  "<p>So much for \u201cpresidential\u201d. Donald Trump reverted to his blame-casting, grievance-airing, media-bashing ways on Thursday in a press conference that started strangely and ended in an even weirder place.</p> \n<p>It was the same Trump who spent more than four years lambasting the \u201cfake news\u201d media as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/07/donald-trump-war-on-the-media-oppo-research\">enemies of the people.</a> But now it was taking place during a global pandemic in which thousands of lives depend on trustworthy sources and reliable information.</p> \n<p>Despite the gravity of a situation that has earned comparisons to war, Trump began with a joke: \u201cI have to say I think with social distancing, that the media\u2019s been much nicer. I don\u2019t know what it is, all these empty, these inbetween chairs,\u201d \u2013 a reference to how reporters now space themselves out in the White House briefing room.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-drug-trump-confusion-malaria-treatment-readiness\">Trump sows confusion with claim coronavirus drug will be ready soon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump added: \u201cI love it, it\u2019s so much nicer, but I shouldn\u2019t say that because you\u2019ll get me now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">Deborah Birx,</a> the response coordinator for the coronavirus task force, remained stony-faced behind him.</p> \n<p>The president continued to paint a sunny picture about clinical trials and economic recovery but, as reporters began to challenge him over the federal response to the crisis, his mood darkened.</p> \n<p>Questioned by an NBC News journalist about his recent claim that he recognised the outbreak as a pandemic before others did, Trump complained: \u201cWe were very prepared. The only thing we weren\u2019t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how prepared I was. I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was \u2013 in fact, it was your network, I believe they called me a racist because I did that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bridling with indignation, he added: \u201cIt was many of the people in the room. They called me racist and other words because I did that, because I went so early.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22f484aee9fddfa964d17489e7b39f86a5673380\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22f484aee9fddfa964d17489e7b39f86a5673380/0_430_6493_3898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the media keep a mandated social distance as they wait for Donald Trump\u2019s briefing on the coronavirus response at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the media keep a mandated social distance as they wait for Donald Trump\u2019s briefing on the coronavirus response at the White House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mike Pence and the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, who is African American, remained expressionless behind him.</p> \n<p>Trump is accustomed to sycophancy from Pence and the others around him \u2013 phrases such as \u201cThe president has ordered\u201d and \u201cThe president directed\u201d. The reporters, however, did not get the memo. He seemed upset that they had the temerity to grill him about his frequent downplaying of the threat of the virus and failure to organise testing kits.</p> \n<p>Trump was asked about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/politics/mario-diaz-balart-coronavirus/index.html\">first two cases of coronavirus</a> among members of Congress. He used it as an opportunity to chastise the gathered media. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re sitting like you people are sitting. You\u2019re actually sitting too close.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was another of those occasions when no one is entirely sure whether Trump is joking. In any case, the reporters in the briefing room \u2013 which long ago was the <a href=\"http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/press-briefing-room.htm\">White House swimming pool</a> \u2013 looked distinctly unamused.</p> \n<p>Trump went on: \u201cYou should really \u2014 we should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I have just two or three of you that I like in this room. I think that\u2019s a great way of doing it. We just figured a new way of doing it, but you\u2019re actually much too close. You two, you should leave immediately.\u201d</p> \n<p>This was pretty rich from a man who continues to shake hands and flout rules on social distancing, even on the White House podium. Last week, when it emerged that Trump had been at Mar-a-Lago with a Brazilian official who had tested positive for the virus, he reluctantly agreed to take a coronavirus test, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-unemployment-testing\">which came back negative.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f167207d-f90d-4942-bade-b0e653061cd6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wDdyn4Kbffs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no symptoms but I had a test and my doctor told me don\u2019t get it, you don\u2019t need it, everybody said you don\u2019t need it, but I had it because the press was going crazy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has spent much of his presidency boasting about the economy; now it is suddenly a sore point. One reporter prefaced his question, \u201cRight now, the economy has essentially ground to a halt.\u201d</p> \n<p>Irritated, Trump butted in sarcastically: \u201cThanks for telling us, we appreciate it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The reporter continued his gloomy forecast and Trump snapped: \u201cGo ahead, what\u2019s the rest of your question, everybody in the room knows that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president has been criticised for constantly using the xenophobic term \u201cChinese virus\u201d. A sharp-eyed photographer caught a picture of his notes, showing the word \u201ccorona\u201d was crossed out and replaced by \u201cChinese\u201d in handwritten black ink.</p> \n<p>The issue came up at the end of the briefing, but not as anyone had imagined. Chanel Rion, who works for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/15/oan-oann-fox-news-donald-trump\">pro-Trump One America News Network,</a> and recently speculated wildly that the coronavirus might have been created in a lab in North Carolina, asked: \u201cDo you consider the use of the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 racist \u2013 because it\u2019s food that originates in China or has Chinese roots?</p> \n<p>Appreciating the gift, Trump replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist at all.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148027c26c0e95da381306a9620d9f1eb4fcac5a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148027c26c0e95da381306a9620d9f1eb4fcac5a/702_1_3049_1830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail of Donald Trump\u2019s notes show where the president has crossed out the word \u2018corona\u2019 and added in \u2018Chinese\u2019 in discussing the coronavirus crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail of Donald Trump\u2019s notes show where the president has crossed out the word \u2018corona\u2019 and added in \u2018Chinese\u2019 in discussing the coronavirus crisis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rion, who last year took Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/19/journalists-blast-one-america-news-series-giuliani-087893\">to spread baseless conspiracy theories,</a> wasn\u2019t done. \u201cOn that note, major left-wing news media, even in this room, have teamed up with Chinese Communist Party narratives, and they are claiming that you are racist for making these claims about \u2018Chinese virus\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs it alarming that major media players, just to oppose you, are consistently siding with foreign state propaganda, Islamic state radicalism, Latin gangs and cartels? And they work right here at the White House with direct access to you and your team.\u201d</p> \n<p>Finally, the Trump era had jumped the shark. He revelled in it. \u201cIt amazes me when I read the things that I read,\u201d he said. \u201cIt amazes me when I read the Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative. It amazes me when I read \u2013 the New York Times is not even \u2013 I barely read it. You know, we don\u2019t distribute it in the White House anymore, and the same thing with the Washington Post.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause you see, I know the truth. And people out there in the world, they really don\u2019t know the truth. They don\u2019t know what it is. They use different slogans and different concepts for me almost every week trying to catch something.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast week, it was, oh, chaos. You see me, there\u2019s no chaos. No chaos. I\u2019m the one telling everybody to be calm. There\u2019s no chaos at the White House. We have unbelievable professionals. It\u2019s really \u2013 I mean, I think I came up with the term, I hope I came up with the term, but it is fake news. It\u2019s more than fake news, it\u2019s corrupt news.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump continued to gripe about media outlets not calling him and said Democratic governors have praised him. \u201cThis administration has done a great job, but the press is very dishonest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rion chimed in: \u201cMore than dishonest. They\u2019re siding with state propaganda!\u201d</p> \n<p>Suddenly we were in the rightwing fever swamps of the internet. As Hahn and Birx looked on, betraying no emotion, Trump replied: \u201cI think they do. They are siding with China. They are doing things that they shouldn\u2019t be doing. They\u2019re siding with many others; China is the least of it.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo why are they doing this? You\u2019ll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.\u201d</p> \n<p>Minutes later, the self-styled \u201cwartime president\u201d was gone.

  "<p>In normal times, last experienced in Britain only a week ago, it might have been fanciful to imagine that in some unprecedented global crisis football\u2019s squabbling and often self-seeking administrators would step up and behave like leaders.</p> <p>Of course, faced with an unthinkable pandemic they have had little other choice than to put their sport immediately on hold but as they did so it was almost weird to see them striking the right tone.</p> <p>The sentiment that public health is the overriding priority, that football cannot happen in these circumstances but that it has a cherished place in life and will assert its best values of solidarity, came in a flurry when Uefa held its crunch meeting of all national football associations on Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/19/premier-league-efl-and-wsl-football-will-not-restart-before-30-april\">Premier League, EFL and WSL football will not restart before 30 April</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Karren Brady, the West Ham vice-chair, had been loudly booed before for suggesting in her column in the Sun that the season should be considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/west-ham-karren-brady-calls-for-premier-league-cancellation-coronavirus\" title=\"\">null and void</a>, although she was not the only decision-maker believing that to be the case. After seeing how that went down and for other reasons sporting, human and pragmatic, the English game expressed a determination to get the season played if at all possible and in any available circumstances.</p> <p>On 3 March at the Uefa congress in Amsterdam, the European governing body\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/03/uefa-congress-ceferin-coronavirus-dark-scenarios\" title=\"\">made an odd, rambling speech</a> that purported to be an affirmation of football\u2019s best values \u2013 \u201cpurpose over profit,\u201d he said. But it was widely taken by followers of all the dismal politics in the past two years to be a veiled attack on the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, although he was not named, for his expansionist Club World Cup plans, which Ceferin saw as a tank-parking threat on the manicured lawns of the Champions League\u2019s own expansion plans.</p> <p>Exactly two weeks later, there was Ceferin on Tuesday, holding a tele-conference with all of Europe\u2019s 55 national associations including the FAs of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, at which they agreed to vacate the month scheduled for the Euros in the hope of helping some normality to return, at least to the world\u2019s most popular sport, by the summer. And there was Ceferin in the statement sent out by Uefa, the silly turf wars set aside for now, thanking everybody involved in making the necessary decision quickly, including Infantino by name.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to thank Fifa and its president, Gianni Infantino, who has indicated it will do whatever is required to make this new calendar work,\u201d Ceferin said. \u201cIn the face of this crisis, football has shown its best side with openness, solidarity and tolerance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ceferin, asked in an interview with Rob Harris of the Associated Press whether this crisis would provide \u201ca pause\u201d to consider the future structure of football in a more collaborative way, seemed to speak honestly when answering that he and others had been jolted out of their habitual political terrain and on to a recognition of their sport\u2019s basic virtues.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen concerning the football calendar,\u201d he said, \u201cbut \u2026 what I saw today is that this situation brought us together \u2013 Uefa, leagues, clubs, other confederations, especially [the South American confederation] Conmebol which I would like to thank, because they agreed that if we move the Euro, they move the Copa [Am\u00e9rica].

This will be the main determinant for the depth of the recession.</p> <p>The fact that the Eurozone has finally come to terms with the magnitude of the crisis should cushion the downswing and is an important prerequisite for a swift rebound. As so often in the past, it took the Eurozone (and this time around also the ECB) a while to react.

  "<p>The government is relaxing competition regulations to allow retailers to work together more closely to help feed the UK during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Supermarkets will be allowed to cooperate to keep shops open, to share distribution depots and delivery vans and to share data with each other on stock levels under the temporary waiver approved on Thursday evening. The move will also allow retailers to share staff to help meet demand.</p> <p>The government is also temporarily lifting the plastic bag tax for online deliveries, to help retailers deliver groceries to those self-isolating at home without cross-contamination from delivery crates.</p> <p>Environment secretary George Eustice, who approved the change in the rules after more than a week of discussions with retailers, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve listened to the powerful arguments of our leading supermarkets and will do whatever it takes to help them feed the nation.</p> <p>\u201cBy relaxing elements of competition laws temporarily, our retailers can work together on their contingency plans and share the resources they need with each other during these unprecedented circumstances.</p> <p>The latest relaxation in rules came after Defra said it would work with local authorities to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/supermarkets-to-be-allowed-to-increase-night-time-deliveries\">extend the hours that deliveries can be made</a> to food stores to help keep supplies on the shelves. In many built-up areas, heavy vehicles cannot normally operate during antisocial hours such as late at night or early in the morning.</p> <p>This week, the Department for Transport has also agreed to ease restrictions on delivery drivers\u2019 working hours during the crisis. Drivers can now work for 11 hours in one stint, up from nine, and can work up to 96 hours in a fortnight, up from 90. Daily rest limits have also been reduced from 11 hours to nine. The new rules will come into effect on Friday.</p> <p>The big grocers, however, are calling for the suspension of some competition rules so supermarkets can work together on securing the supply and distribution of essentials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/supermarkets-take-steps-to-prevent-coronavirus-panic-buying-and-shortages\">UK supermarkets take steps to prevent panic buying and shortages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eustice has the power to temporarily exclude the Competition Act prohibition on \u201cagreements between businesses that prevent, restrict or distort competition\u201d for a limited period. </p> <p>In the past, such orders have been made in relation to the defence industry, such as the maintenance and repair of warships in 2006, and the supply of oil and petroleum products during the 2012 fuel crisis.</p> <p>Retailers are also asking for:</p> <ul> <li><p>Relaxation of restrictions on the weight of goods that delivery vans can carry. Retailers say vans can safely take more weight than the current regulations allow. Raising the limit would allow vans to process more home deliveries in one go to cope with increased demand from those self-isolating, sick or avoiding the shops.</p></li> <li><p>Easing grocery code regulations. The code was developed to prevent big grocers abusing their power over suppliers. They cannot, for instance, halt orders without reasonable warning. The supermarkets say they need the ability to make changes quickly so they can switch away from more obscure products to focus on essentials. Under current rules, they say, that could result in a fine worth up to 1% of UK turnover. Industry regulator the Groceries Code Adjudicator is expected to take a \u201cpragmatic approach\u201d to what counts as reasonable notice during the crisis rather than alter the rules.</p></li> <li><p>Easing national minimum wage regulations.

  "<p>An investigation into the extent of institutional racism within the Home Office must be launched in response to a damning report on the Windrush scandal, an alliance of anti-racism groups has urged.</p> \n<p>The call came after the long-awaited publication of the independent inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the scandal, which saw British citizens wrongly deported, dismissed from their jobs and deprived of services such as NHS care.</p> \n<p>The inquiry \u2013 which prompted an official apology from the home secretary, Priti Patel \u2013 concluded that the Home Office demonstrated \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race\u201d. It was commissioned after the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy led to the exposure of the scandal and eventually the resignation of the then home secretary, Amber Rudd.</p> \n<p>In response to the findings, a consortium of 16 pressure groups called on Thursday for the Home Office\u2019s immigration policies to be scrutinised to assess whether they are discriminatory.</p> \n<p>While the report stopped short of describing the Home Office as institutionally racist, the government now needed to analyse why \u201cHome Office culture, attitudes, immigrations and citizenship policies have repeatedly discriminated against black and ethnic minority British citizens,\u201d deputy director of the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, Zubaida Haque, said.</p> \n<p>She added that the report made it \u201cvery clear that the injustice was not an accident, but a result of institutional failures to understand race and racism\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the report, the Home Office is blamed for operating a \u201cculture of disbelief and carelessness\u201d. It concludes that the failings are \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d.</p> \n<p>Patel gave an official apology in the House of Commons on Thursday, saying: \u201cThere is nothing I can say today that will undo the suffering \u2026 On behalf of this and successive governments I am truly sorry.\u201d</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">Michael Braithwaite</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">, 68, who was sacked in 2017 from his job as a special-needs teaching assistant</a> at the London primary school where he had worked for more than 15 years (despite the fact that he had lived in the country for half a century) said he was frustrated to hear Patel make a new apology almost two years after the government first did so.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same expression of empathy, and more promises like last time.

It says warning signs of problems caused by the immigration policy \u2013 such as \u201cracially insensitive\u201d billboards telling people to \u201cgo home or face arrest\u201d \u2013 were ignored.</p> \n<p>There was a tendency to blame individuals caught up in the immigration regulations, the report says. They found themselves criticised for failing to obtain evidence of their status, even though when they tried to do so they were not provided with the right documentation.</p> \n<p>The report\u2019s author, Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, said at its launch: \u201cThe Windrush generation has been poorly served by this country, a country to which they contributed so much and in which they had every right to make their lives. The many stories of injustice and hardships are heartbreaking, with jobs lost, lives uprooted and untold damage done to so many individuals and families.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams said she met about 800 people, and many of the interviews had been extremely upsetting. She said one man had been in tears when he told her how he had lost his job and his home \u201cin tragic circumstances\u201d. He told her: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have been treated like this by my beloved England.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams said: \u201cThere were a number of examples that were equally as upsetting. There was an overwhelming sense of bewilderment. They couldn\u2019t understand how this had been allowed to happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 275-page report said the roots of the problem could be traced back to racially motivated legislation during the 1960s, 70s and 80s.</p> \n<p> Williams wrote: \u201cWhile I am unable to make a definitive finding of institutional racism with the department, I have serious concerns that these failings demonstrate an institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation within the department, which are consistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said many people \u201cfelt a strong sense of Britishness and had no reason to doubt their status or that they belonged in the UK. They could not have been expected to know the complexity of the law as it changed around them.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1d775b4e-d9e8-4530-a26a-ea91c6ba109b\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Who are the Windrush generation?</b></p>\n    <p>They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government.

Why did Britain fail to act?,</a> 18 March). Watching from 6,000 miles away and on the other side of the coronavirus curve, the British government\u2019s actions over the last week have been almost impossible to take in.</p> <p>Thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of deaths predicted in the UK? South Korea, China, Japan, and Taiwan have a combined population about 24 times the UK\u2019s, had less warning, and have recorded fewer than 3,500 deaths between them (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200318-sitrep-58-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=20876712_2\" title=\"\">WHO situation report</a>, 18 March).</p> <p>Many months in a state of economically devastating shutdown? With extensive testing and contact tracing now in place, life is moving back towards normal here in China after less than two months. The other countries mentioned above never shut down to the same extent in the first place.</p> <p>The British government has given every impression of not being aware by what means, nor how successfully, the coronavirus has to date been contained around us in east Asia, concerns in the press about Japan\u2019s testing rate notwithstanding. It\u2019s baffling. I wasn\u2019t expecting to worry about my older relatives and friends back home in the UK.<br><strong>Adrian Rowland</strong><br><em>Shenzhen, China</em></p> <p>\u2022 As the editor of a leading medical journal, Richard Horton has to pull his political punches, but it is probably as clear to him as to others that this is a government out of its depth, with little idea of social security or public health. Having dismantled both so effectively in the past decade, how could it have any respect for these assets?</p> <p>Almost exactly 80 years ago, facing the threat of annihilation, the Tories and Labour joined forces to create a national government, which lasted until the end of the war. That is what should happen now, including representatives of all political parties.<br><strong>Dr Sebastian Kraemer</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the light of the articles by Aditya Chakrabortty (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-covid-19-response\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 18 March; he writes that \u201cJohnson\u2019s team are masters of the three-word slogan\u201d) and Richard Horton (suggesting that the science has not changed), perhaps the three-word slogan to describe the actions of the government so far is \u201clet them die\u201d. At least Marie Antoinette allowed cake to be consumed, showing perhaps greater intelligence and compassion than our ministers.</p> <p>With three aged relatives under our care, as well as a vulnerable daughter, we have long since been following guidance from sources other than the government. We fail to see how any of the financial measures being introduced will help to support any of the smaller businesses and entrepreneurs, on whose existence people depend for employment. Let us hope that better minds and leaders will surface to help us out of this crisis.<br><strong>David McLaughlin</strong><br><em>Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 As one headless chicken moment follows another, it is like a rerun of the utterly useless Chamberlain government of 1940, but without Churchill waiting in the wings.<br><strong>Michael Grainger</strong><br><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Richard Horton has rightly excoriated Britain\u2019s chief scientific advisers for their catastrophic mishandling of the coronavirus epidemic. I was a scientific expert once, and the one thing you know for sure is that you don\u2019t know all the answers in complex situations. I could be in the hot seat during simulation exercises to decide what action to take when, for example, a massive leak had created a radioactive cloud moving towards an urban area.</p> <p>Even in a simulation, it\u2019s still terrifying when you have to make decisions that might, if wrong, result in thousands of avoidable deaths. You would never ignore all the accumulated knowledge for how best to deal with just such a situation and recommend a different response that had never been tried before. That just this has happened reveals a fundamental lack of good process at the top of government, where alternative views are either not sought or are rejected out of hand. The stables must be cleaned before the next emergency.<br><strong>Dr Bruce Tofield</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government has a goal of 25,000 coronavirus tests a day. This is not an effective use of resources. The attempt to contain the virus has failed. We need to stop chasing after the problem and get ahead of it instead. There is an urgent need for an antibody test that can tell if a person has had the virus and is immune to it. Such people, if well, can then go back to work and keep the country functioning. The current policy of isolation of positive testers merely leads to total shutdown.<br><strong>Dr David Richardson</strong><br><em>Retired GP, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands</em></p> <p>\u2022 On the day China announces there are no new cases of coronavirus, the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser still tells us that if social distancing measures are done \u201ctoo early\u201d there is \u201calmost an immeasurable impact on the epidemic\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/19/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-london-lockdown-williamson-refuses-to-rule-out-government-putting-london-in-lockdown-by-weekend?page=with:block-5e735dd68f085e564ad8710b#block-5e735dd68f085e564ad8710b\" title=\"\">Politics live blog</a>, 19 March).

It could also be described as a callous willingness to sacrifice ordinary people and avoid expense to the moneyed classes. Could this reflex account for the UK\u2019s painfully slow and seemingly grudging steps in tackling Covid-19? Testing all suspected cases and closing businesses and schools are expensive measures. There was much less hesitation in bailing out financial institutions in 2008.<br><strong>Scott Wilson</strong><br><em>St Andrews, Fife</em></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s a bit rich having to read a Conservative government full-page advert (Guardian print edition, 17 March) which says \u201cprotect yourself, others and the NHS\u201d after these very people have spent a decade in their ideological drive to cut and privatise our health and social care services.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite clear that Boris Johnson and his ministers now realise that our health service, which their party has decimated, will have a hard job coping with this crisis. That\u2019s why we get the nonsense of \u201cdelaying and flattening the curve\u201d and achieving \u201cherd immunity\u201d through a Darwinian selection of the fittest.</p> <p>The answer is clear, and it\u2019s testing, testing and more testing, as the World Health Organisation argues. But because of cuts we not only have just a third of the intensive care beds that Germany has, we now don\u2019t have the testing kit or respirators needed, and we don\u2019t produce them either.

  "<p>Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, has produced a thoughtful and intelligent <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873667/6.5577_HO_Windrush_Lessons_Learned_Review.pdf\" title=\"\">review</a> of the Windrush scandal. This shameful episode saw British citizens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\" title=\"\">wrongly</a> deported, dismissed from their jobs and deprived of services such as NHS care. More than 160 people, almost all of African-Caribbean descent, were detained or expelled. It is thought that up to 8,000 were likely to be caught in the web of misery.</p> <p>The reasons why this deplorable event occurred are complex. The trap had been set by decades of restrictive immigration laws and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/immigration-law-key-clause-protecting-windrush-immigrants-removed-in-2014\" title=\"\">questionable decisions</a>.

Two immigration acts in 2014 and 2016 had the <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/briefing-what-is-the-hostile-environment-where-does-it-come-from-who-does-it-affect/\" title=\"\">effect</a> of requiring long-term residents to prove their right to be in the UK, limiting access to services if they could not do so, in a system of citizen-on-citizen immigration checks.</p> <p>Ms Williams, who had been <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/javid-appoints-police-watchdog-lead-windrush-review\" title=\"\">appointed</a> by Sajid Javid as part of the clean-up operation, took the Home Office to task for failing to look out for people it had responsibility for. A senior official in the report describes as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the fact that \u201cmost of the policymakers were white and most of the people involved were black\u201d. That is one way of putting it. Ms Williams suggests a culture stained with \u201cdisbelief and carelessness\u201d, and ingrained \u201cignorance and thoughtlessness\u201d, much of which chimed with the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51961933\" title=\"\">charge of institutional racism</a>.</p> <p>Priti Patel, the current home secretary, was right to apologise. But she was wrong to point the finger of blame at <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/priti-patel-windrush-scandal-apology-a4391911.html\" title=\"\">New Labour</a>. True, Labour ministers shamefully employed the language of the hostile environment. But this was <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081023091612/http:/www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/reports/indreview/indreview.pdf?view=Binary\" title=\"\">not backed</a> by statute. That was left to the Conservative governments that took over. In the last decade, officials and ministers ignored warning signs about the implications of their actions. When stories emerged, in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/i-cant-eat-or-sleep-the-grandmother-threatened-with-deportation-after-50-years-in-britain\" title=\"\">paper</a>, of the Windrush generation, those who came to Britain between 1948 and 1973, falling victim to the harsher immigration controls in 2017, the Home Office sat on its hands.</p> <p>In 2018 Theresa May, who had been the architect of the Tories\u2019 hostile environment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/no-10-refuses-caribbean-request-to-discuss-children-of-windrush\" title=\"\">proved so tin-eared</a> that she initially refused a formal diplomatic request from Caribbean leaders at a Commonwealth heads of government meeting to discuss the matter. Mrs May only relented when the visiting prime ministers went public with their concerns. The Home Office now runs a \u201c<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/compliant-environment-turning-ordinary-people-into-border-guards-should-concern-everyone-in-the-uk-107066\" title=\"\">compliant environment</a>\u201d. This is a change of label rather than a change of product. Ms Williams\u2019 recommendations should be implemented. The Home Office must acknowledge wrong, be open, more human, and have a race advisory board. Crucially, there needs to be a full review of the hostile environment.</p> <p>It was David Cameron who stripped away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/19/cameron-axe-equality-assessments\" title=\"\">the checks and balances</a> vital to cut the risk of policies\u2019 unintended consequences. This mentality contributed to the Windrush scandal. There is a significant lesson to learn here: political considerations must not drive internal targets, priorities and behaviour despite contrary evidence and with an indifference to humanity.</p>",

I really do.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe will be helping the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/us-airline-industry-seeks-50-billion-bailout-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">airline industry</a>. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of executive power. If we don\u2019t have to use it, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also took a swipe at China, where the virus was first reported, musing: \u201cIf people would have known about it, could have been stopped in place, it could have been stopped where it came from, China.\u201d</p> \n<p>This prompted criticism from his presumptive rival in the presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden. His campaign said in statement: \u201cThe reality is, he did know about it and experts spent months trying to prompt Trump into action as he downplayed the growing threat of the virus and praised the Chinese government\u2019s bungled early response \u2013 at a time when Vice-President Biden warned him not to take their word about the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow, as this crisis explodes on his watch, Trump is desperately lashing out to try to cover up his incompetence and mismanagement.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a series of bizarre riffs, Trump described social distancing as a \u201chot term\u201d now and chastised reporters for sitting too close together. He railed against the media for failing to give him credit for banning travel from China. \u201cI got a [coronavirus] test because you people were driving everybody crazy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Trump has been condemned for using the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=007466294097402385199:m2ealvuxh1i&amp;q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGgcLfl6foAhULlXIEHRDZB-8QFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1T36USnyIsJFTePQNIMhkF\">xenophobic term</a> \u201cChinese virus\u201d. In a profoundly weird finale, a reporter from the pro-Trump One America News Network asked: \u201cMr President, do you consider the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 to be racist because it is food that originated from China?\u201d</p> \n<p>He answered: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s racist at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unusually, Trump is not thought to have made contact with the House speaker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the architect of his impeachment last year. Instead he has delegated negotiations to the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who is said to have established a working relationship with Pelosi.</p> \n<p>On Thursday the Senate began work on a $1tn-plus package to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the bill would include direct financial assistance to Americans, lending to key industries including airlines and money for more medical equipment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are not ordinary policies. This is no ordinary time,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe have to beat back this virus.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond\">Alex Salmond,</a> Scotland\u2019s former first minister, has been accused of being a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/22/alex-salmond-in-court-accused-of-series-of-sexual-offences\">sexual predator</a>\u201d who abused his power to sexually assault women for personal gratification.</p> <p>A jury in Edinburgh was told by the prosecutor Alex Prentice QC on Thursday that Salmond preyed for nearly eight years on young, aspirational women who worked for him while he was first minister, often when they were alone at night.</p> <p>\u201cThis case isn\u2019t about a plot or political conspiracy,\u201d he told them. \u201cThis is about a powerful man who abused his power to satisfy his sexual desires with impunity.\u201d</p> <p>Summing up after nearly nine days of evidence, Prentice invited the jury of nine women and six men to convict Salmond of one charge of attempted rape, an intent to rape, nine charges of sexual assault and two of indecent assault \u2013 charges that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/alex-salmond-tells-court-charges-are-fabrications-or-exaggerations\">Salmond denies</a>.</p> <p>Prentice told the jurors: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, they had no one to turn to for an effective remedy. Well, they do now.\u201d</p> <p>Prentice said the testimony from the nine complainers, the Scottish legal term for complainants, painted a compelling picture. There was an \u201cemerging pattern of brazen conduct; he did it because he could\u201d.</p> <p>In several cases, women were assaulted in public, including in a ministerial car, at Stirling castle and at a nightclub, Prentice told the jury. In one incident not among the charges, he said a senior civil servant witnessed Salmond\u2019s attempt to stroke a female official\u2019s hair and slapped his hand way.</p> <p>He is also accused of assaulting women in Bute House, the first minister\u2019s official residence in Edinburgh\u2019s new town, where one complainer accused him of an attempted rape in June 2014 and another of intent to rape in December 2013. Both women allege that they had been plied with drink. Eight of the charges involved alleged attacks at Bute House.</p> <p>\u201cAlex Salmond\u2019s conduct over the span of these charges was intimidating, humiliating and degrading, and created an offensive environment,\u201d Prentice told the jury. \u201cThe complainers in this case are courageous, brave women who spoke up to call out the abusive conduct of the former first minister.\u201d</p> <p>They were \u201centirely credible and entirely believable\u201d witnesses, he said, who had no reason to lie about such serious allegations. \u201cThe common theme, I suggest, is of a comprehensive, compelling and convincing course of conduct.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond, who denies all the allegations, was formally acquitted of a 10th charge of sexual assault on Monday after the prosecution withdrew the charge. His defence lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, is due to address the jury on Friday.</p> <p>Prentice said Salmond was clearly an extremely effective politician, who could be a great, if demanding, boss. But he said the jurors had to focus on the testimony and the evidence. They had to decide whether a crime was committed and, if so, was Salmond responsible.</p> <p>Salmond had been described by some witnesses as a tactile person, Prentice added, \u201cbut that is not a licence to grope women\u201d.</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s former policy chief, Alex Bell, told the court earlier on Thursday he had been in Bute House, the first minister\u2019s official residence, the night that a senior civil servant was allegedly forced by Salmond to reenact a painting showing an older man kissing a young woman in late 2010.</p> <p>The official has accused Salmond of grasping her wrists and pulling her towards him, and ignoring her attempts to remove his hands. \u201cHe was very persistent and I felt like I was wrestling with an octopus,\u201d she told the court on Monday.</p> <p>Bell said \u201cB\u201d was on her own with Salmond in the drawing room as the then first minister\u2019s team prepared for first minister\u2019s questions, known as FMQs, the next day. Bell, who was then Salmond\u2019s head of policy, said two other members of Salmond\u2019s staff asked him to go up because B was alone with Salmond.</p> <p>\u201cI do recall as we were midway through FMQs prep, after the meal, that I went down to the office, and Graeme Roy and Sarah Govan said to me: \u2018You\u2019ve left [B] alone in the office. Would you go up?\u2019\u201d he told Salmond\u2019s defence lawyer, Shelagh McCall QC.</p> <p>Bell could not recall where B and Salmond were standing, but said he had coughed or cleared his throat before entering the room. He did not remember B seeming upset. Alex Prentice QC, the lead prosecutor, asked Bell why he went back upstairs. \u201cTo ensure that the welfare of my colleague was OK,\u201d Bell said.</p> <p>Roger Cherry, who served as Salmond\u2019s government driver as first minister from 2007 to 2014, told the jury he did not see Salmond allegedly holding the leg of an SNP politician while they sat in the back of a government car in February 2011.</p> <p>The SNP politician, known as C, said she was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d and \u201ctotally taken aback\u201d when he put his hand on her leg and left it there for the duration of a short drive through Edinburgh. Cherry said he had no memory of that happening; Salmond denies ever doing so.</p>",

London being in \u201clockdown\u201d could mean quarantine and martial law (never a prospect, as No 10 made clear today) or just all the pubs being closed (still an option). And now we have got \u201cturn the tide\u201d, which Boris Johnson says the UK will be able to do within 12 weeks. Many people will hear that as a prediction that after three months life will start getting back to normal. But it may very well not mean that, as Johnson came close to acknowledging when he faced questions.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from his press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that the UK would be able to \u201cturn the tide\u201d in the fight against coronavirus in the next 12 weeks.</strong> In his opening remarks in the press conference, responding to growing public concern about how long the social distancing measures now in force might last, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m conscious as the days have gone by that people will want to know how long we\u2019re expecting them to keep it up.</p> \n   <p>I think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and I\u2019m absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country. </p> \n   <p>But only if we all take the steps that we\u2019ve outlined, that is vital, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to reduce the peak and once we\u2019ve achieved that and I think that we will, if we take the steps I\u2019ve said, then the scientific progress that we\u2019ve been making will really start coming into play.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson argued that by the middle of June scientific advances would be helping considerably in the fight against coronavirus (see below). But, when asked if he thought that people would be able to go on their summer holidays, he refused to give a direct answer to the question. And, when asked to explain what he meant by turning the tide within 12 weeks, he said he could not be sure the UK would be on the \u201cdownward slope\u201d at that point.

The Guardian found one small pharmacy in south London offering paper bags of 13 paracetamol at 15p per tablet and without labelling, compared to 4p per tablet in supermarket packs last week. The same store was also selling a sample-sized bottle of hand sanitiser for \u00a34, when standard supermarket bottles of hand sanitiser are 300ml, roughly six times the volume, and were priced at \u00a33.49.</p> \n  <p>The regulator, the <strong>General Pharmaceutical Council</strong>, told us that pharmacists may need to \u201cdepart from established procedures\u201d given current exceptional circumstances and prepare smaller packs to keep families supplied, but should only sell them with the appropriate labelling and safety information. \u201cThe care of patients and the public should be the primary concern of pharmacy owners and professionals and they should not be exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic for financial gain,\u201d a spokesperson said. </p> \n  <p>The <strong>Royal Pharmaceutical Society</strong>, which represents pharmacists, said that splitting packs of paracetamol in this way was not normally within the rules, but that it was accepted that flexibility was needed. Its director of pharmacy Robbie Turner said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because of coronavirus, demand for paracetamol is high and frontline pharmacists are faced with making difficult decisions about the supply of medicines every day.

It finished a few minutes ago. Glen is a junior minister and he did not have anything to announce to MPs. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor and his boss, has already said that the government is working urgently on a package of measures to help who are losing work and mostly Glen just kept telling MPs that the Treasury was still working on these measures urgently.</p> \n  <p>But, nevertheless, the session was highly revealing because it showed that backbench Conservative MPs are alarmed by the government\u2019s lack of action on this issue so far. Opposition MPs were also very critical, but that is what you would expect. Here are some of the comments from Conservatives.</p> \n  <p>From <strong>Greg Clark</strong>, the former business secretary who tabled the urgent question</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All employers have an account with HRMC to pay tax for employees through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The monthly wage bill is known to HMRC. </p> \n   <p>Instead of firms paying PAYE to the government, that flow should now be reversed with the nation paying the wages of people for the next weeks if, and only if, they continue to employ their staff. </p> \n   <p>Separate arrangements would need to be made for the self-employed, but at a stroke this would save people\u2019s jobs, save businesses and put an immediate end to the risk of contagion and help save the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is similar to the ideas being proposed by the CBI and by the Resolution Foundation.</p> \n  <p>From <strong>Sir Iain Duncan Smith</strong>, the former work and pensions secretary</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is something else the government can do, literally today. Universal credit has three basic levers which could all be pulled now enormously to help people who are in work. One, the taper could be lowered dramatically at this stage, which would push the floor right up underneath people in work at the moment, allowing them to fall back on that if government\u2019s cannot deal with them.</p> \n   <p>Second, you could change the benefit rates allowing the greater expanse of money to flow to them. This could be done today.</p> \n   <p>The third areas is to look at the waiting time [for benefits] and reduce that almost immediately. </p> \n   <p>Those three things were always built into the flexibility. They can be done today, they can be delivered within days by the department that already has the ability to do that whilst he gets on with this other facility.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1240594616082145281\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUniversal Credit has three basic levers that could all be pulled now\u2026 to help people who are in work,\u201d says Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith <br><br>\u201cThis could be done today\u201d<br><br>Treasury economic secretary John Glen says he is looking at \u201call options\u201d<a href=\"https://t.co/5vned14aOf\">https://t.co/5vned14aOf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kf3ttTZnnH\">pic.twitter.com/kf3ttTZnnH</a></p>\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1240594616082145281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>From <strong>Sir Bernard Jenkin</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those of us who are not in the engine room of government are being told by our constituents that, welcome as Tuesday\u2019s package was, it\u2019s simply not going to be enough.

Firms would continue to pay workers at least two-thirds of their previous wages via their payroll, with the state providing a rebate for those payments at a cost of \u00a34bn for an initial six months if 500,000 employees were involved, and \u00a38bn if a million were.

It wants <strong>statutory sick pay to be extended and made more generous</strong>. It explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On statutory sick pay (SSP), the government should extend it to the 2m employees who earn less than \u00a3118 per week (\u00a3120 from April) and are ineligible. This would cost around \u00a3200m. The government could go further and make SSP more generous, but only if it met the costs of that increase, for small and medium-sized firms at least. Increasing SSP from \u00a395.85 to \u00a3160 per week would ensure it covered half the earnings of employees that rely on it, up from the current third, and cost a further \u00a3800m for small and medium-sized firms.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And it is also calling for <strong>universal credit payments to be made more generous.</strong> It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To protect families affected from hardship, and strengthen the automatic stabilisers that support demand in the economy, the government also needs to strengthen the social safety net. The main adult rate of out-of-work support in universal credit (UC) and other benefits should rise by one-third, to \u00a3100 per week, with equivalent increases in young-adult and couple rates. This would cost \u00a310bn over a year.

This week the government has already a series of measures unprecedented in peacetime to fight coronavirus by limiting social contact. But there are indications that it is going to go even further. For the last 24 hours there have been widespread reports that Boris Johnson is planning to enforce measures that would put London, where the coronavirus outbreak is most advanced, under some form of effective lockdown. And in interviews this morning <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong>, the education secretary, did not rule it out.</p> \n  <p>On the Today programme, asked if the government would shut down bars, restaurants and tube stations in the capital, he said Johnson said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7261068f085e564ad86a2f#block-5e7261068f085e564ad86a2f\">at his press conference yesterday</a> that there were no plans to do that. But Williamson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But the prime minister will constantly be informed by the scientific and medical evidence. And, as has been demonstrated by the unprecedented move that we made yesterday in terms of closing schools, scrapping exams and all forms of other assessment, we will take the incredibly tough decisions that are sometimes needed in order to ensure the safety of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if that meant the government would be willing to implement these measures, Williamson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister has at every stage in terms of dealing with this demonstrated that he will provide the leadership that is required in order to deal with some of the most difficult decisions that any prime minister has ever had to deal with in peacetime. But, as the prime minister said, there are certainly no plans to do so at the moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Quite what a lockdown in the capital would involve is not clear, but<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4648d3d4-693c-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\"> in the Financial Times (paywall)</a> <strong>George Parker </strong>and<strong> Jim Pickard</strong> say one option might involve people being ordered to largely stay at home from Friday. They report:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>According to one person briefed on the proposal, there would be a full lockdown of the capital with only one person allowed to leave home at a time, with no entry to local shopping areas. </p> \n   <p> Supermarkets would be guarded by police, while pharmacies would be among the few other shops to remain open. </p> \n   <p> Two officials briefed on the proposals said residents and business would be given just 12 hours\u2019 notice of the new restrictions. They could initially be in place for about a fortnight.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>We will be covering the latest on this, and all other UK coronavirus developments, as the day goes on.</p> \n  <p>For the worldwide picture, do read our global coronavirus outbreak live blog.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-update-live-news-who-covid19-cases-outbreak-us-states-uk-school-closures-australia-europe-eu-africa-asia-latest-updates\">Coronavirus live news: some London tube stations shut down while Hubei reports no new cases</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.30am: </em>George Eustice, the environment secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>10.15am:</em> Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee.</p> \n  <p><em>After 10.30am: </em>Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement to MPs about next week\u2019s business.</p> \n  <p><em>After 11.30am: </em>Priti Patel, the home secretary, is due to make a Commons statement about the Windrush Lessons Learned Review.

An army spokesman confirmed on Thursday that soldiers had removed bodies from the northern town of Bergamo, where funeral services are overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>In France, which on Monday closed all shops except food stores and pharmacies and ordered people not go out unless to buy provisions, travel to work if it cannot be done from home, visit the doctor or take brief exercise, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, described those breaking the rules as \u201cimbeciles\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"83a6bdbb-1c81-4e83-bdb1-db6355369fa2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_2o75sfPv4M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The government on Thursday closed Mediterranean and Atlantic beaches, banned cycling, and asked people to keep their walks and runs as short as possible \u2013 just \u201ca few minutes to stretch the legs\u201d \u2013 and no longer than 1km-2km.</p> \n<p>President Emmanuel Macron said an extension of the lockdown was likely, while Genevi\u00e8ve Ch\u00eane, the head of France\u2019s public health agency, said up to four weeks of confinement would be needed for the outbreak to be adequately contained, depending on how closely people conformed with the restrictions.

  "<p>At the start of this year, 15-year-old Akasha Daley was ready to settle into a programme of hard work and revision. Now, with the news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-schools-to-be-closed-indefinitely-and-exams-cancelled\">schools are closing</a>, she like many of her friends, has been left adrift and wondering what her future holds.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone was devastated when we learnt that we wouldn\u2019t be going back to school and the exams were cancelled,\u201d said the student of Westminster Academy, in west London. \u201cAfter we found out, everyone was just so sad \u2013 it felt like the whole of year 11 went into meltdown. Everyone is just wondering what is going to happen next.\u201d</p> <p>Gloria Hunter, 14, said she, too, felt suddenly sad, realising Thursday would be her last day at her London comprehensive. \u201cWhile I thought it would be fun at first, the idea of school shutting for the rest of the year made everyone unhappy because of how much we would miss each other,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest, having to be home schooled sounds boring and makes you scared of missing out on things.\u201d</p> <p>As parents begin desperately collating home-schooling ideas and wondering how they will continue to work, teachers are frantically pulling together lesson plans and planning online support for their students. As one tired teacher in Hastings put it: \u201cI didn\u2019t think the apocalypse would have this much admin.\u201d</p> <p>Experts have warned that the early closure of schools could leave children feeling adrift, and without the joyous sense of closure that often comes from leaving school after exams.</p> <p>\u201cAs a clinical psychologist, I am acutely aware of the importance of preparing and having time to process endings and transitions in our lives,\u201d said Natalie Jewitt, clinical psychologist from the Jenby\u2019s school wellbeing project. \u201cWe have to remember that many children have important and supportive relationships with teachers so this will be a huge change for them. It would be good if teachers are able to offer online check-ins for pupils to maintain those relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Parents could also find that the modern-day, exam-focused education system leaves children feeling lost as tests get cancelled, said Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham and co-founder of Action for Happiness. \u201cAt best this could lead to a revival in family discussion and relationships \u2013 but at worst it will be very hard for families to keep children busy who have been formed by an education system that has stripped out all meaning but studying for exams. We haven\u2019t taught our young people how to cope on their own,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, it was already apparent that many parents were feeling overwhelmed. \u201cMy husband is still working, and I am trying to do a full-time job while looking after a seven-year-old and a four-year-old,\u201d said accountant Claire Mcelarney, who like thousands of other parents has joined the Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=871176893326326&amp;ref=br_rs\">Family Lockdown Tips and Ideas</a>. \u201cI\u2019m doing a crap job at working and a crap job at parenting.\u201d</p> <p>Others are, for the moment at least, relishing the challenge.

Wuhan is still largely in lockdown, though some people are being allowed back to work, and nationwide there are still strict controls, for fear the virus might roar back.</p> <p>Many restaurants and shops require patrons to have their temperatures checked and their information logged before entering, or there are quotas for entry.

  "<p>There has been a lot of public debate over the last few weeks over the role scientists are playing during the coronavirus crisis. In the space of just a few weeks, the likes of Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, and Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, have become household names.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/08/five-coronavirus-experts-guide-british-public-through-crisis\">The experts who have guided the British public through coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Covid-19 spreads around the world, scientists are taking a prominent role in advancing public knowledge about the virus by advising world leaders, providing expert comment in the media and urgently researching new ways of tackling the pandemic. We are lucky here in the UK: the scientists we have at the moment are as good as it gets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/04/prof-chris-whitty-the-expert-we-need-in-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Whitty is a professor of epidemiology</a> \u2013 this is what he does.</p> <p>But as this crisis deepens the role of researchers will become even more fundamental as many are now being called upon to join the NHS frontline. Thankfully, we understand within the community that research can go on hold. What\u2019s more, much of it has to because of social distancing.</p> <p>We have taken the decision to release all our clinical staff from academic and research responsibilities at UCL, where I am head of the medical school, as part of a national effort to staff hospitals. These are medically trained staff, who work across the faculties of population health, medical, life, brain and engineering sciences. I expect we will see the same measures enacted soon nationwide. The medical community needs to do everything possible in response to this epidemic.</p> <p>In nearly 35 years as a doctor, the coronavirus pandemic is like nothing I have witnessed \u2013 a global crisis, which will likely overload the health service in every country \u2013 if it hasn\u2019t already done so. By this, I mean, health services will be overwhelmed by the demand put on them by the number of patients requiring treatment. I fear we have to see doctors and nurses working double, or even triple shifts. Many, themselves, will of course get sick, and will have to self-isolate, further compounding the problem.</p> <p>My work at UCL requires me to look after the largest group of biomedical scientists in Europe. Two weeks ago, I started a regular, albeit occasional, clinical service as a consultant respiratory physician at London\u2019s University College hospital alongside this. I always enjoy leaving the desk work behind and returning to my roots as a clinician. As things progress, I am in no doubt that I will spend more and more time on the frontline.</p> <p>My first week working in the wards was unremarkable. But by week two \u2013 last week \u2013 everything had changed. The ward became eerily quiet. Very few patients were referred to the respiratory team as we prepared for the expected influx of patients infected with the Covid-19 virus. Patients were moved to different wards or different hospitals, personal protective equipment arrived and the infectious diseases team grew overnight.</p> <p>Then, the patients with Covid-19 started to arrive.

During the allotted slot it recommends \u201cdistinguishing between worries over which you have little or no control, and worries about problems you can influence.\u201d</p> <p>Limiting daily news consumption may be wise. \u201cIf you\u2019re losing sleep over what\u2019s happening or you\u2019re unable to concentrate on anything other than the risk that someone in your life has, you should probably consider [lowering] your dose of media to once a day,\u201d says Dr Ken Duckworth, medical director of National Alliance on Mental Illness (Nami).<strong> </strong>Apps like <a href=\"https://freedom.to/dashboard\">Freedom</a>, which enable you to block certain websites for specific time periods, can help with this.</p> <h2>Reframe the situation</h2> <p>You are not \u201cstuck inside\u201d. No, you are indulging in a long-awaited opportunity to slow down, focus on yourself and your home, <a href=\"https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/covid-19-lockdown-guide-how-manage-anxiety-and\">writes</a> psychologist Dr Aarti Gupta at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.</p> <p>\u201cDoing one productive thing per day can lead to a more positive attitude,\u201d she writes. \u201cSet your sights on long-avoided tasks, reorganize, or create something you\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d</p> <h2>Set quarantine rituals</h2> <p>With all the additional time spent not commuting or getting to places, Gupta suggests using it to do something special with new rituals. This could entail a walk first thing in the morning, starting a journal, or speaking to a family member every morning on FaceTime.</p> <p>\u201cHaving something special during this time will help you look forward to each new day,\u201d she <a href=\"https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/covid-19-lockdown-guide-how-manage-anxiety-and\">writes</a>.</p> <h2>Get moving</h2> <p>Exercise is a \u201cclassic anxiety reduction strategy\u201d, says Duckworth. A <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-018-9976-0\">review</a> in the Journal of Happiness Studies found that those who exercise just one day a week may experience a happiness boost. It could be YouTube classes, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/02/writers-try-10-big-fitness-apps-weightlifting-pilates\">fitness app</a>, cycling, jogging \u2013 and a New York club called <a href=\"https://nowadays.nyc/\">Nowadays</a> has created an online \u201cvirtual club\u201d with live DJ sets every night.</p> <h2>Small acts of altruism</h2> <p>Helping others can give you a sense of purpose and control. Do you have an elderly or sick neighbor you can offer your services to? \u201cThe idea is to get out of the helpless zone if you can. If you can get out of that then be an agent,\u201d says Duckworth.</p> <h2>Physical distancing, not social distancing</h2> <p>It goes without saying, but \u201cloneliness is bad for humans,\u201d says Duckworth. Have a coffee over FaceTime. Call your parents or kids every day. </p> <p>While in some ways coronavirus is isolating, Bhatia says it is worth remembering that it\u2019s a shared global experience. \u201cEverybody\u2019s affected to different degrees, but the bottom line is that everybody\u2019s in it together, and scientists all over the world are trying to work on it together to find a solution quickly.\u201d</p> <h2>More resources</h2> <ul> <li><p>Mindful walking, breathing and eating for just a couple of minutes several times a day can help with anxiety, says Bhatia. The aim of mindfulness is to bring the mind to the present moment \u2013 or the process of trying to. Try mindfulness apps such as <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/\">Calm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app\">Headspace</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>If you want to talk to a professional, many therapists are now doing appointments by phone or conference call. Bhatia recommends checking <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/counsellors?domain=www&amp;cc=us&amp;cl=en\">Psychology Today</a>, which lists therapists in the US, UK and many other countries around the world, and the<a href=\"http://finder.psychiatry.org/?_ga=2.194109483.748101291.1584637938-1260534117.1584637938\"> American Psychiatric Association</a>.

  "<h2>50. Let Me Sleep Beside You (1967)</h2> <p>A rejected single finally released on a 1970 cash-in compilation, Bowie\u2019s first collaboration with the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/11/tony-visconti-on-david-bowie-death-worst-next-day\">Tony Visconti </a>is better than anything on his debut album. Driven by acoustic guitar, its sound points the way ahead and there\u2019s something appealingly odd, even sinister about the lyrical come-ons: \u201cWear the dress your mother wore.\u201d</p> <h2>49. I Would Be Your Slave (2001)</h2> <p>Uniformly strong, the songwriting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/may/31/shopping.mercuryprize2002\">Heathen</a> stretched from the prosaic \u2013 the letter-to-adult-son of Everyone Says Hi \u2013 to the baffling. Its highlight sits somewhere between: ostensibly a love song that gradually reveals itself to be about God. The melody is beautiful, the arrangement \u2013 very Visconti strings over electronic beats \u2013 perfectly poised.</p> <h2>48. Loving the Alien (1984)</h2> <p>The solitary moment that sparked on 1984\u2019s inspiration-free Tonight. A strange, genuinely great song about religion smothered by overproduction. A 2018 remix helps matters a little, and the stripped-back <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DBwN2Ve9Mc\">00s live versions available online</a> are better yet. The demo version \u2013 much talked up by Bowie in later years \u2013 remains unheard.</p> <h2>47. Jump They Say (1993)</h2> <p>Hailed as a return to peak form on release, Black Tie White Noise was nothing of the sort, but its first single was authentically fantastic. Jittery but commercial funk is undercut by a dark lyric that returned to the subject of Bowie\u2019s mentally ill half-brother Terry, this time brooding on his 1985 suicide.</p> <h2>46. The London Boys (1966)</h2> <p>Tellingly, Bowie\u2019s first great song centred on outsiders. A stark, brass- and woodwind-assisted depiction of those \u2013 like Bowie himself \u2013 left with their noses pressed against the glass of the Swinging London party, it feels like a monochrome kitchen-sink drama compressed into three minutes.</p> <h2>45. Fantastic Voyage (1979)</h2> <p>The album Lodger opened with that rarest of things in the Bowie canon, a protest song. Inspired by the ongoing cold war and its attendant nuclear paranoia, its combination of anger and fatalism still sounds pertinent. The music meanwhile is essentially a gentle reworking of Boys Keep Swinging: same key, same chords, only slower.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e655a265bafba3e1915af83471514a0d64fc8769\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e655a265bafba3e1915af83471514a0d64fc8769/0_0_5351_3724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie in Rotterdam, 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bowie in Rotterdam, 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>44. Lady Stardust (1972)</h2> <p>Ziggy Stardust\u2019s most emotionally affecting moment is one of its most straightforward songs. Driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/may/22/david-bowie-spiders-hull-yorkshire\">Mick Ronson</a>\u2019s piano, it paints a poignant picture beautifully: an overhyped gig by a hot new band, one man in the crowd sadly looking on as his younger ex-lover becomes a star. \u201cI smiled sadly for a love I could not obey.\u201d</p> <h2>43. Seven Years in Tibet (1997)</h2> <p>There was something charming about Bowie\u2019s enthusiastic drum\u2019n\u2019bass experiments on Earthling, but its finest track had nothing to do with them: Bowie suggested it was inspired by 60s soul and the Pixies. Either way, its leaps from eerie atmospherics to blasting, wall-of-noise chorus are really exhilarating: an overlooked triumph.</p> <h2>42. Something in the Air (1998)</h2> <p>Another overlooked 90s gem, from the coolly received Hours, Something in the Air is both limpid and melancholy. The lyrics are filled with regret, the vocal parched and pained behind a liberal sprinkling of electronic distortion \u2013 and, when it hits its chorus, anthemic in a way that hints at All the Young Dudes.</p> <h2>41. Joe the Lion (1977)</h2> <p>Joe the Lion defies explication. Once you get past the opening lines about the transgressive self-mutilating performance artist <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/artists/chris-burden/\">Chris Burden</a> \u2013 \u201cTell you who you are if you nail me to my car\u201d \u2013 the lyrics make virtually no sense at all. The music \u2013 arcing, frantic atonal guitar and gibbering backing vocals \u2013 sounds deranged; Bowie sings like a man on the brink of a nervous breakdown. It is ridiculously<em> </em>exciting.</p> <h2>40. Hallo Spaceboy (1995)</h2> <p>After a decade spent courting the mainstream, Bowie clearly intended Outside to be seen as a grand artistic statement. It occasionally feels a bit laboured, but its highlights rank high: a Space Oddity-referencing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfrqK_uVDok\">Pet Shop Boys remix </a>was a hit, but the original of Hallo Spaceboy is pummelling, chaotic and hypnotic.</p> <h2>39. I Can\u2019t Read (1989)</h2> <p>Tin Machine was a hard rock folly that largely hasn\u2019t aged well, but I Can\u2019t Read is the exception that proves the rule: a brilliant, agonised, self-baiting study of the creative inertia that had overwhelmed Bowie in the 80s, over a dense wall of sheet metal guitars and feedback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41a1bfa8c841a03f32a974a485ee8cbea58cf893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a1bfa8c841a03f32a974a485ee8cbea58cf893/0_0_1904_1905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowie in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowie in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Globe/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>38. Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Suicide (1972)</h2> <p>Ostensibly the tragic, French-chanson-and-50s pop-influenced finale to the Ziggy Stardust story, Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Suicide\u2019s epic coda seemed to take on a different, celebratory meaning as Bowie\u2019s star rose, his howl of \u201cYou\u2019re not alone / Give me your hands / You\u2019re wonderful\u201d summing up his effect on his fans.</p> <h2>37. Bring Me the Disco King (2003)</h2> <p>There\u2019s a sense in which the final track on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/12/popandrock.shopping8\">Reality</a>, the last album he made before his decade-long \u201cretirement\u201d, would have worked perfectly as Bowie\u2019s farewell: a beautiful, weary, uncertain and elegiac rumination on the 70s, set to Mike Garson\u2019s distinctive piano, which shifts from hypnotic to spiky and surprising.</p> <h2>36. Always Crashing in the Same Car (1977)</h2> <p>\u201cSelf-pitying crap,\u201d sniffed Bowie subsequently, which tells you more about his despondent mood during Low\u2019s recording than the song itself. Always Crashing in the Same Car is a sublime sliver of moody paranoia, with distracted-sounding vocals, electronics that alternately bubble and drone, wiry, effects-laden guitar.</p> <h2>35. Stay (1976)</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the side-effects of the cocaine,\u201d Bowie protested unconvincingly on Station to Station\u2019s title track, but Stay \u2013 a taut, twitchy funk-rock hybrid \u2013 audibly was. As usual with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie\">Station to Station</a>, the chaos of its creation (\u201ca cocaine frenzy,\u201d according to guitarist <a href=\"http://www.carlosalomar.com/\">Carlos Alomar</a>) isn\u2019t reflected in the finished product: it\u2019s perfectly poised and confident.</p> <h2>34. Cracked Actor (1973)</h2> <p>There is a particular strain of Bowie song from 1973/74 that sounds like the work of someone who has had all the sex and drugs in the world at once. Cracked Actor may be the supreme example. A sleazy, bitter blast of distorted guitar that sounds like it is seconds away from collapse, it\u2019s both intense and electrifying.</p> <h2>33. Moonage Daydream (1972)</h2> <p>You never want for high-drama rock anthemics on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, but Moonage Daydream is the best example. It switches from the opening guitar chord\u2019s strident call to something weirder and more ominous \u2013 its concluding encouragement to \u201cfreak out\u201d doesn\u2019t sound particularly inviting \u2013 and features a mind-blowing Mick Ronson guitar solo.</p> <h2>32. Diamond Dogs (1974)</h2> <p>Halloween Jack, the persona Bowie adopted on Diamond Dogs, never enjoyed the same cultural impact as Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke. That was no fault of the album\u2019s title track, a propulsive, compelling strut that is simultaneously sensual and dark, as evidenced by its troubling opening cry: \u201cThis ain\u2019t rock n\u2019 roll, this is \u2026 genocide!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a97a2968dcb51d93f2f08d83a1d5684f71635535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97a2968dcb51d93f2f08d83a1d5684f71635535/0_0_2501_2663/939.jpg\" alt=\"In New York, 1973.\" width=\"939\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In New York, 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>31. The Width of a Circle (1970)</h2> <p>Not everything on Bowie\u2019s self-consciously heavy album The Man Who Sold the World works, but its opening track is remarkable. It opens with an acoustic guitar that might have stepped off the 1969 David Bowie album, before exploding into something completely different: an eight-minute Ronson-powered homoerotic epic that swaggers with a newfound confidence.</p> <h2>30. John, I\u2019m Only Dancing (1972)</h2> <p>Considered too controversial to release in the US, John, I\u2019m Only Dancing blithely turned the era\u2019s sexual mores on its head: in its lyrics, a straight relationship is the shocking, threatening aberration. The music, meanwhile, sashays insouciantly along \u2013 in another inspired theft, the guitar part is swiped from Alvin Cash\u2019s 1968 funk hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTtKopprSWE\">Keep on Dancing</a>.</p> <h2>29. The Buddha of Suburbia (1993)</h2> <p>Proof that Bowie worked in mysterious ways: it took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/oct/24/catchofthedaybowiesgreat\">a BBC Two adaptation of Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia</a> to return him to full creative power. Amid the Blackstar-prefiguring free-jazz experiments and Low-esque instrumentals lurked the fantastic, self-referential title track, a keen drawing of pre-fame Bowie, \u201cscreaming along in south London \u2026 ready to learn\u201d.</p> <h2>28. Fame (1975)</h2> <p>Made up on the hoof in the studio \u2013 and allegedly constructed by Bowie cutting up a recording of Alomar playing a cover of the Flares\u2019 1961 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcNnIlrQBgI\">Foot Stompin\u2019</a> \u2013 Fame is a fantastic slice of funk, rendered nervy and strange by the pained delivery of lyrics that take a jaundiced view of the song\u2019s subject: \u201cThe flame that burns your change to keep you insane.\u201d</p> <h2>27. Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980)</h2> <p>Boasting a preposterously stage-y mockney vocal \u2013 \u201cshe \u2019ad an \u2019orror of rooms\u201d \u2013 Scary Monsters\u2019 title track apparently dated back to the early 70s. Bowie had attempted to donate it to Iggy Pop, before reconsidering. It\u2019s the album\u2019s most viscerally exciting moment: frenzied and aggressive, it coats everything from the guitars to Bowie\u2019s voice in distortion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81d540a0bb40c9526743e8a981749946b54a7ca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d540a0bb40c9526743e8a981749946b54a7ca3/0_0_3900_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the Glass Spider Tour in 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the Glass Spider Tour in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Steinfeldt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>26. All the Young Dudes (1972)</h2> <p>Glam rock\u2019s unofficial national anthem. All the Young Dudes announced the arrival of a new era in pop via a Lou Reed-ish cast of characters \u2013 cross-dressers, speed freaks talking about suicide \u2013 and a timely, remarkably cocky dismissal of the past: \u201cMy brother\u2019s back at home with his Beatles and his Stones \u2026 what a drag.\u201d</p> <h2>25. Space Oddity (1969)</h2> <p>In his excellent book <a href=\"https://www.foyles.co.uk/author-nicholas-pegg\">The Complete David Bowie</a>, Nicholas Pegg notes that the episodic Space Oddity sounds like something the 60s Bee Gees might have written at their weirdest. He\u2019s absolutely right, although where the Bee Gees would have played up the melodrama, Bowie perfectly inhabits its mood of blank-eyed, space-age alienation.</p> <h2>24. Where Are We Now? (2013)</h2> <p>The excitement over Bowie\u2019s surprise re-emergence perhaps caused The Next Day to be slightly overrated, but its best moments are magnificent, not least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/08/david-bowie-where-now-first-listen\">Where Are We Now?</a>\u2019s recollection of Bowie\u2019s late 70s sojourn in Berlin. Fond, nostalgic and oddly fragile, it still sounds moving.</p> <h2>23. The Man Who Sold the World (1970)</h2> <p>It\u2019s a song that was subsequently rendered as everything from pop-soul (by Lulu) to despairing acoustic commentary on global success and punk rock ethics (Nirvana), but Bowie\u2019s original version has never been bettered. The title track of his eeriest album remains mysterious, creepy and haunting 50 years on.</p> <h2>22. I Can\u2019t Give Everything Away (2016)</h2> <p>Of the Blackstar songs whose meaning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/11/was-david-bowie-saying-goodbye-on-blackstar\">suddenly pulled into focus with the news of Bowie\u2019s death</a>, none is more affecting than I Can\u2019t Give Everything Away. The music is gloriously buoyant, but it\u2019s hard to see the lyrics as anything other than a man bidding farewell, the musical quotation from Low\u2019s A New Career in a New Town perfectly judged and poignant.</p> <h2>21. Fashion (1980)</h2> <p>Brilliantly claustrophobic, reggae-influenced post-punk funk that casts a jaundiced eye over the ever-changing trends in the world of the hip. The ironic tone of Fashion seemed to be largely missed, possibly because the idea of David Bowie, of all people, protesting about ever-changing trends was frankly a bit rich.</p> <h2>20. The Bewlay Brothers (1971)</h2> <p>There\u2019s a compelling argument that the incredible flowering of songwriting talent on Hunky Dory may make it Bowie\u2019s greatest album. Its most striking moment may be its extraordinary, enigmatic acoustic finale \u2013 possibly a depiction of Bowie\u2019s relationship with his half-brother Terry \u2013 that goes from becalmed to chilling to genuinely frightening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f78baf59944781bbeac071cea8942dc7bd5e8da5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f78baf59944781bbeac071cea8942dc7bd5e8da5/0_0_2718_4023/676.jpg\" alt=\"Bowie in 1967.\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowie in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photoshot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>19. The Jean Genie (1973)</h2> <p>Aladdin Sane\u2019s Ziggy-goes-to-America concept in miniature, The Jean Genie is tougher and sleazier than anything on Ziggy Stardust \u2013 its I\u2019m A Man-ish guitar riff and bursts of harmonica sound absolutely filthy. Anyone inclined to view pop\u2019s past through rose-tinted glasses should note it was kept off No 1 by Jimmy Osmond\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriPIujLtsA\">Long-Haired Lover From Liverpool</a>.</p> <h2>18. Let\u2019s Dance (1983)</h2> <p>The difference between Let\u2019s Dance and Bowie\u2019s other 80s pop albums is that his heart was in it; even if he was largely out to make money, he made an effort. If its title track signalled his temporary abandonment of the avant garde, it\u2019s still a superb song, nervier and stranger than its global smash status might suggest.</p> <h2>17. Win (1975)</h2> <p>A ballad draped in echoing, fluttering sax, Win is utterly gorgeous. Despite Bowie\u2019s insistence it was an attack on artistic rivals who didn\u2019t work hard enough, there\u2019s something oddly sexy about it, not least his delivery of the line: \u201cSomeone like you should not be allowed to start any fires.\u201d</p> <h2>16. Rebel Rebel (1974)</h2> <p>Bowie\u2019s fabulous, valedictory farewell to glam, Rebel Rebel is essentially a loving salute to the kids Bowie had inspired, a metaphorical arm around the shoulder of every teenage misfit who had ever posed in a bedroom mirror. \u201cYou tacky thing,\u201d he sings, delightedly, \u201cyou put them on\u201d \u2013 set to one of the all-time great rock riffs.</p> <h2>15. Changes (1971)</h2> <p>A perfectly written, irresistible mission statement that few heeded at the time, Changes has ended up one of Bowie\u2019s most beloved songs. \u201cIt\u2019s saying: \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to be so fast, you\u2019re not going to keep up with me,\u2019\u201d he explained. It would count as youthful arrogance were it not for the fact that his subsequent career bore the boast out.</p> <h2>14. Golden Years (1976)</h2> <p>A moment of straightforward joy amid the complex, troubled emotional terrain of Station to Station, Golden Years perfectly matches its lyrical optimism with glittering, shimmering funk. What it would have sounded like had Bowie\u2019s original plan to give the song to Elvis Presley is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <h2>13. Absolute Beginners (1985)</h2> <p>The theme to Julien Temple\u2019s universally derided film of the same name, Absolute Beginners may well be the high point of Bowie\u2019s 80s commercial phase. It\u2019s a stately, sweeping, undeniable love song that reunited him with the pianist Rick Wakeman, and \u2013 at an artistic nadir \u2013 proved Bowie could still write incredible songs when he felt like it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KcOs70dZAw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2KcOs70dZAw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>12. Boys Keep Swinging (1979)</h2> <p>Greeted with disappointment on release, Lodger\u2019s reputation has grown with the years. It\u2019s uneven, but contains some incredible songs, not least Boys Keep Swinging, which condensed the kind of sonic overload found on \u201cHeroes\u201d into a sparky three-minute pop song, complete with lyrics that archly, camply celebrated machismo.</p> <h2>11. Starman (1972)</h2> <p>More a cultural moment than a song. Starman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYtRp9UNx8Y\">epochal Top of the Pops performance</a> is probably the most celebrated piece of music television in British history. It\u2019s a series of compelling musical steals \u2013 equal parts T Rex, Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Blue Mink\u2019s recent hit Melting Pot (the morse code guitar) \u2013 and a brash announcement of Bowie\u2019s commercial rebirth.</p> <h2>10. Drive-In Saturday (1973)</h2> <p>Glam doo-wop decorated with bursts of fizzing synthesiser, Drive-In Saturday is one of Bowie\u2019s greatest singles, despite its peculiar lyrical premise. In \u201cabout 2033\u201d, nuclear war has caused humanity to forget how to have sex and they have to relearn seduction techniques from old films. Incredibly, given its subject matter, the song sounds swooningly romantic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e457355777da1d17be69474486e4b9d357f74130\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e457355777da1d17be69474486e4b9d357f74130/0_113_1548_1868/829.jpg\" alt=\"Bowie in 1999.\" width=\"829\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowie in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9. \u2019Tis a Pity She Was a Whore (2016)</h2> <p>Before Blackstar was revealed as the most exquisitely staged final act in rock history, it sounded thrillingly like a new beginning. A relentless, intense drum loop decorated with squalls of sax, Tis Pity She Was a Whore was unlike anything Bowie had done before. His final exultant whoop suggests he knew exactly how great it was.</p> <h2>8. Oh! You Pretty Things (1971)</h2> <p>There was an apocalyptic strain in Bowie\u2019s songwriting almost from the start \u2013 see We Are Hungry Men from his 1967 debut \u2013 but it was never more beautifully expressed than on Oh! You Pretty Things, a song that sets an incredibly bleak message to a melody so lovely it could be covered by the lead singer of Herman\u2019s Hermits.</p> <h2>7. Young Americans (1975)</h2> <p>Young Americans represents the point in Bowie\u2019s career where it became apparent he could take virtually any musical genre and bend it to his will. A white British rock star adopting the breezy, sumptuous sound of Philly soul shouldn\u2019t have worked at all, but it did, to life-affirming effect.</p> <h2>6. Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise) (1974)</h2> <p>The medley on side one of Diamond Dogs is the album\u2019s sickly heart, seven minutes of music that takes glam rock as far as it could go. It\u2019s so decadent and diseased-sounding it must have been hard to imagine where Bowie could possibly go next. As it turned out, he was just getting started.</p> <h2>5. \u201cHeroes\u201d (1977)</h2> <p>Its posthumous uplifting-sporting-montage-soundtrack ubiquity means it\u2019s easy to forget what a weird, ambiguous song Heroes is \u2013 it has, metaphorically, lost the quotation marks around its title. But perhaps that is tribute to Bowie\u2019s brand of alchemy: only he could turn six minutes of pulsing electronic noise, howling guitars and screamed vocals into an all-purpose air-punching anthem.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKcl4-tcuo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AZKcl4-tcuo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>4. Life on Mars? (1971)</h2> <p>A no-further-questions masterpiece, bolstered by Ronson\u2019s fantastic string arrangement, Life On Mars?\u2019s confusing gush of images almost defies explication, but might well be Bowie\u2019s first clarion call to suburban misfits. It says a lot about the sheer power of its melody that a song so lyrically impenetrable has become so widely loved.</p> <h2>3. Station to Station (1976)</h2> <p>By his own account so out of control he couldn\u2019t even remember recording it, Bowie somehow contrived to make Station to Station a work of awesome power and focus, as evidenced by the lengthy title track. The shift into its second section \u2013 \u201cOnce there were mountains and mountains\u201d \u2013 is possibly the single most thrilling moment in his entire catalogue.</p> <h2>2. Ashes to Ashes (1980)</h2> <p>Ashes to Ashes is one of those moments in Bowie\u2019s catalogue where the correct response is to stand back and boggle in awe. Presumably a depiction of its author in his drugged-out mid-70s nadir, everything about it \u2013 lingering oddness of its sound, its constantly shifting melody and emotional tenor, its alternately self-mythologising and self-doubting lyrics \u2013 is perfect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c6c3f90c0a6d08b95652490758e305547793b9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6c3f90c0a6d08b95652490758e305547793b9c9/0_0_3000_2093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie (1947-2016).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bowie (1947-2016).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy King/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Sound and Vision (1977)</h2> <p>Picking Bowie\u2019s 50 best songs is a thankless task. His back catalogue is so rich, you inevitably end up having to lose tracks every bit as good as those you have picked in the process: Queen Bitch, Suffragette City, Be My Wife, Dollar Days. Picking his best is even worse, but Sound and Vision is both a fantastic pop song and an act of artistic daring. A three-minute hit single that doesn\u2019t even feature a lead vocal until halfway through, it twists a despondent lyric into something uplifting and, musically, transcends time. Completely original, nothing about its sound tethers it to the mid-70s. Its magic seems to sum Bowie up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0rP98TdRlBYskYSZ6Pfnx1?si=RLzjhf4bRVCkvpthQF9Ulw\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0rP98TdRlBYskYSZ6Pfnx1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

  "<p>German police have raided properties in 10 states and arrested members of a far-right group after it was banned by the government.</p> <p>The United German Peoples and Tribes organisation belongs to the broader <em>Reichsb\u00fcrger</em> or Citizens of the Reich movement, which rejects the authority of the modern German state and is driven by conspiracy theories. It is armed and considered extremely dangerous, the police said.</p> <p>An interior ministry spokesman said on Thursday that its fight against rightwing extremism would not be halted even during the current global health emergency. \u201cFor the first time, the interior ministry has banned a <em>Reichsb\u00fcrger</em> group,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cEven in these days of crisis, we will continue to fight far-right extremism, racism and antisemitism.</p> <p>Herbert Reul, the interior minister of the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, where the group had its focus, said: \u201cThese people cannot consider themselves safe even in these times of the coronavirus.\u201d He said he was grateful to the federal interior minister, Horst Seehofer, \u201cfor allowing us to proceed against this brown sauce\u201d, in a reference to their Nazi-sympathies.</p> <p>He described the group as a danger to society. \u201cThese people deny the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and agitate against Jews and foreigners,\u201d said Reul. \u201cThis is the right moment to go after people who spread such conspiracy theories. There is no tolerance towards them, only a hard line of action.\u201d</p> <p>Similar to the sovereign citizen movement in the US, the <em>Reichsb\u00fc</em><em>rger</em> movement rejects the modern state, arguing that Germany is not a country but a company. They refuse to recognise German laws, evade taxes and fines and have their own currency. They also mix Holocaust denial with conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Police seized, computers, weapons and ammunition, baseball bats, propaganda literature and drugs during the dawn raids, officers said.</p> <p>The group has a core membership of just 21 people nationwide, and a further 100 followers. The wider movement counts thousands more members, most of whom are males between 40 and 60 years old.</p> <p>Sensitivity toward the group\u2019s existence has grown since the terror attack last month in the city of Hanau when a suspected extremist shot dead nine people, all of whom were from migrant backgrounds. The gunman was not a member of the group, but shared certain tendencies with its members.</p> <p>After the shooting, Seehofer declared war on the far-right extremist scene. He said it was the biggest security threat Germany faced and that it had left a \u201ctrail of blood\u201d across Germany in recent months.</p> <p>An antisemitic attack on a synagogue in Halle in October and the murder of a pro-refugee politician at his home last June have also heightened awareness of the phenomenon.</p> <p>Seehofer announced an increase in police measures as a result, including more resources to fight extremism online, and has signalled a willingness to tighten gun ownership laws.</p>",
  "<p>It was the smell that was the worst. In this dusty camp on Pakistan\u2019s border with Iran, which at one stage held more than 6,000 people, the stench of sweat, rubbish and human excrement hung in the air. There was no real housing, just five people to a ragged tent, and no bathrooms, towels or blankets.</p> <p>The camp, in the town of Taftan in Balochistan province, was supposed to function as a sanitary quarantine location, preventing the spread of the coronavirus from Iran, which has had one of the worst outbreaks globally.</p> <p>Instead, according to Mohammed Bakir, who was held there for two weeks, it was no more than \u201ca prison \u2026 the dirtiest place I have ever stayed in my life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese were the hardest days and nights of my life,\u201d said Bakir. \u201cWe were treated like animals. There were no facilities but also no humanity and everything was in disarray. They were not prepared; there was nothing for us to sleep in except some dilapidated tents.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/pakistan-coronamap/giv-3902g1ReUcRFwVrz/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/pakistan-coronamap/giv-3902g1ReUcRFwVrz/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>Thousands of people have been kept in close quarters in hot, squalid conditions in Taftan, with not even basic precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. According to doctors at the camp, even those who presented with symptoms were not tested or even isolated, and there was a severe shortage of doctors and nurses. There was such a lack of medical facilities, the few doctors on site took to paying for necessary medicines themselves. Things got so bad that protests broke out among those quarantined.</p> <p>\u201cNeither the quarantining service nor the testing procedure was satisfactory at all,\u201d said one doctor, who asked not to be named. \u201cIn the first 20 days, many people had symptoms, but there was no testing at all. We had no testing facilities for three weeks. One child was sent to [a] hospital in Quetta, and he tested positive. But there was no isolation or testing for anyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThere were patients with diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases who were quarantined for 14 days without any proper medication. Their conditions were really bad there and they were treated like animals.\u201d</p> <p>The border between Pakistan and Iran is more than 600 miles and movement between the two countries is extremely common, especially among minority Shia Muslims in Pakistan who travel to Iran on religious pilgrimages. It is also a crucial trade route.</p> <p>But over the past two weeks, it has become a hotbed of coronavirus, with infections going up by the dozen every day. There are 302 reported cases of coronavirus in Pakistan, the highest number of cases in south Asia.</p> <p>Even though infections in Iran began to rise rapidly weeks ago, the Pakistan government only officially shut the border less than a week ago. And the border is still porous; on Tuesday night at least 100 pilgrims crossed from Iran into Balochistan, reportedly after bribing border guards.</p> <p>Among those held in Taftan was Abid Hussain, who is from Nagar in Gilgit-Baltistan, and was quarantined for two weeks after returning from Iran. \u201cIt\u2019s like I have been released from prison,\u201d said Hussain. \u201cThey call it a quarantine but we didn\u2019t get hand wash, face masks or any other sanitary facilities. The only check was that in the morning a doctor used to come round taking everyone\u2019s temperature. That was it for 13 days. Everyone was desperate to leave.\u201d</p> <p> Many of those in Taftan have been released or transferred to other facilities, but 1,200 remain.</p> <p>Hussain also described lax regulations on movement for those in the camp, with many going to shops in the town, walking around the vicinity and having regular social gatherings. No guidelines were issued for how those in quarantine could protect themselves from getting the disease, and there was no running water for people to wash their hands.</p> <p>Hundreds of people supposedly under lockdown left the camp to shop at local markets and stores, buying food and returning to the camp without any checks.</p> <p>\u201cAround these fruit stalls it was more like a scene from a busy Friday bazaar which was run by people who should have been quarantine camp in lockdown,\u201d said one eyewitness.</p> <p>The situation was equally bad in the hospitals in Balochistan, the least developed and most impoverished province of Pakistan, which were tasked with dealing with the outbreak. A doctor at one hospital in Quetta claimed that medical staff had refused to treat or even examine a young girl with all the symptoms of coronavirus, whose father had recently returned from China for work. The girl reportedly died days later without being tested.</p> <p>Pakistan\u2019s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak, said the doctor, was \u201cdepressing and disturbing\u201d.</p> <p>Pakistan has a notoriously poor track record for containing disease outbreaks and is one of only two countries in the world that have failed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/07/pakistan-accused-of-cover-up-over-fresh-polio-outbreak\">eliminate polio</a>.

  "<p>When I took part in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vend%C3%A9e_Globe\">the Vendee Globe</a>, I spent three months at sea alone and on the <a href=\"http://www.avivachallenge.com/\">Aviva Challenge</a> I was alone at sea for six months. My home for that time <a href=\"http://www.avivachallenge.com/yacht-specification\">was a 72ft boat</a> with very few creature comforts and nothing in the way of entertainment, apart from my karaoke skills.</p> <p>Of course, I am well aware that my isolation was one of choice and for very different reasons than the situation we find ourselves in now due to coronavirus. However, in sharing the strategies and learnings from being alone for these long periods of time, I hope that they will resonate with people that find themselves in a situation that is unfamiliar and scary.</p> <p>As mindful humans, we know we need to be physically isolated right now but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to be mentally isolated. Human contact and support are important at all times but particularly in times of crisis or stress. Now, more than ever, we need to look out for each other.</p> <p>My tips for dealing with isolation are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Keep communicating \u2013 this is reassuring for everyone. If you are the one self-isolating, it is moral boosting to know people care but it is equally important for your friends and family to know that you are OK. Stay in touch and ask for help if you need it. A five-minute chat once a day could really lift someone\u2019s spirits and be something they look forward to.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Spending 24/7 alone is alien to many of us and will be a challenge for people that thrive on the company of others. Extroverts get their energy from others so a lack of stimulation may lead to a drop in mood. For most of us, going to work, school or the gym is part of daily routine and now we have to fill that time. Having and sticking to a routine of some sort will help as it provides a focus and a reason to get going for the day. Having something to do will also make the time pass more quickly.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Make technology work for you. There are so many ways we can communicate these days, this is the time to make use of them. Skype, Facetime, email, text, phone calls and social media platforms are all great ways to stay in touch.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Focus only on what you can control and don\u2019t waste energy worrying about things that are outside your control. We are bombarded with information via the media and we do need to take news onboard. However, if you find that listening or reading the news is increasing your anxiety or stress levels then limit your exposure to it. Many of us will be seriously impacted financially through job losses or lack of work. You are not alone, millions of us will be in the same position. Make a manageable plan and seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fd8b4173d341ae3fb34e89d194329fba987206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fd8b4173d341ae3fb34e89d194329fba987206/0_80_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dee Caffari: \u2018Make a manageable plan and seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dee Caffari: \u2018Make a manageable plan and seek help if you are feeling overwhelmed\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Be grateful for the things in your life that you have or can do. Focussing on the good will have a positive effect on your mental health. When you are having a tough day and finding it hard to cope, focus on getting through the next day or even the next few hours rather than weeks or months. The sun will continue to rise and set. This situation will pass.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Look for the opportunities and be creative. In a world of instant contact, demanding work lives and intrusive technology the current situation will allow many of us to step back from that for a period of time. Is there a project that you have wanted to take on but never had the time? Is there a bestseller in your head just waiting to be written? Is there work that you could do on a temporary basis? Necessity is the mother of invention, so perhaps now is the time to embark on something new.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Accept that we must adapt to the new environment we are living in. As a round the world sailor, I am used to my environment changing very quickly and having to adapt to forces that are outside of my control. In the coming weeks and months, restrictions on our lives and the effects of this virus will no doubt make us feel angry, upset, worried and scared. These are natural emotions but will use mental energy. Accepting a situation allows you to think more clearly and calmly.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>The future will be different. That is the reality and we may as well embrace it. Mother nature has flicked the reset button. We have an opportunity to reevaluate and change our behaviour for the better.</p></li> </ul> <p>We are all too aware in today\u2019s world that the only thing we can be certain of is change. Our ability to adapt to this change is what will define us. The current global pandemic is revealing that the majority of us fear the unknown and our reaction is to panic. Let\u2019s come together in this time of adversity and support each other.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was originally published by Dee Caffari for <a href=\"https://www.bluewatergroup.com/\">Bluewater</a>. </p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>Code Orange</h2> <p><strong>March 14, Twitch<br></strong>Having spent months planning the launch of their head-wrecking fourth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/13/code-orange-underneath-review\">Underneath</a>, Pittsburgh metal crew Code Orange were unwilling to let a looming pandemic stop the mosh.

Amid the juddering riffage, there was little direct political commentary until singer Jami Morgan paused the show to direct the camera at the deserted venue: \u201cThis is what happens when the ratfucks who run this world don\u2019t care about you, or me, or any of us.\u201d</p> <h2>Chris Martin</h2> <p><strong>March 16, Instagram</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMBK9OfsKO4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YMBK9OfsKO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Look at the stars, look how they stream for you. At a time of unprecedented global crisis, a rather froggy-sounding Chris Martin took to Instagram Live to spread some sonic balm around the world. For the first show under the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TogetherAtHome\">#TogetherAtHome banner</a>, he bobbed and bumbled his way solo through some Coldplay classics on upright piano and acoustic guitar, messing up the intros to Trouble and Viva la Vida but vamping through covers of As Time Goes By and Life on Mars. For the past decade, Coldplay have been filling stadiums with state-of-the-art theatrical gimmicks; this stop-start half-hour beamed from a domestic jam-hole was comparatively tinny but surprisingly charming. And, despite his stumbling interactions, Martin never messed up plugging <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/gb/\">Global Citizen</a> as a hub for reliable updates and advice.</p> <h2>Yungblud</h2> <p><strong>March 16, YouTube</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usms-qHCADA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usms-qHCADA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>North country boy Yungblud brought some chaotic Big Breakfast energy to this ramshackle revue, originally beamed live from a Los Angeles warehouse at 7am. With the help of a stripped-down but energised backing band, the Yorkshire-born strutter strove to create a genuine atmosphere with his righteously revamped rock\u2019n\u2019roll: the bursts of applause might have been canned but the sweat pouring off the 22-year-old seemed very real. Some skits involving his celeb pals \u2013 notably a drinking game with rapper Machine Gun Kelly and actor Bella Thorne, featuring bottles of Corona \u2013 veered into self-indulgence, but when he focused on the music Yungblud sounded great. Even the cliche of smashing up a drum kit mid-song felt cathartic.</p> <h2>Keith Urban</h2> <p><strong>March 16, Instagram</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B90JN2kBdsE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

If you\u2019re Keith Urban, you set up an iPhone and stream an impromptu show from the nearby warehouse where you store your touring gear. And, if your wife Nicole Kidman wants to bop along in the background, where\u2019s the harm? In truth, Urban\u2019s half-hour jam fell between two stools, lacking the immediacy of a pure solo gig but sounding too clamorous when the DAT tapes kicked in. \u201cIt\u2019s like Wayne\u2019s World,\u201d he quipped. After a bumpy start, though, he settled into a groove, and the supremely laid-back Kidman was great value, even when her man directed a horny, wolf-whistle guitar solo at her during a climactic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PMqUat-Oqsk\">Wasted Time</a>.</p> <h2>Christine and the Queens</h2> <p><strong>March 16, Instagram</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B9zgHVfqShG/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In a bid to \u201cdeal with the ENNUI\u201d, she has promised live musical updates, the first of which was an uplifting 15-minute tonic. Dressed in black polo neck and a tremendous Rockford Files suit, Chris performed stripped-back, piano-led versions of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0GMHfgEskZo\">People, I\u2019ve Been Sad</a> and the amazing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC1jIAP_WBc\">Je disparais dans tes bras</a> while moving hypnotically round the cavernous, wood-panelled studio. She has promised future Instagram dispatches showcasing \u201cguests and weird concepts\u201d, and a Q&amp;A with fellow pop maverick Charli XCX is apparently coming up next.</p> <h2>John Legend</h2> <p><strong>March 17, Instagram</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B920EARl9XS/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The acoustics in his home were also exquisite, enhancing his already supremely honeyed vocals. Over the course of a surprisingly slick hour, things picked up when his wife, Chrissy Teigen, sauntered in, bringing some imperious Joan Collins vibes in a bath towel and turban wrap, perching herself and a generous glass of ros\u00e9 on the piano. Among the love ballads and make-out songs, the sweetest request came from their daughter, Luna, who wanted to hear the title track from Disney\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jLG1hceTKi4\">Beauty and the Beast</a>. As well as semi-ironically plugging his own imminent album, Legend pointed fans toward Global Citizen and the <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/\">Feeding America</a> food bank initiative, while also suggesting fellow lovesick superstars Miguel and Camila Cabello could be streaming intimate shows next.</p> <h2>Ben Gibbard</h2> <p><strong>March 17, YouTube</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei9xuVkbQuU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ei9xuVkbQuU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If beamed-from-home gigs are the new status quo, part of the appeal might be seeing beloved musicians messing around in a low-stakes way, leaving all that image-making and sonic perfectionism far behind. Ben Gibbard, the veteran creative force behind beloved indie acts Death Cab for Cutie and the Postal Service, clearly isn\u2019t quite at the airhorns and hula-hooping stage just yet. For the first of what he plans to be a series of daily YouTube gigs from his Seattle home studio \u2013 in aid of local charity <a href=\"www.teenfeed.org\">Teen Feed</a> \u2013 he performed heartfelt solo acoustic versions of fan-requested tracks, including <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VN0M48Fq93s\">Northern Lights</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H8ZUV9IBEXY\">Grapevine Fires</a>. There was also a cover of Radiohead\u2019s Fake Plastic Trees that he wryly attributed to \u201cThomas Aquinas Yorke\u201d. Sombre but moving, this serious-minded show was absolute manna for superfans.</p> <h2>Lights</h2> <p><strong>March 18, Instagram</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B95oho5pX3o/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

But as Wendy Williams\u2019 blistering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush Lessons Learned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">review</a> shows, the department\u2019s problems are broader and deeper than one scandal.</p> <p>The review exposes the department as unfit for the society it is supposed to serve, after a series of colossal failures, rooted in a toxic internal culture and an ingrained misunderstanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history. It showed \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness\u201d on race issues that is \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d. It calls for ministers and officials to make an \u201cunqualified apology\u201d to \u201cthose affected and the wider Afro-Caribbean community\u201d, but more importantly it says that the sincerity of this apology can only be judged the extent of the \u201csystemic and sustainable cultural change\u201d that follows it. Every Windrush citizen harmed by the government deserves to be compensated immediately, but the true test of whether the British government has learned its lesson will be the future policies it chooses to implement.</p> <p>There is not one easy fix to the culture of the Home Office, or the inhumane policies driving the unnecessary suffering it creates. However, the Lessons Learned review provides a unique opportunity as well as a blueprint to fix a broken department. Home Office reform should follow four steps.</p> <p>Of all the reports and newspaper briefings that have characterised Priti Patel\u2019s crisis-ridden tenure at the helm of the Home Office, perhaps the most concerning was that which suggested she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/21/priti-patel-storm-warning-civil-servant-david-normington-immigration\">not committed to the rule of law</a>. When the UK government presides over a regime that fails to give migrants proper legal representation, splits children from their parents and deports people against legal advice, it is not only the immediate victims who are harmed. These failures fatally undermine the UK\u2019s standing as a champion of the rule of law and human rights in the world.</p> <p>Wendy Williams\u2019 review outlines that many of these failures stem from \u201ccultural issues\u201d in the department. The only way to fix them is with a new positive vision. That means replacing the \u201cdefensive culture\u201d, \u201cnegative terminology\u201d and \u201cbiased language\u201d with a new culture which is open to feedback, ideas, criticism and learning. The Home Office needs to develop a new mission statement and purpose rooted in the British values of the rule of law, democracy, individual liberty, diversity, openness and respect for those from different backgrounds, faiths and beliefs. Internally, the department\u2019s new purpose must be to replace the deeply divisive culture that has distorted immigration control from a responsibility into a sport. Whistleblowers should be actively protected, rather than dismissed. The department\u2019s diversity and inclusion strategy must be made concrete with tangible targets. All staff should be required to undergo education and training to understand Britain\u2019s colonial history, migration and the story of black Britons.</p> <p>Second, we need to rebuild the Home Office in a way that recognises the internal contradiction of being a department that controls immigration, but that also has a fundamental duty to protect vulnerable communities. We need to retrain Home Office officials to recognise that their primary duty is to resolve people\u2019s problems, not exacerbate them. The culture of awarding bonuses in reward for meeting quotas encourages officials to treat individuals as means to an end, rather than as human beings. This must stop. There is no reason that processes for people to be reunited with their families should be designed in a way so complex that even some lawyers struggle to understand them. The Home Office should make it easier and much less expensive for individuals to legalise the status that is rightfully theirs.</p> <p>As the review highlights, caseworkers in the Home Office need to develop a \u201ccraft\u201d, to replace its current \u201cfactory line approach\u201d. This means picking up the phone and arranging face-to-face meetings in complex cases. In terms of data collection and metrics, the Home Office must enter the 21st century. It can no longer be a paper department and it must create a central process for collecting, recording and monitoring data so that it can spot patterns of failure and respond to them.</p> <p>Third, the hostile environment must be replaced by a humane environment. By turning teachers, doctors and landlords into border guards, the government manufactured an \u201cus and them\u201d culture that led to gross discrimination across the public realm. The review calls for an immediate end to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">\u201cright to rent laws\u201d</a> and says the department must take \u201curgent action\u201d to review every hostile environment measure. The implications are clear. We should scrap the entire hostile environment, and immediately introduce a process for individuals who have been discriminated against because of it to get compensation.</p> <p>Finally, we can look at creative policy solutions to detoxify immigration issues that go beyond the scope of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review. A one-off immigration amnesty would lift 1.2 million undocumented migrants out of the black economy, allowing them to work legally, pay taxes and contribute to society. It would also massively reduce the Home Office\u2019s workload. Other countries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/09/spain.gilestremlett\">including Spain</a>, have successfully implemented amnesties on a similar scale. This is a policy that can find cross-party support, having previously been supported by Boris Johnson. A one-off amnesty could be the perfect opportunity for the Home Office to hit reset. Another potential idea is devolving parts of migration policy to the regional level. This could only follow a radical decentralisation of the UK. However, doing so could resolve existing tensions that result from varying public opinion in different parts of the country.</p> <p>If the government is serious about righting the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation, it will recognise that this moment cannot be ignored. The Home Office\u2019s systematic mistreatment of migrants, as well as British citizens, is a moral stain on the United Kingdom. Rebuilding the UK\u2019s immigration system separately from Wendy Williams\u2019 Lessons Learned review, rather than alongside it, would be the final insult to a generation that asked for so little, but gave so much.</p> <p>\u2022 David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham<br><br></p>",
  "<p>In her report on the Windrush scandal, Wendy Williams does not quite brand the Home Office institutionally racist \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">but she comes close</a>.</p> \n<p>Williams\u2019 finding that failings within the department amounted to an \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race\u201d that was consistent with \u201csome elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d should prompt some significant soul-searching.</p> \n<p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, has pledged to review the recommendations and pay close detail to the way her department \u201cviews the communities it serves\u201d. Crucially, she has committed to looking at the government\u2019s \u201ccompliant environment policies\u201d, more often known as the \u201chostile environment\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Home Office is already facing mounting calls to scrap the policies, which, if not the cause of the Windrush scandal, undoubtedly compounded it.</p> \n<p>Introduced by Theresa May as home secretary in two immigration acts in 2014 and 2016, the policies essentially empowered a range of figures across society to become immigration enforcement officers. Landlords were required to conduct right-to-rent checks, doctors were asked to assess the immigration statuses of the sick before they were treated, and checks by banks and employers were also demanded.</p> \n<p>In her review, Williams makes clear that the hostile environment evolved under the Labour, coalition and Conservative governments successively and does not pin the blame on the 2014 and 2016 acts exclusively.</p> \n<p>However, those powers remain, and dismantling or reworking them would be a significant step forward in aiding the cultural change that Williams is calling for.</p> \n<p>Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said: \u201cWe need to see urgent action now on the hostile environment, on overhauling casework culture and the culture of targets in the Home Office, to ensure that the same cultural and organisational concerns we have previously raised do not lead to more scandals like this in the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the issue of race, Williams is clear that the Home Office needs to review its diversity, inclusion and unconscious-bias awareness training, and tackle its lack of senior figures from minority backgrounds.</p> \n<p>But she goes beyond classic HR solutions. She suggests new Home Office staff should be educated on the history of the UK and its relationship with the rest of the world, including Britain\u2019s colonial history, the history of inward and outward migration and the history of black Britons.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Williams says this goes to the heart of what the Home Office stands for. What is its purpose? Her answer is to say that the home secretary should set a clear mission statement that has at its core \u201cfairness, humanity, openness, diversity and inclusion\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"61c6edce-7dd7-4965-b71f-f5eacd2078fe\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jUefQy1Wa1s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Patel committed to clarifying the department\u2019s purpose in this spirit, adding: \u201cI want to make the Home Office a better place to work.\u201d</p> \n<p>But as far as the immigration directorates work, the proposals come at a complicated time. The home secretary has tasked her officials with overhauling the immigration system for post-Brexit Britain, with a point-based system focused on skilled workers to be introduced.</p> \n<p>Overhauling the department\u2019s culture while implementing one of the biggest policy shifts in recent times will be a significant ask.</p>",
  "<h2>Recommendation: ministers should admit that serious harm was inflicted on people who are British, and provide an unqualified apology to those affected</h2> <p>The review found that the government ignored repeated warnings, and that ministers were still failing to acknowledge the extent of suffering inflicted on thousands of people who were mistakenly classified as illegal immigrants by the Home Office. Throughout her interviews, Wendy Williams encountered a reflexively defensive position from senior civil servants and ministers. While officials agreed that the situation was \u201ctragic\u201d, there was a consistent desire to blame the individuals for failing to apply for documentation.</p> <p>Officials told her: \u201cIt was the fault of the people caught up in it that they didn\u2019t get evidence of their status and when they tried to, they didn\u2019t provide the right documentation.\u201d In the most strongly worded section of the report, Williams expresses frustration that ministers and senior officials did not appear to accept the full extent of the injustice done.</p> <p>\u201cMany gave the impression that the situation was unforeseen, unforeseeable and therefore unavoidable. Whereas, the evidence clearly shows that the sequence of events which culminated in the scandal, while unforeseen, was both foreseeable and avoidable.\u201d</p> <p>She concludes that unless there is a genuine acceptance of its failings, all attempts to right the wrongs of the Windrush generation will seem hollow, and warns that the department risks repeating the mistakes that led to the scandal.</p> <h2>Finding: race clearly played a part in what happened to the Windrush generation</h2> <p>Williams says she had \u201creally serious concerns\u201d about racism within the department. The report does not find that the Home Office was institutionally racist, but it offers a detailed analysis of how \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d and \u201cignorance\u201d on race contributed to the scandal.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is unfortunate that most of the policymakers were white and most of the people involved were black,\u201d a senior official told her. Williams finds a lack of understanding about the nature of racism: \u201cThere seems to be a misconception that racism is confined to decisions made with racist motivations \u2026 This is a misunderstanding of both the law and racism generally.\u201d She notes that the Home Office failed to track \u201cthe racial impact of its policies and decisions\u201d.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the department should establish a race advisory board, and teach staff about Britain\u2019s colonial history</h2> <p>This may go some way to addressing ongoing concerns about whether the department is institutionally racist. Williams highlights the lack of ethnic diversity at senior levels in the Home Office, reflecting a pronounced disparity with the public it serves. Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff are predominantly concentrated in the lower grades, and in 2018 made up 26.14% and 26.33% of the two lowest grades respectively, but only 7.18% of the senior civil service roles. She finds there has been low take-up of unconscious bias training in the department. \u201cThe Windrush scandal was in part able to happen because of the public\u2019s and officials\u2019 poor understanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history.\u201d</p> <p>A race advisory board might focus on improving these failings. But campaign groups want the government to go further. A group of 16 leading race equality organisations, led by the Runnymede Trust and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, has called on the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to investigate whether there is institutional racism in the Home Office.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the home secretary should commission officials to undertake a full review of the hostile/compliant environment policy and measures</h2> <p>The Home Office, under Theresa May, was aware of significant concerns about the potential for the hostile environment measures to result in discrimination, the review finds, adding: \u201cDespite the warnings, the department failed to monitor, or properly evaluate, the effectiveness and impact of the compliant environment measures.\u201d</p> <p>The review makes clear that the roots of the scandal stretch back over decades, as immigration legislation was gradually tightened from 1948 onwards, and notes the responsibility of Labour governments in the 1990s onwards in tightening immigration controls. However, it pinpoints the development of hostile environment policies during May\u2019s time at the Home Office as the moment at which problems escalated. The creation of the \u201chostile environment\u201d was done with a \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d for the Windrush generation, the report finds. \u201cWarning signs and messages about the hostile environment policy were not heeded.\u201d</p> <p>A key failure was a misplaced assumption in the impact assessments for the 2013 and 2015 immigration bills that those who were unable to prove that they were here legally were therefore here unlawfully. This was not the case. Around 17% of the UK population do not have passports, and until the introduction of the hostile environment most people had not needed them. After the report\u2019s publication, Labour called for a repeal of hostile environment legislation, and the home secretary Priti Patel said she would review the report\u2019s recommendations.</p> <h2>Finding: Windrush victims are still vulnerable to compliant environment measures</h2> <p>Some Windrush victims remain in severe financial and personal difficulties, facing homelessness and unemployment because of Home Office policies. Many people affected have not approached the Home Office because they remain scared of the threat of immigration enforcement action, Williams notes. The true scale of the problem remains unknown.</p> <h2>Finding: the department displayed a lack of empathy for individuals and used dehumanising jargon and cliches</h2> <p>Using words like \u201cstock\u201d and \u201cflow\u201d when describing immigration numbers is dehumanising, Williams says, criticising the way the department refers to people as a group, rather than recognising that individual lives are at stake. This language has \u201can impact on the attitudes and behaviour of staff towards people with whom they come into contact\u201d \u2013 and contributes to officials \u201closing sight of individuals\u201d. Initiatives like use of the \u201cGo home\u201d vans were \u201cracially insensitive\u201d, and should never be repeated.</p> <h2>Finding: the Home Office displayed \u201cdefensiveness, lack of awareness and an unwillingness to listen and learn from mistakes\u201d.</h2> <p>This review follows numerous previous highly critical reports about the Home Office, published over the past 15 years. One senior official said: \u201cThe department has got used to being beaten up.\u201d</p> <p>This defensiveness meant that officials were unwilling to acknowledge the scale of what had gone wrong. \u201cThere is the sense that priorities and decisions have been driven by an overwhelming desire to defend positions of policy and strategy \u2013 often at the expense of defending individuals from the impact of policies.\u201d The report recommends that officials be reminded of their duty to speak up when worried about the risks of policies and offer \u201ccandid\u201d advice to ministers.</p> <h2>Recommendation: the department should be more proactive in identifying people affected</h2> <p>The government has admitted that over 160 people were wrongly detained or deported to Caribbean countries, but has never investigated who has been deported to other Commonwealth countries. Campaign groups will welcome the request that Home Office extend its own investigations into who it might have wrongly deported.</p> <h2>Finding: a \u2018target-dominated\u2019 work environment within the immigration system contributed to the scandal</h2> <p>Williams criticises a \u201ctarget-dominated work environment within the immigration system and some low-quality decision making\u201d, which combined with<strong> \u201c</strong>operational and organisational failings\u201d in the department to cause the detrimental treatment meted out to the Windrush generation. Some individual decision-makers operated an \u201cirrational and unreasonable\u201d approach to individuals, demanding multiple documents for proof of presence in the UK for each year of residence in the UK \u2013 despite there being no policy basis for this.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a global crisis. An organism has infected hundreds of thousands, and entire nations are in lockdown. Is this the moment for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel\">Marvel</a>\u2019s Avengers to spring into action, defeating the baddies and restoring order? No, this is, alas, reality.</p> <p>In the grand scheme of things, the damage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> is likely to do to the internal structural credibility of the Marvel Cinematic Universe really isn\u2019t the most worrying aspect of its sudden rise to prominence.

What if the inter-movie story threads introduced in Black Widow are no longer available for audiences to yank on until they have already seen the episodes these narrative strands have already teased? Remember <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6drPSAfADoA\">that bit in Avengers: Endgame</a> where Ant-Man ended up as a baby version of himself as a result of some freaky time-travel paradox? This could set off a chain of events with even more devastating consequences for the MCU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec41a0b778421fc1ba2ceb0d366c45ab0a387685\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec41a0b778421fc1ba2ceb0d366c45ab0a387685/222_51_1338_1671/801.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel boss Kevin Feige.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still sporting the Infinity Gauntlet \u2026 Marvel boss Kevin Feige.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Latour/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a normal Hollywood environment, the sensible decision would be to simply shift every movie back by a few months, to allow for Black Widow to be released before those episodes it needs to predate. But the studio might prove a victim of its own success here, too. Marvel movies are now so popular that the MCU is shifting to the small screen, with new Disney+ shows such as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki and WandaVision all likely to weave seamlessly into the main narrative. Will these now also be delayed? Or could Marvel spend the next few months deleting all reference to Black Widow from these shows, like that bit in Endgame where the Avengers head out on a time-travel mission to delete all evidence of the infinity stones from the past before Thanos has a chance to get his wicked purple hands on them?</p> <p>It\u2019s all a bit of a worry, even if there are more pressing concerns right now than whether coronavirus has mucked up the MCU. Moreover, Variety\u2019s own report on the matter quotes an anonymous source declaring that pushing Black Widow \u201caffects nothing on the MCU timeline\u201d. Given that Cate Shortland\u2019s film takes place just after the events of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush\">Captain America: Civil War</a> (2016), when both Romanoff and Robert Downey Jr\u2019s Tony Stark/Iron Man still walked the Earth, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the episode representing a rare standalone instalment.</p> <p>We should also remember this is Marvel we are talking about. Over the past 12 years, studio president Kevin Feige has successfully war-gamed almost two dozen highly successful superhero movies without falling victim to any of the narrative inconsistencies or casting disasters that have plagued his competitors. He has ridden out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/may/23/edgar-wright-departs-marvels-ant-man-due-to-differences-in-vision\">spats with directors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/18/robert-downey-jr-pushed-me-out-iron-man-terrence-howard\">demands from stars for a greater share of the purse</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/21/spider-man-out-of-marvel-cinematic-universe-after-disney-split-with-sony\">a rival studio trying to wrench back one of Marvel\u2019s best-known names</a>. Not once has he dropped the Infinity Gauntlet of ultimate power \u2013 so why should we expect a little thing like the cancellation of a major box-office bow to stop him in his tracks?</p>",
  "<p>Numbers of African black rhinos in the wild have risen by several hundred, a rare boost in the conservation of a species driven to near extinction by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/19/super-gangs-africa-poaching-crisis\">poaching</a>.</p> <p>Black rhinos are still in grave danger but the small increase \u2013 an annual rate of 2.5% over six years, has swollen the population from 4,845 in 2012 to an estimated 5,630 in 2018, giving hope that efforts put into saving the species are paying off.</p> <p>The painstaking attempts to save the black rhino have included moving some individuals from established groups to new locations, increasing the species\u2019 range and ensuring viable breeding populations, as well as protecting them through stronger law enforcement efforts. Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving.</p> <p>\u201cThe continued slow recovery is a testament to the immense efforts made in the countries and a powerful reminder that conservation works,\u201d said Grethel Aguilar, acting director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which compiles the global red list of species under threat.</p> <p>\u201c[But] there is no room for complacency as poaching and illegal trade remain acute threats. It is essential that the ongoing anti-poaching measures and intensive, proactive population management continue, with support from national and international actors.\u201d</p> <p>The outlook for the other African rhino species is still troubled, according to the update to the red list published on Thursday.</p> <p>White rhinos are more numerous in Africa but categorised by the IUCN as near-threatened. The outlook for them has worsened in recent years, driven by high levels of poaching in South Africa\u2019s Kruger national park. White rhinos have larger horns than their black counterparts, making them more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2017/aug/25/rhino-horn-sales-banking-on-extinction\">attractive to poachers</a>, and they are easier to find as they prefer more open habitats.</p> <p>Although white rhino numbers grew between 2007 and 2012, the numbers of the southern white rhino subspecies fell by 15% during that period, from an estimated 21,300 to 18,000, cancelling out previous growth.</p> <p>Poaching levels appear to have declined again in the last few years, down from a peak in 2015 when an average of 3.7 rhinos were killed every day. Estimates for 2019 suggest poaching has declined further, owing to governments taking stronger measures against the organised crime gangs behind poaching.</p> <p>\u201cWith the involvement of transnational organised crime in poaching, rhino crimes are not just wildlife crimes,\u201d said Richard Emslie, a coordinator for African rhinos at IUCN. \u201cIf the encouraging declines in poaching can continue, this should positively impact rhino numbers. Continued expenditure and efforts will be necessary to maintain this trend.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/kenyas-rare-white-female-giraffe-killed-by-poachers\">Kenya's rare white female giraffe 'killed by poachers'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The impacts of the coronavirus crisis are also worrying experts, as the halt to tourism will reduce resources for conservation. \u201cThe impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is likely to have significant negative impacts on private commercial wildlife operations and state national parks and game reserves that conserve rhino,\u201d said Emslie. \u201cThose in the field paying for all the conservation work on the ground may need more financial support so that they can maintain current efforts despite the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The costs of keeping rhinos safe have risen greatly in the last decade, however, and live sale prices have fallen, reducing incentives for private landowners and communities to keep rhinos. About half of white rhinos and nearly 40% of black rhinos are on private land or land managed by communities. If the rhinos are viewed as a cost, that will further hamper efforts to protect them.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s update to the red list showed tha more than 31,000 species around the world are threatened with extinction.

In many ways, the face of fame is destined to change after all this has blown over: many people we consider famous now, at the start of all this, will no longer be famous when it is done. This is because the machinery that makes them famous \u2013 the movies, the reality shows, the album productions, the photoshoots \u2013 will cease production for months, and the great unseen currency in which the famous trade \u2013 relevance \u2013 will fade alongside it. Like, do we really need \u201cFlorence Pugh\u201d as much as we\u2019ve been pretending we do this last year? Coronavirus will be that acid test.</p> <p>But even when the concept of celebrity ceases being a social function \u2013 you can\u2019t be famous in the wastelands, can you? You can\u2019t \u201cI have 5.5 million Instagram followers\u201d your way out of a feral gang beheading \u2013 I ask you this: knowing you live on a planet where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/17/jared-leto-coronavirus-desert-meditation\">Jared Leto</a> is out there, existing \u2026 do you not think you will be fundamentally curious as to what he is up to? Just to keep track of his movements to ensure he doesn\u2019t tiptoe too close to you, if anything. You want to know what Jared Leto is up to. As long as Jared Leto exists, we simply must know what he is up to. This is the true nature of fame. Leto is a creature so distant, so baffling, we simply must gaze at him in wonder. In any other timeline \u2013 alternate universes shoot off into the infinite where this is broadly true \u2013 we would keep him in a bulletproof tank inside a zoo, and pay tickets to go and look at him. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06e426cc97afd9a1a56e3071db264b25ccc9b859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06e426cc97afd9a1a56e3071db264b25ccc9b859/0_0_2284_1370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Leto illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Anyway Jared Leto news now, andLeto somehow managed to miss the coronavirus news (if you have also somehow missed it, may I gesture at the broad sense of eerie silence loaded with the potential of chaos that surrounds you right now, and maybe suggest you get the Guardian app and turn push notifications \u201con\u201d), and he managed to do so in the most Jared Leto way possible: by being on a silent meditation retreat in the desert. No joke can I write, following that. No point trying. Leto has out-Leto\u2019d Leto. There is no cherry to put atop that sundae. He missed the coronavirus news because he was \u201cthinking\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JaredLeto/status/1239785964169342976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow. 12 days ago I began a silent meditation in the desert.

We were totally isolated. No phone, no communication etc. We had no idea what was happening outside the facility.\u201d He added: \u201cWalked out yesterday into a very different world. One that\u2019s been changed for ever. Mind blowing \u2013 to say the least. I\u2019m getting messages from friends and family all around the globe and catching up on what\u2019s going on.\u201d And then \u2013 in one of the most astounding \u201cfamous people\u201d moves I think we\u2019ve seen in 2020 \u2013 Leto, a man who may I remind you learned about coronavirus about 15 minutes ago and is still getting days-old text messages coming through that just say \u201cbro did u die????\u201d \u2013 tweeted some bland coronavirus advice, saying: \u201cHope you and yours are ok. Sending positive energy to all. Stay inside. Stay safe.\u201d Mate, I\u2019ve <em>been</em> staying inside, because I\u2019ve known about coronavirus! Don\u2019t you <em>dare</em> step out of the desert after not talking for 12 days and tell me what to do! </p> <p>I\u2019ve been fascinated by Leto for a long time, because everything he does is shrouded in this inescapable, granular <em>Leto-ness</em>, possibly more than any other celebrity alive. The best Leto story \u2013 before \u201csomehow missing coronavirus because he was so lost in his own thoughts\u201d \u2013 was the filming of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488988/\">Chapter 27</a>, where he spent two months packing on 67lb (almost five stone) to play John Lennon\u2019s killer, Mark Chapman, a feat he managed by guzzling microwaved pints of ice cream mixed with olive oil and soy sauce. He put on so much weight for the role that he developed gout and struggled to walk to set every day. Such dedication to a part, you would think, might garner an Oscar nod, or a blockbuster opening weekend, but no: the film opened to generally poor reviews and ultimately grossed less than $200k. The lesson we must learn from this is: if you\u2019re going to put on so much weight for a role that you Henry VIII yourself, it\u2019s broadly advisable to do it for a decent script. It\u2019s arguable that Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s did better out of that film than the distributor did. Maybe that\u2019s what he was thinking about in the desert. I know I\u2019d never stop thinking about that, even for one quiet second of my life.</p> <p>What we need in this time is sources of simple joy, and while some celebrities have stepped up to the plate \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/robbiewilliams/?hl=en\">Robbie Williams</a>, who this week hosted an Instagram Live from his hotel room, resplendently topless, laptop steaming on his duvet, playing his own songs from YouTube, advert pre-roll and all, singing along to them direct to camera, giving his fans an utterly bonkers intimate dream concert because he was isolated from his wife and children, and if his knighthood isn\u2019t assured by that alone then I suggest we storm the castle \u2013 some very much have not, and yes obviously I am talking about Gal Gadot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gal Gadot does Imagine\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

There they are, in various gardens and against various blank mansion walls, and in various of those special calamitously bad outfits celebrities wear in the downtime moments when they are not being styled, and we realise how fundamentally useless they all are without help, that they can\u2019t even get dressed properly, and that, truly, a lot of them really are lucky that they\u2019re hot. \u201cWe are in this together, we will get through it together,\u201d Gadot wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine together. Sing with us.\u201d I have to preface this statement with: it\u2019s very nice that they all tried. The sentiment behind it is sincere. But the video itself is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen on the internet, and I\u2019ve seen corpses on this thing.</p> <p>Firstly: why do celebrities think them singing a song, badly, is helpful? Do we still blame Band Aid for this? Can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_6SaRWdJMc\">Bob Geldof saying \u201cgive us your fucking money!\u201d</a> really have had this much of a lasting, shockwave impact on popular culture? And secondly: it\u2019s already getting A Bit Bloody Rich having celebrities cloyingly telling us how important self-isolation is from their labyrinthine, exquisite, sunny Hollywood mansions, is it not? I enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/arnold-schwarzenegger-and-his-tiny-horses-urges-people-to-stay-home\">Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s at-home-with-the-ponies videos</a> as much as anyone, but I don\u2019t have a pony, or a house really, so it\u2019s tougher for me to relate. It\u2019s all well and good for famous people to stay at home where they have a room \u201cjust for clothes\u201d and a swimming pool in their garden, but slightly trickier for the rest of us, worrying about income, grocery levels, having to weapon up to go to Aldi, and whether that ominous cough our housemate seems to have got will somehow, distantly, kill our nan.

  "<p>The European Union has toughened its demands on fish in British waters as part of a post-Brexit trade deal, as the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, revealed he had coronavirus, fuelling doubts about the timetable for an agreement.</p> <p>Fishing is set to be one of the most bruising chapters of the EU-UK negotiations, with both sides seeking an agreement by 1 July, a deadline called into question by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>An EU legal text published on Wednesday evening revealed a tougher approach on fishing rights, compared with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/13/brexit-eu-demands-uk-negotiations-draft-treaty\">an earlier version.</a> The new text sets the goal of \u201cupholding \u2026 existing reciprocal conditions on access to waters and resources\u201d, whereas the previous version set the bar at \u201cdefining clear and stable rules\u201d.</p> <p>The changes \u2013 demanded by EU member states \u2013 underline that national governments are taking a harder line on fishing rights than the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, who wants flexibility in the negotiating room.</p> <p>Member states, led by France, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland, are insisting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/fishing-eu-countries-seek-tough-stance-on-access-to-uk-waters\">maintaining the status quo</a> on access rights for their fishing fleets. The British government wants to tear up arrangements formalised decades ago so that it can increase its share of the catch in British waters.</p> <p>The two sides exchanged legal texts on Wednesday, before Barnier announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus, heaping further doubt on the timetable for a deal by the end of the year.</p> <p>\u201cI am doing well and in good spirits. I am following all the necessary instructions, as is my team,\u201d Barnier wrote on Twitter. \u201cFor all those affected already, and for all those currently in isolation, we will get through this together.\u201d</p> <p>In a video message recorded in a book-lined room, he added: \u201cEveryone among us has a role to win this collective battle, this war against the virus.\u201d</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe send Michel Barnier our best wishes for his recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Confirmation that the virus has spread to the highest levels of the EU negotiating team is bound to fuel calls for both sides to extend the transition period that ends on 31 December 2020.</p> <p>At his daily press conference on Wednesday, Boris Johnson denied reports he would seek an extension of the transition, saying it was \u201cnot a subject that is being regularly discussed\u201d.</p> <p>The latest round of talks, due to take place in London this week, were cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. The two sides have been unable to agree so far on other ways of talking. The UK has said both sides are considering \u201calternative ways to continue discussions\u201d, such as video conferencing and conference calls.</p> <p>The European commission\u2019s chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said the negotiations would be carried forward. \u201cWe believe that there are ways to ensure that even in the current circumstances, negotiations can continue to take place.\u201d The main focus, he said, was \u201ctextual analysis\u201d of the legal documents exchanged by both sides.</p> <p>But online talks pose problems for the Brussels negotiators. Even the smallest discussions can include 10 to 20 people on each side, coming and going, during one three- or four-hour session. The European commission has asked all \u201cnon-critical\u201d staff to work at home, a message reinforced by the Belgian government when a nationwide lockdown came into force on Wednesday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, civil servants across Whitehall are being deployed to work on the coronavirus. The next round, due to start on 6 April, is now in doubt, as the EU executive and all European governments turn their attention to fighting the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Terry Reintke, a German Green MEP, who helped to set up the European parliament\u2019s EU-UK friendship group, told the Guardian it was \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d to stick to the original timetable, which is meant to result in a wide-ranging deal on trade, fishing rights and security being agreed by the end of the year.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be possible. I really hope the British government and the British parliament will come to their senses.\u201d</p> <p>She added that a deal was not just \u201cpeople meeting in a room\u201d, but time for parliamentary scrutiny, informed by experts. The European parliament, which has to approve the final deal, has drastically reduced its activity, with many MEPs unable to leave their home countries.</p> <p>Fabian Zuleeg, the head of the European Policy Centre, a Brussels thinktank, said not extending the transition was \u201creckless when faced with unprecedented crisis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cRemote facilities cannot replace the multiple exchanges that take place during a negotiation round, let alone replicate the personal relationships that make a negotiation work,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.epc.eu/en/Publications/The-need-for-a-longer-transiti~30cc30\">he wrote</a>. \u201cThat is particularly crucial in this case, where the timetable is already tight.\u201d</p> <p>The British government has not revealed whether it intends to publish its draft legal text, which was sent to the EU team on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u201cWe are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,\u201d a government spokesman said. \u201cWe will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them available more widely.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Callers to BK radio, a station broadcasting to the remote region around Mount Elgon in western Kenya, were worried on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>\u201cWill the government help us if we stay indoors and we need food?\u201d one asked. \u201cWhat if we have small houses, where we can\u2019t stay too far apart?\u201d asked another.</p> <p>The station was hosting a show with staff from a charity that provides livestock and training to rural farmers, and answering questions about coronavirus from a nervous community. The first case of the global pandemic in Kenya was confirmed in Nairobi on Friday last week, and the number of confirmed cases had risen to seven by Wednesday 18 March.</p> <p>So far there have been no cases in rural Kenya, according to Dr Suvajee Good, health promotion programme manager for the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Africa region.</p> <p>But health experts worry about if and when the virus spreads to where limited access to sanitation and healthcare services mean infectious disease is already a huge problem.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not possible for them to quarantine, because they cannot stock up</p> <footer> <cite>Titus Sagala, Send a Cow charity</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate so far, but we cannot be relaxed about it,\u201d Good said.</p> <p>With people travelling from cities to rural areas, often by public transport, \u201ccommunity infections could happen any time\u201d, she stressed.</p> <p>There are 645 million people living in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa, according to World Bank data \u2013 and three-quarters of them don\u2019t have the facilities at home to wash their hands with soap and water.</p> <p>In fact, said Titus Sagala, country director of <a href=\"https://www.sendacow.org/about/our-team/\">Send a Cow</a>, the charity featured on the radio show, 95% of the Kenyan households with which his organisation works don\u2019t have access to running water. And although the situation has improved since the NGO first began its work, in some households soap is an unaffordable luxury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now, given that thorough handwashing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the disease associated with coronavirus, health workers are emphasising the importance of personal hygiene, according to Samuel Airo, a community health worker in Busia county, on the Kenya-Uganda border.</p> <p>This is especially important because the culture in western Kenya is very sociable, said Sagala. People greet each other with handshakes and hugs, and spend much of their time in groups for meals, ceremonies and worship.</p> <p>Kenya\u2019s government has announced restrictive measures in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, including school closures, bans on entry for non-Kenyans, and instructions for anyone who has travelled internationally in the previous 14 days to self-quarantine.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the government said on Tuesday that it has tested 110 people and aims to have testing facilities in each of Kenya\u2019s 47 counties.</p> <p>County governments are setting up isolation units, but Sagala worries they could quickly become overwhelmed during an outbreak. He added that measures such as self-isolation and staying away from work are difficult for the communities he serves, where many people live hand to mouth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible for them to quarantine, because they cannot stock up,\u201d he said. \u201cA lockdown will make the lives of these communities very tough.\u201d</p> <p>The WHO recommends that rural communities create plans to deal with any outbreak, said Good, who emphasised the importance of isolation for anyone showing symptoms of the disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/16/african-nations-impose-stricter-measures-as-coronavirus-spreads\">African nations impose stricter measures as coronavirus spreads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe acknowledge that people cannot have their own separate rooms and toilets and equipment and utensils everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the community should have a plan to support people who have these kind of symptoms, and have their own arrangement for isolation.\u201d</p> <p>That means being vigilant and acting fast if anyone shows symptoms, Good said. And given the conditions in rural areas, and how quickly the disease has spread elsewhere, it also means bracing for the possibility that if someone in the community tests positive, \u201cthe whole community may be infected\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Sebastian Coe has admitted that \u201cnobody is saying we will be going to the Games come what may\u201d as the debate over whether the Tokyo Olympics should be staged this summer continues to intensify.</p> <p>A growing number of athletes and athlete representatives, including Britain\u2019s world heptathlon champion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/katarina-johnson-thompson-criticises-ioc-for-olympics-preparation-advice\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson</a>, and the Olympic pole vault gold medallist, Katerina Stefanidi of Greece, have expressed their concerns about being able to prepare for the Games with much of Europe in lockdown.

A combination of Johnson\u2019s large majority and widespread disquiet about the BBC\u2019s recent political coverage seemed to open a clear route towards the creation of a radically different, significantly diminished public broadcaster.</p> <p>But we have arrived abruptly in a different era. From our new perspective, adrift in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the most significant public health crisis of our age</a>, those days feel suddenly distant. There are new, more urgent questions. Would market forces offer religious services on local radio stations across the country? Or virtual gallery tours and musical and comedy performances? Would Netflix launch extensive additional educational programming to help children unable to attend school to keep up with their studies? Would Amazon dig into its massive archive of sport, arts and drama content to offer prime cuts to a quarantined population?</p> <p>The BBC is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51931050\">proposing all this and more</a> \u2013 including everything from home exercise classes for older people to dietary advice in a time of potentially scarce supplies. There is a name for such initiatives: public service broadcasting. And we may soon realise how much we missed it if we lost it.</p> <p>The sense of the BBC\u2019s diminishing authority did not arrive from nowhere. Since the turn of the century, it has faced a series of crises: some unfortunate, but many self-created. It fought the government and lost over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jan/29/bbc.davidkelly1\">its reporting of Tony Blair\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq</a>. The scandal surrounding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/jimmy-savile-scandal-bbc-newsnight-boss\">the suppression of the reporting into Jimmy Savile\u2019s lifetime of child sexual abuse</a> still beggars belief.

The treatment of Donald Trump\u2019s absurdly contradictory and misleading rhetoric around coronavirus should act as a warning to us all. Trump\u2019s cheerleaders at Fox News have walked in lock step with their candidate, shamelessly calibrating their stance according to his position, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1240257271353016320\">flip-flopping all over the place as a result</a>. It no longer feels hysterical to suggest that this approach could cost lives \u2013 indeed, it may already have done so. It is a graphic illustration of what can happen when leaders know that their media allies will be slavishly loyal.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s coverage of the political elements of this crisis may still fall short of its wider aims; too often it accepts unquestioningly what the government says. Yet the point remains: if the BBC fails to scrutinise the government, the public, as stakeholders, have a right to hold them to account. Fox News faces no such obligation towards balance and, accordingly, its viewers will remain dangerously ignorant about the extent of their government\u2019s failure.</p> <p>But the BBC is about more than news. It is etched into British lives, even if sometimes only as a pantomime villain. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/bbc-suspends-filming-of-eastenders-due-to-coronavirus\">The delays to staples </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/bbc-suspends-filming-of-eastenders-due-to-coronavirus\">such as EastEnders and Casualty</a> will remind us of that. The pauses to the filming of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/16/filming-of-bbc-peaky-blinders-and-line-of-duty-postponed-coronavirus\">Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders</a> will affect \u201cevent\u201d TV, too. But the coronavirus proposals transcend entertainment. They represent a statement of community values and a practical attempt to help.</p> <p>At its best, the BBC is sustained by a contract between broadcaster and citizen. It\u2019s easy to be cavalier about this sentiment, but suddenly, it feels reassuring. The BBC relies on consent and goodwill to continue as a public service broadcaster. Its enemies have been waiting patiently for that feeling to dwindle and it had begun to look like they were in luck. But, in a time of traumatic change, the BBC could be the one institution that has a chance of staying largely the same.</p>",

Millions stand to lose earnings as a result of social distancing measures. The charity predicted people would typically be spending \u00a327 less a week on transport and \u00a319 less on leisure, but that food and energy bills would rise.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government must set a crisis minimum income of at least \u00a3180 a week so that people can afford the basics while they are unable to work,\u201d said Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. \u201cIncreasing sick pay and support from the benefits system will mean people don\u2019t have to face the impossible choice of working while unwell or ignoring guidance to self-isolate or socially distance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Opposition MPs and peers calling for the introduction of a minimum basic income included Jon Cruddas, Lord Dubs and Chris Bryant for Labour, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, 33 of the Scottish National Party\u2019s Westminster parliamentarians and representatives of Plaid Cymru.</p> \n<p>The Resolution Foundation said that with less than one-in-ten of those in the bottom half of earners saying they were able work from home, it would be harder for them to protect their incomes in the face of social distancing measures.</p> \n<p>It also proposes that the 2 million lowest-earning employees currently ineligible for statutory sick pay are granted the benefit and that it be increased for everyone from \u00a395.85 to \u00a3160 a week to ensure it covered half the earnings of employees that rely on it, up from the current third. The government should meet \u00a3800m cost of the increase over six months for small and medium-sized businesses, it said.</p> \n<p>The foundation also said ministers should increase the basic out-of-work universal credit payment by a third to \u00a3100.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Other European countries affected by Covid-19 have taken steps to shore up household incomes. In Denmark, the government is paying 75% of the salary of workers who have been laid off temporarily up to the equivalent of around \u00a32,800 a month. Germany has said that after being required to enter quarantine, employees must continue to be paid for six weeks and that the government would refund employers.</p> \n<p>In Ireland, employers who have to temporarily shut businesses have been asked to continue paying staff \u20ac203 a week, again reimbursed by the government. Sick pay will also rise to \u20ac305 a week and will be available for those asked to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>In Sweden, employers can halve their wage costs and temporarily stand down their employees, and still receive more than 90% of their wage from the government, which is also offering to cover the cost to firms of all sick pay at least until May.</p> \n<p><br></p>",

  "<p>Tony Allen is the most distinctive drummer Africa ever produced, or at least the most distinctive one who made it into a recording studio. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/31/fela-kuti-musical-neil-spencer\">Fela Kuti\u2019s</a> musical director, he was the co-creator of Afrobeat. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/23/hugh-masekela-obituary\">Hugh Masekela,</a> who died in 2018, was the continent\u2019s finest horn player, celebrated for fusing jazz with homegrown South African styles. The pair met in Nigeria in the 70s, when Masekela paid two famously wild visits to Lagos, where he spent most of his time hanging out with Kuti and his band. They played together again in the 80s, before finally getting round to recording in 2010.</p> <p>But only now is their collaboration album, Rejoice, being released. It promises to be one of the African albums of the year, although Allen seems a little bemused. \u201cI thought it had been abandoned,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Not so, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/apr/10/artsfeatures1\">Nick Gold</a>, who co-produced the recordings: \u201cI knew they wanted to work together. They were going to be in the same place at the same time, so I booked a studio for two days, not to make an album, but to see what would happen. It was just an experiment.\u201d Now, he and Allen have supervised the addition of new bass lines and a dash of keys, vibraphone and extra percussion, while leaving the original work untouched. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m not touching my drums,\u2019\u201d says Allen. \u201c\u2018They\u2019ve been done!\u2019 The feeling was unique with Hugh and I together.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85c0db818acaec9d1939221c8d37514cc9ef9e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85c0db818acaec9d1939221c8d37514cc9ef9e5c/0_0_3796_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Allen and Hugh Masekela\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hugh was a funky guy.

Tony Allen and Hugh Masekela in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Rodgers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What makes Rejoice so special is its brave minimalism \u2013 much of it is drums and bass matched to Masekela\u2019s horn. It brilliantly showcases Allen\u2019s unique talent. Now 80, he is still the go-to drummer for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/07/damon-albarn-gorillaz-heroin-blur\">Damon Albarn</a> and many other younger musicians. Constantly inventive yet never flashy, he has a style that is somehow dominant, but never intrusive. Allen has a deep, quiet voice; when he starts discussing his technique, his hands and feet begin beating out rhythm patterns on the table and the floor, almost instinctively.</p> <p>Masekela and Allen worked out nothing in advance. \u201cI had drum patterns in my mind,\u201d says Allen. \u201cDifferent movements, fast and slow; different structures. I just wanted him to play his trumpet to my patterns.\u201d Masekela obliged, writing melodies on the spot. Much of the set is instrumental, but it includes songs that already sound like Masekela classics. Robbers, Thugs and Muggers is a sturdy clash of South African township styles and west African percussion, while on Never he switches to Afrobeat, with a tribute to the man who brought them together in the chorus: \u201cLagos never gonna be de same \u2013 never! \u2013 without Fela.\u201d</p> <p>Masekela first met Kuti and Allen at an important turning point in his career. He had escaped from apartheid-era South Africa and notched up a hit single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_S3QOJk90\">Grazing in the Grass</a>, in his new home of the US, but then found himself in trouble. His house in Malibu, California, was raided and he avoided prison on drugs charges only because there had been no proper search warrant. His songs about Vietnam and migrant workers were too extreme for many laid-back 70s audiences, so he moved to west Africa to look for new inspiration. He managed to get funding to record with African musicians, but Allen remembers that the month he spent with Kuti was \u201cwell crazy, smoking the weed and things\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ckbxqrCIc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d4ckbxqrCIc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Listen to the new single from the album, Never.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Masekela returned to Lagos in 1977, the situation was even more crazy. He had been invited to play at <a href=\"https://www.pulse.ng/gist/festac-77-find-out-about-the-twisted-legacy-of-the-great-black-festival/205nmc3\">Festac</a>, a high-profile international festival strongly supported by the military regime of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/27/nigeria-olusegun-obasanjo-fighting-corruption\">Olusegun Obasanjo</a>. Kuti refused to take part, Allen says, because he insisted that the government buy copies of a book on African history, <a href=\"http://africaworldpressbooks.com/black-man-of-the-nile-and-his-family-by-dr-yosef-a-a-ben-jochannan/\">The Black Man of the Nile and His Family</a>, and distribute them to all the guests \u2013 which they refused to do.</p> <p>Obasanjo was furious, and became even more angry when he learned that the celebrity Festac guests were spending their time at Kuti\u2019s club, the Shrine. From behind his drum kit, Allen presided over some extraordinary all-night sessions. \u201cHugh Masekela was there, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/oct/19/worldmusic\">Gilberto Gil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/29/caetano-veloso-review-barbican\">Caetano Veloso</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/05/stevie-wonder-every-studio-album-ranked\">Stevie Wonder</a> \u2013 they would all come to jam,\u201d Allen says. \u201cFela was giving them palm wine to drink. But nothing was recorded. It was live business.\u201d</p> <p>Obasanjo got his revenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/16/felas-compound-attacked\">when armed troops stormed Kuti\u2019s compound</a>, which he had named the \u201cindependent\u201d Kalakuta Republic; during the attack, Kuti\u2019s mother sustained injuries from which she later died. \u201cThey burned his house down \u2013 he got his arse kicked in the end,\u201d says Allen, who escaped thanks to having a gig at the Shrine that night. \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t playing, I was always at the Kalakuta. [Working] saved me that day.\u201d</p> <p>Allen had joined Kuti\u2019s band Koola Lobitos in the mid-60s and was a founding member of his legendary Africa \u201970 group in 1969. But in late 1978 he decided to quit, furious that Kuti \u2013 now married to 27 \u201cqueens\u201d \u2013 was becoming increasingly chaotic, owed him money and had failed to respect the musical director who had helped him create Afrobeat\u2019s heady fusion of jazz, funk and African styles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I could understand Kuti\u2019s militancy. It\u2019s OK challenging the government for their wrongdoings. But what about him?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the lack of organisation,\u201d Allen says. \u201cIf you put everyone together who was working \u2013 band, singers, dancers, management \u2013 there would be 24 to 28 people. But we went on tour with 70 people, so there would be over 40 people in the hotel spending money and doing nothing. And the outstanding money couldn\u2019t be paid \u2013 too many people not working! I could understand what was happening with his militancy. It\u2019s OK challenging the government for their wrongdoings. But what about him?\u201d</p> <p>Allen knows how important he was to Kuti. \u201cWithout me, he is not going to play. If I\u2019m sick, there is no work. But if he\u2019s sick, we could play. So tell me, who is the master, then?\u201d What, then, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jbzdl9isW0\">Kuti\u2019s recordings with Ginger Baker</a>, a drummer with a very different style, who travelled to Lagos to meet Kuti? \u201cI just let him play his way. I steadied the music, so he could do anything he wanted. If I\u2019m not there, Ginger Baker cannot play with Fela.

He stayed in Lagos for a while, but by 1984 he had moved to Harlesden in north-west London, where he began gigging with the South African drummer and band leader <a href=\"https://bandonthewall.org/artist/julian-bahulas-jazz-afrika/\">Julian Bahula</a>. Masekela had moved to London, too, \u201cand he came to jam with us and we talked about one day working together. It took 16 years, but everything has its time.\u201d</p> <p>By the time they did eventually record, Allen\u2019s life had changed yet again. He had moved to Paris (he now has French and Nigerian passports) and begun to experiment with new styles, arguing: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be stagnant or bored. It\u2019s evolution. I can\u2019t keep doing the same things.\u201d His 1999 album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/jun/03/artsfeatures\">Black Voices</a>, saw him mixing Afrobeat with dub and electronica. As younger fans began to discover his music, he was given a boost by Damon Albarn, who sang: \u201cTony Allen ... really got me dancing,\u201d on Blur\u2019s 2000 hit Music Is My Radar.</p> <p>Albarn is now \u201clike family \u2013 I love him\u201d; their collaborations have included powerful songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-hMkHkoFrU\">Go Back</a> and Allen\u2019s work with the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen. He says that their second album, 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/16/the-good-the-bad-and-the-queen-merrie-land-review\">Merrie Land</a>, was constructed like Rejoice \u2013 \u201cwritten on my drum patterns in the studio\u201d. His plans for this year include working on what he calls his \u201ctravel album\u201d, playing with young musicians in Nigeria, London, Paris and the US, \u201cbecause I want to take care of youngsters \u2013 they have messages and I want to bring them on my beat\u201d (Albarn may well be involved too).</p> <p>He has organised a tour to promote Rejoice, \u201calong with Hugh\u2019s classics and some of my own stuff\u201d. He will lead a five-piece that will include the South African trumpeter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/nov/14/jazz.shopping1\">Claude Deppa</a>. He says it will be \u201cdifferent from the record. Hugh was a funky guy.

The feminist academic and writer spent almost 16 months inside Luzira prison in Uganda for writing a poem on Facebook about Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni\u2019s mother\u2019s vagina. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stella.nyanzi/posts/10156527462740053?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\">In the untitled poem</a>, she graphically described the vagina in grotesque terms (one line reads: \u201cI wish the lice-filled bush of dirty pubic hair overgrown all over Esiteri\u2019s unwashed chuchu had strangled you at birth\u201d), framing the president\u2019s emergence from the birth canal as a metaphor for his increasingly oppressive near 35-year rule.</p> <p>But Nyanzi came out of prison all guns blazing, head first into a tense political climate as Uganda\u2019s 2021 election looms closer; when she stepped out of the court in Kampala, she donned a tiara and a sash that read \u201cFUCK OPPRESSION\u201d and began to address crowds. When we meet weeks later, she\u2019s excited and speaks quickly; she wants to show people \u2013 particularly those \u201cinspired to write as boldly or even bolder than me\u201d \u2013 that imprisonment did not silence her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/17/jailed-ugandan-activist-stella-nyanzi-wins-freedom-of-expression-award-oxfam-pen-international\">\u2018You can't handcuff my spirit\u2019: jailed writer wins freedom of expression prize</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be out, but it\u2019s not necessarily freedom,\u201d she says, gazing out over the shores of Lake Victoria. \u201cWhen I got a phone, everyone was saying, \u2018Do not [use] Facebook, do not tweet, don\u2019t write anything stupid.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Fuck you, guys!\u2019\u201d She\u2019s shouting now, hands on hips: \u201cThey should say, \u2018Hey! Even after prison, she came back harder, stronger, more vulgar!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nyanzi laid the groundwork for this long before her release. During a court appearance in August, via a video link from prison, she swore and stripped as the judge sentenced her to an extra nine months on top of her initial punishment, on charges of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/02/activist-who-branded-uganda-president-a-dirty-delinquent-dictator-faces-jail-yoweri-museveni-cyber-harassment\">cyber</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/02/activist-who-branded-uganda-president-a-dirty-delinquent-dictator-faces-jail-yoweri-museveni-cyber-harassment\">harassing</a> Museveni. Her release in February followed a successful challenge by her legal team.</p> <p>While in prison, Nyanzi released a poetry collection, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Roses-My-Mouth-Political-ebook/dp/B084F7MHJX\">No Roses </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Roses-My-Mouth-Political-ebook/dp/B084F7MHJX\">from My Mouth</a>, made up of 158 poems she wrote behind bars. With sections dedicated to prison, feminism and Uganda, the collection includes poems as explicit as the piece of writing for which she was imprisoned. She has been described as employing \u201cradical rudeness\u201d \u2013 an activist tactic with roots in Uganda\u2019s anti-colonial resistance movement, which uses public insult and naked protest to disrupt social norms and criticise those in power. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d44154eaa3fdf3cc5c23f0d80f7c514e47a2dabb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44154eaa3fdf3cc5c23f0d80f7c514e47a2dabb/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No Roses from My Mouth is a collection of 158 poems Nyanzi wrote in prison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wrote on my body, on the walls, in the toilets, on leaves\u2019 ... No Roses from My Mouth is a collection of 158 poems Nyanzi wrote in prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nyanzi estimates that half of her poems were confiscated by guards, including a collection about solitary confinement she wrote in an exercise book. \u201cI wrote on my body, on the walls, in the toilets, on leaves,\u201d she says. Despite losing so much, she believes poetry was a practical tool of resistance: \u201cA poem can be short. It can be a little piece of paper stuck inside the bra. On five pages you can have 20 poems,\u201d she says, going through the different methods she used to smuggle her words out of prison, such as hiding pages inside the traditional woven mat she sat on when people visited her.</p> <p>Nyanzi clearly feels indebted to those who worked to get her poems out of prison and into a published book \u2013 despite arriving at our interview holding a copy labelled \u201ccorrections\u201d in red marker. (\u201cWe cannot win any struggle if we can\u2019t spell right!\u201d she says.)</p> <p>Before prison, Nyanzi always wrote poetry for herself; inside, she says, it became a way for her to make sense of what she and others around her were experiencing. \u201cIt was so, so much. Somebody is dying there, someone is pregnant here, someone is being beaten there,\u201d she says. \u201cThese intense moments were always there.\u201d</p> <p>One poem, The Mango Seller, describes a woman who has arrived in prison after being arrested for selling mangos on the street. Nyanzi paints an unflattering picture \u2013 her \u201cscary\u201d eyes, knotted hair and snotty nose \u2013 but contrasts this with her pain and fragility. \u201cI am here in prison crying for my baby,\u201d the mother says; she has been separated from her eight-month-old child, who she left with her neighbour that morning while she went to sell mangos by the roadside. Unable to afford the fine for operating without a licence, she was sent on a bus to prison.</p> <p>Nyanzi\u2019s own trauma is also explored in the book, including several devastating tributes to the baby she miscarried in prison. There is also a poem about a lesbian relationship between inmates, and an intersex prisoner who Nyanzi describes as \u201ca man, a woman, a fabulous person / How you confuse gender rigidities!\u201d</p> <p>An anthropologist by profession, Nyanzi is known for her studies of, and allyship with, marginalised groups, such as the sex worker and LGBT+ communities. Her research was controversial in Uganda\u2019s conservative society before she went to prison; she wonders if this may have contributed to the loss of her position at Makerere University, a decision she is still battling in a civil court. While Nyanzi says she has academic colleagues who support her, none would testify for her in court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93f2e86c4a6a5342fea4d6e54d5e5aad0f4b5939\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f2e86c4a6a5342fea4d6e54d5e5aad0f4b5939/0_112_2368_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yoweri Museveni in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have nothing against the man, but this dictatorship must be represented by an \u201cit\u201d\u2019 ... Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Muchucha/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Museveni is the target of many of Nyanzi\u2019s poems. The two have family in the same area of Uganda and she says she would politely greet him if they met. \u201cI have nothing personal against the man,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut this dictatorship must be represented by an \u2018it\u2019.\u201d She says she even admires Museveni\u2019s use of language, full of \u201cmetaphors and proverbs and riddles\u201d such as <a href=\"https://www.observer.ug/news-headlines/41737-mbabazi-thugs-stuck-a-finger-in-a-leopard-s-anus-museveni\">describing</a> anti-government protesters as putting their lands \u201cin the anus of a leopard\u201d - a phrase Nyanzi uses back at him in her poetry, by describing herself as \u201cpoking the leopard\u2019s anus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a snake and a bastard and a bitch and a murderer and all those things, but he\u2019s also very funny,\u201d she says. \u201cLike, really-clever-brilliant funny.\u201d </p> <p>While Nyanzi makes jokes about inviting Museveni for a live poetry standoff, she knows she needs rest. She has collapsed several times since being released from jail, due to a condition that has now been diagnosed as trauma-induced.</p> <p>\u201cI am thinking I need to go for warm baths, and to sit in rustic overgrown gardens,\u201d she smiles \u2013 although she then lays out her jam-packed schedule. It\u2019s hard to understand when she will find time to relax. Yet since her release she continues to find solace in poetry, particularly listening to the work of young writers in Kampala at spoken-word events. She speaks animatedly about a recent university poetry slam she went to with her 15-year-old daughter, on the theme of sexual consent.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I have teenagers in my house, I have access to kids doing poetry events,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very soothing, music and poetry, percussion and poetry. It\u2019s helping me to cope.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There are few hard and fast laws in the world of rock and pop music, but as a general rule of thumb, you can tell an album is considered a big deal if its release involves a global fashion retailer launching an accompanying range of clothes for both adults and children. So it is with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/j-balvin\">J Balvin</a>\u2019s sixth solo album: whatever you make of Guess\u2019s attendant Colores capsule collection (it\u2019s as subtle and understated as you might expect from clothes designed by a singer who expressed his solidarity with 2019\u2019s Pride events by dying his hair rainbow colours) its existence tells you a lot about the enviable commercial position the 34-year-old Colombian currently finds himself in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"356145179c3216f0e71457fb1453ae1baf3307f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/356145179c3216f0e71457fb1453ae1baf3307f1/0_1_406_406/406.jpg\" alt=\"J Balvin: Colores album art work.\" width=\"406\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J Balvin: Colores album art work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Takashi Murakami</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If he isn\u2019t so well-known in the UK \u2013 where 2017\u2019s platinum-selling <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnJ6LuUFpMo\">Mi Gente</a> remains his only major hit \u2013 that\u2019s not a situation reflected elsewhere. Luis Fonsi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk\">Despacito</a> might have been the song that signalled Latin pop\u2019s ascension to the upper echelons of success outside of Spanish-speaking countries, but it\u2019s Balvin who embodies the genre. He was the first Latino artist to headline Lollapalooza, the first reggaeton artist to appear on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\">Saturday Night Live</a>, and the only guest star at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/beyonce-at-coachella-review-greatest-star-of-her-generation-writes-herself-into-history\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s epic 2018 Coachella</a> performance who wasn\u2019t a former bandmate or member of her immediate family. That year, he was also the fourth most-streamed artist globally on Spotify.</p> <p>For further evidence of his hugeness, you only have to look at the cover for Colores, which is hideous \u2013 a cutesy cartoon of multicoloured grinning flowers \u2013 but the kind of hideous that costs a fortune: it\u2019s the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/02/takashi-murakami-japans-rock-star-artist-unveils-10-metre-stupid-cat-painting\">Takashi Murakami</a>, the Japanese contemporary artist who once sold a sculpture of an anime teenager masturbating for $15.2m. Or read the list of starry cameo appearances, which won\u2019t take long: there aren\u2019t any. It\u2019s often suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/27/j-balvin-english-language-pop-colombian-artist-most-streamed\">Latin pop\u2019s commercial rise</a> is a result of both the global village effect of the internet and the canny use of guest stars to prick the interest of anglophone audiences. Balvin evidently no longer needs the latter, and there\u2019s something understandably confident about Colores, from its grand concept album status (every song is named after a colour, although the lyrics seem conceptual only in so far as they largely revolve around how sexually irresistible Balvin is) to its brevity. Ten songs, over in 29 minutes: no need for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake\">Drake</a>-like attempt to game the streaming systems by sticking out an album with dozens of tracks on it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tG70FWd1Ds\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_tG70FWd1Ds?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For anyone who\u2019s missed the finer points of Balvin\u2019s rise, it provides a concentrated primer. He is widely held to have leapfrogged his urbano music rivals by smoothing out the sound of reggaeton: dialling down the aggression in the vocal delivery to a nonchalant drawl, favouring singing over rapping, being unashamedly tuneful. There are points where Colores delivers something approaching visceral thrills \u2013 such as on the gloomy, minimal Negro, when the roughness of the beats chafe against the lush melodicism of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EU7DybGTY\">Morado</a> \u2013 but Balvin\u2019s ability to break cultural boundaries isn\u2019t matched by a desire to smash artistic ones. There\u2019s little of the off-kilter weirdness or the sudden, mid-song stylistic shifts associated with his competitor and sometime collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/03/bad-bunny-x-100pre-review-off-kilter-debut-from-puerto-rican-powerhouse\">Bad Bunny</a>. Colores is an album of clever production touches \u2013 the appealing balafon samples that open Verde; the hazy, shoegazey electronic tones that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/22/diplo-being-a-white-american-you-have-zero-cultural-capital\">Diplo</a> weaves around Rosado \u2013 rather than head-spinning sonic WTF-ery, the musical equivalent of the blood-soaked visuals in the video for recent single Rojo. The closest it gets to the latter might be sparse opener <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewBfH6AXxf4\">Amarillo</a>, where the only music in the arrangement is provided by what seem to be people making trumpet noises with their mouths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/27/j-balvin-on-breakdowns-escobar-and-beyonce-reggaeton\">\u2018I\u2019ve been through hell\u2019: J Balvin on burn out and Beyonc\u00e9</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It isn\u2019t really interested in standing out by startling the listener, or reeling them in with novelty, but what Colores does have in profusion is a universal brand of pop smarts. There are a plethora of choruses that dig into your brain and breezy but beautifully turned tunes: one listen and Azul is almost impossible to dislodge; even single Blanco, which dispenses with everything except beats, bassline and Balvin\u2019s voice, is infernally catchy. It makes sense that every track comes with a lavish video attached, and not merely because that\u2019s another way of demonstrating his current status. It is focused in a way that a longer album wouldn\u2019t be, and every track sounds like a potential single.</p> <p>It would be nice if the kind of artistic risk-taking Balvin demonstrates in his videos was reflected more in the music, but under the circumstances, you can\u2019t blame him for sounding pleased with himself. \u201c\u2018<em>Tamo\u2019 rompiendo o no estamos</em><em> rompiendo, muchach</em><em>os</em>?\u201d he asks at the conclusion of Morado (\u201cAre we smashing it or are we not smashing it, guys?) before allowing himself a delighted chuckle and adding the word \u201cglobal\u201d, which hardly needs translating. Nothing on Colores suggests that the appeal is going to narrow in the foreseeable future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2mX8ktJoWvyidWBU9U8Jis\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2mX8ktJoWvyidWBU9U8Jis\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU\">Da\u00f0i og Gagnamagni\u00f0:</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU\"> Think About Things</a></strong><br>Robbed of wider exposure by Covid-19, Iceland\u2019s 2020 Eurovision entry is a thing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/01/hey-whats-that-sound-keytar\">keytar</a>-playing choreographed wonder.</p>",

  "<p>xI joined up with the England squad at Lancaster Gate on Monday 4 May 1956, five days before the match, and I felt as small and as insignificant as I had when I turned up for my first day as a professional with Sheffield United. I was only just over the injury that had ruled me out of the match against Wolverhampton Wanderers the Saturday before, but the burden of my new surroundings rendered my legs jelly-like.</p> <p>When I presented myself to the receptionist at the FA headquarters, she said: \u201cAh, yes, Mr Grainger \u2013 you\u2019ll be sharing a room with Mr Matthews.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr Matthews?\u201d I replied, my voice rising an octave.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Mr Grainger, it has already been decided. What are you worried about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStanley Matthews is a star, one of the greatest players in the world. I shouldn\u2019t be sharing with Stanley Mathews.\u201d</p> <p>I wish I had taken the trouble to check the facts. The \u201cMr Matthews\u201d with whom I would share a room was Reg Matthews, the goalkeeper for Coventry City in the Third Division, which came as a massive relief. The other Matthews \u2013 the legendary Stanley, whom I idolised \u2013 never shared a room with any player. He was far too famous and far too talented to be one of the lads.</p> <p>The players to whom I introduced myself first were from Manchester United: Tommy Taylor, Roger Byrne and Duncan Edwards, who were all seated together, each wearing a smile that could only have come from the confidence born of their new status as champions of England. I had no such confidence. To me, the environment was alien.</p> <p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Colin Grainger of Sheffield United.\u201d</p> <p>I had met them all before, of course, during the trip to Belfast a week earlier, but I did not want to assume they remembered me. I was famous locally, in Sheffield and in Barnsley, but still not a national figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"91bd10fd5d3198a1700fc8b9566c61a13768fe49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91bd10fd5d3198a1700fc8b9566c61a13768fe49/0_0_2832_4160/681.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Grainger.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Grainger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCome and join us, Colin,\u201d Edwards said in a thick Black Country accent that must have been how my grandparents spoke.</p> <p>The England manager was Walter Winterbottom, whose reputation was that of a grammar-school headmaster, but he was nothing of the kind. He was quiet, extremely polite, never given to shouting at people, and always eager to perpetuate the sense of team spirit. We trained at Highbury, the home of Arsenal, but all we did was run around the pitch. When we had a meal, I noticed that Stanley Matthews was nowhere to be seen. \u201cHe eats on his own,\u201d somebody told me.</p> <p>Matthews had only just returned to the team after a spell out. John Atyeo, the prolific Bristol City striker, also returned. I was surprised to discover that Nat Lofthouse and Bill Perry, two fine players, had been dropped, while Tom Finney had been ruled out through injury.</p> <p>The day after, when we had some free time, Duncan Edwards asked me if I fancied walking into the West End with him. We cut through Hyde Park and shared stories about our backgrounds. He was interested to learn that the Graingers and the Hollidays hailed from Dudley, Staffordshire, the town where he was born in 1936. We spoke about Joe Mercer, who was not only my manager at Sheffield United but also the man who, as the coach of the England schoolboys\u2019 team, recommended Edwards to Manchester United in 1952. Edwards might otherwise have signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers or Aston Villa.</p> <p>As we strolled around London, Edwards and I enjoyed our anonymity, taking in the sights like wide-eyed tourists, and even going shopping. It was Edwards\u2019s idea to go to a lingerie shop. A gift for the lady, he said, picking up a saucy pair of knickers with that childlike charm of his. The lady in question was Molly Leech, to whom he was engaged. I was a bit more self-conscious when I selected something appropriate (ie, less risqu\u00e9) to take back to Doreen in Havercroft. It required no small amount of dexterity to get these gifts into our rooms back at the hotel in Lancaster Gate without any of the other players noticing.</p> <p>Edwards was something of a paradox. He was shy in social situations, yet he had the most endearing personality. For example, whereas most of us conformed to protocol and addressed Walter Winterbottom as \u201cMr Winterbottom\u201d, Edwards always called him \u201cWalter\u201d \u2013 in that thick Black Country accent that we all liked to imitate. Nobody else would have got away with such informality where Winterbottom was concerned but, then, nobody else had Edwards\u2019s attractive disposition off the pitch or magical exuberance on it. Although I was aged only 22 at that time, Edwards made me feel like I was of an older generation.</p> <p>As my relationship with Edwards seemed to develop quickly into a friendship, I felt a part of the England structure. I woke up on the morning of the match feeling good. I read the newspapers. \u201cStan\u2019s back: England need him again,\u201d read one headline. \u201cColin Grainger beats brother Jack to first family cap,\u201d went another.</p> <p>Apparently I was \u201cthe fastest footballer in England\u201d; quicker aged 22 than I was three years earlier when I could sprint 100 yards in 10.4 seconds. Journalists noted that I was now earning \u201ctop money\u201d at Sheffield United \u2013 20 quid \u2013 and that my speed and direct style could find gaps in the \u201csquare Brazilian defence\u201d. Everything I read seemed designed to make me feel great. But when the time came to get on the bus to Wembley, the nerves kicked in, and everything around me \u2013 the players on the bus, the spectators outside walking to the stadium, the discordant sounds \u2013 turned into an overwhelming assault on the senses.</p> <p>Trembling and sweating, all I could think of was the members of my family who had come down for the match to form part of a 100,000 capacity crowd. What were they thinking? Would they get their tickets OK? Would I let them down? Was I really of the required standard for a career at international level?</p> <p>In the dressing room, I found myself changing next to Stanley Matthews, which, I think, Walter Winterbottom arranged deliberately, possibly in an attempt to calm my nerves. \u201cDo you still get nervous before these big matches, Stanley?\u201d I asked him, partly out of curiosity, partly out of the need to fill an uncomfortable silence. \u201cNervous? I am as nervous as you, Colin.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"497c9db42c471dd1af5185eee3157111f07c6874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/497c9db42c471dd1af5185eee3157111f07c6874/0_0_3368_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The matchday programme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"770\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then he swigged something from one of those new Babycham bottles. I did not ask him what it was but he was shaking so much that some of the liquid spilt all over the floor. He was nearly 20 years older than I and had been a professional since before I was born. He was an idol of mine. He was above sharing a room and the dinner table with his colleagues. And yet, on that blissful afternoon, as Matthews\u2019s hands juddered, I realised that there was something wonderfully egalitarian about the Wembley dressing room.</p> <p>Walter Winterbottom had given us some information about the Brazilians. They were great on the ball and technically superb, but not good at closing you down when you had the ball. Our plan was simple: do not let them have the ball and they will fade away. At that time, Brazil had never won a World Cup, and while there was an aura about them, it was not an aura of invincibility. I formed the impression early on that they had more to fear about England than we had to fear about them. One of the first things I noticed was that the Brazilians wore boots like slippers, made of fine leather. Our boots had improved from 10 years earlier but were still heavy and cumbersome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/23/the-psychology-of-football-rivalries\">The psychology of football rivalries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tommy Taylor scored to give England the lead inside three minutes, which was long enough for us to realise that the Brazilians were limited when it came to the arts of defending. This was easier than I expected, and confidence engulfed my being, replacing the apprehension that had made the pre-match countdown so debilitating. When we had arrived at Wembley two hours earlier, it felt as though my veins contained cement, but now they contained rocket fuel.</p> <p>In the fifth minute, Stanley Matthews received the ball near the corner flag and then, as a loud cheer circulated the stadium, he flicked it between Canhoteiro\u2019s legs to feed the England right-back, Jeff Hall. Hall\u2019s pass forward found Taylor, who beat Pav\u00e3o. The ball went across the goal from Johnny Haynes, and there I was, drifting in at the far post, in perfect position to side-foot the ball home from four yards out.</p> <p>As England debuts went, this was perfect: five minutes of action, my first touch, and already I had engraved my name on the list of England goalscorers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"317c4498ccdc6aced40e7e9627692d28a87a7e9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317c4498ccdc6aced40e7e9627692d28a87a7e9c/0_0_3360_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Grainger with the matchday programme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Grainger with the programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brazil responded by scoring twice early in the second half, through Paulinho and Didi, and then John Atyeo missed a penalty for England just after the hour mark. Tommy Taylor restored our lead in the 65th minute, before Roger Byrne missed a penalty two minutes later. The match became exciting, with Brazil pushing forward in search of an equaliser but leaving gaps in midfield and at the back.</p> <p>Billy Wright in defence and Duncan Edwards in midfield were superb, as was Stanley Matthews on the right wing. I was always impressed with Wright\u2019s timing in the air, which enabled him to out-jump taller men. In the 83rd minute, I picked the ball up on the halfway line, laid it off to Johnny Haynes and kept running. Haynes passed wide to Stanley Matthews, who made light work of Nilton Santos\u2019s attempted tackle, and I continued my run towards the left of the penalty area. Matthews\u2019s cross to the far post was accurate and clever, forcing Gilmar, the Brazil goalkeeper, out of position. I darted towards the six-yard box, jumped as high as I could, and met the ball a split-second before Gilmar got there, and the roar of the crowd confirmed that my header was nestling in the back of the net for a 4-2 lead.</p> <p>Not in my wildest dreams did I envisage such a debut, but it was a fine victory for a fine team on a day that those present were unlikely to forget for a long time. After the tribulations of the matches against Hungary in 1953 and 1954, and the anti-climax of the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, the England team had reclaimed its lost horizon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=true&amp;is-extract=true&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F29e76c097605877df6c671a741823498af016594%3Fcrop%3D0_0_343_499&amp;title=The%20Singing%20Winger&amp;author=Colin%20Grainger%20and%20Hyder%20Jawad&amp;publisher=deCoubertin%20Books&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FSinging-Winger-Colin-Grainger%2Fdp%2F190924595X\" data-alt=\"x\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=true&is-extract=true&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F29e76c097605877df6c671a741823498af016594%3Fcrop%3D0_0_343_499&title=The%20Singing%20Winger&author=Colin%20Grainger%20and%20Hyder%20Jawad&publisher=deCoubertin%20Books&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FSinging-Winger-Colin-Grainger%2Fdp%2F190924595X\">x</a> </figure>  <p>I discovered later the reason why Stanley Matthews was so keyed-up: apparently Brazilian journalists were writing that he would be no match for Nilton Santos. As events unfolded, the opposite proved to be the case. Matthews was world-class, even at the age of 41. Whatever was in that Babycham bottle was doing him good.</p> <p>Afterwards, I was at the back of the bus with Roger Byrne and as the Twin Towers of Wembley faded into the distance, he turned to me and said: \u201cColin, look at that. Just look at that. Once you\u2019ve played at Wembley, you\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p> <p>One match, two goals, and suddenly \u2013 having begun the week by feeling inconsequential \u2013 I felt now part of the England set-up. The 50 quid match fee added to the sense of unreality. I would have paid 50 quid to play for England.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 March 2020 to include a credit to Hyder Jawad who wrote the book with Colin Grainger.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This excerpt from Colin Grainger\u2019s autobiography <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Singing-Winger-Colin-Grainger/dp/190924595X\">The Singing Winger</a>, by Colin Grainger with </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HyderJawad\">Hyder Jawad</a>, <em>was published first on The Blizzard.

And for the first time in a long time, this looks like a game that just about befits the high-profile slot it has on the schedule. Yes, Richmond are raging hot favourites - just two of their premiership 22 are missing from last September - but Carlton did win six games in the second half of last season after David Teague took over.</p> <p>But for Carlton - who finished 16th last year, it is worth noting - to overcome Richmond on opening night for the first time since 2012, they\u2019re going to have to find several credible routes to goal. That looks tough on paper. Harry McKay was the Blues\u2019 leading goalkicker last year with just 26 majors - and he\u2019s not playing tonight, out with an injured groin. Charlie Curnow, second in the best and fairest, is going to miss a lot of footy with an injured knee and Eddie Betts, returning to where it all started at his original club, did his calf this week at training. </p> <p>The good news is their co-captain, Sam Docherty, will be out there tonight for the first time since 2017, after suffering two horrible knee injuries in the last two pre-seasons. That\u2019s a great story. Also in for the Baggers from last year is big recruit Jack Martin from the Gold Coast and Jack Newnes from St Kilda. Expect plenty of attention for Sam Walsh too, last year\u2019s Rising Star winner. That\u2019s something Patrick Cripps is well accustomed to, last year banking his third best and fairest by the age of 24, also taking away the prestigious Players Association\u2019s MVP gong. </p> <p>As for the Tigers, All-Australian Bachar Houli is their big omission, also hurting his calf at training. Brandon Ellis (traded) is the only other member of the 22 who flogged GWS by 89 points in the Grand Final last September. Of course, there\u2019s no Alex Rance either, the superstar defender now retired. Sydney Stack and Jack Graham are the inclusions to that side, the former missing last year\u2019s decider after smashing up his shoulder in the preliminary final. </p> <p>As for Marlon Pickett, as Eddie McGuide just said on the coverage, he \u201ccould retire next week and be the first player to turn out twice and have two books written.\u201d Quite right \u2013 his debut was the Grand Final in front of 100,000 spectators \u2013 and what a debut it was \u2013 tonight the attendance will be zero. In terms of firepower, the contrast to Carlton is highlighted through Tom Lynch, who kicked 63 goals in his first season at the club last year. Oh, and that fella called Dustin Martin \u2013 two Norm Smiths to his name - goes alright as well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rhettrospective/status/1240452309148037122\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For those wondering if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Richmond_FC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Richmond_FC</a> crowd disparity from 2019GF (100,014) to Rd 1 2020 (zero crowd,) is a record, it isnt.<br><br>Some Carlton players in the 1970 GF in front of 121,696 then played Rd 1 1971 in front of 20,399.  <br>A drop of 101,297 in crowd.</p>&mdash; Rhett Bartlett (@rhettrospective) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rhettrospective/status/1240452309148037122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e719e848f088d75755956f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-collins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T07:47:44.489Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Irrespective of what happens on the field over the next few hours, this will be a season opener talked about for generations. Not because it will be tonight when Richmond begin their premiership defence, but, rather, the fact that there will be nobody at the Cricket Ground with season starting smack bang in the middle of a global pandemic. The players, broadcasters and football departments in attendance, but the fans are locked out. Indeed, Richmond\u2019s President, Peggy O\u2019Neal, and chief executive, Brendon Gale, are both staying home. </p> <p>Since 2007, when these sides started playing in the opening round, it is has been routine that the MCG is close to full - more than 85,000 turned out last year; 90,000 in 2018. Indeed, the last time the MCG was in operation just 12 nights ago, more than 86,000 Melburnians were at our spiritual home to witness the Australian Women\u2019s cricket team triump in the World Cup Final. How the world has changed in the days since. It is going to an eerie and unique experience seeing these legitimate traditional rivals going at it without an audience. </p> <p>But whether or not you approve of the decision the commission made yesterday to proceed, footy is back. A 17-game season awaits us, with a certain Coronavirus hiatus coming sooner rather than later. The 153-fixtures will be played with 16-minute quarters to reflect the fact that they will be squeezed in wherever they are possible. Welcome to the new normal.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has increased the risk of shortages of several essential medicines. Raw materials for many key drugs, such as antibiotics and statins, are manufactured in China, where factories have been disrupted by efforts to contain the virus. Will this mean shortages for the NHS?</p> <p>The drug supply chain relies on what are known as \u201cactive pharmaceutical ingredients\u201d \u2013 the basic molecules used to make drugs. These raw materials are manufactured in China and then exported to India and other countries where they are formulated into tablets or injections, for sale worldwide. Indian companies procure 70% of their raw materials with ingredients from China, where manufacturing is cheap. The <a href=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/features/india-and-china-spark-concerns-for-uk-drug-supplies/20206998.article?firstPass=false\">NHS imports</a> 80-90% of its drugs supply from abroad, and 25% of its generic drugs from India.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If new treatments for coronavirus emerge in the next few months, the UK can\u2019t afford to be the last link in a vulnerable chain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the height of the Chinese Covid-19 epidemic, Chinese factory production was stopped. Workers were quarantined and transport between factories was <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30459-1/fulltext,\">disrupted</a>, so key raw materials weren\u2019t produced. After supplies of Chinese raw materials ran out, companies in India and elsewhere could no longer produce and export the same volume of medicines.</p> <p>In response to shortages, India decided to provide its people with essential medicines first. The country recently banned exports of key medicines such as antibiotics, statins and paracetamol. In the long-term, this could wreak havoc on the NHS supply line. Although some Chinese factories have reopened, it is unclear when production will be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/12/814623335/how-coronavirus-is-affecting-the-u-s-pharmaceutical-supply\">fully restored</a>, or when India will lift its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51731719\">restrictions on drug exports</a>.</p> <p>In the short-term, as a result of no-deal Brexit planning, the NHS has a reserve supply of drugs to <a href=\"https://medicines.necsu.nhs.uk/no-deal-brexit-continuity-of-medicines-supplies/\">prevent shortages occurring</a>. But these contingency plans won\u2019t last for ever.</p> <p>We have seen drug shortages in the past, albeit on a smaller scale. In 2008, after Chinese factories closed near Beijing for three weeks during the Olympic Games, there were <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/olympics-spawned-api-shortages\">shortages of raw materials</a>. In 2019 an epidemic of swine flu in China depleted the global <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-30/mass-chinese-pig-deaths-cause-short-supply-of-u-s-blood-thinner\">supply of heparin</a>, an essential medicine to prevent heart attacks. In Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-so-many-medicines-arel-in-short-supply-after-hurricane-maria/\">damaged another factory making heparin</a>, which disrupted supplies of the drug in 2017.</p> <p>The effects of coronavirus will last for months, and will expose the vulnerabilities of our drug supply chain. We need to apply new stress tests to the NHS drug supply chain. How will the NHS cope if Chinese supplies are continually disrupted? How will it be affected by disruptions to supplies of drugs from other countries, such as Italy? For each essential medicine, are there alternative suppliers in other countries? And are there alternative drugs that patients could take if one drug is no longer available? Stress tests were applied to the banking system after the financial crisis of 2008. Our supplies of medicines are equally important, and should be tested in similar ways.</p> <p>Instead of relying on imports, we should re-evaluate the case for manufacturing more medicines in the UK. Britain has a long history of pharmaceutical development. During the second world war, Glaxo Laboratories in the UK <a href=\"https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/about-us/our-history/building-brands-1919-1949/\">manufactured 7.5 billion tablets of penicillin</a> a year. Now, however, both the UK and US <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/u-s-officials-worried-about-chinese-control-american-drug-supply-n1052376\">depend on supplies of penicillin from China</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/the-covid-19-crisis-is-a-chance-to-do-capitalism-differently\">The Covid-19 crisis is a chance to do capitalism differently | Mariana Mazzucato</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Human trials for a coronavirus vaccine will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">begin in April</a> \u2013 but before a vaccine is ready, we will need to ensure that key drugs to treat the symptoms of coronavirus are available for everyone who needs them. Pilot studies from France and the US suggest that <a href=\"https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/French-researcher-in-Marseille-posts-successful-Covid-19-coronavirus-drug-trial-results\">hydroxychloroquine</a> can lessen the severity of coronavirus infection. A clinical trial in Shanghai is currently evaluating whether pirfenidone could <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04282902\">improve lung function</a> for people with severe disease. More definitive clinical trial results of these and other drugs are expected in May and June.</p> <p>These drugs are already being manufactured in other countries. But the acute worldwide demand for drugs to treat coronavirus could easily outstrip supply. In times of shortage, other countries could stockpile their supplies to treat their own people. Like India, they may be unwilling to export drugs to the UK.</p> <p>Supply chains are only as strong as their weakest links. If new treatments for coronavirus emerge in the next few months, the UK can\u2019t afford to be the last link in a vulnerable chain. The government has already requested that UK companies manufacture more ventilators and protective masks. It should do the same with the UK pharmaceutical industry, repurposing factories to produce drugs that help treat coronavirus and any other essential medicines at risk of shortage.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Hill is a senior research fellow in the Institute of Translational Medicine at the University of Liverpool.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>1) Whilst the rest of the sporting world is shutting down, the relatively low spread of coronavirus in Mexico means that Liga MX was one of the few major global football leagues still playing matches last weekend. As this parish has previously covered, the Mexican top flight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-agony-and-the-ecstasy/2017/feb/09/football-league-liga-mx-mexico-club-america-chivas\">is no backwater</a>.

Try matching the 2013 Clausura Final for drama. Down to 10 men and trailing 2-0 on aggregate to rivals Cruz Azul in the 88<sup>th</sup> minute of the second leg, Miguel \u2018Piojo\u2019 Herrera\u2019s Club Am\u00e9rica scored twice to force penalties. Goalkeeper Mois\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz was the hero in the shootout, saving Javier Orozco\u2019s effort as Am\u00e9rica won 4-2. Herrera\u2019s celebrations in the rain are also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOLkUTVT7ko\">quite something</a>.</p> <p>Spare a thought for Cruz Azul. That defeat in 2013 prolonged a wait for a league crown that is still ongoing and stretches back to 1997. La Maquina\u2019s last title was secured in almost equally dramatic and certainly more violent circumstances than their aforementioned loss. In extra time of the league final\u2019s second leg, with Cruz Azul searching for a win after the tie finished 1-1 on aggregate, Le\u00f3n\u2019s Argentine keeper \u00c1ngel Comizzo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&amp;v=sY1A4qFsIls&amp;feature=emb_logo\">chose to reinforce a well-worn clich\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>The Turkish Super Lig is still carrying on, albeit without fans.

One of my competitors left a message on my phone \u2018I understand you\u2019ve got travellers stranded in Morocco too, do you want to share a private jet?\u2019.

At the moment for us, that is not necessary in relation to schools. </p> \n   <p>We know from where the virus has broken out, very few kids get the illness. Those that get the illness are mainly mild, they don\u2019t appear to be transmitting between children, in fact it\u2019s more likely that children will get it from their own parents and other people in their households. </p> \n   <p>Closing schools, we know, does cause a major disruption to society and to families in particular.

However, pregnant women are potentially at increased risk of complications from any respiratory disease due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy. These include reduced lung function, increased oxygen consumption and changed immunity.</p> \n   <p><strong>Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage, teratogenicity or vertical transmission of the Covid-19 virus. There is a possibility of an increased incidence of premature birth but there is insufficient evidence at this point in time</strong>.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recommends that, where possible, pregnant healthcare workers be allocated to patients, and duties, that have reduced exposure to patients with, or suspected to have, Covid-19 infection. </p> \n   <p>All personnel should observe strict hygiene protocols and have full access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). </p> \n   <p>The college also urges employers to be sensitive to the fact that pregnant women are, appropriately, often anxious about their own health and protective of their unborn baby. Consideration should be given to reallocation to lower-risk duties, working from home or leave of absence.</p> \n   <p>The current circumstances are unprecedented. The community will rely on the medical system to function at the highest level and near 100 percent participation of the medical, nursing and midwifery workforce. Specialist practitioners may need to re-allocate to other areas of the medical system. The college expresses our deep and sincere gratitude to our members, all doctors, nurses, midwives and other health care workers, the administrative staff and management of our hospitals and health services for their dedication, professionalism and compassion.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recognises that decisions around resource allocation are complex, and multifactorial, and defers to local jurisdictions in this regard.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:58:10.170Z\">at 12.58am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72bf428f085e564ad86ca7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/melissa-davey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:39:43.405Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Health Protection Principal Committee</strong>, comprised of all chief health officers and chaired by the chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020\">has published</a> the rationale behind its latest recommendations, including that schools remain open for now. Of course, this advice may change \u2013 school closures are not permanently off the table.</p> \n  <p>The committee says there is currently l<strong>imited information on the contribution of children to transmission of Covid-19</strong>. The World Health Organization found in China 2.4% of total reported cases were under the age of 19 years old. Worldwide, very few cases of infection in children have been severe or critical. The committee says;</p> \n  <p><em>\u201cThis contrasts distinctly with the severity pattern observed with other respiratory viruses, where young children are particularly at risk of severe disease.<br><br>\u201cPrevious studies suggest that the potential reduction in community transmission from pre\u2011emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements that are in place for children who are not at school. <strong>Children may require care from older carers who are more vulnerable to severe disease, or may continue to associate (and transmit infection) outside of school settings.</strong><br><br>\u201cBroadly, the health evidence on school closures from previous respiratory epidemics shows the costs are often underestimated and the benefits are overestimated. This may be even more so in relation to Covid-19 as, unlike influenza, the impact on otherwise healthy children has been minimal to date.<br><br>\u201cSchool closure is associated with considerable costs. S<strong>tudies have estimated that around 15% of the total workforce and 30% of the healthcare workforce may need to take time off work to care for children. This burden will be significant and will fall disproportionately on those in casual or tenuous work circumstances</strong>.<br><br>\u201cAt this stage, the spread of Covid-19 in the community is at quite low levels. It may be many months before the level of Australian community infection is again as low as it is at the moment. For pre-emptive school closures to be effective, closure for at least several months is required and it would be unclear when they could be reopened.<br><br><strong>\u201dSchool closures for shorter defined periods may be considered as part of a suite of more stringent distancing measures later in the outbreak, in anticipation of a peak in infection rates.</strong><br><br>\u201cShort term reactive school closure may also be warranted to allow cleaning and contact tracing to occur in response to an outbreak in a given school.<br><br>More than 70 countries around the world have implemented either nationwide or localised school closures, at different times in the evolution of the local Covid-19 epidemic, h<strong>owever it should be noted the majority of these have not been successful in controlling the outbreak. </strong>Some of these countries are now considering their position in relation to reopening schools.\u201d</em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:42:50.506Z\">at 12.42am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72bee58f085e564ad86ca5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:39:10.058Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Tasmanian business community are in support of the decision to shut the island\u2019s borders.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emlybkr/status/1240413023912615936\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TCCI endorsing today\u2019s announcement on Tas borders, says it\u2019s probably the biggest decision of Premier Peter Gutwein\u2019s political career <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politas?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#politas</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/covid19tas?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#covid19tas</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NNXFnHtamG\">pic.twitter.com/NNXFnHtamG</a></p>\u2014 Emily Baker (@emlybkr) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emlybkr/status/1240413023912615936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Tasmania was not impacted by the Spanish flu pandemic, from a health standpoint.

  "<p>\u201cInstagram! How are we feeling tonight?\u201d shouts rising Newcastle pop star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/18/l-devine-one-to-watch-peer-pressure\">L Devine</a>. The crowd goes wild. She throws her arms wide. Then she pauses the applause track. After the last-minute cancellation of a European tour due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Devine\u2019s playing a URL tour instead \u2013 performing live on media platforms including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> over the coming weeks. The stadium-sized applause track, she explains, is to fill the awkward silence at the end of her songs.</p> <p>Her fans are making their own kind of noise: the chat function on the stream buzzes with viewers requesting favourite songs, cracking jokes and sending her heart emojis. Devine is overwhelmed by the response. More than 1,000 fans watched her opening performance on Instagram on Monday, \u201cdouble the usual viewers I get on livestreams\u201d. She felt compelled to play on different platforms to make it feel more familiar: \u201cGoing on a tour anywhere, you get to see fans in different places every night.\u201d She is changing her setlist for each performance and is planning platform-specific performance styles. \u201cWe should totally make a TikTok dance routine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B9zgHVfqShG/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Influential festival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/06/sxsw-cancelled-coronavirus-austin\">SXSW,</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/06/sxsw-cancelled-coronavirus-austin\"> held in Austin, Texas</a>, was the firs<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/06/sxsw-cancelled-coronavirus-austin\">t</a> of many major music events to be cancelled this year; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/glastonbury-festival-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\">Glastonbury</a> followed Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend in scrapping their 2020 plans. On an individual level, innumerable artists and bands have rearranged tours or scrapped them altogether. With streaming still offering low royalty rates for artists, most musicians rely on essential revenue from touring. So can a livestreamed show be a feasible replacement for the real thing?</p> <p>The immediate and long-term impact of these cancellations on the industry will be severe, says artist and researcher Mat Dryhurst. Usually, he says, \u201cthe only advice you can give someone in music to make money is to do a live show\u201d. Dryhurst believes that the coronavirus crisis is only amplifying the flawed, precarious nature of the music industry at large, and that wider reform is essential. \u201cI do think there\u2019s a future for telematic or remote performances,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it can\u2019t just be like, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re an entertainer, get your guitar out for the camera!\u2019 That\u2019s the worst version of all these things.\u201d Moreover, he\u2019s concerned that the platforms could \u201cend up being the beneficiaries\u201d if livestreaming became a mainstream expectation.</p> <p>Although livestreaming in music is nothing new \u2013 internet legend has it that a band called Severe Tire Damage were the first to perform live online in 1993, and <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/\">Boiler Room</a> has produced a decade of livestreams from the DJ-booth \u2013 there has been a boom in the last week. Artists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/christine-and-the-queens\">Christine and the Queens</a> are encouraging fans to meet on Instagram for ad hoc performances, and a reported 13,000 people watched hardcore punk band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/13/code-orange-underneath-review\">Code Orange</a> stream on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/08/how-did-twitch-become-as-big-as-youtube-by-live-streaming-video-game-players\">Twitch</a> this week in place of a cancelled gig.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09b1867bd7ffd6bcce95a3044a8721a2e2d35310\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b1867bd7ffd6bcce95a3044a8721a2e2d35310/0_100_2902_1742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Code Orange livestreamed to 13,000 fans on Twitch in place of a cancelled gig.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Code Orange livestreamed to 13,000 fans on Twitch in place of a cancelled gig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atlantic Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each of these experiences is free to access \u2013 although other artists have been experimenting with monetisation. Brooklyn-based magazine Left Bank is hosting a <a href=\"https://leftbankmag.com/leftbanklive/\">virtual music festival </a>via YouTube, running 12 hours a day until 22 March with artists from around the world broadcasting from their bedrooms. Rather than charging fans for digital entry, they are encouraging listeners to tip the musicians they enjoy using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/17/venmo-payments-app-default-privacy-settings-public-information\">Venmo</a>. Left Bank Media founder Kristyn Potter explains that given the international spread of bands and fans, this was the simplest way to get artists paid without \u201cpotentially breaking any international money laws\u201d. Although limitations of licensing and intellectual property are yet to be fully hashed out by the industry, Potter enthuses: \u201cSome artists are made for this format \u2013 we\u2019ll definitely do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Music industry expert Cherie Hu argues that artists who do best on such platforms are not necessarily the most famous, but those who commit to the format on a long-term basis. Electronic musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/20/spotlight-on-hana-alt-pop-producer-grimes-lorde\">Hana</a>, best known for her collaborations with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grimes\">Grimes</a>, has spent hundreds of hours on Twitch \u2013 a livestreaming platform favoured by gamers and owned by Amazon \u2013 to create an intimate connection with her fans. As she chats, makes music and plays games such as League of Legends, her 9,000 followers donate cash to show their appreciation. Rather than using it to sell records or produce the equivalent of a live gig, Hu explains, these artists tend to use \u201cstreaming to offer an insight into their lives and careers\u201d. The opportunity for backstage nuggets and private, more intimate conversations is what draws the fans in. Midway through Devine\u2019s Instagram Live, she jokes that it\u2019s like a VIP meet and greet event. One fan replies: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in the front row.\u201d</p> <p>Hu recently created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11wWL_7I4BG76t0V2kw1a4yIeWxUSfGwMQFYdUWAgSnA/preview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true\">a widely-shared Google Doc of live</a><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11wWL_7I4BG76t0V2kw1a4yIeWxUSfGwMQFYdUWAgSnA/preview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true\">streaming resources</a> designed to help artists suffering from the financial fall out of SXSW\u2019s cancellation \u2013 when I access it, a pop-up warns me that the document is experiencing unusually heavy traffic. Hu is positive about the potential of livestreaming, but hesitant to recommend it as an immediate solution. \u201cI think if artists approach livestreams in an interesting way, I can see it becoming a revenue stream for some of them,\u201d she says. \u201cBut those models aren\u2019t financially proven. From the artists\u2019 perspectives, there are definitely other channels that could bring them more immediate and concrete income.\u201d Buying an album and a T-shirt remains the most effective way of helping an artist with a cancelled tour.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGnw-x-46pE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GGnw-x-46pE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Electronic musician Hana livestreams the making of her album.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In her document, Hu warns readers that livestreaming is not an exact replacement for the financial, emotional or cultural value of a live show, which raises a further question: what does \u201clive\u201d mean, exactly? The academic debate about the topic usually centres on two key thinkers. Peggy Phelan, writing in 1993, argued that: \u201cPerformance\u2019s only life is in the present. Performance cannot be saved, recorded, documented\u2026 once it does so, it becomes something other than performance.\u201d Many music fans would likely agree: that it is a kind of magic in the air, the sense that anything could happen, and that whatever magic is happening, it\u2019s happening here and now. That said, there\u2019s big business in selling live music, or perceptions of it: the Rolling Stones alone have released 28 live albums to date.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Philip Auslander, whose celebrated book Liveness was published in 1999, responded to Phelan by calling the \u201cmagic of live theatre\u201d a reductive cliche. He argued instead that the phenomena of \u201cliveness\u201d is context-specific, nuanced and subjective. Twenty years later, we have more variations of \u201cliveness\u201d at our literal fingertips than Auslander or Phelan could have ever predicted.

Our systems are falling apart, we\u2019re being separated from friends and loved ones, frightened and unsure as to how life may be about to unfold. \u201cReality\u201d seems to lurch from one worrying scenario to another. Information and advice keep changing \u2014 nothing holds fast, except the idea that something, everything, is going desperately awry.</p> <p>As a psychotherapist who is used to working with clients who suffer from climate anxiety, I\u2019ve become familiar with people\u2019s fantasies and fears about the breakdown of life as we know it. Many of us have been hearing, and speaking, for years about the risks of societal collapse due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters\">extreme weather</a>, and the resulting disintegration of the systems that hold society in place \u2014 not to mention the devastating effects on nature.</p> <p>However, few of us suspected that so many of our gloomiest predictions would be so suddenly realised, albeit for another reason (although pandemics are actually very much on the list of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/18/a-deadly-virus-could-kill-80-million-people-in-hours-experts-warn\">climate-related concerns</a>). Like climate collapse, coronavirus is a threat to our livelihoods, our social lives, our health, our certainties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/sep/18/a-deadly-virus-could-kill-80-million-people-in-hours-experts-warn\">Experts warn world \u2018grossly unprepared\u2019 for future pandemics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Psychological trauma, which is one way to think about the effects of what\u2019s going on today, comes from a combination of an extreme event and its difficult aftermath: \u201ctrauma\u201d literally means \u201cwound\u201d. We know we will all be wounded in different ways by the pandemic, and suffer different losses. Our recoveries, too, will follow different paths. However, we can make choices now about how we act, and it is very important to our future recovery that each of us will be able to live with our actions afterwards. Doing the \u201cright thing\u201d \u2014 insofar as we can know what that is \u2014 is of the utmost importance.</p> <p>History is full of catastrophes: world wars, tsunamis, terrorist attacks. These events are liable to expose the cracks in individuals and societies, as if we only find out who we <em>really</em> are when everything goes wrong. At the heart of many people\u2019s climate-related fears is the notion that nothing really holds us together, that we will all become self-interested monsters the moment the shit hits the fan. On the flip side, extraordinary examples such as the French resistance, or the heroism of the firefighters dealing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/12/september11-usa\">9/11</a>, give us hope and allow us to continue to believe in the value of our human project. Emergency workers in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima</a>, too.</p> <p>So which is it to be? Will coronavirus make us fall apart, or stick together? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/like-a-war-fight-for-rice-toilet-roll-coronavirus-convulses-hong-kong\">Fights over loo rolls</a> suggest the former, while people\u2019s rush to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">neighbourhood support groups</a> suggests the latter. It will bring out the best and worst in people. When picking up the pieces after the event, remembered moments of bravery and selflessness are very often the things that help us to see the point in continuing. The choices we make now \u2014 even tiny ones \u2014 will make every difference to how we feel about ourselves, and others, in the future. The social bond is everything \u2014 and perhaps now that we\u2019re unable to express it physically, even with a handshake, we can see it in even sharper relief. If we can trust ourselves not to behave badly, it will be far easier for us to believe that other people, too, can be decent. Good relations, in this troubling new reality, are perhaps the most valuable thing we have.</p> <p>This crisis is peculiar in that it demands isolation. Still, we can \u2014 and must \u2014 be there for each other, acting responsibly, even if that means keeping one another at arm\u2019s length (or even a little further). Many people\u2019s worst fears are being realised \u2014 the unthinkable is happening. Kindness, care and fellow feeling are the qualities most likely to pull us through \u2014 even if we have to dish it out through the sometimes alienating medium of electronic devices.</p> <p>\u201cNiceness\u201d is a much derided personal quality. It sounds polite, boring, and maybe even a bit fake. Nobody wants to date a Nice Guy \u2014 he\u2019s only doing all that \u201cunderstanding\u201d crap to trick you into bed. But perhaps there\u2019s a need right now for a more radical form of \u201cniceness\u201d \u2014 the actual, real deal. People who suffer from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\">post-traumatic stress</a> are often said to be trapped somehow in their own past, unable to disentangle themselves from the accidents, atrocities or tragedies that have befallen them. They relive the event as if hoping to correct it: \u201cWhat if I had done things slightly differently? Turned left/said \u2018no\u2019/resisted temptation?\u201d Although this pandemic has surely taken us by surprise, things aren\u2019t moving so quickly that we can\u2019t think and make choices about how to act within it. If we do the right thing by one another as much as we possibly can, there\u2019s a hope that, whatever wounds we are about to sustain, we\u2019ll be able to heal together.</p> <p>\u2022Anouchka Grose is a psychoanalyst and author<br></p>",

  "<p>If a week is a long time in politics, it\u2019s an eternity for governments dealing with coronavirus. The pandemic threatens to wreak havoc on health services and bring the global economy to a standstill. Though France has not reached the critical stage of its Italian neighbour, where permits are required to leave your house, it is inching closer towards quarantine.</p> <p>Less than a week ago, President Emmanuel Macron announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/france-at-war-how-parisians-are-coping-with-life-under-lockdown\">schools and universities</a> would be closed. Two days later, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, hastily took to the political stage to order that cafes, bars, cinemas and theatres be shut down by midnight that day. It was a Saturday evening, and the theatres and restaurants of Paris were full. On social media, people posted videos of relaxed customers enjoying a last drink in bars long after the curfew had commenced. Policemen surveyed the scene as bystanders. They did not dare to interrupt this ordinary show of French <em>joie de vivre</em>.</p> <p>The following day, still undeterred by the government\u2019s warnings, crowds were spotted in outdoor markets and parks across the country. Macron and Philippe were reportedly appalled by the population\u2019s lack of collective discipline. The French media reported that one of <a href=\"https://www.sudouest.fr/2020/03/16/en-finir-avec-l-esprit-de-jouissance-7334095-10142.php\">Macron\u2019s political advisers</a><strong> </strong>quoted Philippe P\u00e9tain\u2019s infamous 1940 speech: \u201cThe spirit of enjoyment has overpowered the spirit of sacrifice.\u201d P\u00e9tain, who served as the chief of state of Vichy France in collaboration with Nazi Germany, believed that France\u2019s abject military defeat in the summer of 1940 could only be explained by the population\u2019s lack of seriousness, poor work ethic and innate penchant for entertainment. P\u00e9tain singled out the leftwing Popular Front alliance, which granted workers their first ever paid holiday, as responsible for the country\u2019s military and moral collapse.</p> <p>After people showed little sign of heeding Macron\u2019s guidance, the president implemented further restrictive measures. During a speech on Monday, which invoked a mixture of Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, Macron insisted several times that the country was \u201cat war\u201d, and asked the French to stay at home and self-isolate for two weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5aa979468e657c4d26b22d261fd29c07e693c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5aa979468e657c4d26b22d261fd29c07e693c8/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers check a motorcyclist\u2019s travel certificate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers check a motorcyclist\u2019s travel certificate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Macron has become known for cutting public spending, so his pledges to fully fund the French national health service, \u201cwhatever the costs\u201d, came as a surprise. Most surprising of all, however, was his announcement to freeze controversial pension reforms that ignited a months-long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/french-unions-strikes-emmanuel-macron-pension-reforms\">nationwide strike</a> earlier this year. What the political left, the French unions and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\">gilets jaunes</a> could not achieve after a year of intense political backlash, coronavirus has done in just a few days.</p> <p>This is the closest France has come so far to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/11/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-leaves-streets-deserted-in-pictures\">Italian-style lockdown</a>. In theory, all French citizens are confined at home and should work from there. Everyone has to download an <em>attestation de d\u00e9placement d\u00e9rogatoire</em> (an exceptional travel certificate). You are not required to show proof that you have a right to be out on the street; people self-certify and sign the \u201cdeclaration of honour\u201d. The government is hoping that people will follow the rules.</p> <p>But the first day of the national lockdown did not go according to plan. In some big cities (notably Paris), large crowds could be seen wandering in the streets. Shoppers bustled through the streets; few wore masks or kept the one-metre distance.<strong> </strong>The police began issuing on-the-spot fines to citizens who weren\u2019t carrying travel certificates. Didier Lallement, the police chief of Paris who has presided over a dramatic increase in alleged cases of <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200124-focus-france-french-police-brutality-under-scrutiny-paris-yellow-vest-pension-reform-protests\">police brutality</a>, threatened to use more \u201cexpedient\u201d measures to force people to obey orders.</p> <p>The situation has dramatically worsened this week. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/\">1,200</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/\">new cases </a>were detected in one day, bringing the total number of reported cases to 6,633. At the time of writing, there are now 7,730 diagnosed cases and 175 have died after having contracted the virus. Stronger measures should probably have been taken earlier. Macron has acted decisively \u2013 but not consistently. Just a week ago, he invited the French to carry on life as usual, while on the same weekend that Macron closed bars and cinemas, the French executive flip-flopped on whether to hold local elections (<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200316-france-set-to-postpone-second-round-of-local-elections-over-coronavirus-fears\">they have since been postponed</a>). Instead of giving orders once the virus had already begun to spread, Macron would perhaps have been well advised to sketch out how, in a time of coronavirus, a new French resistance could help contain the outbreak.</p> <p>\u2022 Philippe Marli\u00e8re is professor of French and European politics at University College, London</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 March 2020 to correct Emmanuel Macron\u2019s announcement on pension reforms: they will be frozen, not reversed.</p>",

Last year was the <a href=\"https://www.arctic.noaa.gov/Portals/7/ArcticReportCard/Documents/ArcticReportCard_full_report2019.pdf\">hottest on record</a> for the Arctic, with the annual minimum extent of sea ice in the region its <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145641/2019-arctic-sea-ice-minimum-is-second-lowest\">second-lowest</a> on record.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/antarctica-logs-hottest-temperature-on-record-with-a-reading-of-183c\">Antarctica logs hottest temperature on record with a reading of 18.3C</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike the retreat of sea ice, the loss of land-based glaciers directly causes the seas to rise, imperiling coastal cities and towns around the world. Scientists have calculated that Greenland\u2019s enormous ice sheet lost an average of 268bn tons of ice between 2002 and 2019 \u2013 less than half of what was shed last summer. By contrast, Los Angeles county, which has more than 10 million residents, consumes 1bn tons of water a year.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew this past summer had been particularly warm in Greenland, melting every corner of the ice sheet, but the numbers are enormous,\u201d said Isabella Velicogna, a professor of Earth system science at University of California Irvine and lead author of <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL087291\">the new study</a>, which drew upon measurements taken by Nasa\u2019s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) satellite mission and its upgraded successor, Grace Follow-On.</p> <p>Glaciers are melting away around the world due to global heating caused by the human-induced climate crisis. Ice is reflective of sunlight so as it retreats the dark surfaces underneath absorb yet more heat, causing a further acceleration in melting.</p> <p>Ice is being lost from Greenland seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/10/greenland-ice-sheet-melting-seven-times-faster-than-in-1990s\">revealed last year</a>, pushing up previous estimates of global sea level rise and putting 400 million people at risk of flooding every year by the end of the century.</p> <p>More recent research has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/polar-ice-caps-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-1990s\">found</a> that Antarctica, the largest ice sheet on Earth, is also losing mass at a galloping rate, although the latest University of California and Nasa works reveals a nuanced picture.</p> <p>\u201cIn Antarctica, the mass loss in the west proceeds unabated, which is very bad news for sea level rise,\u201d Velicogna said. \u201cBut we also observe a mass gain in the Atlantic sector of east Antarctica caused by an increase in snowfall, which helps mitigate the enormous increase in mass loss that we\u2019ve seen in the last two decades in other parts of the continent.\u201d</p> <p>The research has further illustrated the existential dangers posed by runaway global heating, even as the world\u2019s attention is gripped by the coronavirus crisis. Crucial climate talks are set to be held later this year in Glasgow, although the wave of cancellations triggered by the virus has threatened to undermine this diplomatic effort.</p> <p>\u201cThe technical brilliance involved in weighing the ice sheets using satellites in space is just amazing,\u201d said Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State University who was not involved in the study.</p> <p>\u201cIt is easy for us to be distracted by fluctuations, so the highly reliable long data sets from Grace and other sensors are important in clarifying what is really going on, showing us both the big signal and the wiggles that help us understand the processes that contribute to the big signal.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>You can learn a lot about someone\u2019s perspective from what they find reassuring at a time like this. This week I saw a private briefing from a bank, soothingly reassuring its clients that \u201cthis feels more like 9/11 than 2008\u201d. I think the point was to let investors know that this crisis is not systemic. It felt a bit like updating the old wartime spirit for today\u2019s hyper-capitalist economy: \u201cKeep well-capitalised, and carry on.\u201d</p> \n<p>I can think of a host of reasons why 9/11 does not bring calming thoughts to mind, but one is the long-term impact it had on human rights. Back then I was in the early stages of becoming a human rights lawyer. My very first day in court was with the team defending a victim of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/03/humanrights.terrorism\" title=\"\">extraordinary rendition</a>, where Britain had helped facilitate his torture. By the time I was practising, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/28/77-london-bombings-10th-anniversary-terror-attacks\" title=\"\">7 July London bombings</a> had happened, and so had draconian new laws \u2013 90-day detention without trial, plus sweeping surveillance and monitoring. Many Muslims remember this as the time that racial profiling and state harassment \u2013 in airports, on the tube, in the street \u2013 became the new normal.</p> \n<p>This might sound like a strange issue to raise when the national priority is \u2013 understandably \u2013 how to stop the spread of coronavirus, treat the sick and tackle the hit to the economy. But since last month, when the government drafted emergency regulations to grant police new powers \u2013 and more far-reaching laws are expected this week \u2013 the potential has been building for a clash between liberty, privacy and public health measures. The authorities now have the power to arrest and detain someone they believe is infectious for up to 14 days, to move that person around from custody facilities including secure hospitals, and to take blood or saliva from them by force, even if they are a child.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: all schools in UK to close from Friday; A-levels and GCSEs cancelled</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/129/contents/made\" title=\"\">legislation</a> set to come before parliament is likely to ban public gatherings, to widen police and immigration officer powers of detention and restraint, to give doctors powers to sign death certificates without seeing the deceased person\u2019s body, to allow fast-tracked burial and cremation, and to strip back services in care homes. People who refuse to self-isolate could be made to do so using the always contested \u201creasonable force\u201d.</p> \n<p>Our human rights protections \u2013 long maligned by many of the politicians now running our pandemic-stricken nation \u2013 were designed for moments such as this.

China has developed an app of remarkably intrusive proportions, using facial recognition to track both your movements and those of everyone in your proximity, so that they can be tested in the event you become infectious.</p> \n<p>Israel is ditching superfluous apps altogether and simply allowing security services to hack infected people\u2019s phones to monitor their movements.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has insisted on a project of deliberate racial demonisation by calling Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 inflaming what we already know to be harmful prejudice against east Asian people, including those who have suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-panic-uk-hostile-environment-east-asians\" title=\"\">shameful abuse</a> in Britain. In one of the most surreal responses to the pandemic, commentators who are usually allergic to this form of social justice have belatedly discovered the concept of reparations \u2013 not for the genocidal abuses committed by Europeans over the centuries, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattwridley/status/1239627378307055616\" title=\"\">for Europeans</a> from the allegedly guilty Chinese. </p> \n<p>The truth is that China has been remarkably effective at stemming the spread of Covid-19, but has done so through a heady concoction of human rights abuses and authoritarian rule, of which no one should be envious. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/12/human-toll-chinas-coronavirus-control-efforts\" title=\"\">has reported</a> censorship; dissenters put \u201cunder quarantine\u201d; a disabled child left to die when his parent was forced into isolation; and a leukaemia sufferer turned away from hospital. </p> \n<p>That doesn\u2019t justify racism against Chinese people any more than the British should be stigmatised for the uniquely dodgy leadership we currently endure. This pandemic has exposed what many of us said about the Tories\u2019 long boast of \u201crecord high\u201d numbers of people in employment \u2013 namely, insecure workers with no rights and no safety net. Likewise, we warned about starving the NHS so that its resilience is shot, creating a generation of renters with no savings, and allowing homelessness and destitution to mushroom.</p> \n<p>These casualties had already become the new normal. But once we see newly troubling scenes \u2013 people arrested for resisting isolation or treatment \u2013 we will be reminded why this could become a crisis of rights, as much as it is one of disease.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>The Trump administration is putting the health and potentially lives of thousands of federal judges, lawyers, court staff and undocumented immigrants and their families at risk by insisting that immigration courts remain open for the deportation hearings of detained immigrants, despite the threat of coronavirus.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DOJ_EOIR/status/1240124718298038273\">announced</a> the temporary closure of 10 immigration courts in addition to the already shuttered location in Seattle. All deportation hearings relating to undocumented people who are not in custody have also been suspended.</p> <p>But a rare alliance of federal employees including immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing immigrants are saying the changes are too little, too late. With 58 immigration courts still open across the country, and only 11 closed, the prospect of courthouses acting as incubators and disseminators of the virus remains pronounced, with the risk of spreading the disease to large numbers of federal employees and the public.</p> <p>A judge working out of the immigration court in Denver, Colorado, is understood to have contracted Covid-19. The Denver court is one of the 58 ordered to remain open.</p> <p>Judge Samuel Cole, communications director of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), told the Guardian that the new restrictions were helpful but not enough. \u201cThere are still hearings going on across the country in courts that need to be closed because they are a public safety hazard.\u201d</p> <p>Staff in federal courts have been making increasingly desperate appeals to the Trump administration to abide by the guidelines set by its own disease control agency and temporarily close all immigration courts. But they have repeatedly been told that hearings must continue.</p> <p>It appears that amid the crisis over the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump is putting his desire to stand tough on immigration in an election year ahead of protecting the lives of government workers and the public. The instruction to keep going with immigration removal hearings of detained individuals issued by the DoJ has come from the top of the Trump administration, court employees have been told.</p> <p>Yet the approach directly conflicts with the guidance given by the government\u2019s own disease control agency. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Seattle_Community_Mitigation.pdf\">Latest advice</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that individuals at risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19 should avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. It also says that workplaces should \u201cencourage staff to telework\u201d.</p> <p>Yet deportation hearings for detained immigrants which frequently have 15 or so people holed up in closed-air courtrooms for several hours, must now carry on.</p> <p>\u201cPrioritizing politics above all else is incompatible with the principles of due process and is a danger to the health and security of all involved,\u201d Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the NAIJ, said before the new restrictions came into effect.</p> <p>Among the 10 courts that have been closed are three located in New York City that are among the busiest in the country. Court staff have been trying for days to persuade management to let them telework from home in line with CDC advice.</p> <p>A whistleblower working in the New York City immigration courts has shared with the Guardian details of how basic CDC guidelines have been flouted every day in the city\u2019s three immigration courts. Even after the announcement was made on Wednesday that the courts were closing, federal staff were told that they had to come into work for the rest of the week to \u201cassist with an orderly shutdown\u201d.</p> <p>The whistleblower said they were relieved the courts were being shuttered but they remained angry at how the issue has been handled. \u201cAt every turn when we brought up our concerns, management has downplayed and deflected responsibility. We could have been exposed for days, even weeks.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cThere is no other reasonable explanation to risk these many people\u2019s lives other than that the Trump administration hates immigrants so much they want to get rid of them. That is abhorrent to me.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days members of the public have been showing up at the New York courts looking visibly unwell. Yet only the most basic hygiene measures have been taken, the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Security guards have been instructed to wipe surfaces clean in courtrooms and waiting rooms where suspected coronavirus cases have been present. \u201cThat\u2019s the extent of the deep-cleaning of immigration courts,\u201d the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Around the country, courts that must remain open to hear detained deportation cases are already experiencing shortages of cleaning supplies to sanitize courtrooms forcing federal employees to provide their own. Interpreters needed to translate for immigrants in removal hearings were being flown from high-risk areas where Covid-19 is already prevalent such as New York to less at-risk states, thereby potentially spreading the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThat contradicts everything we are being told by health experts and the CDC,\u201d said Judge Amiena Khan, NAIJ\u2019s executive vice-president. \u201cHow in God\u2019s name is flying interpreters around the country helping to combat this global pandemic?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week the unions and professional bodies of immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing undocumented clients issued a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6811831-Immigration-Letter.html\">joint statement</a> calling for the immediate suspension for up to a month of all of the nation\u2019s 68 immigration courts. The groups called the measures taken so far \u201cwoefully insufficient \u2026 The DOJ is failing to meet its obligations to ensure a safe and healthy environment within our immigration courts.\u201d</p> <p>Federal employees are being asked to make unconscionable choices, as illustrated by the battles waged in the New York courts. The whistleblower personally has a respiratory condition that means that were they to contract the virus they could be in mortal danger.</p> <p>Numerous requests to telework from home had been turned down, forcing the whistleblower to travel into court every day on the New York subway \u2013 a perilous exercise in itself. Yet they feel unable to disobey because if they lost their job they would also lose healthcare coverage which would make them all the more vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cThe choice that all of us federal employees are being presented is you come to work and you get healthcare coverage or you start taking days off and your supervisor doesn\u2019t like it and you risk being fired without healthcare coverage,\u201d they said.</p>",

The response not only has to be big and bold, it also has to be coordinated. Yet the international community went into this crisis with a row between two of the biggest oil producers \u2013 Russia and Saudi Arabia \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\">driving down the cost of crude</a>, and China and the US embroiled in a trade war. The pandemic has highlighted the need to work together for both public health and economic stability reasons.</p> \n<p>Sadly, the world has rarely looked less prepared to act in concert and that matters, because this time it is not the banks that need bailing out, it is the people. Some are able to work from home: millions are not. Covid-19 is already a health crisis; it is set to be an economic crisis too.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For now what should be scaring policymakers is the risk that the world economy is heading for the Germany of 1932</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A month ago, when financial markets belatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/05/coronavirus-markets-black-swan-dive-chinese-outbreak-economy\">woke up to the threat</a> posed by Covid-19, the assumption was that there would be a painful but relatively short shock. But even if countries have emerged from quarantine by the summer \u2013 a very big if \u2013 the speed of economic recovery is going to depend on the collateral damage caused in the meantime: how many businesses go bust; whether laid-off workers have reached the limit of their credit cards to pay the regular monthly bills; the time it takes for confidence to return.</p> \n<p>Politicians are starting to use the language, and deploying the policies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/17/boris-johnson-invokes-wartime-language-in-fight-against-coronavirus-video\">of wartime</a>. The UK government wants manufacturers to switch production lines to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/uk-manufacturers-regear-factories-build-ventilators-nhs\">making ventilators</a> in the same way that factories switched from consumer goods to making planes and tanks.</p> \n<p>They are also adopting the language and policies of the left: the need for social solidarity, the importance of intervening to help struggling firms, the urgency of bailouts for hard-hit industries. In a battle for economic survival the constraints of peacetime have to be ditched. When the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said this was not a time for ideology or orthodoxy, what he really meant was that this was not time for free-market ideology or orthodoxy. Just as in 1940, the size of the budget deficit is seen as irrelevant. All sorts of hitherto taboo policies become possible.</p> \n<p>Central banks have provided the first line of defence. They have cut interest rates and begun pumping money into the financial system through the process known as quantitative easing (QE). It is a sign of how the once unconventional quickly becomes part of the mainstream that QE is now seen as being a regular part of a central bank\u2019s armoury.</p> \n<p>This time too the once unthinkable will eventually become not just feasible but desirable. Milton Friedman said that governments could always prevent a slump if they were prepared to load helicopters with money and rain it down on the populace. Provided the public thought the cash didn\u2019t have to be paid back, they would increase their spending and lift the economy out of recession.</p> \n<p>Governments have always harboured grave doubts about helicopter money. It involves finance ministries ordering central banks to finance tax cuts, cash handouts or public spending increases through the printing of money and so brings into question central bank independence. An even stronger objection is that it leads to hyperinflation and ends \u2013 as in the Germany of 1923 \u2013 with people trundling wheelbarrows of worthless cash to the shops.</p> \n<p>But for now what should be scaring policymakers is the risk that the world economy is heading for the Germany of 1932, when unemployment hit six million and a failure to abandon orthodox policies led to the rise of fascism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/the-federal-reserve-cant-save-us-can-trump-fix-the-impending-global-recession\">The Federal Reserve can't save us.

It was seen as wildly irresponsible at the time and was quickly ditched.</p> \n<p>This week, Jim O\u2019Neill, a former Goldman Sachs chief economist and minister under David Cameron, said there should be cash handouts so people can feed themselves and pay their household bills during the crisis. And what did he call it? People\u2019s QE. Hong Kong has decided to give all residents a cash handout; Donald Trump wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/us-government-to-give-citizens-emergency-financial-aid\">do the same</a> in the US.</p> \n<p>For the time being, politicians are adopting a bipartisan approach to coping with the crisis, and that\u2019s entirely understandable. But at the end of the second world war the public asked themselves a simple question: if a more interventionist approach was right in wartime, why not try it in peacetime? When the Covid-19 crisis is over, as it eventually will be, they might well ask the same question.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is Guardian economics editor</p>",

  "<p>Wholesale reform of a \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cdefensive\u201d Home Office is expected to be recommended in a hard-hitting review into the causes of the Windrush scandal when it is released by the home secretary on Thursday.</p> <p>The Windrush Lessons Learned review is expected to criticise Home Office staff and government ministers for their continued failure to admit the magnitude of their mistakes and the scale of damage inflicted on thousands of legal UK residents who were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants, with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Those involved in preparing the long-awaited report, which is understood to run to several hundred pages, were dismayed at the timing of the publication, at a moment when the attention of both politicians and the public is entirely preoccupied with the coronavirus emergency.</p> <p>The report was submitted to the Home Office by its author, Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, on Wednesday, after 20 months of work.</p> <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, decided to release it very swiftly and is due to make a statement to the House of Commons on the review and its recommendations on Thursday morning.</p> <p>A leaked early version of the report seen by the Guardian indicated that the true scale of the scandal may still remain hidden because many people affected have so little trust in the Home Office that they are scared to come forward.</p> <p>The Guardian has reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/10/it-felt-like-intentional-torture-the-windrush-victims-who-are-still-homeless-two-years-on\">numerous cases of people who remain homeless</a>, almost two years after the government first apologised for its mistakes and promised to put things right.</p> <p>The report is likely to focus on the discriminatory effects of \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policies introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary, and to condemn Home Office staff for failing to treat those affected with dignity or adequate respect. The Home Office is likely to be criticised for failing in its duty to counter racial discrimination.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s review is expected to highlight the \u201clong-standing tension\u201d between the Home Office\u2019s duty \u201cto protect vulnerable people and communities\u201d and its parallel goal of controlling migration. It may also criticise a \u201cnegative culture\u201d in the Home Office and stress the need for robust whistleblowing policies, and for junior staff to feel able to speak up when they see things going wrong.</p> <p>The report is also expected to argue that Windrush was able to happen because officials had a \u201cpoor understanding\u201d of Britain\u2019s colonial history, the history of migration to the UK and the history of black Britons, and will recommend that the department better reflects the society it represents.</p> <p>The scandal arose after the Home Office wrongly designated thousands of legal UK residents as being in the country illegally. Most had moved to the UK as children in the 1950s and 70s, and found themselves classed as immigration offenders when they reached retirement age.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/14/scale-misery-devastating-inside-story-reporting-windrush-scandal\">Some were mistakenly deported</a> to countries they had left as children about 50 years earlier, and others were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">wrongly detained in immigration removal centres</a>. Many lost their jobs after being told they did not have the right to work in the UK and were later denied benefits, leaving them destitute. Many were made homeless, denied NHS treatment and prevented from travelling.</p> <p>The Lessons Learned review was commissioned by Sajid Javid as home secretary weeks after the scandal came to public attention following a series of articles in the Guardian in April 2018. Publication was expected last September, but has been delayed by a prolonged period of checking findings with ministers and officials involved in the scandal, to secure their agreement, in a process known as Maxwellisation.</p> <p>Patrick Vernon, a prominent campaigner for the rights of those affected by the scandal, was invited to Downing Street on Wednesday night to discuss the report with senior officials, but his meeting was cancelled at the last minute. He was concerned that the report\u2019s findings could be buried during the national emergency.</p> <p>His concerns were echoed by those whose lives were shattered by the Home Office. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-generation-tell-of-holidays-that-led-to-exile-and-heartbreak\">Winston Robinson</a>, who arrived from Jamaica aged nine in 1966, was sacked from his job as an ambulance driver in 2016 because he had no passport, and later became homeless. He said: \u201cI hope that the report recognises that people\u2019s lives were turned upside down, and accepts the damage that was done and the mistakes that were made. I\u2019m worried that it is going to be put on the back burner because of everything else that\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>One of those involved in researching the report confirmed the imminent publication, adding: \u201cBut, sadly, who is going to be very interested?\u201d</p> <p>Since the scandal emerged, more than 8,000 people have been given documentation proving that they are \u2013 and always were \u2013 living legally in the UK.

  "<p>For a child prodigy, learning didn\u2019t always come easily to Derek Haoyang Li. When he was three, his father \u2013 a famous educator and author \u2013 became so frustrated with his progress in Chinese that he vowed never to teach him again. \u201cHe kicked me from here to here,\u201d Li told me, moving his arms wide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/audio/2020/jun/01/computers-replace-school-classroom-education-ai-podcast\">Can computers ever replace the classroom? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet when Li began school, aged five, things began to click. Five years later, he was selected as one of only 10 students in his home province of Henan to learn to code. At 16, Li beat 15 million kids to first prize in the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad. Among the offers that came in from the country\u2019s elite institutions, he decided on an experimental fast-track degree at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. It would enable him to study maths, while also covering computer science, physics and psychology.</p> <p>In his first year at university, Li was extremely shy. He came up with a personal algorithm for making friends in the canteen, weighing data on group size and conversation topic to optimise the chances of a positive encounter. The method helped him to make friends, so he developed others: how to master English, how to interpret dreams, how to find a girlfriend. While other students spent the long nights studying, Li started to think about how he could apply his algorithmic approach to business. When he graduated at the turn of the millennium, he decided that he would make his fortune in the field he knew best: education.</p> <p>In person, Li, who is now 42, displays none of the awkwardness of his university days. A successful entrepreneur who helped create a billion-dollar tutoring company, Only Education, he is charismatic, and given to making bombastic statements. \u201cEducation is one of the industries that Chinese people can do much better than western people,\u201d he told me when we met last year. The reason, he explained, is that \u201cChinese people are more sophisticated\u201d, because they are raised in a society in which people rarely say what they mean.</p> <p>Li is the founder of Squirrel AI, an education company that offers tutoring delivered in part by humans, but mostly by smart machines, which he says will transform education as we know it. All over the world, entrepreneurs are making similarly extravagant claims about the power of online learning \u2013 and more and more money is flowing their way. In Silicon Valley, companies like Knewton and Alt School have attempted to personalise learning via tablet computers. In India, Byju\u2019s, a learning app valued at $6 billion, has secured backing from Facebook and the Chinese internet behemoth Tencent, and now sponsors the country\u2019s cricket team. In Europe, the British company Century Tech has signed a deal to roll out an intelligent teaching and learning platform in 700 Belgian schools, and dozens more across the UK. Their promises are being put to the test by the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 with 849 million children worldwide, as of March 2020, shut out of school, we\u2019re in the midst of an unprecedented experiment in the effectiveness of online learning.</p> <p>But it\u2019s in China, where President Xi Jinping has called for the nation to lead the world in AI innovation by 2030, that the fastest progress is being made. In 2018 alone, Li told me, 60 new AI companies entered China\u2019s private education market. Squirrel AI is part of this new generation of education start-ups. The company has already enrolled 2 million student users, opened 2,600 learning centres in 700 cities across China, and raised $150m from investors. The company\u2019s chief AI officer is Tom Mitchell, the former dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and its payroll also includes a roster of top Chinese talent, including dozens of \u201csuper-teachers\u201d \u2013 an official designation given to the most expert teachers in the country. In January, during the worst of the outbreak, it partnered with the Shanghai education bureau to provide free products to students throughout the city.</p> <p>Though the most ambitious features have yet to be built into Squirrel AI\u2019s system, the company already claims to have achieved impressive results. At its HQ in Shanghai, I saw footage of downcast human teachers who had been defeated by computers in televised contests to see who could teach a class of students more maths in a single week. Experiments on the effectiveness of different types of teaching videos with test audiences have revealed that students learn more proficiently from a video presented by a good-looking young presenter than from an older expert teacher.</p> <p>When we met, Li rhapsodised about a future in which technology will enable children to learn 10 or even 100 times more than they do today. Wild claims like these, typical of the hyperactive education technology sector, tend to prompt two different reactions. The first is: bullshit \u2013 teaching and learning is too complex, too human a craft to be taken over by robots. The second reaction is the one I had when I first met Li in London a year ago: oh no, the robot teachers are coming for education as we know it. There is some truth to both reactions, but the real story of AI education, it turns out, is a whole lot more complicated.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At a Squirrel AI learning centre high in an office building in Hangzhou, a city 70 miles west of Shanghai, a cursor jerked tentatively over the words \u201cModern technology has opened our eyes to many things\u201d. Slouched at a hexagonal table in one of the centre\u2019s dozen or so small classrooms, Huang Zerong, 14, was halfway through a 90-minute English tutoring session. As he worked through activities on his MacBook, a young woman with the kindly manner of an older sister sat next to him, observing his progress. Below, the trees of Xixi National Wetland Park barely stirred in the afternoon heat.</p> <p>A question popped up on Huang\u2019s screen, on which a virtual dashboard showed his current English level, unit score and learning focus \u2013 along with the sleek squirrel icon of Squirrel AI.</p> <p>\u201cIndia is famous for ________ industry.\u201d</p> <p>Huang read through the three possible answers, choosing to ignore \u201ctreasure\u201d and \u201ctypical\u201d and type \u201ct-e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y\u201d into the box.</p> <p>\u201cT____ is changing fast,\u201d came the next prompt.</p> <p>Huang looked towards the young woman, then he punched out \u201ce-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y\u201d from memory. She clapped her hands together. \u201cGood!\u201d she said, as another prompt flashed up.</p> <p>Huang had begun his English course, which would last for one term, a few months earlier with a diagnostic test. He had logged into the Squirrel AI platform on his laptop and answered a series of questions designed to evaluate his mastery of more than 10,000 \u201cknowledge points\u201d (such as the distinction between \u201cbelong to\u201d and \u201cbelong in\u201d). Based on his answers, Squirrel AI\u2019s software had generated a precise \u201clearning map\u201d for him, which would determine which texts he would read, which videos he would see, which tests he would take.</p> <p>As he worked his way through the course \u2013 with the occasional support of the human tutor by his side, or one of the hundreds accessible via video link from Squirrel AI\u2019s headquarters in Shanghai \u2013 its contents were automatically updated, as the system perceived that Huang had mastered new knowledge.</p> <p>Huang said he was less distracted at the learning centre than he was in school, and felt at home with the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d he told me after class, eyes fixed on his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to concentrate on the system because it\u2019s a device.\u201d His scores in English also seemed to be improving, which is why his mother had just paid the centre a further 91,000 RMB (about \u00a311,000) for another year of sessions: two semesters and two holiday courses in each of four subjects, adding up to around 400 hours in total.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone can learn,\u201d Li explained to me a few days later over dinner in Beijing. You just needed the right environment and the right method, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f62cadbc286aa339ca95b310d7bc904308fe3b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f62cadbc286aa339ca95b310d7bc904308fe3b46/0_42_4859_2916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Haoyang Li, the founder of Squirrel AI, at a web summit in Lisbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Haoyang Li, the founder of Squirrel AI, at a web summit in Lisbon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cody Glenn/Sportsfile via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea for Squirrel AI had come to him five years earlier. A decade at his tutoring company, Only Education, had left him frustrated. He had found that if you really wanted to improve a student\u2019s progress, by far the best way was to find them a good teacher. But good teachers were rare, and turnover was high, with the best much in demand. Having to find and train 8,000 new teachers each year was limiting the amount students learned \u2013 and the growth of his business.</p> <p>The answer, Li decided, was adaptive learning, where an intelligent computer-based system adjusts itself automatically to the best method for an individual learner. The idea of adaptive learning was not new, but Li was confident that developments in AI research meant that huge advances were now within reach. Rather than seeking to recreate the general intelligence of a human mind, researchers were getting impressive results by putting AI to work on specialised tasks. AI doctors are now equal to or better than humans at analysing X-rays for certain pathologies, while AI lawyers are carrying out legal research that would once have been done by clerks.</p> <p>Following such breakthroughs, Li resolved to augment the efforts of his human teachers with a tireless, perfectly replicable virtual teacher. \u201cImagine a tutor who knows everything,\u201d he told me, \u201cand who knows everything about you.\u201d</p> <p>In Hangzhou, Huang was struggling with the word \u201churry\u201d. On his screen, a video appeared of a neatly groomed young teacher presenting a three-minute masterclass about how to use the word \u201churry\u201d and related phrases (\u201cin a hurry\u201d etc). Huang watched along.</p> <p>Moments like these, where a short teaching input results in a small learning output, are known as \u201cnuggets\u201d. Li\u2019s dream, which is the dream of adaptive education in general, is that AI will one day provide the perfect learning experience by ensuring that each of us get just the right chunk of content, delivered in the right way, at the right moment for our individual needs.</p> <p>One way in which Squirrel AI improves its results is by constantly hoovering up data about its users. During Huang\u2019s lesson, the system continuously tracked and recorded every one of his key strokes, cursor movements, right or wrong answers, texts read and videos watched. This data was time-stamped, to show where Huang had skipped over or lingered on a particular task. Each \u201cnugget\u201d (the video to watch or text to read) was then recommended to him based on an analysis of his data, accrued over hundreds of hours of work on Squirrel\u2019s platform, and the data of 2 million other students. \u201cComputer tutors can collect more teaching experience than a human would ever be able to collect, even in a hundred years of teaching,\u201d Tom Mitchell, Squirrel AI\u2019s chief AI officer, told me over the phone a few weeks later.</p> <p>The speed and accuracy of Squirrel AI\u2019s platform will depend, above all, on the number of student users it manages to sign up. More students equals more data. As each student works their way through a set of knowledge points, they leave a rich trail of information behind them. This data is then used to train the algorithms of the \u201cthinking\u201d part of the Squirrel AI system.</p> <p>This is one reason why Squirrel AI has integrated its online business with bricks-and-mortar learning centres. Most children in China do not have access to laptops and high-speed internet. The learning centres mean the company can reach kids they otherwise would not be able to. One of the reasons Mitchell says he is glad to be working with Squirrel AI is the sheer volume of data that the company is gathering. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have millions of natural examples,\u201d he told me with excitement.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The dream of a perfect education delivered by machine is not new. For at least a century, generations of visionaries have predicted that the latest inventions will transform learning. \u201cMotion pictures,\u201d wrote the American inventor Thomas Edison in 1922, \u201care destined to revolutionise our schools.\u201d The immersive power of movies would supposedly turbo-charge the learning process. Others made similar predictions for radio, television, computers and the internet. But despite small successes \u2013 the Open University, TV universities in China in the 1980s, or Khan Academy today, which reaches millions of students with its YouTube lessons \u2013 teachers have continued to teach, and learners to learn, in much the same way as before.</p> <p>There are two reasons why today\u2019s techno-evangelists are confident that AI can succeed where other technologies failed. First, they view AI not as a simple innovation but as a \u201cgeneral purpose technology\u201d \u2013 that is, an epochal invention, like the printing press, which will fundamentally change the way we learn. Second, they believe its powers will shed new light on the working of the human brain \u2013 how repetitive practice grows expertise, for instance, or how interleaving (leaving gaps between learning different bits of material) can help us achieve mastery. As a result, we will be able to design adaptive algorithms to optimise the learning process.</p> <p>UCL Institute of Education professor and machine learning expert Rose Luckin believes that one day we might see an AI-enabled \u201cFitbit for the mind\u201d that would allow us to perceive in real-time what an individual knows, and how fast they are learning. The device would use sensors to gather data that forms a precise and ever-evolving map of a person\u2019s abilities, which could be cross-referenced with insights into their motivational and nutritional state, say. This information would then be relayed to our minds, in real time, via a computer-brain interface. Facebook is already carrying out research in this field. Other firms are trialling eye tracking and helmets that monitor kids\u2019 brainwaves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The supposed AI education revolution is not here yet, and it is likely that the majority of projects will collapse under the weight of their own hype. IBM\u2019s adaptive tutor Knewton was pulled from US schools under pressure from parents concerned about their kids\u2019 privacy, while Silicon Valley\u2019s Alt School, launched to much fanfare in 2015 by a former Google executive, has burned through $174m of funding without landing on a workable business model. But global school closures owing to coronavirus may yet relax public attitudes to online learning \u2013 many online education companies are offering their products for free to all children out of school.</p> <p>Daisy Christodoulou, a London-based education expert, suggests that too much time is spent speculating on what AI might one day do, rather than focusing on what it already can. It\u2019s estimated that there are 900 million young people around the world today who aren\u2019t currently on track to learn what they need to thrive. To help those kids, AI education doesn\u2019t have to be perfect \u2013 it just needs to slightly improve on what they currently have.</p> <p>In their book The Future of the Professions, Richard and Daniel Susskind argue that we tend to conceive of occupations as embodied in a person \u2013 a butcher or baker, doctor or teacher. As a result, we think of them as \u2018too human\u2019 to be taken over by machines. But to an algorithm, or someone designing one, a profession appears as something else: a long list of individual tasks, many of which may be mechanised. In education, that might be marking or motivating, lecturing or lesson planning. The Susskinds believe that where a machine can do any one of these tasks better and more cheaply than the average human, automation of that bit of the job is inevitable.</p> <p>The point, in short, is that AI doesn\u2019t have to match the general intelligence of humans to be useful \u2013 or indeed powerful. This is both the promise of AI, and the danger it poses. \u201cPeople\u2019s behaviour is already being manipulated,\u201d Luckin cautioned. Devices that might one day enhance our minds are already proving useful in shaping them.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In May 2018, a group of students at Hangzhou\u2019s Middle School No 11 returned to their classroom to find three cameras newly installed above the blackboard; they would now be under full-time surveillance in their lessons. \u201cPreviously when I had classes that I didn\u2019t like very much, I would be lazy and maybe take naps,\u201d a student told the local news, \u201cbut I don\u2019t dare be distracted after the cameras were installed.\u201d The head teacher explained that the system could read seven states of emotion on students\u2019 faces: neutral, disgust, surprise, anger, fear, happiness and sadness. If the kids slacked, the teacher was alerted. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pair of mystery eyes are constantly watching me,\u201d the student told reporters.</p> <p>The previous year, China\u2019s state council had launched a plan for the role AI could play in the future of the country. Underpinning it were a set of beliefs: that AI can \u201charmonise\u201d Chinese society; that for it to do so, the government should store data on every citizen; that companies, not the state, were best positioned to innovate; that no company should refuse access to the government to its data. In education, the paper called for new adaptive online learning systems powered by big data, and \u201call-encompassing ubiquitous intelligent environments\u201d \u2013 or smart schools.</p> <p>At AIAED, a conference in Beijing hosted by Squirrel AI, which I attended in May 2019, classroom surveillance was one of the most discussed topics \u2013 but the speakers tended to be more concerned about the technical question of how to optimise the effectiveness of facial and bodily monitoring technologies in the classroom, rather than the darker implications of collecting unprecedented amounts of data about children. These ethical questions are becoming increasingly important, with schools from India to the US currently trialling facial monitoring. In the UK, AI is being used today for things like monitoring student wellbeing, automating assessment and even in inspecting schools. Ben Williamson of the Centre for Research in Digital Education explains that this risks encoding biases or errors into the system and raises obvious privacy issues. \u201cNow the school and university might be said to be studying their students too,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>While cameras in the classroom might outrage many parents in the UK or US, Lenora Chu, author of an influential book about the Chinese education system, argues that in China anything that improves a child\u2019s learning tends to be viewed positively by parents. Squirrel AI even offers them the chance to watch footage of their child\u2019s tutoring sessions. \u201cThere\u2019s not that idea here that technology is bad,\u201d said Chu, who moved from the US to Shanghai 10 years ago.</p> <p>Rose Luckin suggested to me that a platform like Squirrel AI\u2019s could one day mean an end to China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/gaokao-china-toughest-school-exam-in-world\" title=\"\">notoriously punishing gaokao college entrance exam</a>, which takes place for two days every June and largely determines a student\u2019s education and employment prospects. If technology tracked a student throughout their school days, logging every keystroke, knowledge point and facial twitch, then the perfect record of their abilities on file could make such testing obsolete. Yet a system like this could also furnish the Chinese state \u2013 or a US tech company \u2013 with an eternal ledger of every step in a child\u2019s development. It is not hard to imagine the grim uses to which this information could be put \u2013 for instance, if your behaviour in school was used to judge, or predict, your trustworthiness as an adult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca518387c8a805b1342e02c9562f737014c2e46b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca518387c8a805b1342e02c9562f737014c2e46b/0_5_3872_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students leaving a gaokao college entrance exam in Hangzhou, China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students leaving a gaokao college entrance exam in Hangzhou, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the one hand, said Chu, the CCP wants to use AI to better prepare young people for the future economy, and to close the achievement gap between rural and urban schools. To this end, companies like Squirrel AI receive government support, such as access to prime office space in top business districts. At the same time, the CCP, as the state council put it, sees AI as \u201copportunity of the millennium\u201d for \u201csocial construction\u201d. That is, social control. The ability of AI to \u201cgrasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner\u201d through the surveillance of people\u2019s movements, spending and other behaviours means it can play \u201can irreplaceable role in effectively maintaining social stability\u201d.</p> <p>The surveillance state is already penetrating deep into people\u2019s lives. In 2019, there was a significant spike in China in the registration of patents for facial recognition and surveillance technology. All new mobile phones in China must now be registered via a facial scan. At the hotels I stayed in, Chinese citizens handed over their ID cards and checked in using face scanners. On the high-speed train to Beijing, the announcer repeatedly warned travellers to abide by the rules in order to maintain their personal credit. The notorious social credit system, which has been under trial in a handful of Chinese cities ahead of an expected nationwide roll out this year, awards or detracts points from an individual\u2019s trustworthiness score, which affects their ability to travel and borrow money, among other things.</p> <p>The result, explained Chu, is that all these interventions exert a subtle control over what people think and say. \u201cYou sense how the wind is blowing,\u201d she told me. For the 12 million Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, however, that control is anything but subtle. Police checkpoints, complete with facial scanners, are ubiquitous. All mobile phones must have Jingwang (\u201cclean net\u201d) app installed, allowing the government to monitor your movements and browsing. Iris and fingerprint scans are required to access health services. As many as 1.5 million Uighurs, including children, have been interned at some point in a re-education camp in the interests of \u201charmony\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As we shape the use of AI in education, it\u2019s likely that AI will shape us too. Jiang Xueqin, an education researcher from Chengdu, is sceptical that it will be as revolutionary as proponents claim. \u201cParents are paying for a drug,\u201d he told me over the phone. He thought tutoring companies such as New Oriental, TAL and Squirrel AI were simply preying on parents\u2019 anxieties about their kids\u2019 performance in exams, and only succeeding because test preparation was the easiest element of education to automate \u2013 a closed system with limited variables that allowed for optimisation. Jiang wasn\u2019t impressed with the progress made, or the way that it engaged every child in a desperate race to conform to the measures of success imposed by the system.</p> <p>One student I met at the learning centre in Hangzhou, Zhang Hen, seemed to have a deep desire to learn about the world \u2013 she told me how she loved Qu Yuan, a Tang dynasty romantic poet, and how she was a fan of Harry Potter \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t the reason she was here. Her goal was much simpler: she had come to the centre to boost her test scores. That may seem disappointing to idealists who want education to offer so much more, but Zhang was realistic about the demands of the Chinese education system. She had tough exams that she needed to pass. A scripted system that helped her efficiently master the content of the high school entrance exam was exactly what she wanted.</p> <p>On stage at AIAED, Tom Mitchell had presented a more ambitious vision for adaptive learning that went far beyond helping students cram for mindless tests. Much of what he was most excited by was possible only in theory, but his enthusiasm was palpable. As appealing as his optimism was, though, I felt unconvinced. It was clear that adaptive technologies might improve certain types of learning, but it was equally obvious that they might narrow the aims of education and provide new tools to restrict our freedom.</p> <p>Li insists that one day his system will help all young people to flourish creatively. Though he allows that for now an expert human teacher still holds an edge over a robot, he is confident that AI will soon be good enough to evaluate and reply to students\u2019 oral responses. In less than five years, Li imagines training Squirrel AI\u2019s platform with a list of every conceivable question and every possible response, weighting an algorithm to favour those labelled \u201ccreative\u201d. \u201cThat thing is very easy to do,\u201d he said, \u201clike tagging cats.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/28/can-we-stop-robots-outsmarting-humanity-artificial-intelligence-singularity\">Can we stop AI outsmarting humanity?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Li, learning has always been like that \u2013 like tagging cats. But there\u2019s a growing consensus that our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/27/why-your-brain-is-not-a-computer-neuroscience-neural-networks-consciousness\" title=\"\">brains don\u2019t work like computers</a>. Whereas a machine must crunch through millions of images to be able to identify a cat as the collection of \u201cfeatures\u201d that are present only in those images labelled \u201ccat\u201d (two triangular ears, four legs, two eyes, fur, etc), a human child can grasp the concept of \u201ccat\u201d from just a few real life examples, thanks to our innate ability to understand things symbolically. Where machines can\u2019t compute meaning, our minds thrive on it. The adaptive advantage of our brains is that they learn continually through all of our senses by interacting with the environment, our culture and, above all, other people.</p> <p>Li told me that even if AI fulfilled all of its promise, human teachers would still play a crucial role helping kids learn social skills. At Squirrel AI\u2019s HQ, which occupies three floors of a gleaming tower next door to Microsoft and Mobike in Shanghai, I met some of the company\u2019s young teachers. Each sat at a work console in a vast office space, headphones on, eyes focused on a laptop screen, their desks decorated with plastic pot plants and waving cats. As they monitored the dashboards of up to six students simultaneously, the face of a young learner would appear on the screen, asking for help, either via a chat box or through a video link. The teachers reminded me of workers in the gig economy, the Uber drivers of education. When I logged on to try out a Squirrel English lesson for myself, the experience was good, but my tutor seemed to be teaching to a script.</p> <p>Squirrel AI\u2019s head of communications, Joleen Liang, showed me photos from a recent trip she had taken to the remote mountains of Henan, to deliver laptops to disadvantaged students. Without access to the adaptive technology, their education would be a little worse. It was a reminder that Squirrel AI\u2019s platform, like those of its competitors worldwide, doesn\u2019t have to be better than the best human teachers \u2013 to improve people\u2019s lives, it just needs to be good enough, at the right price, to supplement what we\u2019ve got. The problem is that it is hard to see technology companies stopping there. For better and worse, their ambitions are bigger. \u201cWe could make a lot of geniuses,\u201d Li told me.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>As the number of coronavirus cases across the US continues to grow, everyone from restaurant owners and musicians to the elderly and those with chronic illness have been affected.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 4,226 confirmed cases, including 75 deaths. For the people who are able, there perhaps has never been a more important time to give to those in need.</p> <p>You can start by following guidelines on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/17/21181694/coronavirus-covid-19-lockdowns-end-how-long-months-years\">social distancing</a> and local restrictions for self-quarantine. But here are some other ways to support your own community and those struggling all across the country:</p> <h2>Support local businesses and not-for-profits</h2> <p>In an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, governors in at least nine states have announced the closure of eat-in restaurants and bars, while local officials have made sweeping bans on large gatherings.</p> <p>Dozens of well-known restaurants have opted to wait out this virus behind closed doors. Others are still open, and are asking the community to support them by ordering pick-up or delivery, and making sure to tip the staff as much as they can.</p> <p>Canlis, a fine-dining hotspot in Seattle, temporarily converted its restaurant into a drive-in burger eatery, bagel shed and family meal delivery service. Jessica Powers, spokeswoman for the restaurant, said the response from the community had been amazing. She encouraged anyone who wants to support the restaurant, but doesn\u2019t want this more casual dining experience, to buy a gift card and make future bookings.</p> <p>The arts sector has also been hit especially hard, with a wide array of performances and concerts canceled across the country. Theaters and orchestras are encouraging people who have tickets to a canceled performance to not ask for a refund and even consider donating further to the organization.</p> <p>Look up your local businesses and not-for-profits online, and find out if there are ways you can still buy from them or donate.</p> <h2>Contribute to local social service organizations</h2> <p>There are plenty of groups and organizations helping those negatively impacted by coronavirus. <a href=\"https://disasterphilanthropy.org/\">The Center for Disaster Philanthropy</a> recommends directing donations to free clinics in areas hit hardest by the outbreak, and also contributing to supplies of protective equipment and educational outreach initiatives about the virus.</p> <p>Those people who were already vulnerable before the outbreak will probably feel its effects hardest and longest, so the center recommends contributing to food banks. But try not to just make it a single donation, as the impacts of this outbreak will probably be felt long into the future.</p> <p>Paul Ash, executive director of the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank, said they are especially in need of volunteers in their warehouses and people who can help them open additional pantries. The food bank serves about 144,000 people on an average week, and is preparing for an increased need over the next few weeks because of the many people who are not going to work or have seen their job changed significantly because of the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThose people will probably have enough in their refrigerator for a week or two, or enough in the bank account, but they\u2019ll eventually come to a point, if this is anything like the financial crisis in 07, 08, they\u2019ll come to a point where they are willing to avail themselves to a free bag of groceries from the food bank,\u201d said Ash.</p> <h2>Donate blood</h2> <p>With thousands of blood drives across the country canceled because of the outbreak, the American Red Cross and America\u2019s Blood Centers announced on Tuesday that the US is facing a \u201csevere blood shortage\u201d. The organizations encouraged anyone who is healthy and eligible to give blood or platelets, to <a href=\"https://americasblood.org/for-donors/find-a-blood-center/\">make an appointment</a> to donate through the Red Cross.</p> <p>The Red Cross\u2019s leaders said they are taking additional steps to keep all donors safe, including checking the temperature of staff and donors and having plenty of hand sanitizer available.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand why people may be hesitant to come out for a blood drive but want to reassure the public that blood donation is a safe process, and that we have put additional precautions in place at our blood drives to protect the health of safety of our donors and staff,\u201d Gail McGovern, president and chief executive officer, American Red Cross, said in a statement.</p> <h2>Reach out to family and friends</h2> <p>Simply reaching out to those most severely affected by coronavirus can be a big help in such a turbulent time. For people older than 60 years and those with chronic illness or weakened immune systems, the virus can cause very severe issues.</p> <p>These people may be stuck in their homes and need food deliveries, or simply looking for some emotional support.</p> <p>But don\u2019t stop there. Everyone is in the middle of a global pandemic. Staying connected with others through the many virtual tools at our disposal can be key to getting through this outbreak as unscathed as possible.</p>",
  "<p>With an N-95 mask on and fully sanitized hands, Denise Alexander walked up to a grey house in Kirkland, Washington, and dropped off four bags filled with everything from eggs and canned chicken to toilet paper and a bottle of all-purpose cleaner.</p> <p>Inside was a mother and her seven-year-old daughter who had just been diagnosed with coronavirus. Alexander said they had already been struggling, ever since local schools were closed and the woman\u2019s daughter could no longer access the free meals provided there. But after their diagnosis and spending time in hospital, they were both in home quarantine and in need of more urgent help.</p> <p>Alexander, 36, from Seattle, left the supplies at the front door \u2013 enough to last them four days at least \u2013 and then, from her car, emailed the family to say it was safe for them to come out.</p> <p>This is the system Alexander has rapidly developed and deployed over the last week, since launching the Facebook group \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/613696842807305/\">Quarantined, I need help!</a>\u201d.

But, she said, given that there are many who can\u2019t afford delivery services, it has also been to help encourage more people to stay inside.</p> <p>\u201cIf my kids were starving to death right now and I was in quarantine, even if I went to jail for it, I cannot say that I would not get them food,\u201d said Alexander.</p> <p>\u201cI know a lot of people feel that way, so I don\u2019t want it to come to that,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Alexander and her team of volunteers are some of the many community members in Washington state, and across the US, who have responded to the coronavirus outbreak by seeking out the most vulnerable and offering assistance in whatever form they can.</p> <p>There\u2019s the barista in Seattle who started hosting free weekday breakfasts and a consultant and career coach offering pro-bono virtual strategy sessions to not-for-profit groups who have seen their fundraising events canceled.

He also recently announced that all kindergarten through 12th grade public and private schools in Washington would be closed for at least six weeks.</p> <p>Tricia Diamond, who lives in Seattle, wanted to help make sure these students don\u2019t fall behind or lose their academic footing, and also continue to have some kind of educational stability in their lives. On Tuesday, the former aerospace engineer turned teacher started offering free online classes.</p> <p>The courses, which are open to students from kindergarten through 12th grade based anywhere in the country, are presented through YouTube Live and Skype. They include everything from Dutch and world history to algebra and physics.

Started about two weeks ago, the sessions last an hour and are held over Zoom, a video conferencing service.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd3bc278364ce5616ca2993d29092fab0ef06bea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd3bc278364ce5616ca2993d29092fab0ef06bea/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Eileen Dey Wurst hosts a free virtual sharing circle and healing meditation using Zoom video conferencing at her home.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wurst hosts a session at her Seattle home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jovelle Tamayo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to read the news and to even connect online through social media, but it\u2019s another to have a space where you can connect online, but you\u2019re in real-time and you\u2019re sharing what it is you\u2019re going through,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>During a session on Sunday evening, she asked each of the five participants, who could be seen through a small rectangle at the top of the screen, to tell the group about their experiences over the past week and how they were feeling.</p> <p>One woman mentioned feeling like a wave, with a lot of highs and lows, while a man who works for Microsoft talked about a sense of underlying stress and his effort to live day-to-day.</p> <p>Jodi Wheeler, 56, said she had been more hopeful lately as she had seen local leaders taking steps towards addressing this outbreak.

It might be universal income. It might be a global blueprint for how to react more nimbly to a future outbreak. Then again it might just be the website Netflix Party. And if that\u2019s the case, then maybe that isn\u2019t so bad.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\">Netflix Party</a> is a Chrome extension that allows users to chat while they watch the same film at the same time. You log in, share a viewing link with friends, choose one person to be in charge of picking what you watch and, as your chosen show plays out in the bulk of the screen, a chatroom pops up on the right-hand side. You can discuss the show with the people in your room, or argue, or flirt, or veer wildly off-tangent because you\u2019ve realised that you\u2019ve picked an absolute dud to watch.</p> <p>Right now, Netflix Party feels absolutely necessary. Self-quarantine has atomised us, and if this is the closest we can get to watching films and TV shows with our friends, then we\u2019ll grab it with both hands. But then again, even if this wasn\u2019t a time of enormous struggle, Netflix Party would be a terrific idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c72ed09a520f1ccf55f7d19a7e00681d592499e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c72ed09a520f1ccf55f7d19a7e00681d592499e0/40_41_1257_855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Because the biggest downside to this vast glut of non-linear content is that nobody watches the same thing at the same time any more. There are no more water cooler series, because everyone at the water cooler has to tiptoe around the fact that they might be a few episodes ahead of everyone else, and one stray spoiler slip might ruin it for everyone else. Television has always been a social pursuit, but this element has been lost in recent years.</p> <p>Netflix Party isn\u2019t a perfect remedy \u2013 take it from a decade-long liveblog veteran, watching and typing at the same time isn\u2019t ideal \u2013 but it comes close. In the past I\u2019ve tried watching films with faraway loved ones over the phone, and it was always a nightmare of botched schedules and mistimed cues. It was far more trouble than it was worth. But having an in-vision chatroom connected by a centrally controlled show makes things so much easier. It\u2019s such a good idea that I wish it had existed a few years ago.</p> <p>Imagine watching the penultimate Breaking Bad episode at the same time as a group of friends, all reacting in real time to every sucker-punch moment. Imagine watching the Red Wedding. Imagine watching the Fyre Festival documentary, for crying out loud. The Evian anecdote alone would melt the internet.</p> <p>There\u2019s so much about Netflix Party to get excited about. Especially now, when we\u2019re all a few days away from going stir crazy from staring at the same four walls all day, this feels like a great gulp of clean oxygen. Sure, the novelty will probably wear off before long, just like it has with every other social network going. Semi-professional Netflix Party trolls might pop up, or Netflix Party influencers who\u2019ve been paid on the sly to artificially increase the popularity of, say, Narcos.</p> <p>But right now there\u2019s something pleasingly pure about Netflix Party. It\u2019ll never beat the enjoyment of watching a show with a big group of friends in the same room, but it\u2019s the best any of us can do right now. It\u2019s a lifesaver.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s day three of my self-isolation. I returned to Aotearoa New Zealand on Monday night from a long-planned family wedding in Australia, itself book-ended by apocalyptic circumstance.

  "<p>The Reserve Bank is expected to push the button on Thursday on the emergency monetary policy of so-called quantitative easing (QE) to support the economy amid the coronavirus crisis.</p> <h2>What is quantitative easing?</h2> <p>It sounds very technical but it boils down to the RBA printing money to pump funds through the financial system. The bank will do this by buying up government bonds and other financial assets from banks and pensions funds, thereby flooding the system with liquidity. The hope is that the financial institutions will use the extra funds to increase lending to households and businesses. It\u2019s often referred to as a \u201cmoney printing scheme\u201d although the actual funds used to buy the bonds etc are created and exist electronically and not printed notes.</p> <h2>Why is the RBA doing this?</h2> <p>The financial system is under severe pressure as a result of the virus-driven shutdown of the global economy. Just like businesses and households facing loss of trade and wages, the financial system needs money to keep it going. Central banks normally ease this by lowering interest rates but the RBA, like every other major central bank in the world, has already cut them as low as they can go. They have, in the words of many commentators, run out of ammo and the only option is QE.</p> <h2>How much does it involve?</h2> <p>We don\u2019t know yet how much money the RBA is going to create with its version of QE but it will run into billions of dollars. When the Bank of England started the scheme in the GFC, it racked up \u00a3375bn (A$750bn) over three years before it stopped in late 2012. The US Federal Reserve reached US$4.5tn in its first five years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/australian-government-plans-coronavirus-safety-net-package-as-fresh-rate-cut-tipped\">Australian government plans coronavirus 'safety net' package as fresh rate cut tipped</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Does it work?</h2> <p>QE, which was used in the US, UK, Europe and Japan to combat the impact of the global financial crisis, is widely regarded as having saved the world economy from collapse.</p> <h2>Sounds too good to be true. What\u2019s the downside?</h2> <p>That\u2019s right. Many people have warned for years that QE \u2013 which is still being used in the eurozone and was only recently wound up in the US and UK \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/21/quantitative-easing-lord-macpherson-qe\">should have been wrapped up years ago</a>. It was only ever intended as an emergency measure but, with markets flooded for a decade with the cheapest money of all time, the world economy has effectively doubled down on the debt addiction that caused the GFC in the first place. By keeping QE going for so long \u2013 and by keeping rates so low for so long \u2013 central banks have been left with no other policy to tackle the current crisis. This has been compounded by the refusal of governments to pump-prime economies with fiscal stimulus, leaving the RBA and others to do all the heavy lifting.</p>",

When equity stakes are sold and loans repaid, this increases the net cash flow.</p> <p>The report notes a clear trend towards using alternative financing arrangements in the transport, energy and telecommunications portfolios.</p> <p>It says between 2007\u201308 and 2016\u201317, the average proportion of the commonwealth\u2019s annual investment in transport infrastructure funded through alternative financing arrangements was around 5%.

However, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the rapid growth in women\u2019s professional sport threatens to grind to a halt, seemingly as quickly as it exploded.</p> <p>There has been much consternation over <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/welcome-to-the-precipice-of-a-not-australia-with-no-sport-20200317-p54arr.html\">the prospect of an Australia without sport</a>, but in some of the commentary \u2013 from the impact on player wages to topics for water cooler conversations \u2013 it is clear whose absence is bemoaned. It appears that sport, or at least the version that counts in Australia, is still men\u2019s sport. How quickly we forget that women are professional athletes, too.</p> <p>It is worth considering how women\u2019s sport is particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, which is likely to hit Australian professional sport hard and unevenly, threatening the existence of less robust competitions like Super Rugby.</p> <p>Yet even in richer leagues like the AFL\u2019s men\u2019s competition, there is talk of pay cuts, a move also being considered by the NRL. At least for now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/afl-season-2020-coronavirus\">the games will go on</a>, albeit with tightened belts, shorter seasons and no spectators. Meanwhile, and in an apparent double standard, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/aflw-goes-straight-into-finals-after-covid-19-forces-shortened-season\">AFLW season has been curtailed</a> in the hope that an expedited finals series can be played before it becomes untenable.</p> <p>The W-League will host its crowd-free grand final this weekend, just in the nick of time. But the victorious Australian women\u2019s cricket team will be denied the chance to continue entertaining cricket fans around the world, with their tour of South Africa later this month now suspended. Add to this the doubt hanging over the French Open and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, traditionally stages where Australians embrace their female athletes as equals, and the situation for women\u2019s sport looks dire.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the WNBA in the United States is sweating, having just \u201cbetted big\u201d on women\u2019s basketball by agreeing to a new contract that will double players\u2019 salaries and provide paid maternity leave. What happens if the product that the league is banking on disappears overnight? Thankfully there is time for contingency planning, with the season not due to start until 15 May. But as observed by Marianne Martin, winner of the first and short lived women\u2019s Tour De France in 1984: \u201c[Sport] is a business, and if something is not profitable, it goes away.\u201d </p> <p>Recent comments by Prime Minister Scott Morrison suggest that the government has its hands full putting out the economic spot fires of a pandemic without adding national sporting codes to the list. In a context where professional female footballers still attract a double take, vigilance is needed to ensure we don\u2019t relegate the women\u2019s game to the sidelines, elevate men\u2019s sport alone as critical to the nation\u2019s morale, or judge empty stands differently \u2013 \u201cnormal\u201d for women, as compared to the clear result of an unprecedented global crisis for men.</p> <p>North Melbourne AFLW captain Emma Kearney recently reflected: \u201cIt will be interesting to see how the men manage playing with no fans.\u201d We might also ask: what will we learn about gender and sport during the coronavirus? Will we notice whether the \u201cwatchability\u201d of men\u2019s football games changes in the absence of crowd noise reverberating around the stands and into our living rooms, or will we reserve that critique for women\u2019s sport only?</p> <p>As Cathy Freeman\u2019s triumph in front of 110,000 fans at the Sydney Olympic Games should tell us, female athletes are every bit watchable when we choose to support them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Madeleine Pape is a sociologist and Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University and a fellow with the <a href=\"https://cescholar.org/\">Center for Engaged Scholarship</a>.

But in his latest update he pointed out that Greenland is still waiting for the test results from nine other patients to be analysed in Denmark which controls the island. Meanwhile, all schools in Greenland have been closed in line with Danish policy, he said. </p> \n  <p>Madsen added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All flights internally and to and from Greenland will be grounded for 14 days starting at midnight on Friday. The fact that local flights within Greenland will be grounded is rather significant because no two towns in Greenland are connected by road.

We have been told test results will take five to ten days. People have contacted the hospital, but for the most part they are still advising that testing is not necessary unless you have travelled. We do not know if the virus is here. I believe we have one person in self isolation who felt unwell after travelling from the UK, but again that has not officially been confirmed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reader said there was also alarm on the Falklands about the limited hospital capacity if coronavirus does hit. They said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A key concern is the ability of the hospital to cope. In total the island\u2019s hospital has 29 beds, seven of which are used for long term care for the elderly already. There are two intensive care beds. Usually if anyone needs critical or specialist care they are flown out to South America or the UK, which is clearly not going to be an option with coronavirus cases. The government raised the possibility that even regular emergency cases might not be accepted by our partners countries if their health systems are already overwhelmed.</p> \n   <p>Many of our medical staff are here on short term contracts, recruited from the UK (or occasionally other countries, we have had several doctors from Canada lately) to work for for 3 to 6 months at a time. Falkland Islanders are concerned what will happen when contracts end and if we will be able to replace those who leave.</p> \n   <p>The other key concern has been tourists coming in. Cruise ship tourists regularly outnumbering the population during the peak season. The season is coming to an end, which should help reduce exposure, but as of today there are still several ships heading here that were reportedly turned away from Punta Arenas.</p> \n   <p>Falkland Islanders are strong, resilient people, but it does feel like the Falkland Island government has been caught unaware by the current outbreak. Updates are few and far between and the current policy to follow the UK\u2019s lead feels problematic given our geographic location and resources.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Madsen writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A second person with Covid-19 in Nuuk has been confirmed. As of 16:00 this afternoon local time the shopping center \u201cNuuk Center\u201d will close, along with will bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and gyms. Establishments are allowed to offer take-away food. Grocery stores are allowed to remain open.</p> \n   <p>No one is allowed to leave Nuuk by any mode of transport (snow mobile, boat, plane, etc).

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day. And, although he did not reveal what the government\u2019s employment support measures would involve, his answers on this were intriguing. He did not dismiss out of hand the temporary universal basis income idea floated by Blackford, or Bryant\u2019s call for a handout in the form of a summer version of the winter fuel payment.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also interesting on the subject of schools. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The house should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to make sure we square the circle both of making sure we stop the spread of the disease but also making sure we relieve, as much as we can, pressure on our NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded very much like a hint that the government will announce a partial closure of schools, with some provision being kept open - perhaps for children of key workers, or perhaps with schools in childminding rather than education mode? - to minimise the impact on the NHS.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">Keep with more detailed live news from the UK here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: schools in Scotland and Wales to close from Friday</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7224508f085c6327bc2477\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ashifa-kassam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:41:47.338Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish hotels set to close as British tourists told to return home</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>British tourists in Spain who are looking to return to the UK should make travel arrangements as soon as possible, the British ambassador to Spain has said, as all hotels in the country have been ordered to close down within a week, writes my colleague Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur advice is now that British tourists in Spain who wish to return home should make travel plans to do so as soon as possible,\u201d Hugh Elliott <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HughElliottUK/status/1240044921207304193\">said in a video posted online on Tuesday evening.</a> </p> \n  <p>He continued: \u201cThe government has ordered the closure of hotels over the next seven days in order to reduce risks to health.\u201d As hotels begin shuttering, some tourists will be asked to move hotels, he noted.</p> \n  <p>The embassy is in close contact with Spanish authorities, who have made it clear that \u201cno one will be left without accommodation,\u201d said Elliott.

Just like in the old days with measles. The larger the group that is immune, the less chance that the virus will jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health. With group immunity you build, as it were, a protective wall around them,\u201d said Rutte.</p> \n  <p>The debate by members of the Dutch House of Representatives can be <a href=\"https://nos.nl/livestream/2327490-kijk-mee-kamerdebat-over-ontwikkelingen-coronavirus.html\">viewed live here</a> on the Netherlands public broadcaster, NOS.</p> \n  <p>But while Rutte insisted on Tuesday that the strategy of his country - which has banned public gatherings and taken other measures - differed little from that of other states some Dutch people have been left to wonder if had become \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDutchmen4/status/1239674291798585360?s=20\">the guineapigs of Europe</a>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">announced last week</a> that it would be banning mass gatherings after prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s cautious approach to the coronavirus outbreak was overtaken by care homes, sporting bodies and others. That came after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had last week defended its initial approach to coronavirus, saying it was aimed at creating a \u201cherd immunity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Amid a continued debate in the Netherlands, some insisted that the strategy of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 was a side effect rather than the main goal, which was to mirror that of other states in attempting to use social distancing and other measures to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of the likely peak of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>A Dutch microbiologist, Marc Bonten of UMC Utrecht,<a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/601067410/virologen-vertrouwen-in-nederlandse-aanpak-maar-nog-veel-onzeker\"> told De Telegraaf newspaper </a>that even countries opting for a total lockdown would have to work on building group immunity.</p> \n  <p>But critics including the London-based economist Jerome Roos pointed to what they estimated the resulting death rate would be, as well as arguing that countries going for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239628249367445506?s=20\">make it impossible for the countries</a> trying to completely stamp out the virus through collective quarantines</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239647484105961480\"> \n

The decision stalls years of careful planning to get people to respond to the survey.</p> \n  <p>The Bureau still has plans to send out field workers in May to follow up with people who fail to self-respond, a critical effort that aims to ensure hard-to-count groups get counted. The Bureau said Wednesday it would adjust that operation as necessary to follow the guidance of public health authorities.</p> \n  <p>The decision, made to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, came about a week after Americans began filling out the survey. The results of the census have profound political consequences -- the data is used to allocate $1.5 trillion in federal funding and to draw electoral districts in place for the next decade. The decennial census is mandated by the constitution.</p> \n  <p>Coronavirus concerns add to a pile of challenges facing the bureau. There is considerable concern that minorities and immigrant groups will be fearful of responding to the survey because of the <strong>Trump administration</strong>\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Individual census responses must be kept confidential by law. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:58:48.168Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725d988f088d7575595e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:52:12.774Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Detroit Three -- Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler -- have agreed to temporarily close all US plants</strong> to protect workers against coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The Detroit Free Press <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/2020/03/18/ford-gm-fca-plant-closures-coronavirus/2865289001/\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Ford Motor Co. said after Thursday evening shifts, Ford is temporarily suspending production at its North America plants through March 30 to thoroughly clean its facilities to protect its workforce and boost containment efforts for the COVID-19 coronavirus.<br></p> \n   <p>Ford said it will continue to work closely with union leaders to find ways to help keep workers healthy and safe, \u2018even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,\u2019 said Kumar Galhotra, Ford\u2019s president of North America. \u2018In these unprecedented times, we\u2019re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Union leaders had pushed for the shutdown for the sake of workers\u2019 health, but the move does make it more likely that auto giants will later seek financial assistance to recover from the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725b9f8f085e564ad869df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:36:23.279Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Dow has now dropped below where it was on the day of <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s inauguration in 2017.</p> \n  <p>Therefore, all of the stock market gains that Trump has repeatedly boasted about have now been wiped out.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*DOW INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WIPES OUT GAINS SINCE TRUMP INAUGURATION<a href=\"https://t.co/ryuOmteNca\">https://t.co/ryuOmteNca</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DtiBIaGX4y\">pic.twitter.com/DtiBIaGX4y</a></p>\u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7256a28f088d7575595e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:30:30.895Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trading halted again amid steep losses</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Adam Gabbatt.</p> \n  <p>Trading was temporarily halted at the New York Stock Exchange, with the Dow currently down more than 1,800 points.</p> \n  <p>This marks the fourth time in two weeks that trading has been halted because of steep losses linked to investors\u2019 fears about the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>For the latest updates on the market drop, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/18/markets-government-stimulus-pledges-ftse-dow-recession-business-live\">Markets slide and pound hits 1985 lows as Covid-19 crisis deepens - business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7252558f085c6327bc2705\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:10:46.441Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u2022The government has closed the US-Canada border to \u201cnon-essential traffic\u201d, Donald Trump announced</strong>, as the number of coronavirus cases continued to rise.

Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer at Associated Press, has been looking at how coronavirus became the latest flashpoint between the two nations:</p> \n  <p>Since the virus has spread, he reports, Trump and his top aides have stepped up their criticism of China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They have referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d or the \u201cChinese virus\u201d on multiple occasions, disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying the virus by geography.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday alone, Trump discussed the Chinese source of virus outbreak during at least two events. At a State Department news conference, Mike Pompeo referred six times to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response.<br></p> \n  <p>In a meeting with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd this all started in China?

And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it\u2019s a very accurate term. But no, I didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Shortly after Trump\u2019s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. </p> \n  <p>Pompeo responded to that news: \u201cI regret China\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct free press operations that frankly, would be really good, really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times.

But much of night-time travel \u2013 particularly on buses \u2013 serves an often low-paid but essential workforce on antisocial hours, from cleaners to NHS employees. Far fewer of them will be working from home than users of the Waterloo and City underground line. From Friday the link used by rush-hour commuters to reach the financial district will be the first tube line to be suspended.</p> \n<h2>Public access to food shops and healthcare</h2> \n<p>Only about half of Londoners own, or have access to, a car. Guidance from <a href=\"https://www.uitp.org/\">the international public transport body UITP</a> suggests that cities should plan to reduce schedules \u2013 but underlines that mobility remains an essential service, even in pandemics, not least to get people to hospital.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a5f7c7c67275e9540bc60d77f58ffd26cddd31\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a5f7c7c67275e9540bc60d77f58ffd26cddd31/0_669_5248_3149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The night tube: services are to be suspended while London\u2019s bars, clubs, restaurants and entertainment venues are closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The weekend night tube services are to be suspended while London\u2019s bars, clubs, restaurants and entertainment venues are closed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nastia M/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Safety of the operation</h2> \n<p>Although the official line being put out by senior Transport for London executives as little as a fortnight ago was that the risk of contagion was no higher on public transport than anywhere else, it appears that this has convinced neither commuters nor staff.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/thrashers/2020/03/coronavirus-newsletter/embed\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tube passenger numbers have dropped faster than bus ridership \u2013 partly for the economic reasons outlined above. The Guardian understands that since the government urged people to stay home on Monday, use of the tube network has fallen by almost 50% from its normal level, with bus use down 40%.</p> \n<p>Unions have also reported rising anger among employees who do not believe they are adequately protected from the virus underground, despite increased cleaning. </p> \n<p>The UITP said a transport system \u201chad to be considered a high-risk environment\u201d, with a high number of people in a confined space with limited ventilation, touching everything from ticket machines to handrails.</p> \n<h2>Staff depletion</h2> \n<p>Whether or not staff have been at higher risk of contagion than any other group, TfL has still planned, as elsewhere, for widespread sickness and quarantining. The numbers of absent staff could soon make full services impossible, regardless of measures imposed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/londoncovid19-zip/giv-3902KWe55k3DCr7K/\" data-alt=\"Graphic of London cases\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/londoncovid19-zip/giv-3902KWe55k3DCr7K/\">Graphic of London cases</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Enforcing travel restrictions</h2> \n<p>Emergency powers being granted during the pandemic have already made some MPs uncomfortable. Policing and tracking non-essential movement could theoretically be easily done via Oyster cards and contactless payments on London transport.</p> \n<h2>TfL revenue</h2> \n<p>Like all transport operators, TfL is taking a huge financial hit. And coronavirus comes on top of other funding difficulties, including yet more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/crossrail\">Crossrail</a> budget overruns. Tube revenues subsidise buses and other operations. Already, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has had to give up his cherished fares freeze pledge. On Monday, TfL warned of a \u00a3500m loss in projected revenues, even on just a 19% fall in tube usage the previous weeks. Now, that will grow substantially worse.</p>",
