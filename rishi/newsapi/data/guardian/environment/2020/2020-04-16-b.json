There should be a more consultative mechanisms where states sit together. There needs to be cooperation. There should be a blueprint for working together.

All countries in the region are affected and under lockdowns of varying degrees, with international travel suspended and movement increasingly prohibited. <strong>Ivory Coast</strong> has the highest number of confirmed cases at 654. </p> \n  <p>Yet, across west Africa testing is very limited, with <strong>Ghana</strong> testing about 35,000 people so far and Nigeria only about 5,000. In Lagos, authorities have just begun the first community testing to determine the spread in the wider population, as so far tests have only been conducted on people who have recently travelled into the country or who have alerted authorities to their condition. </p> \n  <p><strong>Nigeria</strong>\u2019s government is racing to strengthen a chronically underfunded health system, with only a few hundred ICUs and ventilators for its 200 million people, according to medical unions. Nigeria spends 4% of GDP on health, which is among the lowest levels in percentage terms in Africa. <br><br>Nigeria already has an oxygen crisis, with 625,000 people dying each year due to hospitals not having enough oxygen provision. In recent weeks, strikes by doctors have further highlighted the difficulties in health services, amid complaints of unpaid salaries and poor working conditions.<br><br>The number of laboratories testing for Covid-19 are being quickly expanded and health centres built with help from the private sector. But there remain fears that even a moderate outbreak could overwhelm the system unless much more is done. </p> \n  <p>The financial toll of the lockdowns on the poor in west Africa is already becoming clear, with videos across social media of citizens pleading for food supplies and money. Lockdowns have been widespread but help is incredibly limited. <strong>Ghana</strong> has been among the more proactive countries, yet most are struggling to provide adequate supplies to more than a fraction of the people affected. <br><br>In <strong>Senegal</strong>, there are fears that more than 100,000 street children, known locally as Talib\u00e9s, who beg on the streets are at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus. Many are homeless or living in squalid, congested Islamic boarding schools. Senegalese authorities say they are trying to help by providing education centres for 1,500 children. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T10:20:20.160Z\">at 11.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e982a158f08cf571cdb2071\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T09:53:31.483Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Europe still in the midst of the Covid-19 storm, World Health Organization warns</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll?page=with:block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7#block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7\">More from the World Health Organization press briefing</a>, as the body\u2019s European regional director warns that the continent is still in the midst of the storm of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs of today, Europe remains very much at the centre of the pandemic.

Maybe. <br></p> \n  <p>The US is now firmly entrenched at the center of the global coronavirus outbreak, with more than 600,000 people confirmed as being infected by Covid-19 and more than 30,000 losing their lives due to the virus.</p> \n  <p>There are hopes that the US is starting to hit a peak in terms of new infections, followed by a long plateau and then drop, which will open the way to a gradual restart of normal life such as the opening of schools and businesses.<br></p> \n  <p>Anthony Fauci, the federal government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, has expressed \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that hospitalizations from the virus have started to slow down, although the rise in deaths will lag behind. \u201cOnce you turn that corner, hopefully we\u2019ll see a very sharp decline,\u201d Fauci said. On 13 April Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC that \u201cwe are nearing the peak right now.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \u201cpeter out\u201d in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. <br></p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening?

  "<p>New Zealand has been one of the few western nations to pursue a policy of elimination for Covid-19, drawing global praise and popular support at home for a swift and stringent lockdown that began three weeks ago.</p> <p>But now as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, decides how and when the strictest measures in the country\u2019s national shutdown will ease, New Zealand\u2019s comparatively low death toll and case rate have generated increasingly fraught and personal disputes between scientists about whether the lockdown has proven too costly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/new-zealands-fight-against-covid-19-looks-successful-but-democracy-is-under-threat\">New Zealand's fight against Covid-19 looks successful, but democracy is under threat | Bryce Edwards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ardern announced on 23 March that the government would move swiftly to implement a stringent national shutdown \u2013&nbsp;at that point no one had died from the virus and a little more than 200 active cases \u2013 in the hope of preventing the catastrophic death tolls seen in Italy and elsewhere.</p> <p>On Monday she is due to signal whether her government believes four weeks of the most restrictive lockdown measures \u2013 which will expire next Wednesday \u2013 have been enough to flatten the curve and what the next steps will be.</p> <p>To date nine people have died of the virus in New Zealand, with more patients having recovered than there are remaining active cases. Modelling used by the government had projected 14,000 deaths if the virus remained unchecked, and Ardern has been lavished with praise by commentators overseas for averting that possibility.</p> <p>But domestically \u2013 as always \u2013 she faces a harder task in convincing the country to stay the course with the elimination strategy, said Jennifer Curtin, a politics professor at the University of Auckland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"191d00d47b376ccbd6131f48f2e354aead59fe17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/191d00d47b376ccbd6131f48f2e354aead59fe17/0_155_5208_3125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk on Lyall Bay beach on Easter Monday during lockdown for the Coronvirus outbreak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk on Lyall Bay beach on Easter Monday during lockdown for the Coronvirus outbreak</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Lintott/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are a lot of people who are experts in this space in a way that we haven\u2019t really seen in other crises that she\u2019s had to deal with,\u201d Curtin said. \u201cThis is a whole of society crisis and a whole range of interest groups are offering their opinion now.\u201d</p> <p>Ardern has suggested that during the next phase of recovery from Covid-19 restrictions will be loosened only slightly. She has also pushed back at academics who are calling for a swift and total lifting of restrictions.</p> <p>\u201c[It is] commentary that reflects our success to date in stamping out the virus as reason enough to take our foot off the pedal,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cIt is not.\u201d</p> <p>Among those calling for an immediate end to the lockdown is a group of scientists who provoked controversy this week by exhorting Ardern to reopen the country. The group of six, calling themselves Plan B, have claimed that a strategy of elimination is bound to fail and would generate worse economic and health outcomes than the virus itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/new-zealand-jobless-rate-could-hit-13-even-if-lockdown-ends-next-week-modelling-suggests\">New Zealand jobless rate could hit 13% even if lockdown ends next week, modelling suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They have pointed to Australia, a favourite example of strict lockdown detractors, where a slightly less restrictive shutdown has seemed to result in a similar case rate of Covid-19 to New Zealand\u2019s \u2013&nbsp;though that conclusion has been disputed by a number of other scientists.</p> <p>\u201cProlonged lockdown is likely to cause greater harm than the virus to the nation\u2019s long-term health and well-being, social fabric, economy and education,\u201d said Simon Thornley, a public health lecturer at the University of Auckland, in a statement on behalf of the group. He added that New Zealand\u2019s health system had \u201cspare capacity\u201d to deal with Covid-19, unlike in more populous countries.</p> <p>Echoing the group, the leader of New Zealand\u2019s parliamentary opposition, Simon Bridges, wistfully referred this week to the takeaway coffees and haircuts Australians are permitted to access. New Zealanders can only leave their homes to walk, buy groceries or see a doctor.</p> <p>An editorial published by the group \u2013 which appeared to have sparked Ardern\u2019s remarks on Tuesday \u2013 generated a backlash on social media where users said their proposition would condemn to death the elderly and those in ill health.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced the level of vitriol that occurred over this,\u201d Thornley said. </p> <p>Siouxsie Wiles, an associate professor in microbiology at the University of Auckland who has been a prominent government adviser during the crisis, accused Thornley and his group of \u201ccherry-picking and misrepresenting evidence to support their position\u201d. An article she wrote <a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/15-04-2020/siouxsie-wiles-about-those-cries-of-over-reaction-on-nzs-covid-19-response/\">rebutting their points</a> also generated a tirade of social media abuse \u2013 this time against her.</p> <p>\u201cAt the heart of Plan B is the belief that those who are more likely to die from Covid-19 should self-isolate so that the rest of us can get back to our normal daily activities,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThis sounds awfully like the UK\u2019s original herd immunity strategy and look how that turned out.\u201d</p> <p>No one would argue that the lockdown was not harmful to the economy but there was evidence from other countries that it was the \u201cleast worst option\u201d, she said.</p> <p>More than 60 academics from Auckland university\u2019s population health school<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/Jamienzherald/status/1250585697259569152\"> signed a letter </a>on Thursday saying they backed the government\u2019s elimination strategy.</p> <p>Nick Wilson, a public health professor at the University of Otago, said scientists using their authority to suggest the economy should be reopened immediately were being \u201cirresponsible in a time of such crisis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNormally it wouldn\u2019t matter much, duelling academics,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in a national emergency, which is what this is, if people are coming up and saying the government\u2019s strategy is wrong, it is irresponsible not to back this with some very thoughtful work.\u201d</p> <p>For his part Thornley is taken aback at the exhortations for him to be quiet. \u201cI\u2019m getting that sense that I\u2019m out of order asking these questions, but to be quite frank these are probably the biggest policy decisions the government will make in my lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be helpful. I could have not said anything and I would have been having an easier time.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

Summarising what it concluded, he told journalists:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>But, Sage also say that it is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some settings, infections are still likely to be increasing.</p> \n   <p>Sage assess that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community.</p> \n   <p>That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other person</p> \n   <p>But, overall, we still don\u2019t have the infection rate down as far as we need to.</p> \n   <p>As in other countries, we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes.</p> \n   <p>In sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>That would threaten a second peak of the virus, and substantially increase the number of deaths.</p> \n   <p>It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab refused repeated invitations to speculate on how or when the lockdown measures might be relaxed, but he came close to confirming that they would be eased in stages when he said there might be a \u201ctransition\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been very clear that we will take the right decisions at the right moments based on the evidence. And they may well involve a transition out of the current measures. And, of course, they could be calibrated in different ways.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that Boris Johnson\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/19/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-london-lockdown-williamson-refuses-to-rule-out-government-putting-london-in-lockdown-by-weekend?page=with:block-5e73a9278f085c6327bc3389#block-5e73a9278f085c6327bc3389\"> claim on 19 March that the UK would be able to \u201cturn the tide\u201d in the fight against coronavirus within 12 weeks </a>was still realistic. Raab said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak and I think that, broadly, is still the outline.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(Presumably, then, this would be another transition period that No 10 would hope to be over by the end of 2020.)</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab said five tests would be used to decide when it was safe to start relaxing the lockdown. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First, we must protect the NHS\u2019s ability to cope ...</p> \n   <p>Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.</p> \n   <p>Third, we need to have reliable data from Sage showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.</p> \n   <p>Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.</p> \n   <p>Fifth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab said that lifting the lockdown now would harm the economy, not help it. </strong>At this stage there was no conflict between health and the economy, he argued. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a trade-off here, if we get a second peak it\u2019s not just damaging for people\u2019s health and public safety, we will also end up back in a second lockdown which will prolong the economic risks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, made the same point. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the moment this is not a tension between the economy and health, it\u2019s very clear what we need to do now, which is to keep this down, stop this from coming back again, stop a second wave, which would need a second lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said he agreed with Prof Neil Ferguson that a vaccine might provide the clearest exit strategy</strong>. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7#block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7\"> 8.07am.)</a> Asked about Ferguson\u2019s comment, Vallance said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I completely agree that the way out of this is vaccines and therapeutics [medicines]. Those are going to be critically important.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance suggested that there might be a need for people to carry on working from home for a prolonged period of time. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There may be a number of measures that need to continue in order to allow [the virus] to be suppressed and controlled whilst vaccines and therapeutics come along ...</p> \n   <p>There will be some changes, I think, that will need to take place, that have already taken place, around things like home working, that are going to be important to maintain that ability to break transmission.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said that three other factors were more obviously risk factors for coronavirus than ethnicity.</strong> But the government did want to investigate further the extent to which BAME people seem to be more at risk, he said. He said over 90% of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK had at least one other disease, while other factors included being old and being male. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Being a member of an ethnic minority group is less clear [a risk factor], and I\u2019ve had discussions with scientists about this in terms of trying to tease this apart today.</p> \n   <p>This is something we are very keen to get extremely clear. We\u2019ve asked Public Health England to look at this in some detail and then what we really want is, if we see any signal at all, we want to then know what next we can do about it to minimise risk.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said that the government hoped to have a \u201ccrude\u201d idea as to what proportion of the public have had coronavirus soon, but that establishing a serology test (an antibody test) was complicated.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e9885a58f0895d83068f60f#block-5e9885a58f0895d83068f60f\">5.23pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30aa5c401bc56ab01d839a9a88b695db68076680\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30aa5c401bc56ab01d839a9a88b695db68076680/0_282_5356_3212/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab at the press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab at the press conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T17:49:37.701Z\">at 6.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9895248f0895d83068f6e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T17:34:38.547Z\">6.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has asked that people continue to make \u201cdifficult sacrifices\u201d and adhere to Covid-19 restrictions in order to save lives.</p> \n  <p>Speaking after the UK government\u2019s Cobra meeting, Sturgeon said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we were to lift any of these measures now, we would risk an immediate and potentially exponential resurgence of the virus.

the latest twist in the debate about the use of such drugs to tackle symptoms of coronavirus infection.</p> \n  <p>The Commission on Human Medicines\u2019 expert working group on coronavirus has said that at present there is simply not enough evidence to link ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to contracting Covid-19 or the worsening of symptoms. The report says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Patients can take paracetamol or ibuprofen when self-medicating for symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever and headache, and should follow NHS advice if they have any questions or if symptoms get worse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ibuprofen has previously been found to increase the severity of certain diseases, such as chicken pox, but is used to lower temperatures in conditions such as flu.</p> \n  <p>The question of whether ibuprofen could exacerbate Covid-19 was raised last month when the French health ministry recommended against the use of anti-inflammatory medications including ibuprofen for treatment of Covid-19 after reports that four people \u2013 without underlying health conditions \u2013 had taken these drugs and were experiencing worse symptoms.</p> \n  <p>In the days that followed, the WHO maintained that it did not recommend against the use of ibuprofen, while the NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/health-experts-criticise-nhs-advice-to-take-ibuprofen-for-covid-19\">came under fire</a> for continuing to recommend either paracetamol or ibuprofen for those with symptoms of Covid-19. It subsequently shifted its stance, saying that while there was little evidence that ibuprofen made symptoms worse, it recommended paracetamol instead. </p> \n  <p>At present the NHS website still says: \u201cThere is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (Covid-19) worse.

The government has always ruled out requesting an extension to the post-Brexit transition period, and it has stuck to that position even though coronavirus has made it increasingly hard to see how the UK and the EU will be able to conclude a trade deal by the end of this year when crisis management is a full-time job and officials cannot even meet in the same room to carry out the negotiation.</p> \n  <p>But, as <strong>James Forsyth</strong>, the Spectator\u2019s political editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9721728f0895d83068e908#block-5e9721728f0895d83068e908\">reports this week</a>, there has been speculation that the EU itself could request an extension of the transition. One theory was that it would be hard for the UK to refuse.</p> \n  <p>But the UK would refuse such a request, the spokesman said this morning. He told journalists:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will not ask to extend the transition. And, if the EU asks, we will say no. Extending the transition would simply prolong the negotiations, prolong business uncertainty, and delay the moment of control of our borders. It would also keep us bound by EU legislation at a point when we need legislative and economic flexibility to manage the UK response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What is also interesting about this comment is that it shows No 10 is now arguing that coronavirus strengthens the case for the UK to break away from regulatory alignment with the EU. Opposing regulatory alignment could end up with the UK having to negotiate with the EU on WTO terms (what used to be called a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit), although of course the government says it wants a Canada-style trade deal.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T12:23:39.093Z\">at 1.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9849938f0895d83068f309\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T12:08:17.732Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>EasyJet may keep middle seats empty to follow physical distancing rules once coronavirus travel restrictions are lifted, its chief executive has said.</p> \n  <p>Kalyeena Makortoff reports that Johan Lundgren<em> </em>said it was one of the options being explored as the low-cost airline starts planning for flights to resume, following the grounding of EasyJet\u2019s entire fleet on 30 March.

The prime minister\u2019s spokesman deflected a lot of questions by telling reporters to wait until the press conference this afternoon, but he also strongly hinted that some social distancing measures would remain in force for potentially months - or even longer.</p> \n  <p>Asked if the government agreed with what Prof Neil Ferguson told the Today programme this morning about how a significant element of social distancing might have to remain until a vaccine is available (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7#block-5e9800a88f08ea7431f43be7\">8.07am)</a>, the spokesman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The position of the government is that we will be guided by scientific and expert advice in deciding what measures to keep in place and that we will make the right decisions at the right point in time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It was then put to the spokesman that this implied that some form of social distancing would remain in place for many, many months. Was that fair? The spokesman replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My answer on this is not going to change at this point in time, which is that we will be guided by the scientific and expert advice. </p> \n   <p>And, to repeat - we must not undo all of the progress which has been made so far by releasing the social distancing measures too soon.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>If No 10 is saying that it will be \u201cguided by scientific and expert advice\u201d, it is worth stressing that Ferguson <em>is</em> the scientific and expert advice - or at least a big component of it. Scientists do not always agree with each other, but Ferguson is a member of Sage, the scientific advisory group on emergencies, and he heads the team at Imperial College that produced the coronavirus modelling that persuaded the government to impose the lockdown in the first place. </p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-16-COVID19-Report-9.pdf\">the report (pdf)</a> that prompted Boris Johnson to announce the lockdown, Ferguson and his team said the \u201csuppression\u201d strategy would have to remain in place for potentially 18 months. They said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package \u2013 or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission \u2013 will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) \u2013 given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. We show that intermittent social distancing \u2013 triggered by trends in disease surveillance \u2013 may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And this morning Ferguson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some form of social distancing, a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T12:01:36.360Z\">at 1.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9845468f08ea7431f43efe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/robertbooth\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T11:50:13.384Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On Tuesday we told the story of Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where the manager, Anita Astle, expressed her anguish at losing 10 of her 26 residents to confirmed or suspected coronavirus in the space of just a few weeks. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/are-people-dispensable-care-home-manager-tells-how-third-of-residents-have-died-from-covid-19\">'Are people dispensable?': care home manager tells how third of residents have died from Covid-19</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>There has been some good news since then, reports Robert Booth, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent.

But it would also require an emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing, because if measures were relaxed without a strong plan in place there was too much risk of a resurgence in cases. </p> \n  <p>Discussing whether lockdown measures could be eased after another three weeks, Ferguson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that will very much depend on quite how quickly case numbers go down, and that does require us to get on top of things like transmission rates in hospitals and care homes.</p> \n   <p>I think the other thing I would say is that it really requires a single-minded emphasis in government and the health system on scaling up testing and putting in place the ability to track down cases in the community and contact-trace.</p> \n   <p>Because without that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway; if we relax measures too much then we\u2019ll see a resurgence of transmission.</p> \n   <p>What we really need is the ability to put something in their place. If we want to open schools, let people get back to work, then we need to keep transmission down in another manner.</p> \n   <p>And I should say, it\u2019s not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some form of social distancing, a significant level of social distancing, probably indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ferguson said there were some first signs that social distancing measure in the UK may be working, with trends such as the number of calls to 999, 111 and admissions to hospital beginning to flatten. </p> \n  <p>But he said more needed to be done to ensure the UK could leave lockdown safety. He called for a \u201ccommand and control centre\u201d, and suggested that any tracing provided by mobile phone apps would have to be supplemented by a \u201csmall army\u201d of people-testing and tracing. </p> \n  <p>Asked whether the government was moving towards having an exit strategy in place, Ferguson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not completely sure. I think there\u2019s a lot of discussion.

  "<p>On Thursday we saw a rather different Dominic Raab. For every other appearance fronting up the daily Downing Street press briefing, we\u2019ve had the Colonel Kurtz foreign secretary. The full-on madman with vein throbbing in his forehead. Ready to mix it with his own shadow and now so far gone he was almost longing for the police to arrest him.</p> <p>Now, though, Dom was a great deal more chilled. Even to the point of being totally boring. He could make a more than acceptable de facto prime minister yet. It\u2019s amazing what a 7% solution of beta blockers and Mogadon can achieve. From tense and nervous and I-can\u2019t-relax psycho killer to suburban Rotarian in one very slow heartbeat. No need for anyone to run, run, run, run, run, run, run away. This was Raab as the chartered surveyor who had received a series of unexpected promotions simply by turning down every project as being too risky. That way, he would never get to be proved wrong. Dom: the Man who likes to say \u201cNo\u201d.</p> <p>There again, Raab had managed to slow down both his metabolism and his thought processes so much that he was now actually at least seven days behind the rest of the country. On the plus side, he\u2019s still got a sunny Easter weekend to look forward to. It\u2019s been evident to anyone with the hint of a pulse for over a week now that there was no chance of the government lifting any of its lockdown measures anytime soon. You\u2019ve only had to see the daily fatality figures to know that. But Dom still managed to make the announcement as if it was breaking news. Perhaps it was to him.</p> <p>Mind you, Raab did hedge his bets a bit by saying that the restrictions would initially remain in place for another three weeks. It sounded as if he was hoping the prime minister might be back in action by then, so that it would be Boris Johnson and not him who would have to break it to a stir-crazy nation that the three weeks might then turn into another three weeks. And then another three weeks after that.</p> <p>Clearly the government believes the country can only take three weeks of bad news at any one time. Shame Boris rather gave the game away last month by saying the quarantine could last three months. No one should be making too many plans for before the end of June at the earliest.</p> <p>The foreign secretary had also cannily taken a leaf out of Matt Hancock\u2019s book. Two weeks ago the secretary for health and social care \u2013 that\u2019s the bit he tends to forget about and gets tacked on as an afterthought \u2013 had grandly announced his \u201cFive Pillars\u201d for the NHS that sounded authoritative and had gone down well with the public. Even though no one \u2013 not even Tigger \u2013 could any longer remember what any of those five pillars had been.</p> <p>So Dom decided to go big, think outside of the box even, by coming up with his Five Tests that would determine the basis on which the government would consider easing restrictions. Information that had hitherto been considered so top secret that neither Rishi Sunak nor Hancock had been able to share it with the nation when asked at press conferences earlier in the week. So here was Raab, playing it straight and looking the country directly in the eyes. Even if his own were half closed due to the near lethal cocktail of drugs he had injected half an hour earlier.</p> <p>First, things would have to get a bit better in some areas. Second, things would have to get a bit better in other areas. Tests three, four and five followed along similar lines. The Five Tests were literally what anyone could have worked out for themselves. At another time, it might have been a worry that it had taken the cabinet so long to state the obvious. But nowadays we have become accustomed to have \u201cbeing dim\u201d and \u201cslow react\u201d priced in to every government decisions.</p> <p>The briefing had always been meant to be dull and matter-of-fact, to lure everyone into a state of narcolepsy. But realising it had been rather flatter and more depressing than intended and that there were still no answers as to why Germany and South Korea appeared to be handling the crisis so much better, Raab belatedly tried to find a few positives. The health secretary had finally remembered care homes existed and was going to get each and every one of them to pay for a shiny, superhero Green Badge that could instantly repel the coronavirus.</p> <p>Towards the end, Raab became slightly punchier as the drugs wore off. Though he couldn\u2019t bring himself to wholly defend the World Health Organization \u2013 he might get ticked off by Donald Trump or Boris if he did \u2013 he did say that the UK might have to rethink its relationship with China once the crisis was over.</p> <p>This on the same day the prime minister\u2019s press spokesman had said the UK would be better off dealing with the pandemic without being held back by EU regulations. Hell, if he felt like that why not go the whole hog and scrub the facade of the trade negotiations and end transition now. Fantastic. The UK\u2019s answer to a global catastrophe was to go it alone. Who needed some vaccine made by foreigners? This was Britannia Unchained. Now where had Dom heard that phrase before?</p>",

Exit, the House of Karrimor. Enter, the austere and unforgiving House of Saud, a process that is somehow being hailed as a victory for \u201clovers\u201d; and the end (more laughter in the dark) of the cynical commodifying of Newcastle United.</p> <p>Perhaps it is time here for a tale of the tape. Mike Ashley: pig-headed retail magnate. Saudi Arabia: blood-stained inherited dictatorship. Mike Ashley: zero hours contracts in his sports shops. Saudi Arabia: beheaded 37 men in a single day. Mike Ashley: showed disrespect to Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Saudi Arabia: murdered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi. Is this useful at all?</p> <p>Ashley wants to sell you a cheap nylon tracksuit. Saudi Arabia wants to sell you a soft-focus view of its oppressive regime, safe in the knowledge that a mega-spending spree will provide instant distraction, thereby treating the fanbase of a great British football club as useful idiots in the soft\u2011power game. \u201cWe\u2019re getting our club back,\u201d has been a refrain in the last few days. Really? Because it looks more like something more precious is being taken away.</p> <p>In the meantime, yes, the Saudis are finally here. This kind of deal can always hit a late snag. But given the chairman of the Saudi Private Investment Fund, Mohammed bin Salman, owns a painting that cost more than Newcastle, it seems likely any hitches can be smoothed over. At the end of which the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will own an 80% stake in the club.</p> <p>You might wonder why a \u00a3300bn fund would want a football\u2011friendly businesswoman and two local property developers to own the other 20%. Well, maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re a football-friendly businesswoman and two local property developers. It certainly breaks up the row of grinning beards. And let\u2019s be clear: image, spin and reputation management is the game here.</p> <p>For now it also means this conversation must happen again, the one where a liberal-left newspaper suggests that this is not a desirable entity to own a community-centred football club. In return a small, vocal swathe of that club\u2019s online support will click into gear, warrior cells in the sportswashing immune system, and suggest that to point this out is unfair, biased and typically loaded against [insert name of club here].</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb9bf265938a6ee4bcfc95d5c6c5502491a129b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb9bf265938a6ee4bcfc95d5c6c5502491a129b2/0_0_3500_2321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To date the most common responses have included: you never mentioned Club X or indeed Club Y, who are also owned by sportswashing regimes. Another popular theme is that journalists stick up for Mike Ashley because he\u2019s \u201cfrom London\u201d (Ashley is from Buckinghamshire. Mohammed bin Salman, on the other hand, is much more of a Londoner: he does at least own a fair bit of it).</p> <p>This time, however, it does feel as though something has changed. Perhaps we are at a tipping point in this process. Because the whataboutery does actually have some substance. Newcastle may be the headline act, but they\u2019re not even half the story.</p> <p>If we really are to make a stand on this, to suggest that a regime where homosexuality is punishable by flogging (awkward Rainbow Laces day ahead) isn\u2019t a desirable guest at the top table of British sport, then that process is going to require a hasty rewind. The fact is, the Saudis aren\u2019t coming. They\u2019re already here, carried through the financial arms of the PIF like some irresistible super\u2011virus particle.</p> <p>The Premier League is already a willing host. Manchester United have a tie-in with the Saudi General Sports Authority, adjunct to their longstanding deal with the Saudi telecoms agency. West Ham are 10% owned by Blackstone Finance, part-funded by the Saudis. Saudi Arabia owns a stake in Uber, who have previously teamed up with Chelsea. By the same conduit the Saudis in effect sponsor 5% of Mo Salah.</p> <p>It is a process to which the wider world of sport has already given in. We are all Saudis now, touched in some form by the success of the 2016 national transformation project, designed to diminish Saudi dependence on oil and create a pop-up global leisure economy.</p> <p>The WWE and world boxing are on board. Even dear old moral high hats Barcelona have a commercial link with Samba, a Saudi finance company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/newcastle-expect-green-light-saudi-takeover-despite-amnesty-misgivings\">Newcastle expect green light for Saudi takeover despite Amnesty misgivings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s no secret why this is happening. Throwing money into sport is a shortcut to cultural legitimacy, and certainly much easier than keeping Amnesty International happy. The question is what, if anything, those who still have the will to see sporting clubs as a special case, a protected industry, are willing to do about it.</p> <p>There are some changes that could help. A rule against sovereign wealth funds owning majority stakes in football clubs would be a start. Some kind of genuine fit and proper test is conceivable, one that involves a clearly defined notion of moral probity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, you can already feel this collapsing. In a world where nobody is clean, where every hedge fund is connected to something grey, where even professional journalists struggle to see the difference between the harm done by leveraged buyouts and the moral vacuity of nation-state reputation washing, it is easy to fall into moral relativism, to lose any confidence in the ability to say this is not a desirable outcome.</p> <p>At the end of which Mohammed bin Salman is coming up the path in a black and white striped shirt. And the unregulated, entirely commercial Premier League has taken another decisive step down a path from which it will struggle to return.</p>",

  "<p>Premier League clubs are divided over the thorny issue of how to end a season halted by coronavirus as they gather on Friday for another extraordinary meeting to try and staunch its impact.</p> <p>Nearly six weeks after the last round of top-flight matches were played, a group of clubs have swung behind a scheme to finish the season by 30 June, come what may.

That is despite the fact that any date for football\u2019s return remains contingent upon government advice, with the lockdown of UK homes and businesses extended on Thursday for at least another three weeks.</p> <p>It is understood that as many as nine clubs are backing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/premier-league-clubs-ending-season-30-june\">the 30 June plan</a>, deeming it necessary to avoid players running out of contract and transferring before the season is finished. Such a situation is believed to affect up to 80 players in the division, and while Fifa recently made provisions for clubs to temporarily extend deals over the summer, some legal experts have advised this could be challenged under UK law.</p> <p>There also remains uncertainty inside the Premier League as to how such a plan would work in practice, especially if it were not possible to complete all of the remaining 92 fixtures before July. The plan is not among those modelled by its football department, which has been tasked with drawing up alternative options for the season to end.</p> <p>The Brighton chairman, Tony Bloom, said on Thursday he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/brighton-owner-says-pfa-must-step-up-to-the-mark-in-player-wage-dispute\">against the idea</a>. \u201cThere does come a point when we can\u2019t keep waiting but I don\u2019t think 30 June is that point,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom our point of view, and the majority of Premier League clubs, we would very much like to finish the season; for the integrity of the league it would be very good to finish it. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s talk about player contracts and sponsorship and it\u2019s difficult to play beyond that, but this situation is so unique and unprecedented every option should be looked at.\u201d</p> <p>Any proposal would ultimately need the vote of 14 of the 20 clubs to succeed. A definitive decision is not expected to be taken on Friday, however. Following the last meeting, in which the Premier League attempted unsuccessfully to introduce a collective wage cut of up to 30% on its players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/premier-league-clubs-ending-season-30-june\">this </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/premier-league-clubs-ending-season-30-june\">gathering has been billed as simply an \u201cupdate meeting\u201d</a>, with the next due to take place in a fortnight\u2019s time.</p> <p>The debate over an expedited season brings into focus some of the many competing needs at play. These include the issue of player contracts, the dispute regarding temporary pay cuts or deferrals, and also sporting integrity with relegation, European qualification and, in the case of Liverpool, a first league title in 30 years at stake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/no-artificial-means-to-end-the-premier-league-season-says-roy-hodgson\">No 'artificial means' to end the Premier League season, says Roy Hodgson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One further consideration is health and welfare.

Some categories such as seafood, frozen vegetables and processed pork have higher levels of imports.</p> <p>The Abares report includes detailed breakdowns of major foodstuffs. It says Australia exports 86% of the sugar it produces; 75% of the beef produced, 71% of wheat and 40% of dairy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/27/ive-never-seen-it-like-this-why-vegetables-are-so-expensive-in-australia-at-the-moment\">'I\u2019ve never seen it like this': why vegetables are so expensive in Australia at the moment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The numbers were based on average production for the three years 2015-6 to 2017-18 and some of these crops have been significantly reduced during the drought.</p> <p>But Abares said the outlook for rainfall for the coming season was positive. This should see production of wheat, which is generally fed by rainfall rather than irrigated, bounce back.</p> <p>The picture for rice has been complicated by high prices for water in the Murray-Darling Basin, which has seen rice farmers in the Riverina plant their smallest crops since the Millennium drought.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/agricultural-commodities/australian-crop-report\">February Abares report</a> forecast just 54,000 tonnes would be produced in 2020. This is below Abare\u2019s estimate of domestic consumption of rice of around 300,000 tonnes in its latest report.</p> <p>This suggests that there will be reliance on imports in 2020.</p> <p>Some rice growers and dairy farmers sold their high security water rights during government buybacks which were part of the plan to reduce the overall amount of water extracted from the river system. During the drought less secure water entitlements were given a zero or small allocation, which left farmers who relied on this sort of water unable to plant crops.</p> <p>In contrast, farmers growing high-value crops such as almonds or with permanent plantings such as grapes, further down the Murray river, have been prepared to pay high prices for water, which has seen prices skyrocket.</p> <p>Abares noted that some rice growers wanted governments to intervene in the water market to bolster commodities such as rice.</p> <p>\u201cAll water in the Murray-Darling Basin is allocated and so government intervention to provide additional water to a particular sector or producer would need to take water from some other use, such as reserves held to provide future town water supply or environmental outcomes,\u201d Abares said.</p> <p>The issue of water is particularly fraught in the Goulburn and Murray valleys, where farmers have been hurt by low prices for dairy and high prices for water. The National party has come under electoral pressure from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party over the impact of rising water prices on farmers.</p> <p>Water ministers have asked for their meeting with the federal water minister, Keith Pitt, to be brought forward and there is likely to be renewed pressure for the federal government to relax its targets under the Murray-Darling Basin plan for further water recovery.</p> <p>These is also likely to be renewed calls for the Environmental Water Holder to make water held for environmental purposes in the Hume and Dartmouth dams available for other uses.</p> <p>During the drought, the federal government intervened to make water available to grow fodder, but there will be strong resistance to intervening on behalf of one crop.</p> <p>Abares said there was still some concerns about supply chain disruptions \u2013 for instance, there was some concern there might not be enough refrigerated containers to export food in due to Covid-19-related disruptions to international trade.</p> <p>It also said there was a risk of labour shortages.</p> <p>Abares concluded that the risks to food security were far greater for poorer nations, because prices could rise due to the uncertainties of supply.</p> <p>Despite the coronavirus, cargo is continuing to arrive and depart from ports around Australia, albeit with rules now governing the disembarkation of crew from cargo ships.</p> <p>Crew on international cargo ships are exempt from the mandatory self-isolation requirement that applies to arriving passengers but are required to self-isolate on the vessel or in their accommodation.

At very fast speeds manual dexterity is important, and some blamed Carlsen\u2019s defeat on his using a mouse while Firouzja was quicker using finger touch.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s final was at Banter Blitz, where players comment verbally on their moves during the game. The time limit was three minutes per player per game, without the one-second or two-second per move increment which is normal for three-minute blitz. Again Firouzja was noticeably faster. He won two games on time and in another Carlsen escaped by checkmating with just 0.2 seconds to spare. While Carlsen kept up an articulate running commentary throughout, Firouzja, whose English is weaker, made fewer early comments and was usually ahead on time after the opening.</p> <p>Carlsen was the heavy favourite following his impressive 9-0 semi-final win over the strong Russian Sanan Sjugirov, whereas Firouzja had struggled to defeat the Indian Srinath Narayanan 9-6. But in the final Firouzja was sharper, continually producing tactical tricks which rarely gave his opponent the classically controlled games where he dominates.

  "<p>The leader of the UK\u2019s biggest farming organisation says she is optimistic that British workers will come forward to rescue the harvest and keep the nation fed, instead of having to rely on flying in overseas workers.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of signs are optimistic and we have really positive news,\u201d said Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union. \u201cWe are hearing people are very keen [to work on farms]. There does seem to be a real swell of support from people to do this.\u201d</p> <p>She said workers who had been furloughed were allowed to top up their income through farm work, and many others who had lost their jobs would see it as a lifeline, as well as a way to help the country through the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Workers have been flown in this week on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/romanian-fruit-pickers-flown-uk-crisis-farming-sector-coronavirus#maincontent\">charter flights from Romania</a>, despite travel restrictions and fears for their health and safety. Germany has also been recruiting farm workers by air from eastern Europe. About 80,000 workers are likely to be needed this year, leading to calls for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/20/farmers-call-for-land-army-to-sustain-uk-food-production-during-coronavirus-crisis\">\u201cland army\u201d</a> of paid workers to join farms.</p> <p>Batters said there was still time for more people to sign up, as the critical period for the UK\u2019s harvest would not begin until next month. \u201cWe will know much more when we get to May,\u201d she said.</p> <p>However, even if the labour shortages are less severe than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/uk-farmers-fear-huge-labour-shortfall-despite-interest-in-land-army\">some have predicted</a>, farmers across the country are still facing a struggle to stay in business as their supply chains have been turned upside down by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/scottish-fruit-farmers-recruit-thousands-locals-save-harvest\">Scottish fruit farmers recruit thousands of locals to save harvest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For farmers, the biggest single problem is that before the lockdown about half of the food consumed in the UK was eaten outside the home, in cafes, restaurants and pubs. Now they are closed, supermarkets are struggling to keep up with demand for grocery shopping, but farmers used to supplying the catering trade have few ways of getting their produce to consumers. \u201cIt is very difficult, if not impossible, to switch,\u201d said Batters.</p> <p>Food must meet different standards when sold through supermarkets, and adapting the supply chain takes longer than farmers have to sell their perishable produce. \u201cIf you\u2019re a potato farmer, and you sold to fish and chip shops, you can\u2019t just start selling your produce direct. You can sell some at the end of the farm drive, but that\u2019s only going to make a small difference,\u201d said Batters.</p> <p>Ministers have been slow to act, said Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. \u201cWe have heard very little from the government on how they will be supporting farmers to effectively make this transition and we urge them to look at appropriate ways to deliver a clear food delivery strategy that supports short, sustainable supply chains during the pandemic and beyond,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Selling directly to consumers remains difficult, even for farmers who have set up their business that way. Charlie Cole, a livestock farmer at Broughgammon farm in Northern Ireland, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute nightmare. Our business is completely dependent on us selling directly to the customer. So now that the government restrictions are in place, the farmers\u2019 markets and street food events have come to a close and we\u2019ve had to shut the cafe in the farm shop, which are all usually reliable sources of income.\u201d</p> <p>The cancellation of Wimbledon means its strawberry supplier in Kent is faced with 33 tonnes of perishable soft fruit with no market. Marion Regan, whose great-grandfather established Hugh Lowe Farms in Kent in 1893 with a Covent Garden stall, is now looking at alternatives. \u201cWe will find a home for them,\u201d she told the <a href=\"https://www.ofc.org.uk/OFCpodcast\">Oxford Farming Conference podcast</a>. She said she was talking to food banks as well as commercial outlets.</p> <p>The difference between what we eat at home and our tastes when eating out is also causing problems. Our love of mince is a menace to livestock farmers, who have seen the meat market collapse even while supermarkets have been stocking their shelves with meat imported from Poland. People are eating far more mince, which is cheap and comes from the tougher end of the animal, instead of the more expensive cuts, such as steak, that we tend to choose when eating out.</p> <p>As farmers need to sell whole carcasses, they are forced to sell at far below the true value. \u201cIf everyone wants mince, the carcass is massively devalued,\u201d said Batters. \u201cPeople want to buy British beef. If it has to be mince, OK, but you must balance the carcass [if necessary by mincing prime cuts] and stabilise the price, or people will go out of business.\u201d</p> <p>Coffee shops used to account for a large proportion of the UK\u2019s fresh milk sales, but when drinking at home people tend not to make the milky cappuccinos and lattes that they would buy when out.

But Batters said there was no reason for limiting the amount of dairy produce people can purchase as there was no shortage of supply.</p> <p>Small farmers were most at risk from the crisis, Batters warned, as they had less to fall back on and were finding it hard to gain credit extensions from their banks.</p> <p>Farmers who diversified, as they were urged to, into side businesses such as running B&amp;Bs are also finding those sources drying up. \u201cNormally we would make \u00a37,000 off tourism per year, but that income is going to vanish,\u201d said Polly Davies, a tenant farmer in Glamorgan.</p> <p>Batters will urge ministers at a virtual meeting on Friday to give British farmers a boost by mandating all food bought by public bodies, including the NHS and the army, to come from British producers.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has a key role to play, that needs to be recognised,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there is to be a positive legacy from this crisis, let\u2019s build a more resilient economic future \u2013 paying attention to our food and our health, and buying local food, is a key part of that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global coronavirus cases pass 2 million mark</strong></h2> <p>The total number of coronavirus cases across the world has reached at least 2,090,110, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic.</p> <p>The US has the highest number of cases with 640,291, followed by Spain, with 182,816. The number of cases of coronavirus registered globally passed 1.5 million on 9 April.</p> <h2><strong>UK government announces lockdown extension for three weeks</strong></h2> <p>The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson as he recovers from Covid-19, confirmed the extension following advice from the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage).</p> <p>Raab said: \u201cThe government has decided that the current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks.\u201d</p> <p>He said Sage had advised that \u201crelaxing any of the measures in place\u201d would \u201cundo the progress we have made\u201d and would \u201crisk damage to both public health and the economy\u201d.</p> <p>There were 861 Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals reported on Thursday, taking the total past 13,000.</p> <h2><strong>5 million more Americans sign on as unemployed</strong></h2> <p>More than 22 million American have lost their jobs in the last four weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the US.</p> <p>The US labour department announced that another 5.24 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, making a total of 22.2 million since 14 March, when nationwide stay-at-home orders led to an unprecedented wave of layoffs across the country.</p> <p>The largest number of people to ask for unemployment benefits in a four-week period before the Covid-19 crisis came in 1992, when 2.7 million sought support.</p> <h2><strong>Australia PM says more Covid-19 measures needed</strong></h2> <p>Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, said the country had succeeding in flattening the infection curve but that a \u201cmore extensive surveillance regime\u201d needed to be implemented if they were to forge \u201cthe road out\u201d of lockdown.</p> <p>He praised the extensive testing and contact-tracing system in place and the actions from states to open testing to anyone with symptoms. But he cautioned: \u201cWe need to do even better than that \u2026 so when we move to a less restricted environment, we can identify outbreaks very quickly and respond to them.\u201d</p> <p>His government has proposed a mobile app that would trace the movements of patients. At least 40% of Australians would need to download the app for it to be effective.</p> <h2>EU chief: \u2018Europe owes Italy an apology\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> owes Italy \u201ca heartfelt apology\u201d for not offering assistance when the country was suffering in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of the European Union executive said.</p> <p>Speaking at the European parliament, commission president Ursula von der Leyen said truth was needed to overcome the pandemic, including political honesty. She said: \u201cToo many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes, for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology.\u201d</p> <h2>New York State lockdown extended</h2> <p>Governor Andrew Cuomo has extended the New York state shutdown to 15 May. He also announced that starting on Friday, anyone aged two and older would be required to wear face coverings in public if they cannot socially distance.</p> <p>Another 606 people have died from the virus in New York, the lowest figure in 10 days, bringing the total above 12,000 in the state.</p> <h2>IMF: <strong>Asian economies will not grow this year</strong></h2> <p>Economies in Asia will see zero growth this year for the first time in 60 years, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. It warned that the global economy would face the \u201cworst recession since the Great Depression\u201d and that Asia\u2019s service sector in particular will struggle to rebound.</p> <p>Changyong Rhee, director of the IMF\u2019s Asia and Pacific department, warned that governments would need to take extraordinary actions as a result. Rhee said: \u201cThis is not a time for business as usual. Asian countries need to use all policy instruments in their toolkits.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Singapore reports biggest jump yet in cases</strong></h2> <p>Singapore reported at least 728 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the biggest jump yet in numbers in the city-state, which had fought hard to keep its outbreak under control.</p> <p>The latest increase in confirmed cases is 63% more than the 447 new cases reported by the health ministry on Wednesday, and brings the total number so far in the city to 4,427.</p> <p>Singapore had been praised by the World Health Organization for rigorous contact tracing, quarantine and surveillance measures, which had previously mitigated the spread of Covid-19. But the disease has begun spreading rapidly within the large migrant worker community that Singapore relies on to staff many of its basic services, highlighting what rights groups say is a weak link in containment efforts.</p> <h2><strong>Japan declares nationwide state of emergency</strong></h2> <p>Japan has expanded its state of emergency to cover the entire country.</p> <p>Shinzo Abe, the country\u2019s prime minister, told a special meeting of medical experts called to discuss the disease: \u201cAreas where a state of emergency should be carried out will be expanded from the seven prefectures to all prefectures.\u201d</p> <p>According to AFP, the declaration allows regional governors to urge people to stay indoors, but with no punitive measures or legal force the measure is weaker than strict lockdowns seen in other parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>Facebook to warn users who \u2018like\u2019 misinformation</strong></h2> <p>Facebook will begin showing notifications to users who have interacted with posts that contain \u201charmful\u201d coronavirus misinformation, the company announced.</p> <p>The new policy applies only to misinformation that Facebook considers likely to contribute to \u201c<a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/03/combating-covid-19-misinformation/\">imminent physical harm</a>\u201d, such as false claims about \u201ccures\u201d or statements that physical distancing is not effective. Facebook\u2019s policy has been to remove those posts from the platform.</p> <p>Under the new policy, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks, users who liked, shared, commented or reacted with an emoji to such posts before they were deleted will see a message in their news feed directing them to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters\">myth busters</a>\u201d page maintained by the WHO.</p>",
  "<p>The EU has offered \u201ca heartfelt apology\u201d to Italy for letting it down at the start of the coronavirus crisis as fresh evidence emerged that few European countries are likely to have achieved herd immunity as they begin cautiously lifting their lockdowns.</p> \n<p>As the World Health Organization warned that the continent remained firmly \u201cin the eye of the storm\u201d, the president of the European commission said on Thursday that truth was needed to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 including political honesty.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen told the European parliament. \u201cAnd yes, for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology.\u201d</p> \n<p>Early in the crisis, both France and Germany imposed export bans on vital medical equipment, while no EU country initially responded to Italy\u2019s call for aid via the bloc\u2019s emergency mechanism.

Von der Leyen\u2019s direct apology went further than a previous statement in which she she chided member states for their \u201conly-for-me response\u201d.</p> \n<p>As more European governments begin easing physical distancing restrictions, a Dutch study suggested only a tiny percentage of people may have developed antibodies against Covid-19, reinforcing concerns about a \u201csecond wave\u201d of infections when populations embark on a gradual return to normal life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/c19_lockdown_exit_16_apr/giv-3902mELUYEHInCAA/\" data-alt=\"European lockdown exit plans\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/c19_lockdown_exit_16_apr/giv-3902mELUYEHInCAA/\">European lockdown exit plans</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Jaap van Dissel of the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said the study of more than 7,000 Dutch blood donors found just 3% had developed antibodies against the virus.

But while some companies will see robust demand, the overall impact will be negative.<br></p> <p>She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An important aspect of the economic effects of Covid-19 is that they will be highly asymmetric. Firms that relied on social interaction or non-essential visits have had to close down temporarily, while others that can offer services remotely or by delivery have been less directly affected. Recent analyses have highlighted the different ways spending might be affected in sectors that can remain open.</p> <p>On the one hand, firms that offer substitute products will see demand increase: for example, purchases of food from supermarkets instead of cafes and restaurants; or streaming of films or television in place of cinema trips or live entertainment. But on the other hand, all sectors will suffer from falls in demand owing to lower income and increased uncertainty elsewhere in the economy. In my view, the latter effect is likely to dominate. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So what is the Bank of England doing about it?</strong> Tenreyro, a member of the monetary policy committee, explains they have cut interest rates to record lows, launched a new scheme to encouraging lending, and announced another \u00a3200bn of QE.</p> <p>That could help the economy recover, she hopes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A crucial aspect is that much of its economic impact should ultimately prove temporary: many businesses that were viable and jobs that were needed before Covid-19 will be so again after it passes.</p> <p>A key task for policy in the interim is to try to minimise those business failures and reduce job losses that would otherwise lead to persistent scarring effects.

  "<p>Ah, I see we\u2019re at the \u201cpoliticising soup\u201d part of the lockdown discourse. That\u2019s good. We\u2019re ahead of schedule: I thought it would be weeks before I would read bizarre puff pieces about the restorative powers of broth in the face of a coronavirus pandemic that the NHS is desperately firefighting with actual medicine, but no. I was naive, and wrong, and now <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/boris-broth-could-soup-speed-prime-ministers-recovery-coronavirus/\">\u201cBoris Broth\u201d is here</a>, conjuring up images of Boris Johnson poaching pinkly in a hot bath before ladling the water off into a stockpot, and ruining my lockdown for ever. </p> <p>What is Boris Broth? Well, at its core, it\u2019s just well-intentioned chicken and vegetable soup, distributed to NHS key workers by the newly formed Yorkshire-based food charity <a href=\"https://www.food4heroes.co.uk/\">Food4Heroes</a>. \u201cJust like Boris, it\u2019s invigorating, it\u2019s robust and it\u2019ll put colour in your cheeks,\u201d F4H co-founder Mandy Guest told the <em>Telegraph</em>. And yes, I wish she hadn\u2019t said \u201ccolour in your cheeks\u201d either, because \u201cBoris Broth\u201d already sounds like the sort of restorative portions the PM has been spaffing around town for many years now. \u201cIt\u2019s a sustaining tonic for those in good health and a restorative for those recovering from illness,\u201d she continued. Again, this just looks like a 2am text message our prime minister might send to someone else\u2019s girlfriend. This does not sound like an advertisement for soup.</p> <p>But then, we\u2019ve been waiting for something like this: quarantine, for many, inspires nostalgia for the aftermath of a long-ago war, and there\u2019s a very real feeling among a certain subsection of the British public (a sort of sturdy-fingernailed middle class I am nominally labelling Kirstie Allsopp Ultras) that thinks that actually, rationing and queueing at the butcher\u2019s and eating leeks all the time and darning our own jumpers for four years would be a nice lark \u2013 and Boris Broth fits neatly into that.</p> <p>Anyway, here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/boris-broth-could-soup-speed-prime-ministers-recovery-coronavirus/\">William Sitwell in the Telegraph</a>, taking time out from his busy schedule of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/31/waitrose-magazine-editor-william-sitwell-steps-down-over-email-mocking-vegans\">rolling up to vegan squats</a> in a hazmat suit to drag the residents out into the streets and force-feed them bacon, who thinks this Boris Broth stuff is the 2020 equivalent of the wartime <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolton_pie\">Woolton </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolton_pie\">pie</a>. \u201cWe have better and more ingredients than [Lord Woolton] could have dreamt of,\u201d Sitwell wrote this week, \u201cso, armed with a bowl of Boris Broth, we, the NHS staff and, indeed, the prime minister, can fight this enemy of the 21st century.\u201d Please, sir, may I have 13 ounces of sugar this week? I\u2019ve been especially, awfully good!</p> <p>Maybe we should just have a war after this. But only draft the weird 45- to 60-year-olds who want it. They can mortgage their houses and chip in for a munitions slush fund, and allotment out their gardens, and turn all the electric lights off in their houses at night and sleep in helmets; and I can live the normal life I want to, where I\u2019m allowed to buy crates of Heineken from the supermarket and go to overpriced burger bars in east London and lie down in parks without being arrested. And everyone can be happy, finally, everyone can be free.</p> <p><strong>Let\u2019s all clap for Ben Fogle and his awful ideas</strong></p> <p>We never really question how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/06/ben-fogle-i-climbed-everest-expecting-a-rubbish-dump-but-what-i-found-surprised-me\">Ben Fogle</a> managed to wiggle his way into such a key position within British celebrity, do we?

Nobody but Ben Fogle could ascend to the position of Ben Fogle by taking the bizarre, winding route that Ben Fogle took to get there.</p> <p>Latest on Fogle, anyway: he wants to harness the energy of the rapidly-getting-tedious-now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">NHS clap</a> (I should clarify that I participate in the NHS clap, broadly think it is good, and find myself oddly moved by it every time it happens, but the discourse around it is rapidly approaching \u201cWHERE\u2019S YOUR POPPY?\u201d levels of delirium, and efforts to subvert the clap away from the NHS and on to a rapidly changing schedule of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/01/thank-you-nhs-staff-clap-for-general-public-staying-at-home-video\">other nightly claps</a> \u2013 a clap for Boris \u2013 now leads us down a slippery slope where the BBC has to issue clarifications on which nightly clap means what, so we can know what clap to clap or not clap for, and I do very strongly feel we should cap the clapping at: one weekly clap) and use that to make us all sing <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/ben-fogle-sing-queen-birthday-slammed-twitter-a4415991.html\">Happy Birthday to the Queen</a> next week.

At 9am 21st April, we are calling on the whole country to sing Happy Birthday from our windows and doorsteps. Let our song bring good cheer not just to Her Majesty but to the whole nation #singforthequeen.\u201d After a fair amount of pushback Fogle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Benfogle/status/1250771614825938944?s=20\">pointed out that</a>, actually, his daughter came up with it, so don\u2019t have a go. But it was too late, and the wheels were in motion. We were, all of us, Having A Go.</p> <p>I suppose, if nothing else, our time in lockdown is a good opportunity to develop one-sided feuds with our neighbours over very trite and insignificant things, and as a result I will be taking note of anyone who pops their head out around my way to sing Happy Birthday to the Queen because Ben Fogle told them to. If they even think about taking two walks a day after that, the police are getting called.</p> <p>\u2022 Joel Golby is a writer for the Guardian and Vice, and the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant</p>",
  "<p> The peak season for airlines should have started this Easter, when millions of passengers go on holiday and leisure trips through to September. Instead, carriers around the world have been forced to ground their fleets due to travel restrictions imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>During this standstill, wider questions are occupying the industry: what steps would allow flying to restart, what will the pandemic mean for air travel, and will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/ba-says-jobs-will-go-as-airline-industry-faces-crisis-worse-than-9-11-coronavirus\">airlines \u2013 those that survive</a> \u2013 ever be quite the same again?</p> <p><strong>Immediate health-led restrictions</strong></p> <p>As Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), put it: \u201cWe are not expecting to restart the same industry that we closed a few weeks ago.\u201d</p> <p>Airlines are talking to regulators now for guidelines over how travel might resume while coronavirus remains a smaller, but uncertain, risk. Social distancing at airports and on planes is likely to persist, potentially reducing the number of occupied seats. EasyJet has said it expects to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/easyjet-weighs-up-empty-middle-seats-once-coronavirus-rules-are-eased\">leave middle seats on planes empty</a> as a short-term measure, to reduce the level of contact \u2013 a less onerous restriction while demand is low. Deeper cleaning of aircraft seems likely, and potentially the wearing of masks onboard.</p> <p>De Juniac noted that China\u2019s airline travel restrictions are tougher now than during the height of its own outbreak, to limit reinfection from abroad \u2013 and national public health authorities and governments will dictate the procedures. But Iata hopes to find global consensus on sanitary measures to enable air travel again. Screening of travellers could be necessary: passenger temperatures were taken after the Sars crisis and a comparable coronavirus test, should one become widely available, could eventually restore confidence.

Any signs of a new virus outbreak \u2013 or a second wave of coronavirus \u2013 would surely be met with far quicker measures to block international flights, rather than leaving it to airlines to respond to falling demand in the months after a virus is detected.</p> <p><strong>Public demand \u2013 and trust</strong></p> <p>Aviation\u2019s optimists talk of pent-up demand for holidays; others wonder how many passengers will want to risk a vacation abroad. Many of the last European leisure trips were for ski resorts which proved, like cruise ships, major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/hunt-for-coronavirus-victims-as-trail-leads-from-singapore-to-uk-and-france\">incubators and exporters of Covid-19</a>. The depth of the accompanying economic recession will also be a factor. Airline analyst John Strickland, of JLS Consulting, says: \u201cEven if they have the money to fly, I think people will be apprehensive. Normal summer markets like Spain and Italy, even if they wanted to receive people commercially, might not welcome visitors now.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Charlton, an aviation consultant, is also damning of the airlines\u2019 \u201ctin-eared response\u201d to the crisis by offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/rail-journeys-at-5-of-normal-levels-as-uk-stays-home-due-to-coronavirus\">vouchers rather than refunds</a> to customers on cancelled flights, in a desperate attempt to save cash. \u201cYes, passengers will travel by banking their vouchers \u2026 But people being burnt by that now aren\u2019t going to book ahead in future \u2013 it\u2019s collapsing confidence in booking.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The end of business travel</strong></p> <p>Health fears initially made companies halt work trips; now it is an expense that struggling firms will likely shelve. Strickland says: \u201cSome of those businesses will have disappeared, others have put travel bans in place, and all have discovered the joys of videoconferencing \u2013 the lucrative premium cabins on long-haul flights won\u2019t be full for a while. Whether all this is a permanent structural change remains to be seen, but even if it is not for ever, it will be a long recovery.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Smaller planes, and </strong><strong>fewer of them</strong></p> <p>Coronavirus looks to have hastened the demise of the world\u2019s biggest planes, built for long-haul: both the relatively young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/14/passengers-love-airbus-a380-but-it-never-fully-took-off-with-buyers\">Airbus A380</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/23/boeings-747-production-scaled-back-airbus\">Boeing 747-400</a>, the original jumbo, were on their way out anyway. Both models were among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/norwegian-airlines-shares-plummet-as-coronavirus-hammers-travel-sector\">first to be grounded</a> this year as demand fell.</p> <p>German carrier Lufthansa has announced it would be permanently axing half its modern A380s, and retiring a similar number of its 747s early. Charlton thinks it is just the start: \u201cYou will never see a 747 flying again, and the only A380s will have Emirates painted on the side.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Is the environmental gain permanent?</strong></p> <p>Coronavirus has meant a bigger instant fall in emissions than any green campaigner could have dared to dream. Many now demand that state bailouts of bankrupt carriers should have environmental conditions attached.</p> <p>Iata has said the industry remains committed to green targets \u2013 but airlines may be more reluctant to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/british-airways-offset-domestic-flight-emissions-from-next-year\">proclaim net</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/10/british-airways-offset-domestic-flight-emissions-from-next-year\">-zero ambitions</a> or invest in sustainable jet fuel plants. Already the UN-backed global offsetting scheme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airlines-lobby-to-rewrite-carbon-deal-due-to-coronavirus\">Corsia, could face renegotiation</a>. And while bigger carriers will jettison older planes, they may also decide to defer orders, as easyJet has done for part of a \u00a34.5bn Airbus contract, to bring in new, lower-emitting aircraft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Will air travel get more expensive?</strong></p> <p>Analysis by US-based Dollar Flight Club, based on patterns after previous crises, predicts average fare falls of 35% through 2021, but for prices to then double by 2025.</p> <p>Flights will get cheaper as airlines desperately try to sell tickets \u2013 and then rise substantially as capacity falls, Charlton believes. \u201cIn the short term, the Ryanairs of this world are going to bomb the market with cheap seats to get revenues to survive. Others will try to match that and will collapse.\u201d Capacity will then fall and fares rise, as supply is squeezed.</p> <p>The widespread industry consensus is that there will be fewer airlines as the industry consolidates via mergers, takeovers and bankruptcies. Iata has warned of mass insolvencies should the grounding persist beyond May. Already, airlines would have started summer schedules \u2013 meaning fuller, far more profitable flights. Instead, Iata said this week it now expects to lose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-outbreak-could-cost-worlds-airlines-up-to-314bn\">more than half its annual revenues</a> in 2020, a $314bn (\u00a3249bn) decline.</p> <p>Strickland says: \u201cAirlines are going to fall by the wayside. I feel sadly sure that aviation is going to be much smaller.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Flooding events that now occur in America once in a lifetime could become a daily occurrence along the vast majority of the US coastline if sea level rise is not curbed, according to a new study that warns the advancing tides will \u201cradically redefine the coastline of the 21st century\u201d.</p> <p>The research finds major cities such as Honolulu, New Orleans and Miami will become increasingly vulnerable to elevated high tides and stronger storms fueled by the global heating caused by human activity. Beach and cliff erosion will exacerbate this situation.</p> <p>The accelerating pace of sea level rise means that by the end of the century floods currently considered once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years or so, will become a daily high tide occurrence for more than 90% of the coastal locations assessed by researchers from the US government, the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Hawaii.</p> <p>Within 30 years from now, these now-rare flooding events will become annual occurrences for more than 70% of the locations along the US coast according to the research <a href=\"https://nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62188-4\">published in Scientific Reports</a>. This scenario threatens huge, multibillion-dollar damages and, potentially, the viability of some coastal communities.</p> <p>\u201cIf future sea-level rise causes once extreme but rare floods to occur frequently then \u2026 this may render some parts of the US coastline uninhabitable,\u201d said Sean Vitousek, a scientist at the US Geological Survey.</p> <p>The disruption caused by frequent flooding will threaten the habitability of much of the US coastline as it is already widely projected to do to many low-lying islands in the Pacific, Vitousek added.</p> <p>The paper uses an analysis of extreme water levels across more than 200 tide gauges along the US coastline, along with models of future sea level rise that depend on the amount of heat-trapping gases countries pump into the atmosphere through power generation, transportation and other activities.</p> <p>While small changes in the level of the sea may seem inconsequential, the researchers found that 5-10cm of sea level rise can double the chances of flooding, with most coastal locations around the US experiencing a doubling of extreme flooding events every decade this century.</p> <p>Global sea levels have increased by <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level\">bout eight inches on average since 1880</a>, although some places along the US coast have experienced higher rates than this. The seas are expected, on average, to rise by at least another foot by the end of the century even if emissions are constrained. This will be higher in some regions and much will depend on the pace of melting at the two great ice sheets, in Greenland and Antarctica.</p>",

Here is my collection:\u201d \u2013 Chas Tuchel.</p> <p>\u201cThe favourite game my team lost (Fiver letters passim)? Reading\u2019s 1982-83 season was an extraordinary piece of performance art, in which an actually pretty good side somehow contrived to get relegated with 53 points. The undoubted highlight was the away match at Doncaster. Two-all after 10 minutes, 5-3 at half-time, it ended 7-5 to the hosts, with Kerry Dixon scoring four in a losing cause. The whole game was like the last five minutes of lunch football at school, with no midfield and sufficient chances that both teams\u2019 scores could have been doubled. All it needed was a tannoy announcement of \u2018next goal wins\u2019 on 89 minutes\u201d \u2013 Nick Reed.</p> <p>\u201cMay I offer this from 11 October 1969? It was the American Soccer League play-off between my Rochester Lancers and the Syracuse Scorpions, from just down Interstate 95. We had finished tied for first in the Northern division, and met in Aquinas Stadium, a concrete relic of the 1950s heyday of high-school gridiron. I snuck my 17-year-old self under the fence and sat among a large contingent of, primarily, Italian fans. The match was feisty, to say the least, as a fair number of Syracuse players had previously played for the Lancers. The referee had his hands full and the degree to which the match descended in quality was being matched by the rising passion of the spectators. When the portly gentleman next to me pulled out a knife with a 10-inch blade and began waving it about while those around him cheered him on, I knew I was not in Kansas any more. We lost 2-1, with the referee and linesmen sprinting to their cars as fans stormed the pitch. The wooden stakes that served as corner flags also served a couple of fans as convenient cudgels with which to hammer on their cars as they made their getaway. I had never experienced anything like it.

  "<p>Healthcare workers should be screened for Covid-19 every week to protect patients from asymptomatic infection, the head of the Francis Crick Institute\u2019s testing facility has said. </p> \n<p>The call comes amid concerns that hospitals are becoming hotspots for disease transmission and evidence that a significant fraction of those infected show few or no symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor all our fuss about social distancing we\u2019re ignoring one of the main routes of infection in front of our eyes,\u201d said Prof Charles Swanton, who is leading the testing effort at the institute in London. \u201cIt\u2019s almost untenable to argue you shouldn\u2019t be screening and isolating healthcare workers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The institute is next week launching a pilot to screen staff at University College hospital to identify asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, but the approach has not been explicitly endorsed by the government and there have been no indications that this is being considered as a national strategy.</p> \n<p>The institute\u2019s testing lab has capacity to run 3,000 tests a day, so would be capable of running a screening operation for staff at UCH, if this approach were adopted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A possible concern is that screening could lead to large numbers of doctors and nurses, who are otherwise well, being required to self-isolate. But the alternative \u2013 leaving asymptomatic, but potentially infectious staff on the wards \u2013 runs contrary to the principle of \u201cdo no harm\u201d, Swanton said.</p> \n<p>Patients were very aware of the risk, he added, and were staying at home due to justified fears that they could contract the virus by attending hospitals or seeing GPs. \u201cThey\u2019re too scared to go to hospital and you can understand why,\u201d Swanton said.</p> \n<p>The situation appears to be causing fewer emergency calls from people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-concern-heart-attack-stroke-patients-delay-seeking-help\">who have suffered strokes or heart attacks</a>, potentially fuelling the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-pushes-england-death-rate-to-highest-level-ever\">rise in non-coronavirus deaths</a> seen in figures released this week.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

  "<h2>Sports Team</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/27/sports-team-the-indie-stars-romanticising-middle-england\">The London indie-pop band</a> were recording at a studio in Devon when lockdown began</em></p> <p><strong>Al Greenwood (drummer): </strong>Our debut album should have been out last Friday, but when we realised we had to push everything back, we decided to go to a studio in Devon and start writing again. We were there for 10 days before lockdown and then had to make a tough decision: prioritise the band or be with our loved ones. Ultimately, we agreed on being in the studio indefinitely. I think the situation brought out a new side in us. There\u2019s a tendency for everyone to be constantly joking, but it forced us to be more considerate and open. But then we were told we had to leave. Now, there\u2019s complete uncertainty and we\u2019re all in different parts of the country, trying to make a music video.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll manage being in different places. Some vinyl records need to be signed by all six of us. The sheer logistics of trying to organise that \u2026 Our fanbase is super-engaged, so we\u2019re trying to find means of maintaining that connection that isn\u2019t, like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re on Instagram Live again today.\u201d We have a WhatsApp group where fans can share stories \u2013 stuff like that spurs you on. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f21989c610f8bbd2dd10062d04733b843b4c9e83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f21989c610f8bbd2dd10062d04733b843b4c9e83/0_137_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Armon-Jones (left) with Maxwell Owin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Armon-Jones (left) with Maxwell Owin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Joe Armon-Jones</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/one-to-watch-joe-armon-jones\">The jazz keyboardist lives in London</a> with the producer Maxwell Owin</em></p> <p>Maxwell and I have been trying to make some music together for ages. We rarely have a week where we\u2019re both at home, so now it\u2019s easy. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people posting about the pressure to be creative, but that pressure is always there. People just distract themselves by doing things like gigs and touring.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been working with beats rather than live drums. I wouldn\u2019t be able to record an album like [Jones\u2019s 2018 release] Starting Today because that requires me to be in a room with a lot of musicians, playing together. That can\u2019t really happen at the moment, and that upsets me. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how lockdown affects UK jazz. A lot of music is created for dancefloors \u2013 that music is going to change probably. If the lockdown goes on long enough, music will naturally adapt to the setting that people are in. I\u2019m not sure that all of the musical scenes will make it through this time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b1c7aebe938d9aed124ed83a8af594b95c995f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b1c7aebe938d9aed124ed83a8af594b95c995f2/0_0_2316_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eris Drew and Octo Octa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eris Drew (left) and Octo Octa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Octo Octa and Eris Drew</h2> <p><em>The DJs and producers</em><em> live in rural New Hampshire with their partner, Brooke</em></p> <p><strong>Drew: </strong>We\u2019re in a log cabin, surrounded by trees and a river. It\u2019s beautiful. We\u2019re all trans here and we\u2019re in a relationship: me, Maya and our partner, Brooke, so we look after each other. I\u2019m the most scared for my friends who are alone. When I first came out and I was trying to be a woman and exist in public spaces, the only places I got validation for who I was, at first, were within the very small dance music community. So if the only people who use correct pronouns and see your struggle in this world are the people that you\u2019re connected to through music and then you\u2019re isolated, no one is creating that support system around you for who you are. It can get dark.</p> <p>That\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been doing livestreams from our backyard. We\u2019re trying to do one thing a week to give people some access to music and community. We\u2019ve done DJing guides, and we want to start a conference to discuss them. Maya and I have been joking about starting a synth-pop band. But we do so much together, it\u2019s important to go it alone sometimes.</p> <p><strong>Octo Octa (Maya Bouldry-Morrison):</strong> It\u2019s hard to say that isolating is nice, but I am happy to be here. We work as a unit pretty often. When Eris and I are on the road, we\u2019re attached at the hip. There is a lot of melding of personalities and becoming one person, in a certain sense, when you\u2019re having to travel together, play together, and that somewhat carries over to home. But we have two different studios in the house, so we work on music separately, and then Brooke does visual art.</p> <p>When we first came home from tour, I got a bunch of stuff done really quickly. I put out a mixtape; I put some finishing touches on an EP. And then my motivation kind of started dipping. I\u2019m staying positive by doing all the things I\u2019ve been waiting to do around the house \u2013 I get to throw away old roofing tiles that have been sitting in the basement since 1989. Quarantine is not for ever. It eventually ends, and then new things will come. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79b1feba8558d23b747e9d2a35e9731f35091b2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79b1feba8558d23b747e9d2a35e9731f35091b2a/0_0_3088_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walt Disco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walt Disco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Walt Disco</h2> <p><em>Four members of the Glasgow-based glam-pop band share a flat</em></p> <p><strong>Dave (synths): </strong>There\u2019s six of us in one flat: me, James, Finlay and Charlie from Walt Disco; Ali plays drums for Lucy and the Best Boys and Anna is the singer of Medicine Cabinet.

The only problem is in the morning when everyone wants to shower. People in bands are suited to being in isolation because they spend days in cramped spaces without doing much exercise. We\u2019re lucky, because we were meant to be writing a debut album anyway, and being stuck in quarantine with your band means that you don\u2019t have any other option but to do it.

  "<p> It has been well publicised that Covid-19 discriminates by age and by underlying health conditions.</p> \n<p>But it has become increasingly apparent that it also discriminates by sex, with the latest UK data from the Office for National Statistics revealing that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease.</p> \n<p>The trend was first seen in China, where <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51\">one analysis</a> found a fatality rate of 2.8% in men compared with 1.7% in women.</p> \n<p>Since then, the pattern has been mirrored in France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and now in the UK.</p> \n<p>In Italy, men have accounted for <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjgh/2020/03/24/sex-gender-and-covid-19-disaggregated-data-and-health-disparities/\">71% of deaths</a>.

In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to men suffering worse symptoms and outcomes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cases-africa-pass-amid-fears-health-services-south-who\">Coronavirus cases in Africa pass 2,400 amid fears for health services</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-smoking-and-covid-19\">smoking hypothesis</a> was backed by a paper, <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032\">published last month</a>, that found smokers made up about 12% of those with less severe symptoms, but 26% of those who ended up in intensive care or died.</p> \n<p>Smoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.</p> \n<p>Behavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are <a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/sites/default/files/assets/1/AssetManager/2010%20Hand%20Washing%20Findings.pdf\">less likely to wash their hands</a>, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/01/30/hand-washing-soap-poll-survey\">less likely to use soap</a>, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.</p> \n<p>However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2018\">in the UK</a>, 16.5% of men smoke compared with 13% of women \u2013 the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe growing observation of increased mortality in men is holding true across China, Italy, Spain. We\u2019re seeing this across very diverse countries and cultures,\u201d said Sabra Klein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I see that, it makes me think that there must be something universal that\u2019s contributing to this.

Studies in mice suggest this may also be true for coronaviruses, though Covid-19 specifically has not been studied.</p> \n<p>\u201cTheir immune system may not initiate an appropriate response when it initially sees the virus,\u201d Klein said.</p> \n<p>Hormones can also play a role \u2013 oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Sex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are taking place across the world. Klein said she had already reviewed papers on this from Chinese teams, who have tracked blood samples from patients over the course of infection. \u201cWe can expect more on this soon,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Hawkes said, biology, lifestyle and behaviour were all likely to play a role.</p> \n<p>But it will only be possible to tease out the exact balance when sex-disaggregated data is more widely available.</p> \n<p>At the time of speaking, before the latest release by the ONS, Hawkes said it was disappointing that <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjgh/2020/03/24/sex-gender-and-covid-19-disaggregated-data-and-health-disparities/\">only six out of 20 countries</a> had published such a breakdown for case numbers and deaths, according to figures compiled by Global Health 50/50, which Hawkes leads, and CNN.

  "<p>It was bats. Or pangolins. To hear common narratives about the origins of Covid-19, there is a simple causal relationship between China\u2019s consumption of wild animals and the coronavirus ravaging the globe.</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the United States\u2019 top epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/03/anthony-fauci-foreign-wet-markets-shutdown-162975\">told</a> Fox: \u201cIt boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface, that we don\u2019t just shut it down.\u201d His opinion echoes a growing chorus across the political spectrum that singles out China\u2019s so-called \u201cwet markets\u201d as the culprit for the pandemic. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-warns-us-trade-with-china-will-change-if-disgusting-wet-markets-dont-close\">called</a> the Chinese exotic animal trade \u201cdisgusting\u201d and conservationist Jane Goodall has <a href=\"https://vegnews.com/2020/3/jane-goodall-sends-covid-19-message-leave-wild-animals-alone\">called</a> for \u201ca global ban\u201d.</p> <p>Science and political economy, however, tell a more complex story. The principal driver of zoonotic diseases (such as the virus Sars-Cov-2, which spread from animals to humans) is industrial animal agriculture. When food production encroaches on wild habitats, it creates opportunities for pathogens to jump to livestock and humans. Industrial agriculture also breeds its own diseases, like swine flu and avian flu, on hellish factory farms. And it contributes to antibiotic resistance and climate change, both of which exacerbate the problem.</p> <p>We need to have an honest public discussion on how to produce our food. Individually, we must stop eating animal products. Collectively, we must transform the global food system and work toward ending animal agriculture and rewilding much of the world. Oddly, many people who would never challenge the reality of climate change refuse to acknowledge the role meat-eating plays in endangering public health. Eating meat, it seems, is a socially acceptable form of science denial.</p> <p>Researchers have long issued warnings about the consequences of our livestock-dominated food system. After the Sars outbreak in 2003, an essay in the American Journal of Public Health <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1963309/\">lamented</a> that \u201cchanging the way humans treat animals \u2013 most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten \u2013 is largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure.\u201d In 2016, the UN Environment Program warned that the <a href=\"https://environmentlive.unep.org/media/docs/assessments/UNEP_Frontiers_2016_report_emerging_issues_of_environmental_concern.pdf\">\u201clivestock revolution\u201d</a> was a zoonotic disaster waiting to happen.</p> <p>Yet meat consumption continues to rise. Now, just as experts predicted, eating animals is <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318503396_How_eating_animals_comes_back_to_bite_us_from_Antibiotic_resistance_to_Zoonotic_diseases\">coming back to bite us</a>.</p> <p>Xenophobes call Covid-19 the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, but in reality zoonoses emerge worldwide, and do so with increasing regularity. The 1918 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d probably <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720273/\">came from</a> a midwestern pig farm. In the 1990s, ecological destabilization in the US south-west led to the Four Corners hantavirus outbreak. The Hendra and Menangle viruses are named after Australian towns. The Reston virus is an Ebola strain named after a DC suburb. Marburg virus emerged in Germany. These last two diseases sprang from monkeys imported for laboratory use \u2013 the Chinese are not the only ones with a large and dangerous wildlife trade. Sars, Mers and Zika are only three of many novel zoonoses to strike in the new millennium.</p> <p>Fauci, Graham and Goodall\u2019s call for a clampdown on the \u201cexotic\u201d animal trade is a valid demand, but ignores how that industry is inextricably intertwined with \u201cconventional\u201d food production. The Chinese government has encouraged smallholders <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\">to breed and procure wild game</a> to compensate for losing market-share to large livestock firms. Similarly, reliance on \u201cbush meat\u201d in west Africa increased after local fishers were pushed out of coastal waters by foreign trawlers in the 1970s, leading to the outbreaks of HIV and Ebola. The problem isn\u2019t some people\u2019s taste for seemingly strange delicacies, but rather our global, profit-driven, meat-centered food system.</p> <p>Just as zoonotic threats are multiplying, combating them is becoming harder. Antibiotics are increasingly ineffective in part because commercial livestock farmers abuse them, hoping to speed up growth rates or as a prophylactic measure against the spread of disease on overcrowded factory farms. Overuse of antibiotics spurs the evolution of \u201csuper-bugs\u201d like MRSA, a flesh-eating bacterium now found at hospitals worldwide. Modern solutions, like viral cures and vaccines, are elusive. The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=l9jgCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=%E2%80%9C19th-century+public+health+strategies+of+contact+tracing,+quarantine,+and+isolation%22+who&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AWe-ANETVL&amp;sig=ACfU3U2PwVWqxgaaTl8P1NY7DEyDV_7R6w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyk76BqeboAhVAl3IEHSswCAcQ6AEwAHoECAMQKA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9C19th-century%20public%20health%20strategies%20of%20contact%20tracing%2C%20quarantine%2C%20and%20isolation%22%20who&amp;f=false\">reported</a> that the most important techniques for controlling the 2003 Sars outbreak were not cutting-edge medicines so much as \u201c19th-century public health strategies of contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation\u201d. This has also been the case with Covid-19.</p> <p>Our short-term priority is the development of a vaccine for Covid-19. But we must also start thinking about more radical measures to address the roots of this crisis. We need a more resilient food system that puts less stress on the planet and on public health.</p> <p>This requires three interventions. The first is ending subsidies to industrial animal agriculture and taxing animal products to incorporate the cost of environmental and public health externalities, with the aim of the industry\u2019s eventual abolition.</p> <p>The second is support for local, sustainable plant farming to replace the monocrop-focused status quo. We must relieve pressure on soil and wildlife while creating better, safer agricultural jobs. (We should also remember that meatpacking workers, like their peers in wet markets, tend to be the first exposed to new pathogens.)</p> <p>The third is large-scale, public-directed investment in both plant-based meat alternatives and cellular agriculture (ie, growing animal tissue from stem cells), which would expand scientific research and employment while spurring a transition to animal-free protein.</p> <p>The post-meat age will be a healthier one. Between farming, ranching and feed crops, the livestock industry gobbles up 40% of the world\u2019s habitable surface. A vegan food system would require a tenth as much land. Restoring the natural environment could also create jobs through a public works program akin to the New Deal\u2019s Civilian Conservation Corps. And it would reduce the outbreak of new epidemics by reducing contact between humans and wild animals and by restoring biodiversity.</p> <p>Old habits <em>can</em> change. In the last few weeks, as the coronavirus has spread and millions shelter in place, bean sales have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/business/coronavirus-beans-sales.html\">surged</a>.

  "<p>While ministers and their medical advisers refuse to be drawn on an exit strategy from the UK lockdown, discussions are under way in Whitehall to explore how a graduated return to work could soften the economic blow while avoiding a surge in deaths from the virus. What options are available?</p> \n<h2><strong>Release the youth</strong></h2> \n<p>Young workers are among the most resilient to the virus, but often the hardest hit financially. A \u201cyouth first\u201d policy would be aimed at releasing them initially, at least in part, so that they can get back to work and soften the financial impact of the epidemic. <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/news/06-04-20-the_case_for_releasing_the_young_from_lockdown_a_briefing_paper_for_policymakers\">Research from Warwick University</a> this week made the case for easing restrictions on people in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents. Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee estimate that the move would allow 4.2 million people to return to work, of whom 2.6 million are in the private sector, and get the economy moving again.</p> \n<p>\u201cA young workforce release of this kind would lead to substantial economic and societal benefits without enormous health costs to the country,\u201d the authors write.</p> \n<p>As recent deaths have shown, however, the young are not impervious to the disease. The Warwick group calculate that their youth-first policy could lead to 630 premature deaths. But if all goes well, others could follow them back to the workplace, their order determined by age and type of work.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reopen schools</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/08/uk-schools-not-reopen-straight-after-easter-officials-insist\">Shutting schools</a> reduces the spread of coronavirus among pupils and teachers, and creates a distance between parents who have inevitably built up social bonds.

In 1992 he was appointed MBE for services to journalism.</p> <p>In the often cut-throat world of Fleet Street, he commanded not just respect but a deep and lasting affection even among professional rivals. He was dependable and unflappable on the most challenging assignments; reporters would breathe a sigh of relief when told they would be working with John.</p> <p>When he put down his cameras, he was sociable but not self-aggrandising. Instead he quietly mentored young photographers, encouraging and advising them and sharing his experience. \u201cTake it on the way out.

Even if France gets a handle on it by August, then of course the issue is people coming in from different countries.\u201d</p> <p>Sridhar pointed to a series of potential risks, that might even lead to the Tour being halted if there was an outbreak within the race convoy during the race. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a risk that the Tour de France moving around and unwittingly spreading the virus could kick-start a new lockdown.\u201d</p> <p>While the Tour\u2019s television partners were delighted to hear the race was going ahead \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s very good news,\u201d said Laurent Prud\u2019homme, director general of French Eurosport \u2013 Sridhar urged the Tour owner ASO to rethink its plan.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to weigh the risks against the benefits.

Another problem for the British race is a clash of live TV coverage as the official race broadcaster ITV also shows each stage of the French race.</p> <p>\u201cThe position we find ourselves in is unprecedented,\u201d Sweetspot said in a statement. \u201cWe are closely monitoring each development as it happens and acting accordingly with our partners and stakeholders across Britain to do the right thing, with the health and wellbeing of all of our supporters being of paramount importance.\u201d</p>",

Ironically, Teltumbde has written in the past about how the Indian state seeks to \u201cdiscredit and eliminate individuals it deems a threat to its apparatus.\u201d</p> <p>Varadarajan, whose platform the Wire has previously fallen foul of powerful and wealthy figures with strong connections to the government, faces a different set of charges. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there have been strong moves in the Indian media and sections of the ruling dispensation to pin blame for the spread of the virus on Muslim communities. Yogi Adityanath, a fundamentalist Hindu cleric turned politician with a good line in inflammatory speech, is the chief minister of India\u2019s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, where tensions have been rising. Although the Wire misattributed a quote to him on its website, the erratum was quickly corrected and acknowledged.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Varadarajan now stands accused of a fantastical range of crimes, including disobeying an order of a public servant and creating or promoting enmity between classes. The real problem may be that the Wire <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-chief-minister-adityanath-shifts-ram-idol-amid-lockdown/article31160225.ece\">reported correctly</a> that Adityanath had attended a Hindu religious gathering after the national lockdown was declared on 24 March. This report came even as public feelings have been whipped up against Muslims because Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim organisation, held an event prior to the lockdown where many attendees did get infected.

That grand moniker continues to lull the world into believing constitutional rights and freedoms thrive in that nation, when they are in fact under grave threat. Although the misuse of state powers to intimidate principled journalists and of religious divides to garner votes has occurred under other governments, including those of the current Congress opposition, there is little doubt that the last six years of Modi\u2019s government have seen an alarming crackdown on campus dissidents as well as journalists and writers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/killed/asia/india/?status=Killed&amp;motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&amp;type%5B%5D=Journalist&amp;cc_fips%5B%5D=IN&amp;start_year=1992&amp;end_year=2020&amp;group_by=location\">Fourteen journalists</a> have been killed in India since Modi\u2019s election in 2014.

Their true feelings are only revealed when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/footage-appears-to-show-world-leaders-joking-about-trump-at-nato-summit\">private conversations</a> are accidentally overheard. This time it\u2019s different. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simoncoveney/status/1250348979595792392\">Simon Coveney</a>, the foreign minister of Ireland, a country with exceptionally close ties with the United States, described Trump\u2019s decision to cut funds to WHO as an \u201cindefensible decision, in midst of global pandemic. So many vulnerable populations rely on WHO \u2013 deliberately undermining funding and trust now is shocking.\u201d Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister was slightly more restrained, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeikoMaas/status/1250322386907357185\">tweeting</a> that: \u201cBlaming does not help. The virus knows no borders\u201d. In the UK, however, where ministers are still hoping for a post-Brexit trade deal, a Downing Street spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-live-trump-decision-cut-who-funding-sparks-outrage-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188#block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188\">rejected an invitation</a> to join the condemnation, although they did voice support for the WHO.</p> <p>Why undermine the organisation that is at the forefront of responding to a pandemic? For Trump, this seems particularly illogical \u2013 the pandemic has already killed <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-30000-new-yorkers-told-to-wear-masks-idUKKCN21X25I\">more than 30,000 Americans</a>. The answer is<strong> </strong>simple. In the midst of an election year, with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">approval ratings</a> falling, Trump needs to find someone else to blame. Now that the daily White House briefings have taken on the role of campaign rallies in locked down America, nothing can be allowed to undermine the narrative that he is the saviour of the American people. Failings are the fault of others. Once it was the Mexicans <strong>(</strong>ironically, Mexico is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">restricting Americans from entering</a> the country<strong>)</strong>. Then it was China, whose political leaders Trump considers insufficiently obsequious. Now, he has redirected his ire at the WHO.</p> <p>It hardly needs to be said that Trump has justified his decision with claims that fail to withstand the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">basic scrutiny</a>. He claims that the WHO was \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the early stages of the pandemic, thereby delaying the response by the United States. Yet the WHO had warned of person-to-person transmission as early as 23 January. Six days later, his economic adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/donald-trump-coronavirus-memos-warning-peter-navarro\">warned</a> of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of American deaths. Trump ignored them both.</p> <p>The decision will clearly damage the WHO. First, there is the loss of funding. As the world\u2019s richest country, the United States contributes 40% of the WHO\u2019s core budget, although this only amounts to 20% of its total spending. The US also contributes the largest share to the remaining 80% of voluntary contributions.</p> <p>The US theoretically contributes roughly<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\"> 10-15% of the WHO\u2019s budget</a> as its largest contributor. It\u2019s uncertain whether Trump can legally block payments to the WHO\u2019s core budget, as these are authorised by Congress<strong>,</strong> but he could stop those voluntary payments made by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control.</p> <p>With a total contribution of a <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/trump-is-desperate-to-find-someone-to-blame-for-his-coronavirus-failings\">little under $900m</a>, roughly what the NHS spends in 36 hours, other countries could step up to the mark to replace at least some of this shortfall. However, the decision will likely have a disproportionate effect on areas where the United States has made substantial earmarked contributions, such as polio eradication. More importantly, this is a massive distraction for an organisation working flat out to tackle one of the most serious threats to the health of everyone, including Americans, in decades.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of individual leaders and international cooperation. In a world where Jair Bolsanaro can threaten the world by allowing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/jair-bolsonaro-accuses-ngos-setting-fire-amazon-rainforest\">Amazon</a> to burn<strong>,</strong> or Donald Trump can undermine those leading the response to a pandemic, the need for a new international order has never been more urgent.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Martin McKee is professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an adviser to the World Health Organization</p>",

Given the promotion\u2019s continued defiance in the face of Covid-19, it should at least take into account the experiences of other combat sports during the Spanish flu outbreak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/dana-white-ufc-249-private-island-coronavirus-khabib-nurmagomedov\">Dana White plans to host UFC 249 on private island during coronavirus lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Boxing, like much of the rest of the world, came to a standstill during the last pandemic. A story on 13 October 1918 in the New York Times gave the details:</p> <p><em>\u201cBoxing in the East is now at a standstill, because of the epidemic of Spanish influenza. Promoters in Philadelphia, Boston, and New Jersey, in compliance with requests issued by their different Health Departments, have agreed to close up shop. How long the sport will be idle remains to be seen, but it is positive that no matches of any importance will be undertaken while the epidemic continues.\u201d</em></p> <p>Boxing clubs across the country closed as they prepared to deal with the virus ravaging their cities. One of the affected fights was between heavyweight contender Jack Dempsey and light-heavyweight champion Battling Levinsky, who were scheduled to compete in October 1918 in Philadelphia.</p> <p>While fights across much of the country were sidelined during October \u2013 one of the deadliest months for the pandemic in the United States \u2013 the shutdown did not last long. The 27 October 1918 edition of the Milwaukee Journal revealed that \u201cNovember promises to be replete with boxing action, that is, if the Spanish flu ever takes the count.\u201d Another headline from that same date in the Cleveland Plain Dealer read, \u201cBoxing is Resumed Gradually in East as Flu Ban Moves.\u201d</p> <p>The Dempsey v Levinsky bout eventually went ahead on 6 November, and Dempsey defeated Levinsky by third round KO. Dempsey would go on to fight 11 more times during the pandemic, including his lineal heavyweight title win against Jess Willard in July 1919. Other notable boxers such as Gene Tunney, Harry Greb, San Langford, and Benny Leonard fought dozens of times during the pandemic.</p> <p>Despite boxing returning to business as usual in late 1918, several boxers succumbed to the virus, including heavyweight Jim Johnson, Terry Martin, Matty Baldwin, Jim Stewart, Samuel Ranzino, Joe Stein, Al Thomas, and Joe Tuber. Boxing promoter Paddy Carroll and boxing club owner Lorenzo Snow also died from the virus. Canadian sports promoter George Kennedy, who promoted wrestling, boxing, and was best known as the owner of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team, contracted the Spanish flu during the pandemic and never fully recovered, eventually passing away from complications related to the illness in 1921.</p> <p>Several other renowned boxers contracted the virus but managed to recover. Retired heavyweight Jim Jeffries, a former world heavyweight champion who was most famous for being the \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d for attempting to dethrone African American heavyweight champ Jack Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jul/04/jack-johnson-pioneer-black-boxer\">in the 1910 \u2018Fight of the Century\u2019</a>, made a surprise recovery in November 1918 at age 43.</p> <p>It remains unclear how many boxers contracted the virus while competing during the pandemic. What we do know, however, is that there were very few policies implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. Fans were allowed to attend the events, while hygiene was not generally of the standard it is today. UFC has said it will hold events without a live audience but it still plays a dangerous game if it wants fighters to brawl in close quarters during a pandemic \u2013 and that\u2019s before the threat to officials and televisions crews, not to mention the fact that traveling across the country risks spreading the virus to different communities.</p> <p>UFC President Dana White remains defiant though. And while he was unable to go ahead with the UFC 249 pay-per-view event, he maintains that the UFC will be the \u201cfirst sport back\u201d and that \u201cFight Island is real\u201d. On Wednesday, he said he plans to host an event <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/29036726/ufc-president-dana-white-eyes-9-next-event-tbd-location\">as soon as 9 May</a>.</p> <p>While governments and hospitals are better prepared to handle a pandemic now than they were a century ago thanks to a medical revolution and the lack of world wars depleting infrastructure and services, it is important that sports leagues and organizations refrain from taking any reckless action during a global health crisis. Instead, promotions such as the UFC should look back on history and learn from the mistakes of the previous pandemics.</p>",
  "<p>Vulnerable parts of the developing world, particularly in Africa, are at risk of sliding into famine as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, while humanitarian relief efforts are being hindered by lockdowns and travel restrictions, according to the UN.</p> <p>Experts raised the spectre of unrest similar to that seen in 2007-08 when food price rises sparked riots around the world, destabilising fragile states and fuelling conflict in ways that are still being felt. They told the Guardian that the world could still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">avoid such a crisis</a>, but time was running out.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a food security perspective, some places are very close to famine,\u201d said Dominique Burgeon, the director of emergencies at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \u201cThe number of people on the verge of being extremely vulnerable was already very high. What we fear is that this number will further increase because of the impact of Covid-19 on food security.\u201d</p> <p>Swathes of the horn of Africa were already experiencing severe problems as swarms of locusts have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/13/second-wave-of-locusts-in-east-africa-said-to-be-20-times-worse\">attacking crops over several countries</a>, in the worst such outbreak for 70 years. Before the coronavirus struck, at least 20 million people were estimated to be in danger of acute food insecurity.</p> <p>\u201cThe level of need was already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/12/a-humanitarian-crisis-looms-in-africa-unless-we-act-fast-to-stop-the-desert-locust\">extremely high</a>. The one thing they did not need was one more shock. We are very concerned,\u201d Burgeon said.</p> <p>He said people in the rich world should not see food shortages arising from the coronavirus crisis as a problem for other people. If food shortages begin to bite, the impacts will reverberate across the globe.</p> <p>He drew a parallel with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/13/food.climatechange\">food price spikes in 2007-08</a>, which triggered riots and unrest across north Africa and parts of the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a matter of international solidarity, and humanity, but also a matter of global security \u2013 to make sure the situation in some parts of the world does not create food riots,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Burgeon\u2019s assessment was backed by Amer Daoudi, the senior operations director at the World Food Programme, which is serving 100 million people in dire need in Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia.</p> <p>He also pointed to the food price jumps that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/21/food.unitednations\">occurred</a> at the same time as the global financial crisis in 2007-08, and warned of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/29/food.qna\">similar shock</a>. Then, some countries exacerbated the price leaps by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/jun/05/romefoodcrisissummitonthe\">banning exports of staples</a> such as wheat. He urged governments to avoid that this time.</p> <p>\u201cRemember in 2007 high food prices led to riots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world community needs to come together. We can avoid food shortages if we are able to support countries across the globe [that are vulnerable].\u201d</p> <p>Daoudi said food prices had not yet risen sharply as a result of the crisis, and international cooperation could keep food affordable and reaching areas where it is needed, but countries needed to come up with plans for achieving those aims.</p> <p>\u201cFor the time being we are not seeing food prices rise internationally, but we are seeing food prices rise in local food markets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can avoid food shortages if we are able to supply countries across the globe. But if we interrupt the supply chain, food insecurity will definitely arrive.\u201d</p> <p>The WFP is organising a hub-and-spoke system of air cargo routes, creating \u201cair bridges\u201d to take food to some of the worst-affected regions as ground transport becomes impossible in lockdowns. But these efforts are also being hampered by travel restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cThere are major bottlenecks in transport,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople also can\u2019t access medical services.\u201d</p> <p>Daoudi urged countries to ensure food supply chains are kept open by maintaining free trade, avoiding food export bans and treating farm labourers as key workers.</p> <p>The UN is concerned that if countries embrace protectionist measures, as some have done by restricting exports, then the threat of food shortages will rapidly become real. The chief economist of the FAO, Maximo Torero, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">told the Guardian last month</a>: \u201cThe worst that can happen is that governments restrict the flow of food. All measures against free trade will be counterproductive.\u201d</p> <p>Funding is also a major issue. The WFP has requested $350m for its initial Covid-19 response, but so far only about $80m has been forthcoming, including \u00a315m from the UK.</p> <p>Last week several major multinational food companies including Unilever, Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-double-number-of-people-going-hungry\">warned</a> that the coronavirus crisis could double the number of people at risk of hunger around the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/27/back-poor-countries-fighting-covid-19-with-trillions-or-face-disaster-g20-told\">Leading economists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-global-leaders-urge-g20-to-tackle-twin-health-and-economic-crises\">former political leaders</a> have also called on the G20 to provide financial support to poor countries.</p> <p>Burgeon said a swift response was crucial. In some of the vulnerable areas in Africa, he said, there were already armed militia and guerrilla groups. If coronavirus takes hold, people will be unable to work and tend to crops, and resources will be stretched further, fuelling greater instability.</p> <p>Another complicating factor in some east African countries is that many people are pastoralists, depending for their livelihood on being able to move their livestock around. Travel restrictions will hurt them and may give rise to conflict.</p> <p>The African Union will discuss the looming food crises at a special meeting with the FAO on Thursday.</p> <p>Burgeon called for governments around the world to do more. \u201cWe need more international cooperation. We had humanitarian appeals before Covid-19, but now the needs are bigger, the funding gap is bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cCountries are mobilising but they need to accelerate.\u201d</p> <p>Daoudi echoed the call. \u201cThe world needs a new social contract, for us to come together as an international community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in a race against time.\u201d</p>",

That time period \u2013 known as the access period \u2013 will now be reduced to a minimum of one day. </strong></p> \n  <p>Importantly, employers will still need to meet the essential conditions required under the \u201cgenuine agreement\u201d test that is ultimately determined by the Fair Work Commission. This is a safeguard to ensure workers are able to make informed decisions about changes affecting the way they work. Employees will also still be able to vote down a proposed change to agreements.</p> \n  <p>These changes have also been time-bound and will revert to the usual 7 day period automatically in six months. Having listened to concerns raised by the ACTU, the Attorney-General has also determined to review the operation of the changes in two months to assess whether the system has been operating effectively without misuse. If substantial evidence were to emerge that the changes are not operating effectively, the time period can be altered again at that point of two-month review.</p> \n  <p>Importantly, the regulation change applies to all businesses with employees covered by EBA\u2019s, including those not eligible for JobKeeper payments.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are designed to enable companies to deal swiftly with urgent issues that are arising in their workplaces, such as health and safety issues associated with COVID-19,\u201d Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, Christian Porter said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor example, businesses that have urgently needed to divide their workforce up into teams that rotate between working from home and in the office for social distancing reasons, haven\u2019t been able to quickly implement those changes due to the mandatory access period.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn some cases, delays have been impractical and prevented employers from taking effective steps to improve the safety of their staff, or to ensure their businesses were able to function efficiently during these difficult and fast-changing times.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are only temporary and will expire in six months, in line with other changes to working arrangements that have been recently adopted, such as the amendments to the Fair Work Act that were necessary to facilitate the roll out of the $130 billion JobKeeper package and I intend to review the operation of the change two months after it becomes effective.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97f4308f08cf571cdb1ed1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:59:32.208Z\">6.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The ACTU and <strong>Sally McManus</strong> is not:<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cSome employers have not stopped demanding rights be taken off working people. We saw some openly try to force changes to the Fair Work Act that would undermine people\u2019s job security and rights at work in the lead up to Jobkeeper becoming law, those attempts were opposed by the union movement and were rightly refused by all political parties.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHaving been denied a legislative pathway for their power grab those employers, who have not suffered serious downturn, have spent the last week lobbying the government to take away workers\u2019 rights via regulation, they should be condemned, and the Government should stop listening to them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBy agreeing to these changes Christian Porter would be using his power to abolish rules that protect workers, their job security and their rights at work.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes will allow employers to ram through reductions in pay and undermine job security.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe current rules ensure workers have adequate time to consider any proposal to change an enterprise agreement, to discuss this with their employer, other workers and to seek advice. This change effectively takes away all these rights leaving workers exposed to employers seeking to exploit the fear caused by the pandemic and to pressure workers into rushed agreements, locking out their access to advice.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are already seeing widespread abuse of the JobKeeper system, prior to the pandemic Australian business had an enormous problem with wage theft. We know that, sadly, too many employers will exploit the system if there are no safeguards for working people.

It has been expertly handled by the Tasmanian health authorities in an exemplary way of bringing an episode under control. </p> \n   <p>But as the PM has said, if we relax the distancing measures that are stopping or reducing that community transmission, that will inevitably lead to some more outbreaks of community transmission. </p> \n   <p>Unless we are prepared as a nation to detect those outbreaks really early and get on top of them and control them and isolate the cases and quarantine the contacts, we could end up with large community outbreaks that could lead to situations like we\u2019ve all seen every night on the nightly news in high-income countries with good health systems like the USA and the UK. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7010ca324ca58c33d83e38d2de9be3f93e6b330f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7010ca324ca58c33d83e38d2de9be3f93e6b330f/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Scott Morrison and CMO Brendan Murphy at a press conference in the main committee room of parliament house in Canberra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Scott Morrison and chief medical officer Brendan Murphy provide a Covid-19 update after the national cabinet meeting.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:19:28.642Z\">at 6.19am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97e8898f08cf571cdb1e8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:09:48.678Z\">6.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>According to slides handed out to journalists at today\u2019s media conference, Australia is estimated to be currently detecting approximately 92% of all symptomatic cases, while each state and territory is individually estimated to be detecting over 80%. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>The slides argue that Australia has one of the highest reported detection rates globally. </strong></p> \n  <p>The high detection rate doesn\u2019t mean the outbreak is out of control in Australia, just that we don\u2019t seem to be missing symptomatic cases.</p> \n  <p>The Doherty Institute is currently working on the next phase of modelling using Australian data to work out the current state of the epidemic, which will be known as \u201cnowcasting\u201d.

In short, leaders emphasise the value of providing education within classroom settings, but acknowledge that it is up to state and territory governments and the non-government school sector to make operational decisions. <br></p> \n  <p>There is also a need for schools to offer teachers and staff a safe working environment.</p> \n  <p>The full list of principles is as follows:</p> \n  <p>1. Our schools are critical to the delivery of high quality education for students and to give our children the best possible start in life. Our education systems are based on the recognition that education is best delivered by professional teachers to students in the classroom on a school campus.</p> \n  <p>2. It is accepted that during the Covid-19 crisis, alternative flexible, remote delivery of education services may be needed.</p> \n  <p>3. Our schools must be healthy and safe environments for students, teachers and other staff to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of education to students.</p> \n  <p>4. State and territory governments and non-government sector authorities are responsible for managing and making operational decisions for their school systems respectively, subject to compliance with relevant funding agreements with the Commonwealth.</p> \n  <p>5.

<p><strong>Pauline Wright</strong><em>:</em><em><br></em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Law Council remains concerned about the adequacy of public interest protections where warrants authorise investigative action involving journalists and media organisations, whether they are suspected of having committed an offence or whether they are simply third parties who may be in possession of information. </p> \n   <p><strong>The law continues to leave journalists and media organisations exposed to possible police investigation and prosecution. </strong></p> \n   <p>The Law Council believes that any similar case in the future could be avoided through law reform measures to protect and recognise the importance of public interest journalism and to incorporate greater accountability mechanisms. Protections might include contested hearings, the involvement of a Public Interest Advocate to test the warrant process and a requirement that warrants may only be issued by a judge of a superior court of record. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s media is critical to holding government and its agencies accountable for their actions and scrutinising the exercise of power. Transparency and accountability lead to better decision-making and a stronger democracy that protects rights and freedoms and upholds the rule of law. This case is a reminder of the ongoing vulnerability of public interest journalism within the current legal framework. </p> \n   <p>We will continue to call for stronger protections to provide an essential balance in the face of the extensive powers Australia has given our law enforcement and security agencies. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T00:20:57.499Z\">at 1.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979ca68f08ea7431f439f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-butler\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:46:06.560Z\">12.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Shares in Virgin Australia have been suspended from trade as the grounded airline desperately seeks a bailout.<br></p> \n  <p>The stock went into a trading halt two days ago but has so far been unable to secure a lifeline amid furious political debate over whether it should be rescued by the government.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhilst this consideration and these discussions have continued over the last two days including discussions which remain confidential and are incomplete, the company is not presently in a position to make an announcement to the market with respect to these matters,\u201d Virgin Australia told the exchange on Thursday morning.<br></p> \n  <p>As Guardian Australia has reported, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/virgin-australia-considers-going-into-administration-as-labor-calls-for-government-rescue\">options under consideration include putting the company into administration</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:50:33.262Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979bdc8f08ea7431f439f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:45:38.701Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Most of these seem legit to me.

A few years ago, she was trying to find a way to engage her students with social-justice issues and feminist ideas, especially the problematic way women are portrayed in art. She wondered if Barbie, that plastic idealised woman, could become a vehicle for playful commentary on the \u201cpatriarchal palaces of painting\u201d. Soon Williamson was gathering a doll army, clothing it in pieces handmade by her feminist mother in the 1970s, with new additions created by her sister. She handed each of her students a Barbie doll and a blank placard on a lollipop stick, then set them loose in Huddersfield Art Gallery.</p> <p>The resulting mini-protest signs stopped visitors in their tracks, and the photographs of Barbie\u2019s protests drew plenty of notice back in Williamson\u2019s office: \u201cI realised I had something which attracted everyone\u2019s attention and catalysed conversations about how women are portrayed and represented not only in art, but society in general.\u201d</p> <p>So she set up a Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarbieReports\">@BarbieReports</a>, not really expecting many people to care about this decidedly academic project. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how to use Twitter,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI was on the train to London and I posted it. And then my phone never stopped pinging the whole week. It just seemed to take off.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0efbae267d4d84932f66216944d6a2eeecbb0e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0efbae267d4d84932f66216944d6a2eeecbb0e5/8_8_1351_1937/697.jpg\" alt=\"ArtActivistBarbie in front of Charles Mengin\u2019s Sappho at Manchester Art Gallery.\" width=\"697\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Victorian porn\u2019\u2026 ArtActivistBarbie in front of Charles Mengin\u2019s Sappho at Manchester Art Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter @BarbieReports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/31/mary-beard-sits-for-naked-portrait-in-new-bbc-programme\">Mary Beard\u2019s Shock of the Nude</a> having recently aired on BBC2, the authority of art galleries as neutral spaces of culture has been called into question. Beard points out that most female nudes were made for the male gaze, and lines between art and pornography are not easily drawn. Williamson agrees. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarbieReports/status/1084823364227731456?s=20\">she posed ArtActivistBarbie in the Manchester Art Gallery</a> in front of Charles Mengin\u2019s Sappho \u2013 which portrays a topless young woman with a sheer drape covering her bottom half \u2013 two men approached her. \u201cThey said to me that they were realising many of these works were, in their words, \u2018Victorian pornography.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Visitors are often shocked or amused when they see ArtActivistBarbie. Her playfulness is key to her success, helping to articulate the feminist message in a relatable way. Visitors often take pictures of her, and ask questions about the project.</p> <p>Williamson remembers one visitor remarking that the Barbies made her \u201crealise just how much women are judged by what\u2019s on the outside and not on the inside\u201d, and this awareness is at the heart of ArtActivistBarbie\u2019s mission. Art museums and galleries exude authority, and the public usually accepts the version of history and culture they portray without question.</p> <p>\u201c[ArtActivistBarbie] tries to reveal what you don\u2019t always see. She points out what is there, but what\u2019s <em>not</em> there as well. [She tries] to reveal inequality and structures of male power and privilege,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cI suppose she\u2019s a catalyst \u2013 helping people to see things with a bit more consciousness \u2026 so that people try and look with fresh eyes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88016fbf7ef6fc80ab07aed5d71280acc21440a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88016fbf7ef6fc80ab07aed5d71280acc21440a4/0_218_1611_1635/985.jpg\" alt=\"ArtActivistBarbie not pleased with an all-male set of artist stamps.\" width=\"985\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catalyst \u2026 ArtActivistBarbie not pleased with an all-male set of artist stamps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BarbieReports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Williamson wants to reach out to people who wouldn\u2019t normally engage with gender politics: \u201cThere\u2019s no point preaching to the converted,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to reach out to everyone else.\u201d And of course, the nostalgia and familiarity of a much-loved toy can bring onlookers into a more receptive space.</p> <p>ArtActivistBarbie has an eclectic range of Twitter followers, from art critics to celebrities to everyday people around the globe. Her work has also inspired others to do the same. Williamson called for a global flashmob last August, where people around the world took their dolls, placards and lollipop sticks to their local art galleries to question long-held beliefs about art and women. The posts (with the hashtag #AABFlashmob) were then projected on to the walls of Manchester Central Library, where ArtActivistBarbie was holding her first exhibition of photographs.</p> <p>Now that Covid-19 has cancelled all cultural events and closed venues and spaces, ArtActivistBarbie has embraced a fully online presence. Williamson was initially doubtful that such a playful protest would be well received in these serious times. She asked her followers if the AAB project should continue \u2013 to a resounding chorus of support:</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KMScattergood/status/1240054853768032279?s=20\">\u201c</a><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KMScattergood/status/1240054853768032279?s=20\">We need creative resistance more than ever\u201d</a></em></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecolegsazer1/status/1239929296304685063?s=20\">\u201c</a><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecolegsazer1/status/1239929296304685063?s=20\">Your activism is so positive &amp; it gives us something else to think about\u201d</a></em></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/heineplath/status/1239916688277151744?s=20\">\u201c</a><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/heineplath/status/1239916688277151744?s=20\">Please, content that isn\u2019t v*rus, I\u2019m begging\u201d</a></em></p> <p>Yet the most encouraging message <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wmarybeard/status/1240583285794918404?s=20\">came from Mary Beard</a>. \u201cYou are just what we need in difficult times @BarbieReports\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/25/barbie-maker-gender-neutral-dolls-release\">'It was time': maker of Barbie launches line of gender-neutral dolls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Williamson decided to carry on, tweeting unpublished pictures from a recent London excursion and photographing Barbie and her friends in other contexts.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the main stories on Thursday 16 April.</p> \n<h2>Morrison lays out three conditions for restrictions to be lifted</h2> \n<p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said current restrictions would continue for at least four weeks but there are three conditions that need to be met before they are eased. They are: increased testing, better contact tracing (\u201clifted to an industrial capability\u201d) and the ability to lock down localised areas, similar to what happened in the Tasmanian north-west this week. Morrison also says some of the Coalition\u2019s election \u201cpolicy framework\u201d may not be able to be delivered once the crisis is over.</p> \n<h2>Stuart Robert claims app swaps phone numbers</h2> \n<p>The minister for government services, Stuart Robert, has said the government\u2019s proposed coronavirus tracking app <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshgnosis/status/1250636195253501952\">will work by swapping the mobile phone numbers </a>of people who are in close proximity. The app, which Morrison has said will roll out in 14 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-tracking-app-to-be-rolled-out-in-australia-only-with-privacy-safeguards-minister\">may be delayed as the attorney general checks it for privacy concerns</a>. Robert\u2019s comments sparked confusion as to which app (of many kinds) the government would use. \u201c[If] we are in close proximity for 15 minutes because we are waiting in a queue, our mobile phone numbers would swap securely,\u201d he said as an example.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>All Ruby Princess crew to be tested within 48 hours</h2> \n<p>All 1,100 crew on board the virus-stricken Ruby Princess <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/all-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-crew-tested-covid-19-within-48-hours\">will be tested for Covid-19 by Saturday, NSW Health announced</a>. Currently only 25% of crew have been tested, with half of those tested returning positive results. More broadly, NSW authorities also signalled towards testing anyone with mild symptoms. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said that anybody who \u201cworks in an industry where you are in contact with a lot of people\u201d, especially vulnerable people, should get tested if they have symptoms. Previously that only applied to people in certain suburbs.</p> \n<h2>24 hours to change EBAs</h2> \n<p>The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, announced a change to workplace laws that gives workers only 24 hours to consider changes made by their employers to their enterprise bargaining agreements. Previously, if an employer moved to change an EBA, workers had seven days to consider it before voting to accept or reject. That has now been changed to 24 hours, in what the Labor party said was \u201crobbing workers of an important safeguard\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/all-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-crew-tested-covid-19-within-48-hours\">All Ruby Princess crew to be tested for Covid-19 within 48 hours</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Immigration detention centre protest</h2> \n<p>Armed riot police entered Sydney\u2019s Villawood immigration detention centre to end a protest by refugees who were worried about the danger Covid-19 posed to their health while in detention. Three men had been protesting on the roof of the Blaxland compound since Saturday but were removed by police on Thursday. Refugee advocates say they do not know where they are now.</p> \n<h2>School guidelines</h2> \n<p>The federal government <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samanthamaiden/status/1250643366959656960/photo/1\">announced a broad set of national principles</a> about the return to school, but said that states and territories still retain the ultimate control.

Closed airports, bonded labour, or other forms of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/feb/26/time-to-end-kafala\">unbreakable employment contracts</a>, and little access to funds, have made it close to impossible for those who want to leave to do so.</p> <p>In Lebanon, where an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/lebanon-to-default-on-debt-for-first-time-amid-financial-crisis#maincontent\">economic meltdown</a> had already shattered household incomes before the coronavirus lockdown, both Amnesty International and the International Labour Organization fear many domestic workers are no longer being paid.

  "<p>What do you say to a business owner who has heard it all before? Answer: Don\u2019t speak, use sign language.</p> <p>At least that\u2019s the novel approach taken by Teki Paper bags, an Ethiopian enterprise developed by deaf women.</p> <p>They certainly have the numbers to back it up. With almost a million handmade paper bags sold, the organisation is slowly weaning the country\u2019s bustling capital, Addis Ababa, off plastic bags while simultaneously empowering the deaf community.</p> <p>As other countries in east Africa, such as Rwanda and Kenya, lead the way in eliminating single-use plastics, Ethiopia has experienced a steady <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/994622/plastic-consumption-ethiopia/\">increase in both plastic consumption and production since 2011</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a situation that has particularly affected Addis Ababa, where plastic bags are clogging the waterways, causing floods in the rainy season and polluting the land.</p> <p>\u201cPlastic bags are cheap in Addis Ababa,\u201d explains Mimi Legesse, the charismatic co-manager of Teki. \u201cSo business owners will give you a bag with every product you purchase.\u201d</p> <p>Clement Piguet, Teki\u2019s co-founder, admits that persuading business owners to choose a more expensive alternative is a challenge but lecturing people about the environment won\u2019t always have the desired impact. Instead, Teki believes that if they can also provide a clear social benefit along with the environmental impact, business owners are more likely to invest in a greener alternative.</p> <p>Clement says: \u201cWith our paper bags we want to provide people with the opportunity to change the lives of deaf people, and through this create an alternative way to fight plastic.\u201d</p> <p>Meskerem Beyene, a resident interpreter at Teki, believes empowering deaf people to engage with clients has had a positive impact on the business. \u201cWhen someone who can hear tries to sell the bags, people tend not to listen,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when Mimi uses sign language people lend us their ear.\u201d</p> <p>Piguet, who is not deaf, believes sign language is a powerful communication tool, saying: \u201cSign language has a special power when you use it well; it has a universal aspect because we all have two hands. The way you move them, it fascinates people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbf0915d6ce99dfccb5c2e09c01aa7068f59dab1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbf0915d6ce99dfccb5c2e09c01aa7068f59dab1/0_481_6131_3679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teki paper bags\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teki paper bags.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Adler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This fascination led Piguet to visit the Alpha deaf school in his area four years ago.

  "<p>Public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year in schools, universities, hospitals and care homes have pledged to cut the amount of meat they serve by 20%.</p> <p>The caterers\u2019 meals are eaten by a quarter of the UK population and the groups said their action was aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving the healthiness of meals. Industry experts called the move unprecedented.</p> <p>People in rich nations, such as Britain, eat more meat than is considered to be healthy. Studies have also shown that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown\">meat consumption</a> must be slashed to tackle the climate emergency and other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">environmental crises</a> such as water pollution arising from the high impact of livestock.</p> <p>International studies have suggested cuts of up to 90% are needed, but in January the UK\u2019s official climate change advisers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/23/make-big-polluters-pay-for-mass-tree-planting-officials-say\">recommended a 20% </a>consumption reduction.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://20percentlessmeat.co.uk/\">#20percentlessmeat</a> pledge was launched in the <a href=\"https://secure.viewer.zmags.com/publication/0b5583a8#/0b5583a8/68\">trade magazine Public Sector Catering</a>.</p> <p>David Foad, editor-in-chief of the magazine, said: \u201cIt represents a bold move, because it is not being mandated. It would have been much easier to sit back and wait until they were either prompted or forced into action like this by government.\u201d</p> <p>Some experts have suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/eu-meat-tax-climate-emergency\">meat taxes are needed</a> to bring about change.</p> <p>Foad said that attaining the 20% target would remove 9m kg of meat from plates every year, equivalent to 45,000 cows or 16 million chickens.</p> <p>Andy Jones, who chairs the <a href=\"https://www.publicsectorcatering.co.uk/psc100\">PSC100 group</a> of caterers and suppliers working to improve the health of meals, and is also a former chair of the Hospital Caterers Association (HCA), said: \u201cThe carbon emissions savings and the potential benefit to people\u2019s health can play a part in tackling climate change and shortening NHS queues.\u201d</p> <p>The HCA has signed up to the pledge. Craig Smith, the association\u2019s chair, told Public Sector Catering that the people it served were already moving away from meat. \u201cThe biggest rise we are seeing is those demanding a more plant-based diet.\u201d</p> <p>Matt White, chair of the University Caterers Organisation, said: \u201c[We are] fully committed to the #20percentlessmeat initiative. We have a very short window of opportunity to make changes in the way we all eat or we will have done irreparable damage to our planet and to future generations.\u201d</p> <p>The National Association of Care Catering has also backed the move, but its chair, Sue Cawthray, said it would require work to implement. \u201cI would say our biggest challenge to meeting the 20% target is the mindset of many of those currently in care homes. The majority would have been brought up on a staple diet of meat and veg and will be resistant to change.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Forster, chair of LACA, (the Local Authority Caterers Association), which represents 3,300 school food providers, said: \u201cThe school food industry is leading the way on meat reduction. Schools across the country have meat-free days and are increasingly introducing plant-based vegetarian and vegan options. We therefore support the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Mansbridge, director at the campaign group ProVeg UK, said: \u201cNever has the public sector made a commitment of this magnitude. By making simple and effective adaptations, all public sector caterers will soon find more of their meals are healthier, more planet-friendly and equally or more delicious.\u201d</p> <p>Jones said: \u201cThe huge range of people we feed every day means we can influence the diet of the nation.

  "<p>To a certain way of thinking, never has an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">independent Scotland</a> looked more desirable; to another way of thinking, never has it looked more unviable. Some people \u2013 since 2016, I\u2019ve sometimes been one of them \u2013 manage to hold both opinions: \u201cIt would be a good idea, if only \u2026\u201d But<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/13/the-power-and-the-story-global-battle-news-and-information-review-john-lloyd\"> John Lloyd,</a> a fine journalist with a long career at the Financial Times, has never been among the vacillators. In this book, he argues that Scotland\u2019s secession from the United Kingdom would certainly be damaging for what was left of it \u2013 England, Wales and Northern Ireland, supposing the last still existed \u2013 but nothing less than a disaster for Scotland itself. Economically, socially and culturally, secession would do it more harm than Brexit.</p> <p>The likely economic consequences are hard to deny. Scotland would be launched as a new nation using, as Lloyd says, \u201ca currency (sterling) of a state it has left and over which it has no control, and an application to join a European Union whose rules insist on its adoption of a currency (the euro) the SNP leaders do not wish to join\u201d. Scotland would be separated from its largest export market, which is the rest of the UK, by a hard customs border; there would be no equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/11/northernireland.northernireland\">the Belfast agreement</a>, an enforceable international treaty, to soften it.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/what-is-barnett-formula-how-work-scotland-wales-northern-ireland\"> Barnett formula</a> by which the Treasury allots a higher rate of per capita public expenditure in Scotland would go, and with it, by Lloyd\u2019s reckoning, an annual subsidy of between \u00a38bn and \u00a310bn that helps sustain Scotland\u2019s idea of itself as the last British redoubt of the welfare state: free university education, free medical prescriptions and free home care. Oil revenues aren\u2019t what they were, and they never will be again. Most forecasts, including those of the Scottish National Party, predict the need for cuts amounting to as much as a fifth in public spending unless taxes are raised significantly. In the short to medium term, an independent Scotland would inevitably face turbulence and economic decline. Lloyd writes in a memorable sentence that for the SNP\u2019s leaders \u201cthe prospect, for all their public confidence, must be, in reflective moments, terrifying.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae0024971bdf17642ea4d8045650178bb5e6ca4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0024971bdf17642ea4d8045650178bb5e6ca4c/0_225_3500_2101/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Alex Salmond outside his home on the day of the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Salmond outside his home on the day of the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so it must \u2013 as terrifying, in fact, as the economic prospect that should have terrified Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other members of the Tory groupuscule that has led the UK out of Europe. Just like Brexiters in the European referendum campaign, the most zealous Scottish nationalists write off these dire forecasts as \u201cproject fear\u201d. Forgetting that the original project fear contained warnings that proved well founded (don\u2019t trust in the constancy of oil revenues, for example), they march through Scottish cities turning their streets into a sea of white and blue, demanding a second referendum on independence \u2013 now!</p> <p>The author cuts them no slack. In his view, Scottish nationalism as a popular cause rests on fanciful assumptions of difference and moral superiority. \u201cA confident statement of long-term, deeply embedded difference between the English and the Scots in character, habits, and outlook is rarely possible, though the nationalists attempt to encourage it,\u201d he writes, citing the SNP leadership\u2019s stress on the openness of Scottish society to immigration, compared with the \u201cgrudging, even hostile attitudes\u201d that Scottish nationalists imply are those of the English, when England is the far more multicultural and diverse country. Likewise, the belief that Scotland is inherently more social democratic is hard to justify; the furthest that surveys of social attitudes will go is only that Scotland is \u201csomewhat\u201d more so. As for a greater attachment to European identity, similar surveys show that historically the EU hasn\u2019t excited the Scots any more than the English (more than a third of Scottish votes were for Brexit, after all), though that has changed since 2016. In other words, as the commentator Alex Massie recently wrote, \u201cScotland has more in common with the rest of the United Kingdom, even after Brexit, than it does with anywhere else on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>The SNP\u2019s two most successful leaders, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, always recognised this fact and took care to build the secessionist case on different grounds from cultural and social oppression, as summarised in the cry of \u201cFreedom!\u201d that rings out from the Mel Gibson/William Wallace character in <em>Braveheart</em>. Leery \u2013 and lacking the inspirational grievances \u2013 of \u201cheroic\u201d nationalism, they chose better governance and greater prosperity as their objectives, with Scotland imagined in Salmond\u2019s phrase as \u201cthe Saudia Arabia of renewable energy\u201d. Lloyd doubts that this reasoned, civic nationalism is what fuels the popular movement, which now \u201crelies heavily on a distrust, a dislike [of England], most strongly expressed by some of Scotland\u2019s most prominent writers, furthered by the nationalist leadership through a relentless depiction of the British political and governing class as chronically out of touch, London-centred and determined to impoverish Scotland with policies of austerity\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd383d58e9930c6d9bd459cac3e7f32169c5a4ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd383d58e9930c6d9bd459cac3e7f32169c5a4ec/0_192_2387_1431/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Mel Gibson as William Wallace in Braveheart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel Gibson as William Wallace in <em>Braveheart</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The writers he has in mind include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/03/theobserver.uknews3\">Tom Nairn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/05/james-kelman-my-writing-day\">James Kelman</a>, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/30/alasdair-gray-lanark-sarah-ditum-appreciation\">Alasdair Gray</a>, and the long-dead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/25/hugh-macdiarmid-robert-burns-scots-vernacular-poetry-auld-lang-syne\">Hugh MacDiarmid</a>. Some prize quotations are summoned. Gray divided English people who came to live in Scotland into two categories: \u201csettlers\u201d, who have the same status as \u201cthe Italians who brought us fish and chips\u201d, and \u201ccolonists\u201d, who can \u201clook forward to a future back in England through promotion or by retirement\u201d. Kelman refused, and refuses, to read English (as opposed to any other country\u2019s) literature on the evidence-free grounds that: \u201cWhy would you want to read things that were treating you as an animal?\u201d Scottish attitudes towards England more generally are difficult to gauge, but if hostility towards it exists as a significant factor in Scottish politics then the tone and personnel of the present Westminster government seem unlikely to bring about any decrease.</p> <p>Which brings us to a paradox. A book that is severely critical of Scottish nationalism becomes kindness itself when it turns to English nationalism. The author berates the SNP on many fronts: that it has never properly engaged with the difficulties that independence will bring; that its social and economic policies post-independence are either vague or absent; that it perpetuates Scotland\u2019s proud but naive idea of itself as a nation of \u201cconfident globalists, well able to fend for themselves in the world\u2019s market place, requiring to be protected from no peoples other than the English\u201d.</p> <p>This is the author as a sceptical, scolding father figure. When he moves south a maternal side emerges, anxious to understand and forgive. The obvious similarities between nationalists north of the border and Brexiters south of it \u2013 their delusions as \u201cconfident globalists\u201d, their need for enemies (London, Brussels), and their economic recklessness \u2013 are never invoked. English nationalism, Lloyd writes, has been characterised as a rightwing endeavour with its psychological origins in English/British exceptionalism and the empire. All wrong. In fact, he says, the blame must go to \u201cthe Englishman\u2019s burden of the three Celtic statelets\u201d, which were never grateful enough to England for their subsidies. While Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland got their devolved assemblies, England continued to be powerless and \u201cenforcibly enfolded\u201d inside Britain and the Union flag. It felt ignored and resentful. By this logic, Scottish nationalism and not the Bruges Group forged the first link in Brexit\u2019s causal chain.</p> <p>He takes on the imperial argument with unusual literalness.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\"> Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> is described as \u201cin some ways the opposite of an imperialist\u201d because he believes in the free market \u2013 as though this division in 19th-century Britain was anywhere near as clear-cut. Every Rees-Mogg mannerism suggests the word \u201cempire\u201d: his drawling superiority; his idolisation of martial figures such as generals Gordon and Napier (who thought the best way to \u201cquieten\u201d a conquered country was \u201ca good thrashing first and great kindness afterwards\u201d). Lloyd quotes a speech by Rees-Mogg in praise of free trade, but even here the MP for North East Somerset can\u2019t help but sound imperial: \u201cBritain has been called on to be a shaper not only of our destiny but that of the whole world.\u201d And Brexit critics such as Fintan O\u2019Toole (to whom Lloyd takes especial exception) are, after all, not suggesting that Rees-Mogg and his colleagues want to march into Matabeleland with rifle, flag and drum, only that an emotional residue from Britain\u2019s era as the supreme power bloats their view of England\u2019s capability and destiny.</p> <p>Lloyd himself often reaches back to his upbringing in East Fife, in a fishing town that in the 1950s and 60s was far more \u201cScottish\u201d than it is now, though that identity, like most others, has never been a simple thing. His grandfather repaired fishing boats; his mother was a hairdresser; he never knew his English father; his Polish stepfather worked in the mines. He evokes life there more than half-a-century ago with a lively eye for the particular, to show how a distinctive local identity could flourish within a political culture that was unionist and led from London.</p> <p>His book is never better than when it attacks Scottish ideas of English oppression. Where it fails is its refusal to recognise that England has changed \u2013 from a stable and predictable neighbour into a volatile, abrasive and rather friendless country going who-knows-where. Lloyd suggests some form of federalism will hold the UK together, and wants future referendums to stipulate a majority of at least 60% before the status quo can be changed. Good ideas, probably: we know how divisive narrow majorities can be. But where are the federalists? And where is the SNP politician saintly enough to accept this higher bar when the Brexiters now in power were delighted to accept a much lower one? Forces great and small, the pandemic on the one hand and Salmond\u2019s trial on the other, have made the Union\u2019s future anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot: The Great Mistake of Scottish Independence is published by Polity (\u00a320).</em></p>",

  "<p>The UK\u2019s efforts to cut greenhouse gases are being undermined by a failure to put in place climate policies that cover imported goods, research has found.</p> <p>The government is committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/12/what-will-it-take-for-the-uk-to-reach-net-zero-emissions\">cutting the UK\u2019s carbon output to net zero by 2050</a>, and emissions have been falling for the past three decades. But that does not take into account the \u201cinvisible\u201d side of Britain\u2019s carbon footprint, which comes from international travel and the carbon produced overseas to make goods that are used here.</p> <p>About half of Britain\u2019s true carbon footprint is made up of these sources, according to a report from the conservation charity WWF.</p> <p>Emissions associated with imports to the UK, including international travel, have risen from about 316m tonnes of carbon in 1990 to 360m tonnes in 2016 and 358m tonnes in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. These imported emissions can vary substantially from year to year, but have been broadly steady or rising, though they are down from a peak of 449m in 2007, before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Over the same period, between 1990 and 2016, the UK\u2019s own carbon emissions fell by more than 40%, thanks mainly to a long switch away from coal-fired power to gas and renewable sources of electricity, according to the report published on Thursday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/21/britain-is-g7s-biggest-net-importer-of-co2-emissions-per-capita-says-ons\">The carbon associated with the manufacture of imported goods</a> appears in the carbon accounts of the manufacturing country. However, some countries have less stringent carbon targets than others, and developing countries may struggle to use low-carbon methods as they pursue economic growth. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airlines-lobby-to-rewrite-carbon-deal-due-to-coronavirus\">International aviation</a> is not covered by countries\u2019 national carbon targets, under the UN climate talks and the Paris agreement.</p> <p>\u201cIf all other countries were going for net zero too, then this [invisible carbon footprint] wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d said the author of the report, John Barrett, a professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Leeds. \u201cThe UK should be showing leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Policies to ensure that goods allowed to be imported had a lower carbon footprint \u2013 such as requirements on the efficiency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/the-right-to-repair-planned-obsolescence-electronic-waste-mountain\">repairability</a> and recycling of electric and electronic goods \u2013 could have a major impact on the invisible side of Britain\u2019s carbon footprint, he added. Exporters would have an incentive to reduce their carbon footprint and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/eu-brings-in-right-to-repair-rules-for-phones-and-tablets\">emissions associated with using their goods</a>.</p> <p>Other changes to people\u2019s habits could also bear fruit, for instance, encouraging a move to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/28/meat-of-the-matter-the-inconvenient-truth-about-what-we-eat\">healthier diet</a> with more vegetables and less meat could change food imports and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">carbon associated with them</a>, said Barrett.</p> <p>The question of how to account for the emissions associated with imports is a vexed and polarising one, with some green campaigners arguing that developed countries should accept responsibility for emissions generated overseas, while other economists point out that the manufacturing countries have been paid for the goods.</p> <p>Josh Burke, a policy fellow at the Grantham research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: \u201cUsing consumption accounting to understand trade flows is a useful exercise in light of the current global disruptions to supply chains and geopolitical tensions that have seen trade walls erected. Policies to shift consumption patterns and lower imports emissions \u2013 such as border carbon adjustments \u2013 are an elegant economic solution, based on equity and efficiency, rather than protectionism.\u201d</p> <p>The EU is considering such border adjustments \u2013 in effect, carbon taxes on imports \u2013 to take into account the carbon generated by their manufacture, as part of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European green deal</a>. But this is complex, said Burke. Such policies \u201ctend to get bogged down in the politics of implementation and discussions often get sucked backed into protectionist agendas. As the UK begins to negotiate a raft of new free trade agreements, the optics of such a policy may in fact hinder international cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>The UK will host the next UN climate talks, originally set for November in Glasgow but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/we-must-use-this-time-well-climate-experts-hopeful-after-cop26-delay-coronavirus\">delayed to next year by the coronavirus crisis</a>. This gives ministers the opportunity to encourage other countries to bring forward strong plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and to offer assistance to poor countries that could benefit by building their low-carbon export sectors, according to Stephen Cornelius, the chief climate adviser at WWF.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not be avoiding imports, but we should help other countries to reduce their carbon intensity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK should work with other countries to bring forward high-ambition plans\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">under the Paris agreement</a>.</p> <p>Barrett warned that ministers could be tempted, in drawing up plans for the economy to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">recover from the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">virus crisis</a>, to pursue trade deals at any cost, without regard to their environmental impacts. \u201cWe have the option to improve standards, to encourage a low-carbon economy, or a race to the bottom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would undermine our environmental and social capital.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s domestic emissions fall under the Climate Change Act, under which the government must meet carbon budgets set out by the independent Committee on Climate Change several years in advance.</p> <p>The CCC has recommended that the UK continue to base its commitments on its \u201cterritorial\u201d emissions, as this is the agreed international practice, but also keep track of emissions based on the consumption of goods from overseas and the implications of that trade.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global cases pass 2 million mark</h2> <p>There are 2,064,115 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The number of people who have died so far in the crisis stands at 137,020. The US is the worst-affected country in terms of infections and the number of deaths, with 639,055 cases \u2013 nearly a third of the world\u2019s total \u2013 and 30,925 fatalities.</p> <h2>IMF says Asia will suffer zero economic growth this year</h2> <p>Asia\u2019s economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the coronavirus crisis takes an \u201cunprecedented\u201d toll on the region\u2019s service sector and major export destinations, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. The IMF expects a 7.6% expansion in Asian economic growth next year on the assumption that containment policies succeed, but added the outlook was highly uncertain.</p> <h2>Trump fuels virus lab theory </h2> <p>The US president has added credence to a theory that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/trump-us-coronavirus-theory-china\">pandemic began when the pathogen accidentally escaped a Wuhan laboratory</a>, and has further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/trump-wades-further-into-china-covid-19-row-as-focus-turns-to-easing-lockdowns\">questioned China\u2019s figures on the outbreak</a>. Responding to a question from Fox News on the lab, he said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to say that John, but I will tell you more and more we\u2019re hearing the story.\u201d </p> <p>New guidelines are set to emerge on Thursday for some US states to ease their lockdowns, with Trump saying governors \u201cchamping at the bit\u201d to reopen. Trump did not back down on his decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization.</p> <h2>South Korea\u2019s ruling party wins landslide victory</h2> <p>President Moon Jae-in\u2019s left-leaning Democratic party and its smaller affiliate won 180 seats in the 300-seat assembly \u2013 the biggest majority in the national assembly by any party since South Korea\u2019s transition to democracy in 1987, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/south-koreas-ruling-party-wins-election-landslide-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic turned the political tide in Moon\u2019s favour</a>.</p> <h2>Almost 700 sailors on French aircraft carrier test positive</h2> <p>At least 668 sailors assigned to the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle\u2019s naval group tested positive for the virus, and results are still not in from a third of the tests from 1,767 mariners. In other news from France, Amazon has ordered the temporary closure of all six of its French distribution centres after a French court ruled it was not doing enough to protect its workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>Big events unlikely to resume until 2021, says LA mayor</h2> <p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday it is unlikely concerts and sporting events will resume until at least 2021, as the city continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Garcetti\u2019s comments echo those of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and California governor Gavin Newsom, both of whom said it will be a long time before gatherings of 100 or more people are commonplace again.</p> <h2>Debt burden eased for poorer countries</h2> <p>G20 finance ministers have agreed to suspend poorer countries\u2019 debt payments to help them prepare for increased spending on healthcare. The measure takes effect from 1 May and lasts until the end of the year. The IMF said Asia\u2019s economic growth would grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the crisis takes an \u201cunprecedented\u201d toll on the service sector and major export destinations.</p> <h2>Ten Britons and a UK stranded in Peru after missing repatriation flight</h2> <p>Ten Britons and a UK resident have been left stranded in Cusco, Peru, after missing a UK repatriation flight on Wednesday because a military aircraft which had been sent to collect them refused to let them board after landing and taking off twice, they say.</p>",

Helping them prevent disaster is not only right, he suggests, but in our own interests; so long as infection lingers anywhere in the world, it will keep coming back to countries who think they have beaten it. \u201cThis is not some abstract globalist thing,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of us are going to be properly safe until all countries are free of this.\u201d</p> <p>So, what does he make of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/trump-turns-against-who-to-mask-his-own-stark-failings-on-covid-19-crisis\">withdraw funding from the World Health Organization</a> (WHO) mid-pandemic, seen in some quarters as an attempt to distract from the president\u2019s handling of the outbreak in the US?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s illogical, it is counter-productive, it\u2019s really sabotaging the efforts to coordinate global health and it\u2019s an act of self-harm because it will rebound to hurt America,\u201d he says, bluntly. \u201cIf the next wave of the virus comes out of Africa because the WHO and others have not been able to help them contain and suppress the disease, then no doubt President Trump will blame Africa and demonise them as well as the WHO.\u201d Yet he hopes the US may still fund some arm\u2019s length WHO initiatives on coronavirus, and insists he hasn\u2019t given up on a global response: \u201cI still don\u2019t rule out getting countries round the world to bring China and America back into cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>Brown has persuaded more than 200 ex-leaders and ministers, economists and medical experts to back detailed proposals for global cooperation that he hopes will make the agenda of this week\u2019s meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The open letter they have signed calls for a global pledging conference where governments could collectively agree to fund the search for a vaccine, treatments, ventilators and personal protective equipment worldwide. Instead of competing for scarce stocks, Brown wants countries to cooperate in boosting supply for all. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt if there was greater global coordination you could solve many of the problems that we face in this country \u2013 but also other countries are facing \u2013 about the lack of test kits, the lack of protective clothing, the lack of ventilators.\u201d</p> <p>The letter also calls for a taskforce of the G20 group of powerful nations to agree assistance for developing countries, plus joint interventions to stop a global recession becoming a 1930s-style depression<strong>.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe<strong> </strong>fear people have is that a liquidity crisis in companies becomes a solvency crisis, and a recession becomes a depression and that\u2019s what we have got to avoid,\u201d says Brown. \u201cAction can be taken to minimise the number of weeks and months the economy is closed down, or at least partially closed down, but the international action is important.\u201d The economic repercussions of the virus are, he thinks, \u201cbigger than the global financial crisis and there\u2019s no doubt that they are as big in some countries as the Great Depression\u201d.</p> <p>He flatly refuses to criticise Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the epidemic, from shortages of protective clothing to the timing of lockdown. But isn\u2019t his letter tacit recognition that current leaders are failing? He sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back on what decisions have been made, I want to look forward to see what decisions could be made in the future. We aren\u2019t trying to criticise, we are trying to encourage.\u201d The convalescing prime minister, he insists, has his sympathy. \u201cI feel sorry for Boris Johnson, because at the moment, when the greatest call upon executive action is being made, he\u2019s found himself out of it. That must be very frustrating and very sad.\u201d Asked if he\u2019s in touch with Johnson, his stand-in, Dominic Raab, or Sunak, Brown says only that he\u2019s \u201ctalking to people who are in touch with the decision-making in government\u201d.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t he frustrated, lacking the power to do what he feels needs doing? A burst of laughter, which I suspect disguises a yes, rolls down the line. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few ideas that might be able to be helpful, but I\u2019m not claiming anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this strikes closer to home than he cares to admit. It\u2019s when I ask how he is coping personally with lockdown that he momentarily falters. \u201cFor me it\u2019s uh \u2026 you know, we had to protect our son so we had to take action quite quickly.\u201d Gordon and Sarah Brown\u2019s son Fraser, 13, has the lung condition cystic fibrosis and government advice is to shield sufferers from the virus. It is a sensitive subject, the Browns guard the boys\u2019 privacy fiercely (they also have an older son, 16-year-old John). Brown doesn\u2019t want to discuss how this affects his political mission, but eventually says gruffly: \u201cWhat I do know is all of us have had to deal with a crisis at one point in our life, so you do feel whenever there\u2019s a crisis you have got to act quickly. That\u2019s what\u2019s motivating me at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>We are on safer ground discussing the books getting him through lockdown. He\u2019s just ordered the novelist Linda Grant\u2019s latest (he found her 2000 book When I Lived in Modern Times, the story of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">Jew from </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">the East End of London moving to what was then </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">Palestine</a>, \u201camazing\u201d) and is ploughing through policy proposals to retrain people out of work during lockdown. At 68, he scoffs at the notion of retiring: \u201cNobody retires now!\u201d</p> <p>But nor does Brown crave a comeback. When he surfaced on the BBC\u2019s Today programme in March, a wave of nostalgia surged through Twitter and he got some \u201cvery generous\u201d messages from the public. But while Tony Blair remains a political player, Brown doesn\u2019t regret leaving London to live quietly in his old constituency of Dunfermline East after losing the 2010 election.</p> <p>\u201cI used to say my best advice is not to take my advice,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI\u2019ve not involved myself in business or anything else and I\u2019ve not interfered in the Labour party. I\u2019ve just tried to do what I can to help various causes. I don\u2019t think former leaders should claim any special privileges or insights. There may be occasions when your experience is of use but you should be modest enough to realise that you\u2019ve got a new group of leaders and it\u2019s their time.\u201d He has discussed his proposals with Labour\u2019s new leader, Keir Starmer, but<strong> </strong>\u201cit\u2019s up to him to decide what he wants to do. I wish him well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/05/gordon-brown-backs-keir-starmer-for-labour-leader\">I think he\u2019s an excellent choice.</a>\u201d</p> <p>He tweeted that Starmer\u2019s was the team that could return Labour to power, so why does he think Starmer can succeed where Jeremy Corbyn failed? \u201cBecause Keir\u2019s very good,\u201d he begins, before spotting the trap and declining to discuss domestic politics.</p> <p>Why does he think countries have been initially slow to cooperate against coronavirus? \u201cIn the first few years after 2010 there was a sort of defensive nationalism \u2013 protectionism, tariffs, building walls, people putting import controls down. I think in the last year or two, it\u2019s been a more aggressive nationalism,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an atmosphere that is a problem. But I think people have got to stop re-running the debate between globalists and nationalists. This is about saving lives.\u201d</p> <p>Brown reckons a moratorium on debt interest repayments owed by the poorest countries could, for example, release \u00a340bn for health and social protection. \u201cThat\u2019s almost a decision that if you made today, the countries could act on it tomorrow.\u201d But some will surely need IMF bailouts, reliant on richer countries\u2019 willingness to finance them.</p> <p>During the banking crisis, Brown was working 20-hour days, knowing that if his recapitalisation plan failed and banking collapsed then anarchy could follow. What advice can he give leaders operating now under similar pressure? \u201cFor me, it was a huge challenge. You know people didn\u2019t always agree with the way I did it ... but you\u2019ve got to quickly understand what\u2019s needed to be done, and then you\u2019ve got to mobilise every possible resource to do it. Some of the methods you use are controversial, but you\u2019ve got to take the widest possible view.\u201d</p> <p>His mistake, he suggests, was succeeding in emerging from recession, but failing to convey the case for running a fiscal deficit to do so. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to be thinking of what happens next. In Britain at the moment we\u2019ve got to get out of the immediate crisis, but then you\u2019ve got this issue of which companies are going to survive after you\u2019ve solved the medical problem.\u201d</p> <p>This Gordon Brown is mellower than the rather defensive one I encountered in office, perhaps as a result of no longer being constantly attacked. If it hurts to see the Tories lauded for turning Keynesian overnight, it doesn\u2019t show.</p> <p>\u201cThe irony is that 10 years ago, the conventional wisdom was that running a deficit, as Keynes had argued in the 1930s, wasn\u2019t fashionable,\u201d he says philosophically. \u201cI think we were right then and I think people accept that we did the right thing, but we got penalised for it. Now there\u2019s a better understanding that if economic activity in your economy collapses then the only organisation that can come in is the government. To be honest, it\u2019s sad that what happened in 2010 led to austerity and everything else, because that was the inevitable consequence of not understanding that you had to run a fiscal deficit to deal with the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Brown won\u2019t say how the current bailouts should ultimately be paid for, but thinks one legacy of the virus may be greater aversion to risk. \u201cThere\u2019s climate change, there\u2019s cybersecurity issues, nuclear proliferation issues. People in this generation are going to be more aware that the balance of risk and security has to be examined and that will raise questions about what people expect of government.\u201d</p> <p>If anything, he thinks enforced separation under lockdown has encouraged such solidarity. \u201cBeing isolated, people realise the need to be connected, the importance they attach to friendship, the importance of acting as a community.<strong>\u201d</strong></p> <p>After years of separatist political movements, from Scottish independence to Brexit, is this crisis illustrating the dangers of separation?</p> <p>\u201cIt becomes a moment where we have got to make a choice,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t cooperate on this, then it doesn\u2019t say much about the world and I do think people in the end will.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And so I leave him to his phone calls; cloistered from the world now, but forever looking out.</p>",
  "<p>It is only four months since Boris Johnson led the Conservative party to a historic victory. His 80-seat majority seemed to recast the electoral landscape for a generation. It also marked another milestone in Brexit\u2019s transformation of the Conservative party from the party of business to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-exposed-myth-british-exceptionalism\">party of the flag</a>. Today, that seems like another world.</p> <p>Everything has been upended by Covid-19. The business of government is wholly taken up with protecting public health, keeping the economy on life support and, in Johnson\u2019s own case, his personal survival. Today the national lockdown is expected to be extended into May. </p> <p>It seems likely that the Britain which eventually emerges from the coronavirus crisis will be a country of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/life-never-return-normal-coronavirus-shape-generation\">significantly different temper</a> from the Britain that went into it. Nobody can be certain about the degree of change. The possibility that the economy may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">shrink by a third</a>, with millions of job losses, is a reality check about a more enduringly difficult new normal. The post-pandemic Conservative party must adapt too. But in what ways?</p> <p>Future British politics will not shake down into a binary choice between the economy and public health. The need to restore both will be far messier than that. Political horizons will simultaneously be very wide \u2013 global issues of health, supply chains, travel, information and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-spy-agencies-urge-china-rethink-once-covid-19-crisis-is-over\">Chinese power</a> will surge up the agenda \u2013 and very narrow: local issues about safe ways to work, earn, live and survive a future pandemic will matter more too. Politics will be more fragile, fearful and dynamic.</p> <p>While the pandemic and the lockdown hold sway, the official Conservative position is to ensure the least bad of all possibilities. The policy can be summed up by Rishi Sunak\u2019s comments this week. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e95ec7f8f082c29014b0d77#block-5e95ec7f8f082c29014b0d77\">single most important thing</a> we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people,\u201d said the chancellor on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health.\u201d</p> <p>However, once discussion moves on to the so-called exit strategy and to the post-Covid future, as it is now beginning to do, this begins to change. The choices do not suddenly become absolute. Instead they become competing calculations of the balance of risk in the interaction between the economy and public health, as and when the pandemic wanes. That has to be one of the reasons why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/keir-starmer-calls-for-ministers-to-set-out-plans-to-end-coronavirus-lockdown\">Keir Starmer is pressing the government</a> to publish its strategy. He knows this will reveal faultlines and compromises that an opposition can exploit without appearing partisan or unpatriotic.</p> <p>There are some signs of those tensions already appearing within Conservative ranks. Sajid Javid, Sunak\u2019s more fiscally cautious predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/free-market-is-only-way-to-revive-our-economy-l8h066t75\">warned this week</a> against mortgaging the future, and said low taxes remained key to kickstarting the economic recovery. Theresa May and several of her ex-ministers, including Philip Hammond, believe something similar. But Johnson will want to go on spending, not reinventing austerity. So will the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who will press for a large programme of resilience measures in health and social care to guard against a future pandemic. The new Tory MPs from the former industrial areas will agree with them. So, at least for now, will Sunak.</p> <p>Where this process of change will eventually lead the Tory party is difficult to predict. Sunak\u2019s autumn budget \u2013 in which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/17/theresa-may-conservative-tory-policy-older-people-pay-for-social-care\">social care agenda that was abandoned in 2017</a> will surely have to be a central focus \u2013 looms increasingly as a vital moment. But all this will surely generate a rather different party, and with rather different priorities, from the one that Johnson led to victory last December.</p> <p>Whether the Tory party successfully embraces the choices that will now face it depends overwhelmingly on Johnson himself. After 2019, the party is unusually dependent on the man at the top. The reshuffled cabinet consists mainly of minister of state-level players whom Johnson dominates from No 10. Its lack of depth has been cruelly exposed in the crisis. The party remains very much Johnson\u2019s own brand, held together by his inimitable personality and popularity.</p> <p>For as long as Johnson remains out of action, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/a-tudor-court-without-a-king-inside-no-10-as-raab-takes-the-reins\">important choices</a> about the party\u2019s direction are likely to be deferred. The party which, only a few weeks ago, Johnson and Dominic Cummings were building on the basis of Brexit and the anger of the left-behind is becoming less relevant by the day in the shadow of coronavirus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-had-made-the-bbcs-balancing-act-even-harder\">Coronavirus has made the BBC's balancing act even harder | Tom Mills</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dissonance between the new realities and the recent past is now huge. Instead of the old contempt towards experts, competence and seriousness, there is now a craving for all three to help steer a safe course through the Covid-19 crisis. The idea that the government\u2019s post-pandemic priorities might include lighting fires under the BBC, the civil service and the universities therefore seems even more destructive now than before. The idea that Britain should be a Brexit buccaneer, turning its back resolutely against Europe and throwing itself into the arms of Donald Trump seems even more irresponsible.</p> <p>As one former minister put it to me this week: \u201cThe party that was being created in the wake of the election was a new one. It was based on a cultural backlash against liberalism and established elites at home and abroad. But that doesn\u2019t feel to me like what the country wants now. It doesn\u2019t want divisive politics. It doesn\u2019t want a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-culture-war-lockdown-economy\">culture war</a>. This feels like a moment to step away from a lot of that.\u201d Whether to take that step away will be very much Johnson\u2019s own decision. But it is a decision with momentous implications for the Tory party and for the whole of British party politics.</p> <p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>In a revelation that may confound those who take a hyper-partisan view of politics, Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new memoir outlines the part he played in the establishment of Guardian Australia.</p> <p>As Turnbull writes, in the seven years we have been operating, Guardian Australia has only rarely endorsed his or his government\u2019s policies.</p> <p>Since we are a progressive publication and he is a politician of the centre right, that should hardly come as a shock. But his part in our establishment might surprise some who approach relationships between the media and politicians on terms of mutually beneficial transactions. We don\u2019t work that way.</p> <p>\u201cI was beginning to despair about the state of Australian journalism,\u201d Turnbull writes in A Bigger Picture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/16/malcolm-turnbull-new-book-memoir-bigger-picture-scott-morrison\">\u2018Scott is a control freak\u2019: what Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new book tells us about his relationship with Morrison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t especially concerned about the political slant of one outlet or another, but more about the fact that newsrooms were shrinking and editorial standards were dropping to the loopy standards of the twittersphere. Gina Rinehart was threatening to buy Fairfax \u2013 no doubt so that its newspapers could emulate her own ultra-rightwing views.</p> <p>\u201cIn June 2012, I suggested to Alan Rusbridger, editor of the UK\u2019s Guardian, that he should establish an Australian edition. For a modest cost, he could start a digital-only edition. That would provide a good base from which to build. Alan was interested. We exchanged some rough numbers and he concluded he\u2019d need $20m of underwriting for three years \u2013 if it couldn\u2019t get to break-even in that time, it never would.</p> <p>\u201cGiven my political role, I could hardly participate myself, but I thought I knew someone who would. Graeme Wood had made hundreds of millions of dollars from an online travel booking business called Wotif. He was on the political left and had been generous in the past to the Greens. He\u2019d also recently funded a progressive free online newspaper called the Global Mail. It wasn\u2019t going to make it. So, I suggested to Graeme he drop the Global Mail and instead use his fortune to bankroll an Australian edition of the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIts progressive politics suited him plus it was one of the greatest newspapers in the English language, nearly 200 years old and, unusually, wasn\u2019t controlled by any media mogul but rather an independent trust dedicated to \u2018quality, independent liberal journalism\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOnce Graeme Wood was on board, I introduced Rusbridger to two seasoned Canberra political writers, Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy (AKA murpharoo). He sent his deputy, Kath Viner, to Australia to be the first editor. The (digital) paper exceeded expectations, broke even after a few years and Wood got all his money back. Clearly, my deal-making skills remained intact.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s recollection skips over a long and complicated process that followed those initial introductions, after which Turnbull had no further involvement as far as I know. I had some early conversations with Rusbridger about the Australian media landscape and then waited; first to hear from Rusbridger about whether his discussions with Wood had amounted to anything, then to meet Viner when she came to Australia, and then to find out whether she had appointed me to her team. It took almost a year.</p> <p>Rusbridger has also written about the process in his own memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/breaking-news-by-alan-rusbridger-review-the-remaking-of-journalism-and-why-it-matters-now\">Breaking News</a>, published two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIn the autumn of 2012 I had a weekend call from a senior Australian politician. He planted the idea that we should think of starting an Australian edition of the website. The Murdoch domination of the Australian press scene was overwhelming, but it had been historically counterbalanced to some extent by the Fairfax titles, especially the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. But the Fairfax group was at that moment in some danger of being taken over by Australia\u2019s richest person, an iron ore magnate named Gina Rinehart. In 2017, Forbes valued her personal wealth at $16bn: she could have financed Fairfax from her small change. The group\u2019s journalists feared she would turn the papers into cheerleaders for the mining industry. Suddenly Australia\u2019s media scene looked very unbalanced indeed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/14/guardian-australia-doubles-audience-to-become-fourth-most-popular-news-site-in-the-country\">Guardian Australia doubles audience to become fourth most popular news site in the country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a nice idea, but unaffordable, unless a philanthropist, concerned about media plurality, could be found to support the idea. Within weeks, such a figure emerged, Graeme Wood, a digital entrepreneur in his 60s who was passionate about the environment. He was willing to underwrite for the first few years. If we turned Guardian Australia into a going concern, we\u2019d pay him back. If not, he was happy to write the investment off. It was an interesting new model of financing journalism. Wood obviously had to understand he would have no say at all in the editorial stance of the operation. It appeared he did.\u201d</p> <p>For me, joining Guardian Australia was a career-defining leap into the unknown, from a job I loved at the then Fairfax papers to a digital startup that was at the time more hope and ideas than a reality.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/27/brutal-end-for-fairfax-media-changing-change-it-for-good\">As I\u2019ve written before</a>, my motivation was to introduce a new voice into one of the most concentrated media markets in the world, to help build a quality, independent news option in a media landscape that had already started to crumble.</p> <p>Even before we learned that Rusbridger and Wood were talking, Katharine Murphy and I had been thinking about ways we might start up a new online political publication, a conversation we paused to see what became of the idea of establishing the Guardian in Australia and whether we would have roles in it.</p> <p>Three years after Guardian Australia\u2019s 2013 launch I was appointed as editor.

Trump, clad in a baseball cap, strode into the Situation Room for a meeting with the coronavirus task force. He didn\u2019t stop by the group\u2019s daily meetings often, but he had an idea he was eager to share: He wanted to start a White House talk radio show.<br></p> <p>At the time, the virus was rapidly spreading across the country, and Mr. Trump would soon announce a ban on European travel. A talk radio show, Mr. Trump excitedly explained, would allow him to quell Americans\u2019 fears and answer their questions about the pandemic directly, according to three White House officials who heard the pitch. There would be no screening, he said, just an open line for people to call and engage one-on-one with the president.</p> <p>But that Saturday, almost as suddenly as he proposed it, the president outlined one reason he would not be moving forward with it: He did not want to compete with Rush Limbaugh.</p> <p>No one in the room was sure how to respond, two of the officials said. Someone suggested hosting the show in the mornings or on weekends, to steer clear of the conservative radio host\u2019s schedule. But Mr. Trump shook his head, saying he envisioned his show as two hours a day, every day. And were it not for Mr. Limbaugh, and the risk of encroaching on his territory, he reiterated, he would do it.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Trump had gone through with the idea, it\u2019s likely he would have faced severe criticism for spending two hours a day hosting a call-in show as the country struggled through a growing pandemic. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9751118f08cf571cdb1af4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-gabbatt\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T18:35:13.338Z\">7.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Lock her up' protests against Michigan governor</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88c8c9af17ad9582784cf234b4a59bf9c309eee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88c8c9af17ad9582784cf234b4a59bf9c309eee5/118_0_3601_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Perreca protests on the front steps of the Michigan State Capitol building in Lansing, Michigan today.
