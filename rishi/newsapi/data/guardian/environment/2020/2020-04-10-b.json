No. Do we have enough PPE? No.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump snapped: \u201cA lot of it is fake news \u2026 This is not happy talk. Maybe it is happy talk for you. It is not happy talk for me.

We all have to be resilient.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Embracing everyday moments</strong></h2> <p>The good news for parents is that children learn best through everyday moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3949ebbfe6af2498d0041d5f95a11b8622e9dfe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3949ebbfe6af2498d0041d5f95a11b8622e9dfe2/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grover coughs into his elbow, in line with the show\u2019s advice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grover coughs into his elbow, in line with the show\u2019s advice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sesame Workshop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her book Sesame Street: Ready for School! A Parent\u2019s Guide to Playful Learning for Children Ages 2 to 5, Truglio writes about turning everyday tasks into learning moments. Enlisting kids to create a shopping list can be a way to use the alphabet and build vocabulary. Building towers with blocks can mean talking about shapes, width and height. <a href=\"https://medium.com/sesame-street-caring-for-each-other/sesame-streets-tips-for-families-at-home-drawing-cooking-and-moving-together-55a76369e48e\">Cooking dinner or doing laundry</a> is a chance to practice math and measurements.</p> <p>A key, said Truglio, is to make learning playful. \u201cLean in and follow your child\u2019s interest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not good is to do flashcards and rote learning. It\u2019s not very interesting. When children are playing, they\u2019re activated, they\u2019re invested in the learning. When they are trying to solve a problem, they learn through trial and error. They learn not to give up.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Coping with the \u2018for-now normal\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The pandemic is presenting a new kind of trauma, explained Akimi Gibson, vice-president and education publisher at Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. \u201cThis trauma is universal. It has no cultural or economic bias. And it caught us all equally by surprise,\u201d Gibson said. .</p> <p><a href=\"https://childmind.org/article/how-trauma-affects-kids-school/\">Research attests</a> to the negative impact trauma has on child development \u2013 whether it stems from poverty, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/12/sesame-street-characters-mom-has-an-addiction-experts-say-thats-valuable-lesson/\">parent addicted to drugs</a>, or a global outbreak. That\u2019s why Sesame Street is leaning into the \u201cfor-now normal\u201d, as the program creators are referring to the moment, by providing tips and resources for talking and listening to children in its recently launched \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sesamestreet.org/caring\">Caring for Each Other</a>\u201d initiative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07932861d743c6940c1a33b403cdfbf95c0e982f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07932861d743c6940c1a33b403cdfbf95c0e982f/0_2_2060_1237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elmo works with a child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Lean in and follow your child\u2019s interest,\u2019 says Rosemarie Truglio of learning at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sesame Workshop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have to realize this is a new way to look at trauma\u201d, said <a href=\"https://www.sesameworkshop.org/who-we-are/our-leadership/jeanette-betancourt\">Jeanette Betancourt</a>, senior vice-president of Sesame Workshop\u2019s US social impact. \u201cBut most importantly, we need to ask how we can best support children in the most traumatic times, when their voices are often lost.\u201d</p> <p>If you listen closely, children will say what\u2019s on their mind as they narrate their play, Truglio noted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/22/family-isolation-guide-for-parents-teenagers-coronavirus-lockdown\">\u2018Don\u2019t make a drama\u2019: a survival guide for parents during family isolation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crucial for caregivers is to listen and help children understand it\u2019s OK to be scared or uncertain. Thankfully, the support children will need to adapt looks a lot like what they have always needed.</p> <p>\u201cVery important to young children are routines, but even more important is knowing that grown ups are there for me. We know what young children need: routine, stability and love. A pandemic doesn\u2019t change that,\u201d Betancourt said.</p> <h2><strong>In it together</strong></h2> <p>Sesame Street is built around children, but its creators understand that adults need help, too. For them, Sesame Street\u2019s message is simple: understand that you\u2019re human and take a breath.</p> <p>\u201cParents can\u2019t help children if they\u2019re not taking care of themselves. It\u2019s like oxygen on a plane. We want to make sure there\u2019s resources there, but also to be kind to themselves,\u201d Truglio said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEmaWIxyhj8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aEmaWIxyhj8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For Sesame Street, that has meant providing educators with reliable learning resources at a time when they\u2019re facing a glut of untested tip sheets and guides. For parents and caregivers, it has meant helping them understand they don\u2019t have to become the teacher.</p> <p>\u201cA parent has to be a caregiver, first and foremost,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cAnd the educator wants to maintain a status as teacher. The two are in it together for the interest of the child.\u201d</p> <p>At no point do the makers of Sesame Street say any of this will be easy. But neither did they suggest the future has to be grim.</p> <p>\u201cI hope [people can see] a picture of joy within this moment,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe act of rallying together toward a common goal is not a sad occasion.\u201d</p>",

It also took issue with Hancock\u2019s insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use \u201cno more and no less\u201d than they clinically require.</p> \n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA\u2019s chair, said: \u201cWe are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected \u2013 and without them, we face real disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe note the government\u2019s announcement this afternoon \u2026 However, PPE should not be a \u2018precious resource\u2019 and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don\u2019t want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Susan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock\u2019s pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE. <br><br>Masters said: \u201cThese figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn\u2019t available. The calls are still coming through \u2013 people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already.<br><br>\u201cThings have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the \u201cenormous challenge\u201d of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested.</p> \n<p>He visited a newly opened \u201cmega-lab\u201d in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available.</p> \n<p>He stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector.</p> \n<p>Diplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK.</p> \n<p>He praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls-Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE \u2013 and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Appearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public\u2019s support. \u201cThe rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>She and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p><br></p>",

It has instituted jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, and banned visitors and transits through the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cb6a1cfe5cefd76574f61b6e87013140ad298ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cb6a1cfe5cefd76574f61b6e87013140ad298ad/0_0_6124_4082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A foreign worker at a medical screening booth in the WestLite Toh Guan foreign worker dormitory in Singapore, 07 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A foreign worker at a medical screening booth in the WestLite Toh Guan foreign worker dormitory in Singapore, 07 April 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ministry Of Manpower/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comparisons between countries are always flawed, too great are the differences in size, development, governance and demographics.

But we have to stick it out, because if we relax too soon, and allow the virus to re-emerge and spread widely, all the pain we have suffered will have been for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>There is historical precedent in Australia too. In the immediate aftermath of world war one, Australia was spared the very worst of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/09/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic\">the Spanish flu outbreak</a>, aided by geography and the delay the steam-ship age afforded a distant continent to implement a strict quarantine regime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f951538effee068d6e8debd303b9679be886a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f951538effee068d6e8debd303b9679be886a0c/242_1_1883_1197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff and workers from Riley Street Depot, Surry Hills, April 1919.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff and workers from Riley Street Depot, Surry Hills, April 1919.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NSW State Archives and Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But when the flu did break in Australia, it killed an estimated 17,000 people, and it did so in three waves, the first in February, the second in April.

When this pandemic is over \u2013 and it will end \u2013 governments must learn its lessons, and invest heavily in medical research and public health systems.

  "<p>Let\u2019s talk worms.</p> <p>I was always late to school because my mother worked dinner service at her restaurant, so was never awake for the morning school run. When I started year one we moved across the road from our school so we could manage ourselves in the morning.</p> <p>We dutifully rose at 7am, had breakfast, did our ablutions, made ourselves lunch then settled ourselves on the couch to watch The Wonderful Wizard of Oz \u2013 the 52-episode <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz_(1986_TV_series)\">anime version</a> that came on every day at 8.30am. Then we\u2019d bolt to school a little after the bell rang at 9am. Sometimes we\u2019d make it, sometimes we had to sit at the late bench. It all depended on whether the light was green when we got to the school crossing.</p> <p>What does this have to do with worms? Well there was one episode that made such an impression on me that I still remember it clearly after 35 years.</p> <p>It featured Guph\u2019s Giant Dirt-Devouring Worm, a creature that could eat through solid rock across the underworld between kingdoms. As a kid raised in the city, it blew my mind.</p> <p>Before that point worms were so disgusting to me I avoided them at all costs. It never once crossed my mind they might be a subject worth pondering. .</p> <p>They lived in the dirt, phallic in form, eating out of one end then expelling from the other. Not to mention they were slimy, unhygienic, dirty, alien and just gross \u2013 worms even rhyme with germs. And then there\u2019s the myth every kid is fascinated by, that if you cut them in half they will just go ahead and multiply rather than die. It\u2019s not actually not true, the head may survive to grow a new tail but it does not essentially become two worms. But still, to my child brain: ewwww.</p> <p>I can only express my shame now.<br><br>I have come to love and value worms. The presence of earthworms in the soil makes me fist pump the air. They are a visible indication of how healthy your soil microbiome system is. Where there are worms, there will likely be other micro organisms like fungi, protozoa, nematodes and actinomycetes. All very important for the soil, and many completely invisible to the naked eye. The worm is the clinical yardstick.</p> <p>Although they make terrible pets \u2013 unlike other domesticated animals, they will never care for you \u2013 I still recommend everyone with even just a little bit of space keep composting worms. </p> <p>Your return for investment is not affection; instead you will be gifted glorious vermicompost and worm juice from your scraps that is top-notch fertiliser for your garden or potted plants.</p> <p>They are there to eat, and eat anything and mostly everything they will.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/turning-crap-into-gold-why-a-composting-habit-will-change-your-life\">Turning crap into gold: why a composting habit will change your life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, like anything done well, there are guidelines.</p> <p>The following are lessons I have learned the hard way:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Make sure you start off with the right worms.</strong> Despite all this time you now have, do not go worm hunting in the garden! Leave those ones right alone. There are<a href=\"https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/worms/australian-earthworms/\"> 6,000 known species of earthworms</a> categorised in 20 families and not all of them are keen to eat your kitchen scraps. The most efficient worms available in Australia for composting are red worms, tiger worms and blue worms. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>You don\u2019t need a fancy worm bin.</strong> A bucket with a spout that allows a bit of air flow is absolutely fine if you are composting indoors. Use any receptacle that you can drain, that doesn\u2019t conduct too much heat. There are so many vermicomposting systems available, but I have found worm farming success is less about the container and more about the balance of contents you put into it. On our farm, old bath tubs propped up on some bricks are ideal as they come already complete with a drain hole. Whatever you choose make sure you can cover it up with a lid, wood plank or fine netted material. This helps by keeping out the fruit flies and undesirable pests and rodents. Another great system I use in our home garden is cutting out the bottom of a garbage bin and burying that straight into the ground with the lid intact. You can then fill the bottom with some bought worms, or wait for the earthworms already in your garden to come hither and then start composting straight away.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t overfeed your worms! </strong>When you\u2019re first starting out, it\u2019s easy to overwhelm your worms with too much food. Don\u2019t get excited and start overfeeding them just to see what they can handle. You will likely be starting with 1,000 worms, which sounds like a lot but is actually only a large handful. They will multiply over time, but that doesn\u2019t happen immediately, and you\u2019ll end up with a smelly bin. Worms while efficient don\u2019t work that fast, and you can help them by chopping up the food contents into smaller pieces.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Break down your scraps by using a bokashi composting system first </strong>and then add the \u201ccured\u2019 scraps to your worm bin. This will help the worms break the compost down even more efficiently so you can add the vermicompost to your garden faster. Also, the bokashi will have somewhat neutralised the odour.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>No large bones and no citrus directly into the worm bin. </strong>Break down the citrus first in your bokashi or avoid putting it in altogether.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Acidity is the enemy of a healthy worm composting system. </strong>If you find that you have an uncontrollable amount of fruit fly larvae in your bin, add a sprinkling of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth\">diatomaceous earth</a>, not lime. In my experience the wrong kind of lime will kill invertebrates and upset the PH balance of the environment. So make sure you have a good balance of carbon to nitrogen. I find a little more carbon than nitrogen is the key. You can tell if you\u2019ve got the right mix by eyeballing your bin contents \u2013 there should be a good ratio of carbon such as newspaper, empty loo rolls, egg cartons and leaf litter to nitrogen rich organic food matter, egg shells and dog poo.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>If you find that the bin starts to smell, add shredded newspaper and even torn-up egg cartons</strong>. Do that too if you are going away and cannot feed the worms for an extended period.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Water your worms.</strong> They need a moist environment. A layer of wet newspaper over the contents also helps regulate the moisture. Use the dripping from your watering in your garden. Do not throw it out! <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>You know when vermicompost is ready when it looks like soil and is neutral in odour. </strong>It should be a lovely dark colour and not soggy. It will hold a ball shape when you throw it into the air and be friable (easily crumbled). This is an indication that it contains water soluble nutrients and microbes. If you\u2019ve got a large bin or bathtub, move the vermicompost to one side, then start another pile of food on the opposite end of the container. The worms will naturally migrate there. In a bin, once you have a rich vermicompost and the food looks completely digested, stop adding more food for a couple of days. You can sieve the worms out to separate them from the vermicompost and then start another lot. If you have too many worms, split the lot into another bin or gift them to someone \u2013 like a sourdough starter!<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Vermicast is an incredibly rich fertiliser.</strong> Besides the set-up cost of buying some worms, if you care for it a worm farm is essentially free continuous fertiliser, and a way to transform your garbage into food.</p></li> </ul> <p>I admire <a href=\"https://www.hungrybin.co.nz/customers/councils/\">Auckland council</a> and City of Melbourne council for implementing a New Zealand invention \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hungrybin.co.nz/\">Hungry Bins</a>\u201d in their city centres and around public buildings like the<a href=\"https://qvm.com.au/sustainability/recycling-program/\"> Queen Victoria market</a>, embracing worm composting on a public scale.</p> <p>My wish is that more city councils around the world replicate this as a way to deal with our organic waste. In doing so it might help city children, like my little ignorant past self, come to see worms not as disgusting but as magical creatures that play a tremendous role in our environment.</p>",

  "<p>Support for Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus has plunged over the past week, polls show, as some of his advisers and Republican allies are said to be concerned over the US president\u2019s daily briefings on the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-live-news-global-deaths-near-95000-as-boris-johnson-leaves-intensive-care\">Coronavirus live news: worldwide Covid-19 death toll passes 100,000</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump experienced an upturn in public support as the virus hit the US, and his job approval rating surged to almost the highest rating since he was elected. As concerns over the government\u2019s response have grown, however, the number of people who believe the president is doing a good job appears to be settling back to pre-coronavirus levels.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-data-core-political-2020-04-08\">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> this week found approval of Trump\u2019s handling of Covid-19 had dipped to 42%, down from 48% the week before. Trump\u2019s overall approval rating was at 40%, close to where it has been for much of his presidency. According to a survey by CNN, 45% of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s coronavirus response.</p> <p>Perhaps more worrying for Trump are his dwindling numbers in a match-up against Joe Biden. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump/index.html\">CNN found that Biden leads Trump</a> 53% to 42% among registered voters nationwide.</p> <p>A number of Trump\u2019s advisers and Republican allies are said to be among those unimpressed with his performance at his press briefings, which have become a daily ritual and often last several hours. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-recovery-republicans-2020-3b161514-053c-480f-99ca-0c8ad142e98c.html\">Axios</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-press-briefing.html\">the New York Times</a> reported that a series of senior figures have become dismayed at the briefings, which Trump has used to propagate lies and disinformation about his response to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhite House allies and Republican lawmakers increasingly believe the briefings are hurting the president more than helping him,\u201d the Times reported.</p> <p>Even the Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham is among those who wants Trump to rein in his briefings, which frequently run on for more than an hour and regularly feature an upset president lashing out at the press.</p> <p>Graham told the New York Times that Trump \u201csometimes drowns out his own message\u201d, and said he had counseled the president to limit the briefings to once a week. Axios reported that Republicans are worried the rambling performances, along with the White House\u2019s wider response to the coronavirus, could harm Trump\u2019s re-election chances.</p> <p>\u201cThe next 4-8 weeks is really going to decide whether Trump gets re-elected,\u201d Stephen Moore, a former Trump nominee for Federal Reserve, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-recovery-republicans-2020-3b161514-053c-480f-99ca-0c8ad142e98c.html\">told Axios</a>.</p> <p>The normally forgiving editorial board of the conservative Wall Street Journal has also come out against Trump\u2019s daily presentations.</p> <p>\u201cThe briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus, how Americans should change their behavior, and what the government is doing to combat it,\u201d the Journal wrote. \u201cBut sometime in the last three weeks Mr Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the pleas, it seems unlikely that Trump, who is increasingly using the briefings to push out the kind of messaging usually reserved for his campaign rallies, will put a halt to them any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cAny suggestion that President Trump is struggling on tone or message is completely false,\u201d the White House spokesman Judd Deere told the New York Times.</p>",

In Scotland, which also counts deaths outside hospitals, there were 48 more deaths making a total of 495. Wales recorded 29 more hospital deaths, taking its total to 315, and there were 10 more deaths in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 92.</p> <p>The figures in England showed a particularly sharp rise in fatalities in the Midlands, where the number of victims rose by more than 84% from 124 to 229 in 24 hours. London remains the worst-hit region with 249 deaths.</p> <p>The patients who died in England were aged between 27 and 100. All but 56 of them had underlying health conditions.</p> <p>The latest data came after it was confirmed that coronavirus had claimed the life of a 10th NHS doctor. Dr Fayez Ayache had retired as a Suffolk GP but had been working part-time in North Clacton, Essex, until three weeks ago. He had also volunteered to help refugees from his native Syria. He died on Wednesday after being diagnosed with pneumonia and Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Dr Sharif K Al-Ghazal, a consultant plastic surgeon at Bradford Royal Infirmary, paid tribute on behalf of the Syrian British Medical Society. He said: \u201cDr Fayez was a kind-hearted man who always went out of his way to assist his patients, even at great personal cost.\u201d</p> <p>His daughters Layla and Katie said: \u201cHe was an incredible and amazing doctor having worked as a GP, ENT consultant and surgeon in the NHS and private sector for over 40 years. We are truly devastated and will miss him dearly. He was a true foundation in our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how many healthcare workers had died during the crisis at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Hancock passed the question to chief nursing officer Ruth May who said that internal numbers were available for nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and doctors but that it would be \u201cinappropriate for me to go into numbering them\u201d without family permission.</p> <p>Like Ayache, all the other nine doctors to have been named as victims of coronavirus have been from BAME backgrounds. They are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, who had pleaded with the prime minister for more PPE.</p></li> <li><p>Sami Shousha, a British-Egyptian doctor who specialised in histopathology, and had worked for more than 40 years at Charing Cross hospital in west London.</p></li> <li><p>Dr Edmond Adedeji, an A&amp;E doctor at the Great Western hospital in Swindon.</p></li> <li><p>Syed Haider, a British Pakistani retired GP, who had worked at the Valence medical centre in Dagenham, east London.</p></li> <li><p>Anton Sebastianpillai, a consultant geriatrician who trained in Sri Lanka and died in Kingston hospital, south-west London, just over two weeks after completing his last shift there.</p></li> <li><p>Dr Alfa Saadu, a retired medical director born in Nigeria, who had been volunteering at his local hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire.</p></li> <li><p>Amged el-Hawrani, an ear, nose and throat consultant of Sudanese descent who was working at Burton hospital near Derby.</p></li> <li><p>Adil El Tayar, a surgeon from Sudan, who died after volunteering in A&amp;E departments in the Midlands.</p></li> <li><p>Habib Zaidi, 76, a GP with Pakistani origins, who died after showing \u201ctextbook symptoms\u201d of the virus.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>On 10 April 1999, a little under two years since their takeover by Mohamed Al Fayed, Fulham were a third-tier club being propelled remorselessly upwards, running away with the league title \u2013 they were 16 points clear, with seven games to go \u2013 inspired by Kevin Keegan and rocket-fuelled by their owner\u2019s chequebook.</p> <p>Still, Keegan apart they were short of superstars. Their record transfer and most famous player was Chris Coleman \u2013 at \u00a32.1m his was the highest fee paid by a third division club, a record beaten only when Sunderland signed Will Grigg 21 years later. The Welsh centre-back was a fine defender but not exactly box office, though they also had the Belgium international Philippe Albert, another centre-back, on loan from Newcastle. Hugh Grant, whose most successful film, Notting Hill, would be premiered in Leicester Square later that month, stood alone as their most famous fan.

  "<p>If this virus complied with the rules of ancient literature, it would have struck in the depth of winter. We would have been surrounded by bleakness and death just as nature had shrivelled up and the trees were stripped bare. But this plague refused to conform to any pathetic fallacy of our making, choosing instead to arrive with the spring. The news bulletins speak of a UK death toll of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/uk-daily-death-toll-to-surpass-900-for-first-time\">nearly a thousand a day</a>. Outside your window, the sun is shining and there is blossom and bloom.</p> <p>There is something cruel about that. Especially for those whose homes are cramped \u2013 an overcrowded flat, say, with no outside space, no room for a barbecue or paddling pool \u2013 a glimpse of blue sky and a warming sun might well be tantalising and taunting, a joy that is painfully out of reach. Even for those lucky enough to have a garden, it will seem perverse. Spring is about life and renewal, while all around is death and sorrow.</p> <p>And yet the timing brings consolation, too, and not just because an hour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/07/closing-uk-parks-and-public-spaces-tipping-point-coronavirus-covid-19\">licen</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/07/closing-uk-parks-and-public-spaces-tipping-point-coronavirus-covid-19\">sed exercise</a> is more enticing if the weather\u2019s fine. True, it might be odd to talk of timing when it\u2019s not always obvious what day it is. We\u2019ve become unmoored from the calendar and even the clock. (With no evenings out, some are finding that every night is an early night.) Those furloughed or unaccustomedly working from home find themselves in an unfamiliar limbo: their surroundings suggest they\u2019re off work, and yet they\u2019re not on holiday. When the distinction between work and home is already blurred, and when you\u2019re not allowed to go anywhere, a four-day holiday weekend can seem \u2026 confusing.</p> <p>But this period is about more than a couple of days off. It is also Easter and, for Jews, Passover. In normal times, plenty of people wouldn\u2019t care less about such things. But when the calendar is a vast blank of undifferentiated time, when the other, collective rituals of the season have gone \u2013 there\u2019s no football outside Belarus \u2013 then, for many, the ancient structures are all that\u2019s left.</p> <p>The key event of Passover is already behind us: the seder, when it is all but compulsory for Jewish families such as mine to gather together. (Think Christmas dinner.) Nothing said lockdown more coldly than the oxymoronic prospect of a seder in isolation.</p> <p>And yet, somehow, we managed it. Thanks to Zoom, relatives in scattered parts of north London, as well as in-laws in the countryside and a son and a niece abroad, several of them on their own, joined together to retell the story of the ancient Hebrews and their escape from slavery in Egypt to freedom. Over wobbly video link, and often out of sync, we sang the familiar songs, the melodies taught by generations long gone. At a second Zoom seder with friends, we broke off at 8pm to clap for the NHS and other carers. </p> <p>Before I\u2019d seen it, I thought that, like the weather, there would be something cruelly perverse about the notion of Passover in lockdown. It is billed as the \u201cfestival of our freedom\u201d, and yet we were to be under virtual house arrest, separated from those we love. But once the seder was under way, I felt my resistance receding. Sure, the video feed was glitchy and lagging, but we were experiencing it together. And the threat of the virus only made the proceedings more poignant. We were recalling a time when our ancestors were not free; when 10 plagues struck the land of Egypt; when people cried out for their ordeal to end. All that felt less abstract this year.</p> <p>The story of the seder is one of hope: after slavery, liberation. And the story of our seder was one of hope too: that even confined to our homes, we can connect.</p> <p>Now, I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/dec/24/jesus-ultimate-political-drama\">confessed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/dec/24/jesus-ultimate-political-drama\">before</a> that, despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 my Jewish upbringing, I have always been a sucker for the Easter story. It does not merely converge chronologically with Passover \u2013 some like to speculate that <a href=\"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/was-jesus-last-supper-a-seder/\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/was-jesus-last-supper-a-seder/\">Last </a><a href=\"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/was-jesus-last-supper-a-seder/\">Supper </a>was, in fact, a seder \u2013 it converges thematically too. While Jews tell a story of emerging from enslavement to freedom, Christians move from death to resurrection. It\u2019s starker, but it offers that same message of hope \u2013 that even after the greatest pain, there is renewal.</p> <p>Right now, we might not have the head for such talk. We are still held captive by corona. We cannot go out; doctors, nurses and care workers still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/doctors-threaten-to-quit-over-protective-equipment-shortage\">lack the protective equipment</a> they need; key government decisions, over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-testing-in-uk-timeline-of-ministers-mixed-messages\">vital testing</a> most obviously, seem to have been botched. Too many people are dying. And we have not even begun to contemplate what happens when the virus strikes those countries without sophisticated healthcare systems: recall that Central African Republic has a total of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nazaninemoshiri/status/1247946669934731265\">three </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nazaninemoshiri/status/1247946669934731265\"> ventilators</a> for a population of 5 million.</p> <p>Naturally, people are desperate to see even a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel. They\u2019re impatient for it: witness the questions about an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/the-traffic-light-exit-strategy-to-free-the-uk-from-lockdown\">exit strategy</a>\u201d from lockdown, the demand for it to be eased sooner rather than later, if only for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-culture-war-lockdown-economy\">sake of the economy</a>. But just as we don\u2019t really know how quickly or how well the body recovers from Covid-19, we don\u2019t know how \u2013 or if \u2013 the economy will recover, or what will happen to our society. We know so little.</p> <p>The message of the Easter or Passover stories, and the signal sent by the arrival of spring, is that life will return, one way or another. It may be a small consolation, but for a few hours this strange, sunny weekend, let\u2019s cling to it.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Recently \u2013 oh, no particular reason \u2013 I\u2019ve found myself returning to the ancient philosophical idea known as <a href=\"https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-dichotomy-of-control/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe dichotomy of control\u201d</a>. \u201cSome things are within our power, while others are not,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epictetus/\" title=\"\">Epictetus</a>, the Greek Stoic, in a line you\u2019d be justified in dismissing as obvious, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that we ignore its ramifications every day, and suffer as a result. In every situation, there are things we can control and things we can\u2019t, and struggling to control the latter is a recipe for anxiety and stress. \u201cPartial control\u201d, like the kind I have over my three-year-old\u2019s behaviour, can be broken down into the two: I usually have total control over what I say or do; and none, technically, over how he reacts.</p> <p>It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s echoed widely elsewhere, for example in the <a href=\"https://www.beliefnet.com/prayers/protestant/addiction/serenity-prayer.aspx\" title=\"\">Serenity Prayer</a>, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, and in an <a href=\"https://fakebuddhaquotes.com/if-the-problem-can-be-solved-why-worry/\" title=\"\">observation with Buddhist origins</a>: if a problem can be fixed, there\u2019s no need to worry about it; and if it can\u2019t be fixed, well, why bother worrying?</p> <p>Which is fine so far as it goes: it\u2019s surely true that <em>if</em> I could manage never to fret about things I can\u2019t affect, <em>then</em> life would proceed serenely. But it strikes me as a major weakness of Stoicism \u2013 at least in its rediscovered, newly fashionable form \u2013 to assume that seeing the truth in an insight like this can bring peace of mind by itself. Among the many things I can\u2019t control, it turns out, are my own emotions. What Sigmund Freud and his successors brought to psychology was the understanding that conscious thought might be only a tiny sliver of what\u2019s going on in the mind as a whole. So if a global pandemic triggers my particular anxieties around death, or illness, or job security \u2013 anxieties formed over decades, and embedded in my unconscious \u2013 it\u2019s radically insufficient to try to think myself into realising they\u2019re futile. If pointlessness caused things to vanish, <a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/2987/popsockets-are-a-sin?zd=2&amp;zi=ygbznp7r\" title=\"\">Pop</a><a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/2987/popsockets-are-a-sin?zd=2&amp;zi=ygbznp7r\" title=\"\">Sockets</a> that people stick on the backs of their phones wouldn\u2019t exist. Yet they do.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, in my experience, the dichotomy of control is best approached as a preliminary tool. You use it to distinguish what you can control from what you can\u2019t \u2013 but peace of mind arrives only when you begin taking action in the realm of the former. (As the saying goes, you can\u2019t think yourself into new ways of acting, but you can act yourself into new ways of thinking.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/13/would-a-society-of-moral-saints-be-a-worse-place-to-live\">Would a society of moral saints be a worse place to live? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s often less a matter of realising how little control you have than how much.

However, how do you even begin to replace a singer and lyricist as charismatic and gifted as the subsequently legendary 23-year-old?</p> <p>Shrewdly, they didn\u2019t try. Sumner stepped into the breach as singer, while Morris\u2019s girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert \u2013 who had already filled in for Curtis on guitar at a gig at Eric\u2019s in Liverpool after he hurt his hand \u2013 was drafted in on guitar and keyboards. This minimised the disruption to the chemistry that produced Unknown Pleasures and Closer \u2013 two of the finest albums of the post-punk era \u2013 and meant they could become a thoroughly reinvented band, albeit one that still carried Joy Division\u2019s heart and soul.</p> <p>Movement, the 1981 debut, didn\u2019t quite shake off that band\u2019s long shadow, but with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, New Order found their sound.

The change is apparent from the opening song, the mighty Age of Consent, as Peter Hook\u2019s euphoric, twangy bass riff leads into a keyboard- and guitar-soaked melodrama. However, PCL is full to bursting with avenues to explore. Side one careers from the mournful We All Stand to the giddy electro-pop of The Village, a distant cousin of 1982\u2019s similarly sequencer-driven single, Temptation. 5-8-6 is electronic dancefloor pop from the same well as Blue Monday. That much-loved 80s classic isn\u2019t on the album (neither New Order nor Joy Division put singles on albums back then), but teed up PCL for a wider audience by becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time.</p> <p>Side two of the album is slightly more statuesque. There\u2019s the shimmering majesty of Your Silent Face (initially titled Kraftwerk 1, in homage to the German electronic predecessors) , the tense Ultraviolence, the electro-vocoder odyssey Ecstasy and sublime, melancholy Leave Me Alone, which shows they could still make new shapes from guitars and drums. It\u2019s a record full of possible futures \u2013 for New Order and for pop \u2013 and the band\u2019s defining album is the perfect place to start.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Low-Life (1985)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3XW6NLILqo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x3XW6NLILqo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Blue Monday gave New Order a mainstream audience without entirely shedding the army of Joy Division/post-punk era fans (myself included), who wore long overcoats, pretended to read Dostoevsky, scoured record fairs for obscure bootlegs and swapped tapes of soundchecks with their mates. Low-Life (1985) carries off the tricky feat of catering for the different camps of fans. As with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, it unveils a different style with virtually every track. Opener Love Vigilantes \u2013 about a returning soldier \u2013 is one of the band\u2019s great guitar pop songs. The Joy Division end of the band\u2019s sound is represented by the driving, post-punky Sunrise, a brooding This Time of Night and beautifully, well, elegiac Elegia, an aural memorial to Curtis that appeared years later in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LY3ftiLqmE\">an 18-minute version</a>. The newlyacquired Saturday-night-beer-monster fanbase could wobble along to Sub-Culture and Face Up. Possibly best of all, hit single The Perfect Kiss utilises state of the art Emulator sampling technology to produce a dancefloor killer featuring frog croaks.</p> <p><strong>Technique (1988)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1tjQqWqqAA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t1tjQqWqqAA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Peter Hook\u2019s book Substance is full of eyebrow-rocketing tales of how New Order recorded their acid-house-era classic in Ibiza, leaving behind a trail of trashed cars, hedonism and fracturing relationships. A battle between the band\u2019s rock and electronic camps over how the album should sound hinted at the growing schisms that led to a 90s hiatus and eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/20/peter-hook-settlement-new-order-royalties\">Hook\u2019s estrangement from the band</a>.</p> <p>Given all this \u2013 and the fact that partying took priority over recording until they relocated to Peter Gabriel\u2019s Real World back in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s remarkable that they managed to come back with much at all, never mind such a fantastic album. Technique assimilates Balearic beats but is recognisably, inimitably New Order. The band\u2019s most dancefloor album starts off with the acid-house-flavoured Fine Time and ends with the supernaturally melancholy Vanishing Point, while the rest of the album careers from guitar pop (Run, Dream Attack) to plangent electronic pop (Round and Round, Mr Disco), the sound of summer adventures, Ibizan clubs and long, reflective sunsets.</p> <p><strong>Brotherhood (1986)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkOr12AQpnU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tkOr12AQpnU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies and Low-Life defined New Order as a band who were able to weave together guitars and electronics, a format used by countless bands today. However, Brotherhood separates the two sides again, virtually entirely, with a guitar/drums side and an electronic side. Brian Eno had done something similar with the very different halves of Before and After Science, while David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d divided neatly into rock music and synthesiser stuff. New Order were fans of both, and here they pull off a similar feat.</p> <p>The first side is a Hook masterclass. Having been a huge part of Joy Division\u2019s sound with those mournful/powerful bass lines, his trademark twangs fire five supremely catchy guitar-pop songs such as the hurtling Weirdo or the truly lovely As It Is When It Was. Side two kicks off with a classic \u2013 Bizarre Love Triangle\u2019s soaring symphonic electronic pop \u2013 and ends with a rare recorded moment of their idiosyncratic Mancunian humour. As Sumner sings Every Little Counts\u2019 madcap lines \u2013 \u201cI think you are a pig, you should be in a zoo\u201d \u2013 he can\u2019t stop laughing. It\u2019s a long way from their roots, but, if you like these albums, head back to Movement and Joy Division to listen to where they started out.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>Peel Session, 1982</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTlLE_UUQGM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NTlLE_UUQGM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>New Order didn\u2019t travel to Maida Vale studios in London to record their second session for John Peel\u2019s Radio 1 show \u2013 the standard practice, which they followed for their first one. But perhaps recording the four tracks in Manchester gave them room to experiment. The skeletal, minimalist, embryonic version of 5-8-6 is barely recognisable as the pop song it became later. The haunting, melancholy version of We All Stand is arguably superior to the one featuring 80s fretless bass on Power, Corruption &amp; Lies. The anxiously mournful synth- and bass-driven <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sySXyLHEM1o\">Too Late</a> is a terrific lost New Order classic, which was never played live or recorded elsewhere. The oddest curio/gem is an unlikely but sublime melodica-driven cover of Jamaican artist Keith Hudson\u2019s 1975 reggae song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYsRIdB3sc8\">Turn the Heater On</a>, which led Peel to remark: \u201cSkank with New Order.\u201d It\u2019s a wonderful remake of a song apparently loved by Ian Curtis, and this session is as fine a 20 minutes of music as New Order have recorded.

A second volume on the New Order years and fall-outs, due later this year, promises to be similarly gripping.</p> <p><strong>From Heaven to Heaven by Dec Hickey (2010)<br></strong>If you can find it, this originally limited hardback is a beautifully designed and presented pictorial and text record of New Order\u2019s early live years, 1981-84.

  "<p>I would never have described myself as vain. When I got my first standup spot on television, I returned home to find my wife and mother waiting to stage a hair intervention, immediately taking me to get it cut. I had apparently left it so long that my wife described my look as \u201crecently released political prisoner\u201d. Similarly with clothes: once we had children, I discovered that anything nice had a life expectancy of about an hour before one of them smeared ketchup, snot or a concoction that could only be identified by sending it to a lab, all over it, sometimes accidentally. So, for a long while, I just gave up on wearing nice stuff.</p> <p>Since then, I have started to get my hair cut more frequently and make a sartorial effort. My wife would argue that I have gone too far the other way, as it is fair to say I have developed something of a trainer addiction. I recently wore a box-fresh pair of Yeezys to Chessington World of Adventures, which my wife and kids insisted would lead to the day being ruined by me crying over getting any kind of mark on them. Yeezys are the only fashion item I have ever possessed where, before deciding whether to wear them or not, I have to check the news to see if the designer, Kanye West, has said something twattish.</p> <p>But I ignored my family\u2019s protests. What\u2019s the point of getting nice things if you\u2019re not going to wear them? Half an hour after arriving, a woman in a wheelchair ran over my foot, emblazoning my trainers with a tyre mark, and my family said, \u201cI told you so\u201d a combined total of 1,500 times.</p> <p>What the lockdown has shown me, apart from the importance of not reading the news just before bed, is that I never really left the slob in me behind. Freshly trimmed and smart-clothing Romesh is my Bruce-Banner, and the pants-dwelling, hairy, unkempt, eating-like-an-animal-about-to-go-into-hibernation Romesh has been biding his time until a global pandemic would allow him to re-emerge: the Disgusting Hulk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/13/nickname-ashy-ankles-fight-back-with-moisturiser-romesh-ranganathan\">No one wants the nickname Ashy Ankles.

At first, I would wear tracksuits and comfy hoodies; nice loungewear that, at a push, you might pop to the shops in. Those were the halcyon days. Since then, I have stopped giving any kind of thought to what the outfit looks like, merely ensuring I make some sort of effort to cover my genitals. I have started wearing whatever comes to hand. I type this while wearing a very smart shirt, Gruffalo slippers and boxer briefs. This morning, I walked downstairs in this outfit as if my mission brief was to stop my wife ever having a feeling of sexual desire for me again.</p> <p>Everyone I know has been talking about how they are going to head straight out and aggressively socialise as soon as this is over. I would actively campaign, however, for an extra week or so of lockdown for people to adjust to doing their hair, picking out clothes that are suitable for public consumption, and dressing in a way that won\u2019t lead to arrest. If we don\u2019t have that time allocated, I fear that, for a while, we are going to see people at bars and in shops wearing swimwear and dressing gowns.

  "<p>When will the pandemic end? The future is uncertain, but it seems likely that over the next 18 months the UK will experience a cycle of national lockdowns while it awaits a vaccine. This is far from ideal. Repeated lockdowns could lead to mass unemployment, rising national debt, uncontrolled bankruptcies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/singing-stops-italy-fear-social-unrest-mount-coronavirus-lockdown\">widespread social unrest</a> as people grow sick of draconian measures. Many people are now asking how quickly the lockdown can be lifted \u2013 and how soon we can return to normal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/brexit-britain-economy-coronavirus-gdp-figures-economic-growth\">Brexit had already damaged Britain's economy. Now coronavirus could sink it | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monitoring the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number\">reproductive rate of infection figure</a>, R<sub>0</sub>, will be crucial to any decision about lifting the lockdown. The figure indicates how contagious an infection is. As the R<sub>0</sub> number drops below one, each existing infection causes less than one new infection; eventually, the outbreak will decline and die out. When R<sub>0</sub> remains steadily less than one, governments may decide to gradually loosen restrictions, with the lockdown relaxed earlier in lower intensity areas and later in hotspot cities such as London.</p> <p>New data <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30746-7/fulltext\">published this week</a> in the Lancet, from a team of researchers at the University of Hong Kong led by the clinician Gabriel Leung, shows that the spread of infection in China outside Wuhan, measured by the R<sub>0</sub> in four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou) fell below one within two weeks of partial lockdown. This is good news; it shows a partial lockdown can quite quickly suppress transmission of the virus. Our national lockdown and social distancing measures may already have brought the R<sub>0</sub> down across much of the country.</p> <p>But the problem still remains of how to prevent a second surge. The Hong Kong researchers worry that as economic activity restarts, local and imported cases of coronavirus could lead to new outbreaks. And the R<sub>0</sub> rate varies across different regions: case fatality rates were just below 1% in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou compared with 5.9% in Wuhan. We will likely also see a higher rate of infection and death rate in London than the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Moreover there\u2019s a crucial difference between the response to coronavirus in China and that in the UK. From the beginning of the outbreak, the Lancet researchers note, \u201conly residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down\u201d. Health authorities also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">found cases</a>, traced contacts and isolated them, monitoring their quarantine closely.</p> <p>So it was not just a lockdown and social distancing that were responsible for bringing down the R<sub>0</sub> number in China, but the country\u2019s community surveillance approach. Scarred by memories of the Sars outbreak in 2002, China and other east Asian states acted with greater speed, imposing total or partial lockdowns supported by a protective shield of community measures \u2013 finding people with the virus, isolating them swiftly, and tracing those they contacted.</p> <p>In South Korea, this took the form of mass testing and digital contact tracing; in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam, health authorities identified cases based on people\u2019s symptoms, and used testing when available. Strict isolation of cases and contacts was monitored by phone apps and home visits. Rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach, China varied the lockdown across different regions. While Wuhan was under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">total lockdown</a>, other provinces had more autonomy, and focused on quarantining the household clusters where most transmission took place.</p> <p>Data seems to show that this approach is the right one. Death rates in Asian countries have been lower than in the US and Europe (South Korea\u2019s death rate, for example, is four per million and stable; the UK\u2019s is 105 per million \u2013 and rising). In addition to helping reduce the R<sub>0</sub> number, a community shield may also allow governments to lift national lockdowns more quickly. Rather than maintaining a prolonged lockdown, governments can target measures at people who actually have coronavirus. This would likely be far less disruptive to the economy: better to quarantine 10% of people who have coronavirus symptoms than an entire population.</p> <p>At first, Britain eschewed the community shield approach. On 12 March the government stopped community testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">moved to a \u201cdelay\u201d phase</a>, explaining that a managed spread of the virus across 60% of the population, with a case fatality rate around 1%, would hopefully produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">herd immunity</a> and allow the economy to move on. After its modellers realised this strategy would overwhelm the NHS, the government enforced a lockdown. It is now attempting to conduct 10,000 tests a day, mostly in hospitals for patients and health workers.</p> <p>Despite Britain\u2019s slow start, there are reasons for hope. Behind the scenes, general practices and public health workers are working at tremendous speed to build our own protective shield. They\u2019re finding places to treat infected patients who aren\u2019t sick enough for hospital but can\u2019t be nursed at home, visiting those with long-term conditions or coronavirus symptoms, and building a picture of community spread using 111 data. The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new <a href=\"https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/nhsx-coronavirus-contact-tracking-app/\">NHSX app</a> and the popular <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Zoe Covid symptom tracker</a>.</p> <p>We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown. After this, we can then get most people back to work, focus on quarantining individual cases and contacts, and suppress outbreaks if they arise. Hopefully this approach will help us avoid further national lockdowns. But it will take a long time before life returns to normal.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London</p> <p><br></p>",

The struggle to find a path true to his faith was typically atypical. It took him from the concept of worker priests bringing Christian values to the workplace, via ICI, the trade union movement, liberation theology, and in 1981 a parish in the Chilterns, then to Tottenham in north London, along the way shedding much of the upper-class privilege he was born with - although he never lost his accent, which always turned heads on 1970s picket lines.</p> <p>Dad\u2019s determination to make a difference only increased as his health deteriorated in recent years.

  "<p>It\u2019s hard to write music during lockdown. A lot of songwriters I\u2019ve spoken to just aren\u2019t getting inspired at the moment. I did try. I wrote a song called Wash Your Hands and thought: \u201cI\u2019d better put the guitar down now.\u201d That\u2019s why I decided to start hosting listening parties on Twitter instead, which I\u2019ve been doing every night from 9pm with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/timstwitterlisteningparties?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#timstwitterlisteningparties</a>. We pick an album and listen together at a set time \u2013 9pm or 10pm \u2013 with commentary from one of the artists involved.</p> <p>The first week I did it we had Blur, Ride, Franz Ferdinand and Oasis \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoneheadsPage?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bonehead</a> did the commentary for that one. As soon as we started, it had become a thing. One of the maddest things was seeing it as the top trend on Twitter.</p> <p>Everyone who\u2019s taken part so far has said it\u2019s like doing a gig. There\u2019s the trepidation beforehand, then an hour of craziness, and finally a period where you\u2019re kind of decompressing. The only difference with this is that nobody\u2019s nicking your beers!</p> <p>We\u2019ve done about 30 so far, including our debut album <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/The-Charlatans-Some-Friendly/master/12876\">Some Friendly</a>, and there have been some great moments. My personal highlight is me not realising that I\u2019d played Reading festival in 1999 \u2013 I still can\u2019t remember it now, even though people have been telling me exactly what happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/tim-burgess-my-life-before-was-sky-high-these-days-its-real-and-natural\">Tim Burgess: \u2018My life before was sky high. These days it\u2019s real\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also loved Dave Rowntree revealing his collection of laminated artefacts from the Parklife era \u2013 old photos, gig tickets. He made so much effort and that really upped everything because the listening party became a visual thing. The Cribs did one for Men\u2019s Needs, Women\u2019s Needs, Whatever and were showing their old tour diaries and lyric sheets. Those are the kind of insights you don\u2019t often get in a magazine \u2013 bands probably wouldn\u2019t want to show those at the time of release anyway, but now there\u2019s a bit of history involved and they feel more relaxed.</p> <p>What I like is that it\u2019s giving people the opportunity to listen to an album in its entirety again. Musicians I talk to, even the younger artists, all want to make an album that\u2019s a masterpiece, that has a theme running through it, a start and a finish. That has been crushed in a way because people felt they didn\u2019t have enough time on their hands. But now all we have is time, so it\u2019s a beautiful thing for this moment.</p> <p>We\u2019ve had listeners from all over: New Zealand, Japan and even Antarctica. Part of the reason we do them at 10pm is because that\u2019s when Japan is waking up. The other reason is because that\u2019s when the 10 o\u2019clock news is on, and I wanted people to have an alternative to that \u2013 you can watch the news at any time these days; this is a way of offering up an alternative good time instead.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the only thing I\u2019m doing at the moment. I\u2019ve got a new solo album, I Love the New Sky, coming out in May. I spoke to the label about whether we should postpone it, but we agreed it was a good time to put music out, to have something to look forward to. I\u2019ve also been doing some home schooling with my six-year-old. But I\u2019m not a teacher and I don\u2019t think I should try to be. Instead we just go for a walk every day and talk about volcanoes, tornadoes, the coronavirus and the environment. That\u2019s not a bad start, is it? He\u2019s also got into wrestling, so we do a bit of that.</p> <p>But most of my time is spent on these listening parties. I\u2019m always working on them. All day I\u2019m getting direct messages and emails and I\u2019m normally up until midnight answering questions. The listening party itself keeps you on your toes. I usually have a few tweets lined up beforehand \u2013 that way I can answer everyone\u2019s questions while it\u2019s live. It\u2019s hard to keep up. There\u2019s so many people out there saying things like \u201cwhere are we now?\u201d and I have to be on hand to say \u201ctwo minutes and 34 seconds into track four ... no, it\u2019s two minutes and 36 seconds now!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s growing every day. We could keep this going until Christmas. Sleaford Mods have just said they want to do all of their albums, every Thursday at 8pm. That\u2019s what I love about it, it\u2019s all about impulsive decisions and it spirals into a thing of its own.</p> <p>When I was first starting out, I would listen to <a href=\"https://www.longlivevinyl.net/classic-album-neil-young-harvest/\">Harvest by Neil Young </a>to learn how to write songs. That was more of a conscious thing, but I\u2019m sure listening to all these classic albums will affect my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/tim-burgess-my-life-before-was-sky-high-these-days-its-real-and-natural\">songwriting</a> in some subliminal way. Hopefully it will, and you won\u2019t ever get to hear that song I wrote about washing your hands.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tim Burgess\u2019s I Love the New Sky is out on 22 May via Bella Union</p></li> <li><p>As told to Tim Jonze</p></li> </ul>",

Fortunately, if you\u2019re missing the competitive zeal of live sports, multiplayer games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/25/fifa-20-review-not-your-typical-annual-update\">Fifa 20</a> enable fans to create their own tournaments \u2013 providing both distraction therapy, and the chance to beat your sister to the Premier League title. Here are five recommended multiplayer sports sims, and how to set them up for fierce, sofa-based competition.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-20\">Fifa 20</a> (PS4, Xbox One; \u00a329.99)</h2> <p>One of Fifa\u2019s great strengths is its options for offline tournament play. There are 63 competitions included, such as the English FA Cup and German DFB-Pokal. If you live with 19 other people you can even set up an entire Premier League season, with every club human-controlled.</p> <p>Best of all is the Custom Tournament mode, where you and three (or seven!) additional family members can go head to head, using your choice of Fifa 20\u2019s 700 teams. Flexible options include two-legged ties and the number of permitted substitutes, plus your choice of trophy and stadium for the final.</p> <p>There\u2019s sadly no way to set up an online tournament alongside friends, although <a href=\"https://www.fifplay.com/fifa-20-co-op-seasons/\">Co-op Seasons</a> is a fine alternative. Here you team with a mate against similar tandems, with a system of 10 divisions ensuring you\u2019re matched to opponents of equal ability. All results count towards a global leaderboard.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mlb-the-show-20-ps4/\">MLB </a><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mlb-the-show-20-ps4/\">The Show 20</a> (PS4; \u00a344.99)</h2> <p>The best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won\u2019t threaten your double glazing is The Show\u2019s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It\u2019s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress.</p> <p>The Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MLB The Show 20\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best living-room baseball ...

That\u2019s purely down to its offline excellence.

  "<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to spread around the world. As the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">passed the 100-day mark</a> and many countries extended their lockdowns, others moved to relax restrictions wary that cases may take off again.</p> \n<h2><strong>Scientists shed light on </strong><strong>immune response to coronavirus</strong></h2> \n<p>On Monday, a team at Fudan University in Shanghai <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1\">reported the first detailed analysis</a> of the immune response in patients with coronavirus. Tests on the blood of 175 patients who had been discharged from hospitals in Shanghai revealed that neutralising antibodies \u2013 those that can wipe out the virus \u2013 usually arose 10 to 15 days after the onset of illness and targeted three different parts of the \u201cspike\u201d protein on the virus\u2019s surface.</p> \n<p>While older patients produced the highest levels of neutralising antibodies, many patients had low levels and 10 did not appear to generate them at all. If the findings hold up \u2013 the study has yet to be reviewed and published \u2013 they have widespread implications. The more robust immune response from older people suggests their blood plasma may work best in trials that are assessing whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-survivors-blood-plasma-could-be-used-to-fight-infection\">convalescent plasma</a> infusions can help seriously ill patients overcome the virus. But the findings may frustrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/health-minister-defends-uk-coronavirus-testing-approach-chris-whitty-germany-covid-19\">efforts to manufacture an accurate antibody test</a> for the virus if many people have low or even non-existent levels of neutralising antibodies. This week it emerged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-government-urged-to-abandon-poor-finger-prick-antibody-tests-coronavirus\">none of the antibody tests</a> purchased by the UK government were good enough to roll out.</p> \n<p>The work also has implications for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\"> \u201cimmunity passports\u201d</a>, which could allow people to return to normal life if blood tests showed they had developed immunity to the virus. Nearly 6% of the recovered patients had no neutralising antibodies, suggesting that other parts of the immune system had cleared the infection, without producing long-term immunity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Not everyone agrees on wearing face masks</strong></h2> \n<p>Whether or not to don a face mask in public became a matter of debate and confusion. After a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">review of new evidence</a>, the World Health Organization maintained its view on Monday that while people who have cough, fever and difficulty breathing should wear a mask and seek medical help, there was no need for healthy people to wear face masks in public. The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO\u2019s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \n<p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051177v1\">preliminary research</a> showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as \u201cstay healthy\u201d. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask \u201cdramatically reduced droplet excretion\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a81dbd86-f7c7-4b2d-affa-9a6aff9b9b5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xFY3aPF7E4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Some countries look towards easing </strong><strong>lockdowns</strong></h2> \n<p>Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s like walking a tightrope.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/08/wuhan-ends-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">returned to a ward on Thursday</a> after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation. In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic. But discussions are underway in Whitehall where options range from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">\u201cyouth first\u201d</a> policy that would allow young workers to return to their jobs, to a staggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/uk-lockdown-could-end-with-sector-by-sector-plan-for-firms\">sector-by-sector approach</a>.

President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. \u201cThe majority is clearly European,\u201d Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">New York Times</a>. The same approach was used last month to trace the coronavirus back to <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015008v1\">infected bats</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/09/how-coronavirus-spread-across-the-globe-visualised\">How coronavirus spread across the globe - visualised</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>And finally\u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>As streets emptied out and factories closed their doors, scientists at the British Geological Survey noticed their sensitive earthquake-detecting seismometers had stopped twitching as much.

With lockdowns easing around the world, they do not have long to look. As Brian Baptie at the BGS conceded: \u201cWe may not get anything in the short term.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s probably not the greatest, most productive skill to be proud of, but my ability to watch hours and hours of TV was always something that, I felt, set me apart from other people. At my peak, if you can call it that, I thought nothing of spending six, seven hours with the same show. I once devoured an entire series of 24 on DVD in one sitting, and consumed all 86 episodes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/14/the-sopranos-at-20-how-the-hit-show-changed-the-gangster-genre\">The Sopranos</a> in 13 days. In my defence, with the latter, I had just been made redundant and had nothing better to do. Plus, it made staying in my dressing gown all day look like cosplay, rather than mild depression.</p> <p>I always had other hobbies, and I\u2019ve always enjoyed going outside, but if I set my mind to TV, that\u2019s what I did without much thought for anything else.</p> <p>I turned this to my advantage in later years, too, writing about TV for the first eight or nine years of my working life, and I still dip in every <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/brad-pitt-snoop-dogg-asap-rocky-peaky-blinders-steven-knight-gangster-series\">now and again</a>. But in the past couple of years, I\u2019ve noticed my concentration span disappear. Perhaps it\u2019s guilt catching up with me for all the years I spent slack-jawed on the sofa letting yet another box set of forgettable US TV wash over me? Or maybe I\u2019m distracted by worry \u2013 about everything from the climate crisis to the feeling I should be doing something better with my time?</p> <p>I don\u2019t think it takes a psychiatrist to work out why I might not be able to concentrate at the moment, but even before the whole global pandemic thing, I couldn\u2019t really focus on TV. I\u2019ve got stuff to do; too much tension makes my chest tight; too much shouting sets my teeth on edge. Needless to say, news and current affairs are off the menu, and on it are The Repair Shop, Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing and not much else. \u201cHow slow can you go?\u201d I seem to be asking my television.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried documentaries, wondering if it was more realism I craved, but this coincided with a trend for genuinely staggering factual series about almost unbelievable events. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/19/making-a-murderer-season-2-review\">Making a Murderer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life\">Wild</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life\"> Wild Country</a>, The Keepers, The Staircase, you know, all those. \u201cTry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/insane-intoxicating-tale-of-big-cats-is-perfect-lockdown-tv-tiger-watch-james-mcavoy-greta-gerwig\">Tiger King</a>,\u201d is the latest advice from friends trying to suggest something to watch during the lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d they say.</p> <p>A global pandemic that has left thousands dead and threatens the very fabric of society is about as much crazy as I can deal with this month, thank you. Some guy with a big cat will have to wait, no matter how daft his mullet is.</p> <p>Thankfully, I have found a few things to watch. Given how much Wheeler Dealers, How It\u2019s Made and The New Yankee Workshop I used to sit through on Discovery Shed, it\u2019s hardly a surprise to me, but most of my viewing now revolves around the restoration of old things. I stumbled upon this new world during a break on a night shift at this very paper last year. I\u2019m not sure why it spoke to me the way it did, but as soon as I saw this film of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpRdVBC5PNo\">restoration of a seized 1960s chainsaw</a>, I knew it was the only thing I wanted to watch. And with 10m views, I\u2019m far from the only person to enjoy this 38-minute slice of nerdy bliss. Thank you, Will Matthews, I owe you.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpRdVBC5PNo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TpRdVBC5PNo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>From there, I fell down a tool-restoration rabbit hole. King among them is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrMVIBtqFW6O0-MWq26gqw/featured\">My Mechanics</a>, a YouTube channel with about 1.3 million subscribers and more than 123m views. He \u2013 I assume he\u2019s a he, you only see a pair of hands in the videos and there\u2019s no talking \u2013 is based in Switzerland. And that\u2019s about all the information there is. Where does he get the projects from? How has he mastered working with so many materials? Who paid for all those amazing tools? Does he have a day job? Why doesn\u2019t he fix the broken button on his sandblasting machine? Many questions, but I don\u2019t care about the answers, really, I just sit back and watch another video. At least I did \u2013 I\u2019ve now seen them all, several times, and eagerly await the next. One was uploaded this week, thankfully, the restoration of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KahctElSnpw\">barn find oil lamp</a>, and it\u2019s perfect.</p> <p>If watching someone restore an old Game Boy or PlayStation sounds more your thing, then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_suVrG2dA5BTjJhNLwthQ\">Odd Tinkering</a> is the channel for you. Who knew 1980s plastic could be bleached and exposed to UV light to come up looking like new?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/stewartmacdonald\">StewMac</a>, the video channel of luthier supply company Stewart MacDonald, is another source of endless fascination (for me, at least) and sits perfectly at the intersection of what now appears to be my two main interests \u2013 restoration videos and guitars. If you can\u2019t marvel as <a href=\"http://www.danerlewine.com/\">Dan Erlewine</a> masterfully restores a butchered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUUuMzxJ9h8\">1953 Fender Telecaster</a>, or replaces a mother-of-pearl inlay in the neck of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KJwBie5XBo\">Martin D-45</a>, then I can\u2019t help you.</p> <p>Of course, there is a temptation to analyse this viewing in a way that makes it seem philosophically pure, that in witnessing the restoration of an item that would otherwise be thrown on the scrapheap, that I\u2019m somehow making a stand against consumerism and the disposability of life in the 21st century.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s true, but really, I just like seeing rusty old bits of metal get a once-over with a sandblaster.</p> <p><br></p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Huanan seafood wholesale market in central Wuhan was the kind of place where people often caught colds. Vendors started setting up as early as 3am, plunging their hands into buckets of cold water as they cleaned and prepared produce for the customers that arrived every morning.</p> \n<p>The sprawling market of more than 20 streets spanned two sides of a main road in an upscale neighbourhood of the commercial district of Hankou. Racks of meat were hung on hooks or spilled out on plastic mats. Workers walked around in welly boots. Drains lined the kerb alongside stores selling everything from live poultry to seafood and cooking ingredients. It was crowded but clean.</p> \n<p>So, in mid-December when Lan, who sold dried seafood at one of more than 1,000 stalls in Huanan, felt unwell, he thought little of it.</p> \n<p>He stayed home to rest but after losing 3kg in just a few days, he decided to go to his regular hospital for a check up.</p> \n<p>From there he was sent to a hospital that specialises in infectious diseases and was admitted on 19 December. He remembers how the staff praised his positive attitude. \u201cI was just a little bit sick. I wasn\u2019t scared in the slightest,\u201d said Lan, who asked not to disclose his full name.</p> \n<p>Lan could not have known then that he was among the first cases of a new, highly contagious coronavirus that would kill more than 2,500 people in his city and engulf the world, infecting more than 1.6 million people so far and killing more than 95,000. The World Health Organization has described the outbreak of Covid-19 as the worst global crisis since the second world war. \u201cI thought I had a cold. I had no idea,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus infections began cropping up in Wuhan in December \u2013 and reportedly as early as November \u2013 but the Chinese authorities did not inform the public that the virus could pass between humans until late January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241/0_364_5461_3277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, as China celebrates what it claims is victory over the disease, the number of infections and deaths is increasing around the world. Officials from Australia, the US and the UK have accused Beijing of suppressing information, allowing a localised outbreak to turn into a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Beijing claims its strict lockdowns bought the world time that health authorities in some countries chose to squander. But interviews with early patients, medical workers and residents, as well as leaked internal documents, accounts from whistleblowers and research studies, show delays in the first few weeks of the epidemic, government missteps that would have far-reaching consequences.</p> \n<h2>Human-to-human transmission</h2> \n<p>By the end of December, before Lan recovered after more than 20 days in hospital, word had gotten out in Wuhan about a mystery illness. Internet users circulated screenshots of a WeChat conversation on 30 December in which a doctor at Wuhan Red Cross hospital, Liu Wen, warned colleagues of confirmed cases of a contagious coronavirus at another hospital. \u201cWash your hands! Face masks! Gloves!\u201d the medic wrote.</p> \n<p>That same day an ophthalmologist at Wuhan central hospital named Li Wenliang told a WeChat group of former medical school classmates that seven people at his hospital had contracted what he believed to be Sars, the outbreak that killed more than 600 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1/0_24_5745_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An \u201curgent notice\u201d from the Wuhan health commission warning of \u201csuccessive cases of unknown pneumonia\u201d was also leaked and posted online on 30 December. The statement ordered hospitals to \u201cstrengthen responsible leadership\u201d and ensure that no one \u201cdisclose information to the public without authorisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under growing pressure, the following day the health commission said researchers were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, its first official notice about the virus. There was no \u201cobvious evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the statement said, describing the outbreak as linked to the seafood market and assuring the public that all patients had been quarantined and their contacts placed under observation. \u201cThe disease is preventable and controllable,\u201d it added.</p> \n<p>A day later, on 1 January, the Huanan seafood market was closed and Wuhan\u2019s public security bureau announced that eight people had been \u201cpunished\u201d for spreading rumours. Authorities also tasked hospitals to screen for pneumonia cases linked to the market. It wasn\u2019t until 20 January that vendors in the market were asked to submit to temperature checks and blood tests.</p> \n<p>But across the Yangtze River, some 6 miles (10km) away, people who had never been to the market were falling sick. In the second week of January, Coco Han, 22, developed a cough she couldn\u2019t shake.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3deca7accfd51e95a50b8060a9ac7def9d4abf4b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3deca7accfd51e95a50b8060a9ac7def9d4abf4b/0_340_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Han, 22, in Wuhan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco Han, 22, in Wuhan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After a week, she went to see her local clinic on 20 January and had a CT scan done. The results showed an infection on her lungs. A medic in a full hazmat suit escorted her to another hospital for more tests.</p> \n<p>Han\u2019s mother joined her in a crowded waiting room where those waiting began to panic. Han had a mask but her mother had not thought to wear one, given the government\u2019s assurance. A young woman in line in front of them fainted and Han\u2019s mother hugged her, telling Han not to look.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe all knew we might have the virus. Everyone was scared,\u201d Han said. \u201cI think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn\u2019t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Han was told that she probably had \u201cthat pneumonia\u201d, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn\u2019t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Daron Hu, 35, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on 16 January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south.</p> \n<p>By the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of 20 January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission.</p> \n<p>Hu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next 24 days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. \u201cI saw some people give up. It is very lonely,\u201d Hu said.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Things felt out of control\u2019</h2> \n<p>By the time officials revealed the infectiousness of the virus, hospitals in Wuhan were already overwhelmed and the numbers increased after the announcement. Video taken on 22 and 23 January showed crowds of patients at Wuhan No 6 hospital in Wuchang, another district of Wuhan.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was so busy. We couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d said a nurse who slept in the hospital dormitory and rotated every four hours in a team of six people to keep up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0898893b6f12be2eca08bde792271cd834fecec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0898893b6f12be2eca08bde792271cd834fecec/0_284_5301_3181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 28 March 28 the subway in Wuhan resumed operation after two months of being closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 28 March 28 the subway in Wuhan resumed operation after two months of being closed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another medic gestured to the sidewalk outside the hospital. \u201cThis was all full,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day people were dying.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 23 January, the city of 11 million people was placed under lockdown. Surrounding areas followed suit, putting a total of more than 50 million people under de-facto home quarantine.</p> \n<p>Facing severe shortages of supplies, staff and space, the next few weeks were desperate. Hospitals turned away patients, sending them home where they often infected their families. Footage showed medics weeping and people collapsed in the streets. Dead bodies were left in hospitals where staff were too busy to collect them. Internet forums filled with pages of pleas for help by residents trying to save loved ones. By 19 February, the death toll from the virus had passed 2,000.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe virus was very quick. At the beginning, things felt out of control. We didn\u2019t know what would happen,\u201d said one doctor treating coronavirus patients at Wuhan central hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not given permission to speak to media.</p> \n<p>It is a time authorities are quick to gloss over as they celebrate the lifting of Wuhan\u2019s almost three-month lockdown, an event marked with light shows and banners hailing the success of the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeijing has been working very hard to fight the negative domestic and international fallout,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut this is far from adequate in stopping people from discussing China\u2019s responsibility in covering up the outbreak in the beginning,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0e9d4a87c1b650d7c95769860343e77038227e3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e9d4a87c1b650d7c95769860343e77038227e3/0_81_5473_3284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 8 April the Wuhan Gongjialing toll station reopens as authorities lift traffic restrictions after 76 days of lockdown in which residents were not allowed to leave the city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 8 April the Wuhan Gongjialing toll station reopens as authorities lift traffic restrictions after 76 days of lockdown in which residents were not allowed to leave the city.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wuhan is slowly coming back to life. Neighbourhoods have erected flags and signs declaring them \u201cvirus free\u201d. Cars are starting to fill the streets again as people return to work. Yet, visible reminders of the epidemic remain. Rows of tall metal fencing surround the still-shuttered Huanan seafood market, its former entrances manned by security while police cars patrol nearby.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>And not everyone is willing to forget. On a wall near her home, Han recently spray-painted the Chinese characters<em> bu neng, bu mingbai</em> (I cannot, I do not understand), a reference to a declaration Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">was forced to sign</a> before eventually succumbing to the virus he tried to warn others about. Underneath the words, some residents have burned piles of paper money, a way to honour the dead, drawing small white circles around the ashes.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey said stay. I stayed. They said everything was fine. I believed. I believed it all,\u201d Han says. \u201cI want to know why this happened. Who said not to tell people?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI will remember this for the rest of my life \u2013 I understand now that we are not important.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang</em></p>",
  "<p>Sunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">causing outrage</a>. The police are involved; the parks may be shut.</p> \n<p>Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong?</p> \n<p>Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people\u2019s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don\u2019t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don\u2019t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic <em> </em>in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don\u2019t harm anyone else \u2013 they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?</p> \n<p>Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between individual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.</p> \n<p>It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/03/john-stuart-mill-on-liberty-100-best-nonfiction-books-review-robert-mccrum\">John Stuart Mill</a> said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.</p> \n<p>But if you can do that while making yourself happier \u2013 by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown \u2013 it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/lockdown-viral-trends-5g-towers-coronavirus-cases\">righteous fury</a>, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3849e921-99ee-4b30-87d9-ad45ffd298fb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tVoHlEfXtJ0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Can that really be true? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/sep/20/west-kantian-ideal-freedom-society-suffers\">Immanuel Kant</a> thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair.</p> \n<p>If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time. But once we start to think in these terms, we need to look at a much broader picture. As political philosophers such as Karl Marx emphasise, our individual decisions are made against a social background that we have not chosen. Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space.</p> \n<p>Lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">reinforces existing social inequalities</a>. It is even less excusable for the more fortunate to break the rules. Though we should all keep to the guidelines, it doesn\u2019t follow that we should heap blame on those who don\u2019t, not knowing what staying at home is like for them, not knowing their reasons for being out. Of course they should comply, but be kind; most people are doing their best.</p> \n<p>It is a mark of the crisis we are in that simply sunbathing in the park raises the deepest questions about what truly matters in our lives: the happiness of all, even if I rely on others obeying the rules, as utilitarians would say. Or respect and fairness, as Kant would reply. The role of individual responsibility within a social context, as Marx would insist.</p> \n<p>Finally, we can draw on another value very important to Marx (and Rousseau and Hegel too): the value of solidarity. There are huge disparities between the burdens a few are being asked to bear for the sake of the many. Doctors, nurses and other key workers constantly risk their lives to look after the sick and to keep essential services running. For the rest of us, there is very little that we can do to make a difference in this global crisis. It is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. But in fact, sitting at home, we can stand in solidarity with those who are doing more. We are doing our part, and treating fairly everyone else who is doing the same. It is the most, and the least, we can do.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Alison Hills is a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St John\u2019s College, University of Oxford</p> \n<p><br><br></p>",

  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, each NHS trust would send out individual emails of the number of people who had died. Now the daily totals are approaching the 1,000 mark, we are down to one global email per day. It feels as if so many people are losing their individual identity and just becoming a statistic. So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease. Just so that he and thousands of others like him don\u2019t get forgotten.</p> <p>Pete wasn\u2019t a close friend: more of a friend of a friend and someone my wife would join on long weekend walks. But he was a lovely man. He was at Exeter University several years before me \u2013 he took his studies so seriously, it took him four years to complete a three-year degree \u2013 but photos from that time show him as a dead ringer for Steely Dan\u2019s Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter. He was also known for driving his motorbike far too fast and for crashing cars. On leaving Exeter, he went on to establish his own communications business in Brighton and was heavily involved in several charities working in India and Africa. He is survived by his wife, Heidi, and his two children. My heart goes out to them. It\u2019s still not clear what the rules are for funerals in the time of the coronavirus but it will undoubtedly be a scaled back affair. Sometime, when this horror is all over, we will have a party to remember him properly. And for all the many others whose deaths were merely reported as a grim number at the daily Downing Street press conference.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I found myself totally unsettled by the news that Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. So much so, that I had to switch off Twitter and stop watching the news: even though it is literally my job to watch the news. Part of the shock was that less than three hours earlier, Dominic Raab had insisted at the Downing Street press conference that Boris had only gone to hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">as a precaution</a> and was basically still in charge of the country. So the only possible conclusion was that Raab had lied about the gravity of Boris\u2019s condition or that, even as de facto deputy prime minister, he had not been kept in the loop. Neither of which inspired much confidence in the government. If we couldn\u2019t trust the government to tell the truth about something so critical as the prime minister\u2019s health, why should we trust it to tell the truth about anything else? The No 10 communications team really needs to start upping its game: we\u2019re long past the point where serious news can be withheld for a few hours. But mostly my shock at the deterioration of Boris\u2019s condition was on a more existential level. You can dislike his politics and think little of of his suitability as prime minister, but he is still the country\u2019s leader. At a very basic, psychoanalytical level Boris is the country\u2019s daddy. And no one ever wants to lose their dad, no matter how crap a dad he has been. We want our parents to be strong. Invincible, even. The last thing we want is proof that the coronavirus really is totally indiscriminate.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Finding ways of filling up the days \u2013 other than with work \u2013 is proving to be more and more of a challenge. I have had two more goes at Hilary Mantel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review-thomas-cromwell\">The Mirror and the Light</a> but still haven\u2019t got the concentration to get past the first four pages. That makes it six attempts at the book so far, but it\u2019s testament to the power of the writing that I have been gripped on each occasion. By this time next week, I am determined to make it to at least page six. My wife is rather more inventive than me and had found on Twitter the #GettyMuseumChallenge, which encouraged everyone to recreate works of art using objects they had lying around the house. After a great deal of passive resistance from me \u2013 \u201cWhy on earth would I want to do that?\u201d \u2013 Jill persuaded me to join her as Piero della Francesca\u2019s Duke and Duchess of Urbino.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48/0_693_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her costume was constructed using some lace bought from a French market some years ago, along with a pair of headphones covered with tin foil and a paper flower. Mine was made from some red felt, left over from making one of the children\u2019s Christmas stockings, rounded off with a heavy Le Creuset saucepan for the head gear. It certainly had the necessary gravitas. Once the pictures were taken against the kitchen wall, our son Photoshopped them into the appropriate frame and we posted the diptych on Twitter and got a wonderful response from many people. Apart from the bloke who suggested I should have gone the whole hog and broken my nose like the original duke. Now our fame is to be extended further. Yesterday I got an email from a producer working on a TV film Grayson Perry is making about creativity in lockdown, requesting permission to use our photo. A Bafta surely must be in the offing.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>I have spent most of the football season wishing Spurs could play rather more like Liverpool and less like a bunch of bored, non-league players. And much to my surprise, I have found that I have missed the final two months of the season far less than I expected. It turns out that there are limits to my masochism and were the Premier League to announce that the final placings for this year\u2019s season were as of the beginning of March, I\u2019d be quite happy. If we can\u2019t make the Champions League we can at least avoid the Europa League. Best of all, though, would be for the entire season to be considered null and void so that Spurs would automatically qualify for the Champions league on last season\u2019s performances. </p> <p>But now I find myself not just wishing Spurs would play like Liverpool but behave like them too. Earlier this week, Liverpool announced it had made an error in laying off and furloughing many of its non-playing staff and were going to retain them all. Just a week after announcing profits in excess of \u00a370m, the Tottenham board \u2013 despite much pressure from the supporters\u2019 trust and other interested parties \u2013 came to an entirely different decision and is laying off and furloughing non-playing staff. At White Hart Lane, the directors seem to care more about the bottom line than basic human decency. To make things even worse, the club has broken physical-distancing guidelines by holding training sessions in the park. I\u2019ve sometimes been ashamed of Spurs\u2019 on-field performances; now I am ashamed of their off-field ones. It\u2019s not too late to reverse the decision. The club may be surprised at just how many fans won\u2019t forget or forgive if they don\u2019t.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7/0_70_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image on a hoarding in London of the Queen broadcasting her message\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen: Next, they\u2019ll be having me sing Vera Lynn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no getting away from it. As for many people, it\u2019s been another tricky week on the mental health front. I miss my children more and more \u2013 I dare say I might be feeling differently about this if they were both still teenagers and going stir crazy indoors \u2013 and our frequent phone calls are bitter-sweet reminders of the distance between us. It\u2019s the not knowing when I will next get to see them that hurts the most, and I am planning on observing government guidelines to the letter. But I did promise to try to include some good news each week, so here goes. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/boris-johnson-father-stanley-tells-relief-pm-leaves-intensive-care\">Boris Johnson is out of intensive care</a>: I feel far more emotional about that than I expected. I\u2019ve also spent the last three and a half weeks growing a beard, something I\u2019ve never done in the past. So that\u2019s a first. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a total success though and I doubt it will be staying much longer. My sisters have been polite about it but my friend Alex said I look like a serial rapist on death row. I\u2019ve also now almost finished cataloguing my books, which has been mind-numbingly dull and unexpectedly time consuming as my spreadsheet skills are minimal. Next I plan to move on to cataloguing our ceramics. Soon I will be down to cataloguing the exact amount of dog and cat food we have left. But the undoubted highlight of the week has been the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/wisden-2020-offers-plenty-scope-cricket-loving-self-isolators-ben-stokes\">this year\u2019s Wisden Almanack</a>. I haven\u2019t had time to more than dip in so far \u2013 Mark Lawson\u2019s moving essay on how cricket helped his mental health was my first port of call \u2013 but the new Wisden is always a sure sign of the start of summer. Though what kind of summer it will be is still in the lap of the coronavirus. And who knows what next year\u2019s Wisden will look like?</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Same again.</p>",

  "<p>Much has been made of the Football Association\u2019s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women\u2019s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows \u2013 the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus \u2013 into its Sport Hall of Fame.</p> <p>The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women\u2019s football \u2013 which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women\u2019s Football Association \u2013 happened by chance. Follows\u2019s daughter, Maggie Ferris \u2013 another Nottingham alumnus \u2013 mentioned her father in a routine fundraising phone call with the university.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"12e3dea5f5f46db546c8869e07537ea9cf234a93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12e3dea5f5f46db546c8869e07537ea9cf234a93/112_0_1141_1426/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Denis Follows\u2019 daughter, Margaret Ferris.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Denis Follows\u2019 daughter, Margaret Ferris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The student that jotted down a few notes from their call took them away and soon afterwards the university and Ferris began to explore the history of a man who had a firm belief in equality and a person\u2019s right to play sport and felt the lifting of the ban was natural. \u201cHe was always campaigning about things,\u201d explains Ferris. \u201cThat was just part of what he was. And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,\u201d she adds with a chuckle.</p> <p>Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals \u2013 World Cup Willie \u2013 and separated the tournament\u2019s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery.</p> <p>\u201cDad brought it home [after it had been recovered] and he actually slept with it under the bed until we won it,\u201d recalls Ferris. \u201cAnd then it went to a special place to be displayed. When it was due to be taken to Mexico for the 1970 World Cup there was a real issue of how they were going to get it there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78/0_0_1931_2506/771.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.\" width=\"771\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I\u2019ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.\u201d</p> <p>When Nobby Stiles\u2019 contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris\u2019s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles.</p> <p>Follows\u2019 journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students.</p> <p>In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. \u201cIn a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,\u201d says Ferris. \u201cHe could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/28/coe-and-ovetts-olympic-debt-to-bureaucrat-who-defied-thatcher\">Coe and Ovett's Olympic debt to bureaucrat who defied Thatcher | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. After the war that enabled him to become general secretary of Balpa. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962.</p> <p>His dual career paths gave him a unique role in the Munich air disaster in 1958. \u201cWhen there was the the crash with the Busby Babes in it Dad was the general secretary of Balpa, but he was also treasurer of the FA,\u201d explains Ferris. Follows became the union representative of the pilot, Captain James Thain, who was initially blamed for the crash, and spent more than a decade working on the case to clear his name. \u201cInitially he was a scapegoat, guilty [of failing] to clear the ice on the wings despite witnesses saying there was no ice, but Dad got him cleared in 1968,\u201d says Ferris.</p> <p>Three years later Follows drafted the letter that would lift the ban on women\u2019s football. \u201cI knew about it being reversed,\u201d says Ferris, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know about the ban [coming into force] in the 20s. I just knew that there wasn\u2019t any women\u2019s football and accepted that as the status quo.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e/84_877_4490_3887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Players from Southampton Women line up in 1971, one year after the club was founded.

It was traumatic. But he seemed pretty calm at the time, he just dealt with the complaints and just quietly said that, in his opinion, it was an individual decision and that the opportunity should be there for the athletes to participate. It was Lord Carrington [the foreign secretary] and Michael Heseltine [head of the Department for the Environment, which included sport] that were ringing him and putting the heavy screws on but he just stuck by his guns.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it was Seb Coe\u2019s gold medal that year,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd he has said himself, I believe, that if it hadn\u2019t been for my father he probably would have never won a gold medal.\u201d Instead, with government funding cut, Follows travelled the length and breadth of the country \u201ctrying to raise money for the Olympics, because he was just so desperate for them to be able to do what they wanted to do, without government money at all. And he did it.\u201d</p> <p>His hall of fame induction is on hold due to the coronavirus crisis, but Nottingham\u2019s head of sport, Dan Tilley, is looking forward to recognising his \u201caffinity for student sport, the connection to the university, the fact that he has achieved a huge amount in his career\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tilley says: \u201cIt feels only right that we celebrate him.

Sometimes sports administrators get overlooked, and actually some of the things they do are quite significant.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Shhh! That\u2019s not just the wind \u2013 there\u2019s definitely something out there, moving around outside the tent. A lion, perhaps; do they hunt at night? Or a polar bear? I believe they often rip tents apart in order to devour the human occupants. Perhaps it is some<em>one</em> \u2013 a human, a murderer almost certainly. Unless of course it\u2019s just Gatsby, next door\u2019s cat, out on the scrounge again or pooing in our flower bed. Whatever, we\u2019re way too scared to unzip and have a look.</p> <p>We \u2013 my family \u2013 are camping in the garden. I say my family, but it\u2019s just me and the boys, eight and six. Their mum started off with us, but she disappeared after bedtime stories. Her words on leaving the tent? \u201cI\u2019m just going inside; I may be some time.\u201d I think she had planned it.</p> <p>To be honest, it\u2019s a good thing she left. Our four-person tent didn\u2019t fit in our tiny garden. So we put up my old festival tent, cosy for three; even that only just went in. I know, we\u2019re lucky \u2013 especially now \u2013 to have any garden. But I think you could do a version of this even without one. Put a tent up inside. If you haven\u2019t got a tent, make one out of sheets and the sofa cushions, maybe. Use your imagination \u2013 and then again to decide where you are. Alexa, play jungle noises.</p> <p>Why is home-holidaying such a great idea? It\u2019s cheap \u2013 really cheap; almost certainly the cheapest holiday you\u2019ll ever take. No fares, no accommodation, no campsite fees, just what you would have been consuming anyway, plus one bag of marshmallows. You can turn the heating off, too, and anyone still inside can put on an extra layer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a/0_0_5152_3864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Wollaston's boys take turns to burn their marshmallows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam\u2019s boys take turns to burn their marshmallows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: provided by Sam Wollaston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no added eco-guilt \u2013 this is almost certainly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/green\">greenest holiday</a> you\u2019ll ever take, too. No flying, no driving, no emissions at all, apart from the ones that children produce anyway \u2013 especially in small tents, it seems. There may be a fire \u2013 but ours was just two bits of wood. Sorry, I suppose it wasn\u2019t entirely necessary, but I think we\u2019ve got some credit in that department.</p> <p>It\u2019s something to do, and something <em>different</em> to do. That has been one of the big problems during lockdown \u2013 the sameness of every day, of the weekdays merging into weekends, of not being able to get out, the lack of any kind of excitement or adventure that doesn\u2019t come via a screen. Garden camping offers proper terror, without putting anyone in danger, although I guess that depends on where you live.</p> <p>It is actually \u2013 amazingly and in spite of everything \u2013 quite fun. Not just doing stuff you do on holiday, and being a bit scared, but simply sleeping in a big pile together. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s transferable inside. Obviously, there\u2019s an upper age limit; if ours were much older, it would almost certainly be the lamest, most ridiculous idea ever. But this time they enjoyed it, the big-pileness of it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh. Fighting, too, of course, but fighting somewhere new.

Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can\u2019t think of many instances from my own life where it isn\u2019t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost \u2013 they all led to better things.</p> <p>The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. \u201cMadame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.</p> <p>And so to the present. Though our current blessings may also be well disguised, we must count them.

  "<p>Higher influenza vaccination rates could help prevent a future pandemic by exposing new viruses like Covid-19, which was probably circulating much earlier than December 2019 but was mistaken for flu, an expert has said.</p> <p>If more people were vaccinated against flu, unusually high rates of flu-like illness would be more likely to raise red flags, said Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor in epidemiology from the University of Manitoba. \u201cGiven that both Covid-19 and influenza share similar early symptoms of illness, influenza vaccination status provides an additional mechanism to help distinguish potential infections that could be responsible for a patient\u2019s symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cNow I wonder how many things are written off as influenza where they may be new viruses which could impact world health.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/global-coronavirus-cases-pass-1-and-half-million-amid-fears-of-second-wave-of-outbreaks\">Global coronavirus cases pass 1.5 million amid fears of second wave of outbreaks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, some countries are approaching flu season. Governments have urged as many people as possible to get vaccinated against influenza to reduce the burden on health systems and virus testing labs.</p> <p>Kindrachuk said flu vaccination rates had traditionally been low and authorities must focus on increasing them. He said Canada should be aiming for 80% of the population but was currently around 20%.</p> <p>The World Health Organization recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups including pregnant women, healthcare workers, people with underlying chronic conditions, the elderly and children under five.</p> <p>The WHO has warned of disruption to routine immunisation activities during the pandemic because of strain on the health system and a \u201cdecreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance\u201d. It says there is a high potential for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles at this time, but mass vaccinations bringing together large groups of people should be avoided. Countries should instead \u201cmaintain continuity of immunisation services wherever services can be conducted under safe conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Australia and New Zealand have begun flu vaccinations early, and have prioritised the elderly, people with disabilities and health workers. Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt, has warned of the dangers of people falling ill with both the flu and Covid-19, while his New Zealand\u2019s counterpart, <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12317607\">David Clark,</a> said that although the flu shot does not protect people against Covid-19 \u201cit will help to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of demand on our hospitals this winter\u201d.</p> <p>South Africa has said it will prioritise health workers for vaccinations as it does not have enough, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-28/south-africa-says-coronavirus-cases-rise-to-1-187-from-1-170\">Bloomberg has reported</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/elimination-what-new-zealands-coronavirus-response-can-teach-the-world\">Elimination: what New Zealand's coronavirus response can teach the world | Michael Baker and Nick Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A few weeks before the known start of the coronavirus outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201910/31/WS5dba17d3a310cf3e35574898.html\">China Daily reported</a> the country had stockpiled twice as many vaccinations as the previous year for the coming winter and spring.</p> <p>In March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-doctors-warn-coronavirus-testing-compromised-by-failure-to-stockpile-key-chemical-reagent\">the Guardian revealed</a> that some Australian jurisdictions had failed to properly stockpile a common reagent that was needed to test for Covid-19 as well as other viruses including influenza. \u201cAs the virus has spread, exhaustion of the reagents and materials required for performing diagnostic testing has resulted in decreased testing capacities which has further exacerbated the tolls from this pandemic,\u201d said Kindrachuk.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an important point as many regions, including here in Canada, have now had to adopt more stringent diagnostic testing criteria so as to preserve testing capacity as the pandemic continues.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days a study from 2017-18 has been widely shared on social media, with readers suggesting that it shows flu vaccinations increase the chance of recipients contracting a coronavirus. The WHO\u2019s influenza team said they had not previously seen the report but a brief review of its conclusions showed there was in fact \u201clittle or no evidence of association of virus interference and influenza vaccination \u2026 Conclusions regarding the current Covid-19 pandemic and influenza vaccination cannot be made.\u201d</p>",

Dancehall and reggaeton have featured more and more across the global electronic underground circuit, too \u2013 yet even here, the music of \u201cdeep reggaeton\u201d pioneer <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2918\">Brian Pin\u0303eyro</a> stands alone. Producing and DJing as DJ Python, he combines the swinging percussion of reggaeton with deep-house chords and ambient techno textures. It\u2019s a concoction that seems so natural and almost obvious in retrospect, though that notion owes itself to the quality of Pin\u0303eyro\u2019s lithe compositions. With an EP, remixes and considerable touring experience in between, this new record follows his <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-python-dulce-compania/\">2017 full-length debut</a> to plunge even deeper into the sound.</p> <p>Structured like a mix, Mas Amable is an album meant for listening all the way through. Pin\u0303eyro refers to it as a soup, cooked by taste rather than recipe. This analogy rings true from its beatless beginnings to the various elements intuitively stirred in or stripped out along the way, defining sections beyond the tracklist\u2019s delineations. The record\u2019s first beat is introduced on scratch-heavy roller Pia, then inverted into a teetering stutter on its successor. Introspective, ensnaring lead single ADMSDP features ASMR-like susurrations from guest vocalist LA Warman, rumbled only by the introduction of a bassline reminiscent of Voices from the Lake. Cohesive and seamless, Mas Amable reaches the heart of the rhythm and the soul of the drum, aspiring to a meditative quality and tranquility that almost feels sacred.</p>",
  "<p>The World Health Organization is being urged to declare abortion an essential health service during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In guidance notes issued last week, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-03-2020-who-releases-guidelines-to-help-countries-maintain-essential-health-services-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\">advised</a> all governments to identify and prioritise the health services each believed essential, listing reproductive health services as an example.</p> <p><a href=\"file:///Users/laptop_user/Downloads/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2020.4-eng.pdf\">Clinical guidelines</a> published by the organisation last month said that women\u2019s right to sexual and reproductive healthcare \u201cshould be respected irrespective of Covid-19 status, including access to contraception and safe abortion\u201d.</p> <p>Simon Cooke, the CEO of Marie Stopes International (MSI), said a stronger pronouncement by the WHO would be \u201cimmensely helpful as it would help countries to see abortion from a public health perspective\u201d.</p> <p>There have been growing calls for governments to protect abortion services during the crisis.

Unsafe abortionsaccount for between 4% and 13% of maternal deaths.</p> <p>Dr Jeanne Conry, president elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, said </p> <p>\u201cAbortion access is critical. Women need access or we will see more unintended pregnancies, more maternal mortality and more unsafe abortion,\u201d said Conry.</p> <p>\u201cAbortion is not an elective procedure, it\u2019s an essential part of women\u2019s healthcare.

  "<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/jade-anouka\">Jade Anouka</a> announced on Twitter: \u201cGonna shoot my own short film!\u201d She had been contacted by a theatre company for an acting role, but such are our extraordinary times of social distancing, she was asked to shoot her own footage as well for the nine-minute monologue written by Aisha Zia and directed by Suba Das.</p> <p>\u201cIt was down to me to work out the shots. I got some pointers from Suba and recorded it on my iPhone,\u201d says the London-born actor, poet and playwright. She soundproofed her London flat as best as she could and shot snippets of everyday life from \u201cthe view out of the window to my dog sleeping or barking\u201d.</p> <p>The film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODBPtC59oFo\">Bedlam Before the Burnout</a>, is the first in HighTide\u2019s five-part series Love in the Time of Corona, which will be streamed weekly. The other monologues are written by Olivier-nominated Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, Bafta nominee Dawn King, grime poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/06/debris-stevenson-mormonism-grime-poet-in-da-corner\">Debris Stevenson</a> and Ben Weatherill, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/03/jellyfish-review-bush-theatre-london\">the acclaimed play Jellyfish</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODBPtC59oFo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ODBPtC59oFo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Theatre-making, it seems, has never been so DIY. The series comes amid a welter of new online offerings. Anouka loves the speed and invention of it all and the industry\u2019s quickfire response, but misses the collective experience of live theatre. \u201cIt is devastating and sad,\u201d she says. \u201cIndividuals are dealing with job losses as well as the thought of what this might lead to. Theatre is struggling, but it is such a creative world that I\u2019m not surprised we have come up with ways of keeping performance alive. We know it\u2019s not the same thing as live theatre \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to get back to that \u2013 but you have to keep creating in the meantime.\u201d</p> <p>Her own creative responses have included recording a speech from The Merchant of Venice as a rousing reminder of the value of Shakespeare in troubled times. \u201cI woke up one morning and had the idea that it needed to be out there.\u201d Anouka, who has worked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/23/my-favourite-shakespeare-character-ophelia-lovibond-paapa-essiedu-jade-anouka-roger-allam-john-kani-\">on Shakespeare productions</a> at the Globe, the Royal Shakespeare Company and Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s all-female trilogy at the Donmar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/23/actors-appeal-for-the-quality-of-mercy-in-online-shakespeare-videos\">emailed fellow actors to ask for recorded contributions</a>.

Anouka picked it partly out of sentimental reasons, because it was the first Shakespeare play she performed in professionally (\u201cIt was the RSC\u2019s production, and I was something like fifth spear carrier\u201d) and for its message about kindness: \u201cIt\u2019s just beautiful for its poetry, but there is a reminder in it to be kind to each other.\u201d</p> <p>The HighTide monologue is also a response to a global state of solitude. Anouka plays a woman whose life is brought to a halt by the lockdown and finds herself alone in her house. It leads to deeper reflection on an over-busy life that has left her almost at breaking point and pushes her to make positive re-evaluations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8890bc4336429c78c36664d8114922120b29047b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8890bc4336429c78c36664d8114922120b29047b/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joshua McGuire as Hamlet and Jade Anouka as Ophelia at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua McGuire as Hamlet and Jade Anouka as Ophelia at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anouka is in isolation with her partner and three-year-old rescue dog (a photogenic terrier mix who features in her Instagram feed). \u201cI don\u2019t feel as positive,\u201d she admits. \u201cThere is too much darkness, although I\u2019m someone who works from home anyway so I think I\u2019ve adapted easier. It must be hard for people doing regular jobs who are now suddenly in their house with family or partners.\u201d</p> <p>When the lockdown began, Anouka was in the middle of two film projects \u2013 including a thriller for Channel 5 called The Drowning, starring alongside Jill Halfpenny \u2013 which are now postponed. She has writing projects on the go, too. Anouka has long written poetry and in 2016 published a collection, <a href=\"https://www.jadeanouka.com/product-page/eggs-on-toast-by-jade-anouka\">Eggs on Toast</a>, but she is newer to scriptwriting. She has just handed in the draft of a play to Soho theatre with the working title Mother Daughter, and is commissioned to write another for Paines Plough.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hon1PJ2JlGs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hon1PJ2JlGs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But before that, her one-woman play, Heart, is scheduled to debut at the Kiln this summer. Directed by Nancy Medina, Anouka will also perform as its lead. She describes it as a story being told by a black woman but with no mention of blackness. In the trailer for the show, she says: \u201cThis is not a black story or a woman\u2019s story, but for all those who have felt \u2018other\u2019,\u201d though she adds now that \u201cas soon as I stand on a stage as a black woman, people will bring their assumptions\u201d.</p> <p>There are dynamic stories around diversity being told in theatre at the moment, but she feels that only certain kinds get plucked for bigger stages. \u201cThe shows that are produced by the mainstream are not representative of the stories that are being told. They seem diluted.\u201d The focus, she adds, is often black experience imported from America. Writers such as Clint Dyer have spoken about the dearth of black British stories on stage, and Anouka feels the same. \u201cWatching a play about black Americans, it\u2019s easy for an audience to feel separate and for the characters on stage to be othered. We really need black British stories.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Bedlam Before the Burnout is available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbIipkB8nJXo4nKNv95V1w\">HighTide\u2019s YouTube channel</a>.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Friday 10 April.</p> <h2>NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order</h2> <p>Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/10/nsw-minister-don-harwin-fined-1000-for-breaching-coronavirus-public-health-order\">breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order</a>. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The minister resigned on Friday night, after the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had earlier said she wanted to establish the facts.</p> <h2>Doubt cast over NRL\u2019s return</h2> <p>A day after the NRL <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/09/nrl-2020-season-restart-decision\">revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May,</a> the league\u2019s plans showed signs of unravelling. First, Brad Hazzard, NSW\u2019s health minister, said he had not been consulted on league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time.</p> <p>But while Hazzard said he was willing to discuss the matter with the NRL, the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/10/nrl-restart-date-paul-kelly-brad-hazzard\">expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon</a>.</p> <h2>Australians warned not to travel over Easter</h2> <p>State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/09/australians-warned-to-avoid-all-non-essential-travel-over-easter-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">over the Easter holidays</a>, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those flouting social distancing laws. On Friday, Tasmanian police confirmed they had already ordered a number of people to turn their cars around after they were intercepted travelling from their home to a holiday house. Police have the powers to issue fines to people who breach social distancing rules.</p> <h2>Queensland highlights \u2018Covid-19 hot spots\u2019 in NSW</h2> <p>Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/10/queensland-orders-anyone-returning-from-covid-19-hot-spots-in-nsw-to-quarantine-for-14-days\">state\u2019s chief medical officer posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW</a>. Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days. It marks the first time Australians have been required to quarantine for travelling for a specific part of the country.</p> <h2>Chef Pete Evans\u2019 recipe to treat Covid condemned</h2> <p>The Australian Medical Association dismissed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d</a> a device that Pete Evans has suggested could be used to treat coronavirus. Evans, a celebrity chef and television host, was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform on his website. He said on a livestream that the machine had \u201ca thousand different recipes and a couple on there for coronavirus. The AMA and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners condemned Evans on Friday.</p> <h2>Hard-pressed GPs face rent reduction requests from pathology giants</h2> <p>GPs practices are under pressure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/pathology-giants-seek-50-rent-reduction-from-hard-pressed-australian-gps-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">to accept a 50% reduction in rental payments</a> from major pathology corporations. It follows news that doctor-owned general practices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/australias-small-medical-practices-on-brink-of-collapse-amid-coronavirus\">are on the brink of financial collapse due to revenue losses</a> from Covid-19.

This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand.</p> <p>Claire McIntosh, the Mission\u2019s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been liaising with food banks since January,\u201d said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. \u201cThis is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I\u2019ve handed out \u00a317,500 in the last few weeks, compared to \u00a312,000 for the whole of the last year.\u201d</p> <p>The UK fishing industry is worth \u00a3989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at \u00a3574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent.</p> <p>\u201cLangoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,\u201d said David Dickens, the Mission\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a pandemic, people aren\u2019t interested in high quality seafood.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/one-seafarer-almost-cried-the-last-chaplain-visiting-quarantined-boats\">\u2018One seafarer almost cried\u2019: the last chaplain visiting quarantined boats</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charity\u2019s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse.</p> <p>\u201cAll the indications are we\u2019re at the beginning of a curve of need,\u201d said Dickens. \u201cThis is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there\u2019s a lot of very worried people. We\u2019re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.\u201d</p> <p>On 25 March, the Scottish government announced a \u00a35m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres.</p> <p>Dickens welcomes <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/support-for-seafood-fishing-industry/\">the scheme,</a> which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time.</p> <p>A further \u00a310m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: \u201cWork on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.\u201d</p> <p>They added that further support is being made available, including a \u00a32.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly.</p> <p>Donna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland\u2019s seafood to consumers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>It was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the \u201cworst weather we\u2019ve seen for 15 years for fleets\u201d, before the Covid-19 crisis hit.</p> <p>\u201cThe prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,\u201d said Fordyce. \u201cThe whitefish fleet, some are still going out.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to be a UK market for the next few months.\u201d</p> <p>Scotland has <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/news/scottish-sea-fisheries-statistics-2018/\">2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew</a>. </p> <p>Among those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the \u00a310m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWe are waiting with bated breath,\u201d said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get that or we are not eligible, we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p> <p>McMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January.</p> <p>\u201cWe are having to pay staff weekly. It\u2019s a huge strain on the business as we haven\u2019t any cash.\u201d</p> <p>Based in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village\u2019s largest employers.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty-two jobs is a lot of families,\u201d McMillan said.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Selling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it\u2019s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Justine Tanomjit, a commercial law student at Aberystwyth University, was headhunted for a job as an insurance broker that would have begun in June.

Alice Cole (not her real name) is in her final year at the University of Brighton and wanted to go into the NGO sector as a researcher. She was feeling confident about her prospects after graduation and there were jobs available, but the outlook has changed rapidly. \u201cBecause of coronavirus, funding for NGOs is getting smaller and there are fewer jobs at entry-level positions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt won\u2019t be possible anymore.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/06/students-tell-of-a-future-snatched-away-covid-19\">'A weird time': students tell of a future snatched away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Students are starting to realise they will be graduating into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who\">global recession</a>. According to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), many firms have scaled down their recruitment of entry-level staff and more than a quarter of businesses are reducing the number of graduates they hire this year.</p> <p>While some firms are moving assessments and interviews online, the majority have cancelled them. \u201cThousands of young people are supposed to be entering the labour market from July and they could be left without work and nothing to do while coronavirus is sorted out,\u201d says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the ISE. \u201cWe need to make sure that a whole generation isn\u2019t lost.\u201d</p> <p>One graduate recruiter says they have already retracted offers. \u201cFirms are being realistic and most are putting recruitment on hold. No one wants to offer an opportunity which might not be there in three months\u2019 time.\u201d</p> <p>Routes into graduate jobs have also been affected. Short-term work such as internships and placements will be reduced by almost a third, say the ISE, and 68% of firms have cancelled work experience and taster opportunities. As a result, <a href=\"https://trendence.co.uk/downloads/coronavirus-pandemic-gen-z-study\">almost 40% of students</a> are now worried they won\u2019t be able to get a job at all.</p> <p>James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, says although we don\u2019t know the full extent of the virus on the graduate job market yet, shrinking opportunities tend to be bad for social mobility, with students unable to access internships and other work experience placements. He says: \u201cInternships are increasingly necessary for many graduate jobs, and there is a risk that young people with professional connections may be able to find work experience while other, openly-advertised, opportunities cease to exist.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says although most companies will feel the impact, there will be some big winners and some losers depending on the sector. \u201cEven in this crisis, some employers are booming. Technology companies, the food sector and logistics firms are busier than ever,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might not end up with the job you hoped for but you can get a job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/apr/03/how-will-law-exams-be-affected-by-coronavirus\">How will law exams be affected by coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Students can also rely on their university careers\u2019 services, and Kim Connor Streich, marketing director of the Debut Careers app, thinks it is vital that applicants practice video interviews and presenting on camera.</p> <p>Others, however, think we will see more students deciding to take master\u2019s degrees or further courses of study.

The new iPad Pro manages more than eight hours of constant work between charges; enough for day\u2019s work and watching a video on the commute home but not quite the 1.5 days working-day battery that 2018\u2019s model managed.</p> <p>Part of this discrepancy could be explained by the upgrade from iOS 12 to the more capable iPadOS 13.4, which does more, often concurrently, so will be more power hungry \u2013 but also more useful. With lighter use, such as reading or watching offline movies, the iPad Pro lasts well over nine hours between charges.</p> <p>Charging the 12.9in iPad Pro with the included folding 18W charger took three hours 20 minutes from flat. Using 45W charger shaved more than an hour off that time.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2> <p>Apple does not give a rated lifecycle for the iPad Pro\u2019s battery, typically 500 full-charge cycles, but it can be replaced for \u00a399. The tablet is generally repairable, with the out-of-warranty service cost being \u00a3616.44, which includes the screen.

Instead you get a morphing blob that changes shape when near actionable items. A caret appears when over text like a Mac, but when you go near a button the cursor jumps to it, morphing into a light-grey rectangle highlighting the button. This instant selection reduces the precision required to click something obvious.</p> <p>A trackpad is the best option for the iPad as it opens up a load of gestures many of which are similar to those on a Mac. Highlights include two-finger scrolling, three/four/five-finger swipes replicating iPadOS\u2019s navigation gestures (up for home etc), and a five-finger pinch to see recently used apps. You can even two-finger or right click, which brings up what would be the tap-and-hold menu on icons and items.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f7f9cd2d17d0b3f9e7c3a912c28351267c87555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f7f9cd2d17d0b3f9e7c3a912c28351267c87555/91_153_4837_2903/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple 12.9in iPad Pro review 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trackpad support in iPadOS 13.4 is a game-changer for working on the iPad Pro, here highlighting the share button in Safari</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The interface and cursor have a bit a momentum too. For instance, you can click the time to get to notifications or battery icon to get to quick settings, or you can fling the cursor to each respective cursor with a bit of force instead. To bring up the dock you need to fling the cursor to the bottom of the screen. It\u2019s surprisingly fun, if using a cursor on a screen could ever be described as such.</p> <p>Not all the usual interactions you expect are supported, such as a lack of hover-over for tool tips, which stops some functions in web apps from working. Some buttons also refuse to click, such as the back arrow in Evernote. Clearly, some third-party app developers will need to do some work.</p> <p>Overall, trackpad and mouse support is fairly transformative for the iPad Pro as a work machine attached to a keyboard. It adds much-needed precision for text selection, working in spreadsheets and other office duties, while also reducing the strain of constant prodding of the screen.</p> <h2>Lidar and camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74082d26830325232004cedc6570ad701f4508a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74082d26830325232004cedc6570ad701f4508a6/700_427_3574_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple 12.9in iPad Pro review 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dual-camera and lidar lump on the back of the iPad Pro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The big new hardware addition to the iPad Pro for 2020 is a new dual-camera setup, similar to that used on the iPhone 11, and a lidar sensor.</p> <p>The cameras are good for a tablet, but not as good as those on the iPhone 11.

But AR on a tablet remains niche.</p> <p>Instead the big changes are software as part of iPadOS 13.4, which is also available for older models. It makes the iPad Pro more of a full computer replacement than ever.</p> <p>I can finally get every part of my work done on the tablet, without resorting to hacky work-arounds or finishing on a PC. This review was written and edited, the photos imported and edited, and finally the lot inserted into the Guardian\u2019s backend systems, something I\u2019ve simply not been able to do before all on an iPad.</p> <p>The 12.9in screen was big enough not to feel cramped, while some tasks were faster and others slower than when working on a Mac or PC.

And without massive adjustments too.</p> <p>It may not be much different from the last one, but the 2020 iPad Pro is the very best mobile tablet you can buy \u2013 which it absolutely should be for at least \u00a3969 for the 12.9in version \u2013 and arguably a solid laptop or PC replacement.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> good battery life, fast, beautiful screen, optional 4G, USB-C, great speakers, Face ID, mouse support, capable work PC replacement, lidar</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> very expensive, no kickstand without case, no headphone socket, will still need a PC for some tasks</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"818413feeb600f4b41e63b600b156f3d2a786a69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/818413feeb600f4b41e63b600b156f3d2a786a69/138_112_4388_2634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple 12.9in iPad Pro review 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The all-screen design, thin profile, squared-off sides and rounded corners still look fantastic two years on</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/apple-macbook-air-review-2020-near-perfect-consumer-laptop\">Apple MacBook Air review: 2020\u2019s near-perfect consumer laptop</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/16in-macbook-pro-review-bigger-battery-new-keyboard-new-apple\">16in MacBook Pro review: bigger battery, new keyboard, new Apple</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/12/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-not-yet-ready-for-prime-time\">Microsoft Surface Pro X review: not yet ready for prime time</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/23/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-the-best-windows-10-tablet-pc-computer\">Microsoft Surface Pro 7 review: the best Windows 10 tablet PC you can buy</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/06/microsoft-surface-go-review-tablet-thats-better-for-work-than-play\">Microsoft Surface Go review: tablet that\u2019s better for work than play</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Tanzania has pledged to improve access to education for pregnant girls after receiving a controversial $500m (\u00a3402m) World Bank loan, but has stopped short of readmitting them to mainstream classrooms.</p> <p>The World Bank has been accused of undermining human rights and has faced <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/world-bank-finally-approves-500-million-tanzania-school-project\">criticism</a> from local and international civil society groups over the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/factsheet/2020/03/31/tanzania-secondary-education-quality-improvement-program-sequip\">Tanzania secondary education quality improvement programme</a> loan.

  "<p>Helen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March \u2013 exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. \u201cIt felt like a 1960s-style birth,\u201d she jokes.</p> <p>She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. \u201cWe were hoping for the best,\u201d Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry \u2013 she hadn\u2019t brought enough food with her \u2013 so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again.</p> <p>For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. \u201cThe hardest bit of labour isn\u2019t the pushing,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cIt\u2019s the contractions. And doing that alone \u2026 you don\u2019t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can\u2019t have that person there with you.\u201d</p> <p>After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn\u2019t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn\u2019t known she had. \u201cIt gave me a newfound respect for women through history,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. \u201cIt\u2019s an anxious time for pregnant women,\u201d says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. \u201cThey are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. \u201cVisiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,\u201d says NHS England, \u201cbut our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.\u201d The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: \u201cAt the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.\u201d Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180/0_19_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Edmondson after the birth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Edmondson after the birth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Naomi Edmondson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section.</p> <p>What may be noticeable to mothers giving birth, however, is that hospitals seem emptier. A recent survey by the RCM found that 20% of midwife roles <a href=\"https://www.rcm.org.uk/media-releases/2020/march/rcm-plea-help-us-deliver-safe-care-for-pregnant-women/\">are currently unfilled</a> because of self-isolation, coronavirus or existing staff shortages. Last week, Lynsay Coventry, 54, died at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. She was the first midwife to die of Covid-19, showing the risks healthcare professionals are taking when carrying out their jobs.</p> <p>Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. \u201cThere was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: \u201cWe\u2019d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.\u201d She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages; some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews.</p> <p>Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. \u201cThe idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When it came to it, \u201cthe birth was great\u201d, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. \u201cThe fact I was not at home didn\u2019t matter.\u201d But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn\u2019t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. \u201cI started shouting at the midwives and crying,\u201d San says. \u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t meant to be there, this hadn\u2019t been the plan, I shouldn\u2019t be left alone with the baby and I wasn\u2019t coping.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507/0_0_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Martha San</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. \u201cIt just felt really wrong,\u201d San says. \u201cAfter the birth, I needed someone there and I didn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas\u2019s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. \u201cWhen they told me I couldn\u2019t have my water birth, I joked that I\u2019d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t actually expect that to happen.\u201d</p> <p>When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. \u201cI thought I could be like that for days.\u201d A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. \u201cI thought: it can\u2019t be the baby \u2013 it\u2019s too early,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even called the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn\u2019t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. \u201cI know that home births can be dangerous,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut maybe, subconsciously, I thought: \u2018I really don\u2019t want to have my baby on the labour ward.\u2019\u201d Collier-Thomas is not alone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/expectant-mothers-turn-to-freebirthing-after-home-births-cancelled\">as a result of the coronavirus lockdown</a>, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital; others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications.</p> <p>All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under \u2013 and are not bitter that their births didn\u2019t go as planned. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be upset,\u201d says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan \u201cbecause there\u2019s so much going on. I totally get it.\u201d Even though San\u2019s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. \u201cThey were doing an incredible job,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they can\u2019t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.\u201d</p> <p>The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn\u2019t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won\u2019t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. \u201cThe staff were brilliant,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm and supportive.\u201d But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. \u201cWe\u2019re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful and overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. \u201cIt\u2019s really tainted everything,\u201d says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield. She gave birth to her daughter, Clara, on 20 March. Goodman describes the care she received at Macclesfield district general hospital as \u201cbrilliant\u201d. But she feels upset Clara won\u2019t meet her grandparents for months. \u201cThey\u2019re only tiny for such a short period of time,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cThey change so quickly.\u201d Helena is also finding things strange. \u201cI should be showing my baby off and going out and seeing people. But, instead, I\u2019m sitting at home, feeling scared.\u201d</p> <p>Many expectant mothers may be contemplating their births with trepidation. And the whisper networks of expecting-mum WhatsApp and Facebook groups can be frightening. \u201cI\u2019d been freaking out before the birth and imagining the worst,\u201d says Edmondson. \u201cBut actually being in the hospital was the least worrying part of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Edmondson urges women to ignore the rumour mill, and trust the NHS. \u201cIn the hospital, it\u2019s not as bad as everyone says,\u201d she adds. \u201cFor me, it was calm, and when you have your baby you\u2019re in this lovely bubble. You\u2019re not paying attention to all the scary stuff people are posting on social media.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For politicians in the US and western Europe seeking to distract from their own disastrous mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, the idea of \u201cChina\u201d has become a convenient scapegoat. The beauty of blaming \u201cChina\u201d lies in its ambiguity. Are critics merely condemning the way the Communist party concealed information during those crucial January weeks? Both <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/house-resolution-china-coronavirus-origin-trump-racism_n_5e7a2a80c5b6f5b7c54baf93?ri18n=true&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000098&amp;guccounter=1\">liberals</a> and conservatives in the US, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242202291718979587\">Donald Trump</a>, have used this defence.</p> <p>Or, is the clear subtext that the real culprits are the \u201cChinese people\u201d and their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-china-cornyn-blame/\">exotic culture and habits</a>? Leave it to Nigel Farage to clumsily play both sides, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/nigel-farage-china-coronavirus-west-rethink-1493085\">claiming</a> both that he held \u201cno ill-will against the Chinese people\u201d but that the problem lay with \u201cappalling hygiene conditions in Chinese wildlife markets\u201d and the customary diet of bats and pangolins. Whatever the intentions, we now see how criticisms of \u201cChina\u201d have translated into an upsurge of racist violence aimed at the Chinese and Asian diaspora living in the<a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/490373-attacks-on-asian-americans-at-about-100-per-day-due-to\"> US</a>,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/coronavirus-racism-europe-covid-19\"> western Europe</a> and<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8178421/Man-armed-WHIP-goes-racist-tirade-outside-Chinese-Consulate.html\"> Oceania</a>.</p> <p>I applaud the liberal condemnation of these attacks as <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-23/coronavirus-devastation-immigrants\">xenophobic</a>, but also worry that vague cries of tolerance for \u201cChinese people\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d play into the racist framing of the right, in which we wind up debating identity and difference at the expense of dynamic historical processes. Any serious attempt to grapple with China\u2019s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China\u2019s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus\u2019s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These dangerous sentiments will not disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s take the claim that the novel coronavirus was caused by a culturally peculiar fondness for eating pangolins. Though it is true that pangolin scales and meat are advertised as a sort of folk medicine in mainland China, statistics suggest the real key variable are the effects of globalisation, which have enriched the country\u2019s business classes. Prices for the animal have <a href=\"https://qz.com/874854/chinas-insatiable-thirst-for-pangolin-scales-is-fed-by-an-international-black-market/\">climbed from $14 </a>a kilo in 1994 to more than $600 today, while illegal shipments confiscated at the border regularly <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/publications/reports/the-global-trafficking-of-pangolins/\">exceed 10 tonnes</a>. Customers ordering wildlife often do so in order to flaunt their wealth or to celebrate a good day on the stock market, although they remain a minority: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Cognition-types-and-frequency-analysis-of-Chinese-urban-residents-attitude-toward_tbl1_225329213\">most Chinese citizens</a> support strict limits, if not a ban, on wildlife consumption. Resurgent pangolin consumption is thus a result of economic liberalisation in China \u2013 which the US championed \u2013 not simply of traditional culture.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/chinese-virus-world-market/\">these same economic forces</a> that also hastened the spread of the virus overseas. Wuhan, where the virus originated, originally served as a hub between coastal metropolises, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, and inland China. Although considered a \u201csecond-tier\u201d city, even Wuhan has been caught up in the latest phase of globalisation, as capital pursues cheaper land and labour markets inland. During February and March cases of the novel coronavirus illuminated economic linkages long hidden from view, such as Chinese investments into infrastructure in<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/irans-strategic-partnership-with-china-lies-at-root-of-its-coronavirus-outbreak-11583940683\"> Qom, Iran</a> or the ties between Wuhan\u2019s car parts industry and factories in<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march\"> Serbia, South Korea</a> and<a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/china/webasto-halts-travel-china-after-2-employees-germany-contract-coronavirus\"> Germany</a>. The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, but the ensuing spread and crisis also belong to the global assemblages of commerce, tourism, and supply chains erected by powerful interests in the 21st century.</p> <p>The great irony of blaming some vague notion of Chinese culture is that the best responses to the pandemic have come from the ethnic Chinese majority governments of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/taiwan-who-coronavirus-china/\">Taiwan</a> (five deaths, 380 cases), Singapore (six/1,910), and Hong Kong (four/974). Yes, their responsible policies were due largely to the trauma of the 2003 Sars epidemic but also have to do with the history of robust welfare states in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/opinion/covid-face-mask-shortage.html\">East Asia</a>, which, unlike Europe and the US, have increasingly invested in healthcare infrastructure to deal with precisely such crises.</p> <p>To push back on the anti-China line is not to apologise or defend the state\u2019s actions. It is clear that local officials were wrong to silence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Dr Li Wenliang</a>, who alerted friends about the virus as early as possible, and that the government has consistently downplayed the virus\u2019s contagiousness and the severity of deaths.</p> <p>But is the contrast between authoritarian and democratic regimes so stark, as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/why-democracies-are-better-fighting-outbreaks/606976/\"> western ideologues</a> allege? Most observers agree that China covered up the crisis in Wuhan for three weeks in January, and this lost time probably decided the difference between a local versus a global epidemic. Nevertheless, it is still sobering to read reports that even from mid-January other governments took even longer to respond: the UK dragged its feet for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\"> an interminable eight weeks</a> and the US<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\"> ignored clear warning signs for 70 days</a>.</p> <p>This inactivity was partly the product of a western exceptionalism that believed viruses and epidemics only happen \u201cover there\u201d, in poor and non-white countries. This is a crucial point for challenging anti-Asian racism. Rather than debate the blame game, as Justice is Global director Tobita Chow has written, we should point out how short-sighted <a href=\"https://fellowtravelersblog.com/2020/04/03/policy-from-the-people-cooperation-in-the-face-of-covid-19/\">nationalist perspectives</a> have produced fatally ineffective responses. During Italy\u2019s worst weeks, officials<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html\"> admitted they</a> initially viewed the Wuhan crisis as a \u201cscience-fiction movie that had nothing to do with us\u201d. In the US, a<a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article241353836.html\"> Kansas politician stated</a> that his town was safe because it had only a few Chinese residents. In Philadelphia, in a more tragic offshoot of racial thinking, <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/03/coronavirus-immunity-racism-history-disease-yellow-fever/607891/\">rumours circulated</a> that the virus could not infect black Americans because it was a Chinese disease, misinformation that officials now fear <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-coronavirus-race-african-american-cases-rising-20200403.html\">exacerbated inequalities</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-black-people-ethnic-minority-deaths-pandemic-inequality-afua-hirsch\">If coronavirus doesn't discriminate, how come black people are bearing the brunt? | Afua Hirsch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, both the pandemic and the accompanying anti-Asian backlash are dynamics that go beyond questions of culture and xenophobia, carrying serious life-and-death consequences. Both are the indirect byproducts of China\u2019s emergence as a major force in global capitalism, not only forging the supply chains and travel networks that conveyed the virus but also threatening Euro-America\u2019s centuries-long economic and political prestige.</p> <p>In the US, such fears were already manifest in populist claims that China alone \u2013 and not the domestic political and business class \u2013 was to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs. In the wake of a referendum result seen as a vote against globalisation, anxieties in the UK have recently been manifest in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-usa-huawei-instantview/reaction-to-uk-allowing-huawei-a-role-in-5g-network-idUSKBN1ZR1FU\">panic over Huawei</a> providing the country\u2019s 5G network. Fears over China were not created by coronavirus, but find in it a most apt metaphor, as a global and invisible force of destruction.</p> <p>It follows that these dangerous sentiments will not automatically disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance. We need to also recognise and confront the political-economic forces behind the west\u2019s anti-China backlash \u2013 and the inadequacy of nationalism in responding to the social and public health crises facing us today, which are global in scale.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Liu is an assistant professor of history at Villanova University and the author of <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300243734/tea-war\">Tea War: A History of Capitalism in China and India</a></p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>On the Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, speaking about Covid-19, Prof Neil Ferguson was described as being \u201cmore influential right now than any politician\u201d. Ferguson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">leads a team of modellers</a> at Imperial College London whose mission has been to predict the pattern and health impact of coronavirus transmission in the UK under different scenarios, and thereby help government make the right decisions about how best to protect the population.</p> \n<p>The UK has some of the best infectious disease modellers in the world, and the government has been wise to draw upon their expertise. But all models have their limitations, and none can avoid the fact that decision-making must also be informed by people with relevant expertise and experience, and by the facts on the ground. In the case of Covid-19, where so much about the disease and its transmission dynamics is still unknown or unclear, models are useful \u2013 but experience and sound judgment are crucial.</p> \n<p>This is becoming apparent across the world. Countries that lived through the experience of Sars and Mers appear to have been better prepared to deal with Covid-19 than those that didn\u2019t. And in Canada, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-ontario-quebec-covid-19-1.5524056\">the success of British Columbia</a> in controlling Covid-19 compared with other provinces has been partly attributable to the combined ingredients of political experience and good judgment.</p> \n<p>There is also a non-scientific element to decision-making which involves choosing between competing demands and needs in society, determining what is ethical and moral, and balancing challenges that are current and immediate with those that will only emerge in the future. For example, a model that incorporates value judgments is needed to balance the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, while it is often said that Covid-19 \u201cdoes not discriminate\u201d, this statement is only partially true. The virus disproportionately affects older people and men; and we can be sure that the effects of both the virus and the collateral damage of control measures will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">disproportionately affect the poorer and more marginalised</a> segments of society. How we manage this differentiated vulnerability is all about ethics and politics. It may be informed by a scientific model, but it shouldn\u2019t be disguised as a technocratic problem that can be resolved by mathematical equations.</p> \n<p>It is easy to be entranced by the cleverness of models that map, measure and predict the complex interactions of multiple natural and social variables. There is something impressive about the ability to produce answers in the form of precisely calculated numbers, and professionally crafted charts and graphs. And for politicians, nothing is more convenient than being able to say that they are merely following \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings\">the science</a>\u201d and evidence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While Marr\u2019s comment about Ferguson being the most influential person in the country was rhetorical, it hints at the perception that epidemiological modelling has played a disproportionately influential role in shaping the UK\u2019s strategy and plans. Others have pointed out that some of the earlier modelling work had gaps that have adversely affected policy decisions. These include not accounting for the potential role of testing and contact tracing in mitigating the epidemic; not modelling the impact of sick patients on intensive care beds and other parts of the health system; and not modelling the epidemic across different regions of the UK.</p> \n<p>It is not clear what caused these omissions. Perhaps they were the result of blindspots that persisted due to the lack of external scrutiny and challenge. In the case of the sidelining of testing and contact tracing, perhaps it was because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had concluded that these measures were not worth while \u2013 a view that is understandable if Sage also saw the building up of herd immunity through natural infection as part of its strategy.</p> \n<p>There has been lots of speculation as to why the UK delayed lockdown compared with other countries; why it was slow to increase viral testing capacity; and why the NHS was left so poorly prepared. Now is not the time to look backwards. Neither would I want to place any criticism on modellers. Rigorous modelling is done by clever modellers; but the design and testing of models, including the assumptions built into models and the questions that modellers have been asked to help answer, is a collective responsibility.</p> \n<p>Modelling is vital and could assist greatly in going forward. In particular, two things should be urgently modelled. The first is to model the impact of different strategies that will help us avoid the harms of draconian, population-wide lockdown. This should include modelling the costs and benefits of weekly viral testing of the whole population (not 100,000 tests a day, but 10 million tests a day), or a more modest but greatly expanded testing regime, combined with aggressive case detection and contact tracing, coupled with continued physical distancing and improved hygiene. The former idea may sound radical and extreme, but is a serious proposal that could be implemented if there was sufficient political will.</p> \n<p>Second, we must model (and then keep monitoring) the health and socioeconomic impacts of both the virus and the control measures, with short-, medium- and long-term timeframes, and with a social lens to look at how the virus has impacted differentially across society. For some reason, there was no modelling of the socioeconomic impact of lockdown. This was an omission \u2013 and as we enter the beginning of what could be a global economic recession, we could see thousands of lives cut short from this collateral damage.</p> \n<p>Finally, from a policymaking perspective, there are two things needed. First, we need greater transparency and participation to allow effective scrutiny and challenge from scientists and public health specialists who are more independent of government. This will avoid the danger of groupthink and blindspots. Second, we must better acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based policy and recognise the importance of expertise, experience and sound judgment.</p> \n<p>\u2022 David McCoy is a professor of Global Public Health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London.</p>",

It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings.

Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d.</p> <p>One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up.

Until recently, the NAB director Ann Sherry was billed as Carnival Australia\u2019s chairman, but Carnival says she no longer holds the role.</p> <p>A search of the corporate registry shows there is no Australian company named Carnival Australia. Instead, the words are a business name owned by one of the companies atop Carnival\u2019s globe-spanning corporate tree, the UK-registered Carnival PLC.</p> <p>According to Carnival\u2019s filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the group\u2019s only Australian subsidiary is the oddly named A.C.N. 098 290 834, which has paid-up share capital of $100 and is owned by Carnival PLC.</p> <p>Sherry is not and has never been a director of this company, and Carnival\u2019s spokesman, David Jones, did not respond to specific questions about what it did. Nor did he respond when asked when Sherry ceased to be chairman of Carnival Australia, how she could be an officer of an entity that does not exist and how the group\u2019s local operation was structured.</p> <p>Attempts to contact Sherry have been unsuccessful. There is no suggestion that she played any role in the events surrounding Ruby Princess.</p> <p>At the top of the group sit Carnival PLC and another company called Carnival Corporation, which is registered in the Central American tax haven Panama. The two companies operate together as one entity \u2013 a structure that allows it to be listed on stock exchanges in London and New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edfa35396a7dea688a0676d7ac404065cdebd082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edfa35396a7dea688a0676d7ac404065cdebd082/307_359_5036_3023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NSW police prepare to board the Ruby Princess to search for evidence on Wednesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NSW police prepare to board the Ruby Princess to search for evidence on Wednesday evening.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Patterson/NSW police/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of Carnival\u2019s fleet of more than 100 ships are registered in tax havens around the world \u2013 including Panama, Bermuda and the Bahamas \u2013 although some are registered in the UK.</p> <p>The two companies file one set of accounts, which show that even before the Covid-19 outbreak stranded its ships around the world it was heavily indebted. Accounts filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission show Carnival lost US$770m ($1.24bn) in the three months to the end of February.</p> <p>It owed more than $10bn that had to be repaid within 12 months, including $4.7bn in customer deposits for cruises that now mostly appear unlikely to happen, and a further $9.7bn that has to be paid back later on.</p> <p>Against the $10bn in current debts, it had just $2.9bn in current assets.</p> <p>To help it survive, last week Carnival went to its shareholders and lenders for an emergency cash injection, raising $6.25bn.
