  "<p>Europe\u2019s Roma communities are often living on polluted wastelands and lacking running water or sanitation in their homes as a result of \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d, a report has concluded.</p> <p>The European Environmental Bureau (EEB), a pan-European network of green NGOs, found Roma communities were often excluded from basic services, such as piped drinking water, sanitation and rubbish collection, while frequently living at or near some of the dirtiest sites in Europe, such as landfills or contaminated industrial land.</p> <p>As many as 10 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/25/europe-roma-matteo-salvini-ethnic-minority\">Roma people</a> live in Europe, including 6 million in EU member states. While their social exclusion has been long documented, EEB researchers say denial of basic services and exposure to pollution has been overlooked.</p> <p>The EEB, in collaboration with researchers in central and eastern Europe, found 32 cases of \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d in five European countries: Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and North Macedonia. The researchers also drew on existing work on living conditions of Roma people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo.</p> <p>Absence of water, sanitation and rubbish collection were problems in more than half the case studies, such as Stolipinovo in Bulgaria, Europe\u2019s largest Roma settlement and part of the city of Plovdiv. About 60,000 people are estimated to live in the district, but many are cut off from piped water and sanitation services from the rest of Plovdiv, a European capital of culture in 2019.</p> <p>In Hungary, access to the public water supply for some Roma communities was shut down during summer heatwaves \u2013 decisions affecting 800 people in Gul\u00e1cs in August 2017 and 1,500 inhabitants of Husz\u00e1rtelep in 2013. The northern Hungarian city of \u00d3zd received nearly \u20ac5.5m (\u00a34.8m) from Switzerland to improve provision of running water to Roma communities, but researchers said many had not benefited from the scheme. Authorities claimed Roma households did not pay their bills.</p> <p>Previous research concluded that only about 12% of Roma communities had functioning flush toilets and drainage systems.</p> <p>One vivid example of the desperate conditions Roma people can find themselves living in is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/no-voice-no-future-roma-ignored-as-europe-goes-to-polls\">Pata-R\u00e2t,</a> on the outskirts of Cluj-Napoca in Romania\u2019s north-west, known for its gothic architecture and baroque palaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"118cca4d506d326b983d92eac8b710e6e3734c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/118cca4d506d326b983d92eac8b710e6e3734c1d/0_0_4957_3072/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The isolated Roma community living in Pata-R\u00e2t\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The isolated Roma community living in Pata-R\u00e2t.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cronos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Pata-R\u00e2t about 2,000 Roma people live next to or on a landfill site. \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying,\u201d said the Roma rights activist Ciprian Nodis, who has visited several times. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to what you can see in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. People are living in extreme poverty with no access to utilities, no access to electricity, water. They live in improvised shelters made from recyclable materials that they find on the landfill \u2013 cardboard, or rotten wood, or things like that. Most of them work in the landfill.\u201d</p> <p>He identified four separate Roma communities living at Pata-R\u00e2t: the first group came in the 1960s, and the most recent arrivals in 2013 when Roma residents of Cluj-Napoca were evicted from the city centre. The least fortunate of the four communities live on the landfill itself, where the air, water and soil is deeply polluted. \u201cIt\u2019s a living hell, especially for the children who are born there. It\u2019s bad luck to be born in Pata-R\u00e2t,\u201d Nodis said.</p> <p>But Pata-R\u00e2t is not even exceptional. Researchers identified more Roma communities living on or next to landfill sites at Fakulteta, near Sofia. On the outskirts of the Transylvanian city of Turda, Roma families live on a former industrial site contaminated with mercury. Unsurprisingly Roma people in the 32 case studies were vulnerable to respiratory and infectious diseases, accidents and depression.</p> <p>Meanwhile Roma communities not living on degraded land risk eviction, without legal recourse. About 100 Roma people living in Constan\u01aba in Romania were forced to move to allow for the creation of a holiday resort.</p> <p>Patrizia Heidegger, one of the report\u2019s authors and the director of global policies and sustainability at the EEB, said the 32 cases were only the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>Denial of basic services persisted, despite Roma communities having being settled in the same villages and cities for many years. Absence of water or sanitation was \u201cnot due to not having lived in the place for a long time. It\u2019s really total neglect of neighbourhoods with Roma populations.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was compounded as Roma communities were often blamed for the pollution and land degradation, she said. \u201cThey are perceived as the environmental problem and not as communities that are disproportionately affected by exposure to pollution or the non-provision of environmental services, which then leads to the degradation of their environment.</p> <p>Roma communities faced huge prejudices, she said, citing attitudes such as \u201c\u2018they don\u2019t care about a clean environment, they don\u2019t care where they live, they work in waste dumps anyhow so they live there.\u2019 These are racist prejudices.\u201d</p> <p>The EEB is now calling on EU authorities and member states to increase efforts to protect health, while urging them to recognise the scale of the problem. \u201cWe need to acknowledge that environmental racism exists in Europe. That is the first step,\u201d Heidegger said.</p>",

Now every sentence would be picked over and every word would count.</p> \n<p>The Queen began by acknowledging the challenges everyone was facing: death; financial hardship (some more than others, when it comes to the royal family); and separation, before going on to praise the selflessness of those in the NHS and other frontline emergency services. She then said how much she hoped people would maintain the self-sacrifice, self-discipline, compassion and sense of humour needed to defeat the illness.</p> \n<p>On the hottest weekend of the year so far, this rang a little hollow as most of the country appeared to have gone outdoors with the sole purpose of snitching on any people they came across who weren\u2019t keeping the appropriate safe distance from one another. B&amp;Q have had a massive run on tape measures in the past week. It won\u2019t be long before there\u2019s also a black market in tasers to take out sweaty joggers.</p> \n<p>After a nod to the Commonwealth and the global nature of the pandemic \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the plucky Brits taking on the might of Nazi Germany singlehandedly in 1940 \u2013 the Queen mentioned a previous address she and Princess Margaret had made to the nation in 1940. Still, she could be forgiven the solipsism as she had done her bit during the second world war, having spent the latter years of the war driving military trucks. As yet there were no promises to turn any of the royal palaces into field hospitals or emergency supply depots, though she might be holding that in reserve for another day.</p> \n<p>The Queen ended with a promise that better days would one day return and that in the meantime we should hold our nerve and do our best to be the generation of which future ones would be proud. We can but hope. She even came over a bit Vera Lynn, promising us \u201cwe\u2019ll meet again\u201d. Only without the singing. Small mercies. Maybe next time. Given the circumstances, it had been more or less a pitch perfect speech. After all there\u2019s only a certain amount a head of state can say at times like these.</p> \n<p>But one thing was notable by its absence. Although it\u2019s her job to be apolitical, there was no mention of the government\u2019s efforts or requests to follow official advice. Her Maj still hasn\u2019t forgotten how she was used, and made a fool of, by Boris Johnson over the prorogation and pointless Queen\u2019s speech. In Boris, she doesn\u2019t trust. But then who does?</p> \n<p>The subtext was unmistakeable. If the country was to survive, it would do so through the collective resolve of its people, not through a government that had been slow to react and was still making promises it did not know it would be able to keep. And with that she faded out after little less than four minutes.</p> \n<p>Throughout, her face remained more or less expressionless \u2013 inscrutability to hide the pain \u2013 but she had done what was required. Simply by being there, she had shown she cared. She had provided the clear moral leadership that many politicians have failed to provide. For some people nothing she could have said would have been enough, while others would have taken comfort. Most people probably wouldn\u2019t have cared much either way. But it was a necessary rite of passage. And a tough gig when underneath you\u2019re just as scared \u2013 if not more so, given her age \u2013 as everyone else. There\u2019s no disguising it: the Queen\u2019s a class act.</p>",
  "<p>I had hoped to interview the plant neurobiologist <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/stefano_mancuso\">Stefano Mancuso</a> at his laboratory at the University of Florence. I picture it as a botanical utopia: a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence; where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2015/12/15/can-a-plant-remember-this-one-seems-to-heres-the-evidence/\">their long memories</a>; and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms.</p> <p>But because we are both on lockdown, we Skype from our homes. Instead of meeting his clever plants, I make do with admiring a pile of cannonball-like pods from an aquatic species, on the bookshelves behind him. \u201cThey\u2019re used for propagation,\u201d he says. \u201cI am always collecting seeds.\u201d</p> <p>Before Mancuso\u2019s lab started work in 2005, plant neurobiology was largely seen as a laughable concept. \u201cWe were interested in problems that were, until that moment, just related to animals, like intelligence and even behaviour,\u201d he says. At the time, it was \u201calmost forbidden\u201d to talk about behaviour in plants. But \u201cwe study how plants are able to solve problems, how they memorise, how they communicate, how they have their social life and things like that\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b407655007c5374e751be2026c823bec4cb94c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b407655007c5374e751be2026c823bec4cb94c8/0_0_4200_2811/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Flowers of Mimosa pudica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flower power ... Mancuso\u2019s team has shown that <em>Mimosa pudica</em> can retain learned information for weeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mancuso and his colleagues have become experts in training plants, just like neuroscientists train lab rats. If you let a drop of water fall on a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/08/do-plants-think-james-wong\">Mimosa pudica</a></em>, its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves, but, if you continue doing so, the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting. The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks, even when their living conditions, such as lighting, are changed. \u201cThat was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories, in the range of one or two days \u2013 the average memory of insects,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cTo find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise.\u201d Not least because they don\u2019t have brains.</p> <p>In a plant, a single brain would be a fatal flaw because they have evolved to be lunch. \u201cPlants use a very different strategy,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cThey are very good at diffusing the same function all over the body.\u201d You can remove 90% of a plant without killing it. \u201cYou need to imagine a plant as a huge brain. Maybe not as efficient as in the case of animals, but diffused everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso\u2019s work is the idea of plant consciousness. As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence, not to mention human intelligence, the always-contentious term consciousness has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/-sp-why-cant-worlds-greatest-minds-solve-mystery-consciousness\">the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate</a>.<strong> </strong>\u201cLet\u2019s use another term,\u201d Mancuso suggests. \u201cConsciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages. Let\u2019s talk about awareness. Plants are perfectly aware of themselves.\u201d A simple example is when one plant overshadows another \u2013 the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light. But when you look into the crown of a tree, all the shoots are heavily shaded. They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves. \u201cSo they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside,\u201d says Mancuso.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, the plant emits a distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric, he argues. One test for self-awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves. \u201cVery few animals are able to do this,\u201d says Mancuso. \u201cHumans, dolphins, a few apes and probably elephants. This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self-awareness.\u201d Mancuso believes this is wrong. \u201cMy personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself. For me, it\u2019s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent, to solve problems.\u201d</p> <p>Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state \u2013 incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them. But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals. \u201cAnd this is not an opinion. This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence. We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least 20 different chemical and physical parameters, many of which we are blind to.\u201d There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet, and we would have no idea, whereas \u201cplants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Far from being silent and passive, plants are social and communicative, above ground and beneath, through their roots and fungal networks. They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms. They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger, deter predators and attract pollinating insects. When corn is nibbled by caterpillars, for example, the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef054ca6030930e7faefec8e44f0a039ca969b9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef054ca6030930e7faefec8e44f0a039ca969b9e/0_0_3600_2400/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Old Tjikko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slower pace of life ... Old Tjikko in Sweden is almost 10,000 years old.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Johansson/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plants respond to sound, too, \u201cfeeling\u201d vibrations all over. \u201cPlants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds, for example at 200hz or 300hz \u2026 because they are seeking the sound of running water.\u201d If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant, he says, they will follow it. There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants, although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it.</p> <p>Another reason we overlook plants\u2019 intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life. In Mancuso\u2019s new book, The Incredible Journey of Plants, we meet the world\u2019s oldest plant \u2013 Old Tjikko \u2013 a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about 9,560 years. We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass, which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect \u2013 and can survive for six years while waiting.</p> <p>The main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet. Mancuso eschews the notion of \u201cnative species\u201d and prizes so-called invasive species above all else. \u201cThe more invasive they are, the more I like them, because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems,\u201d he says. \u201cInvasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine.\u201d For Mancuso, \u201cmigration is one of the most important forces of nature. All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>Although new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology, Mancuso still has his detractors. Last summer, a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(19)30126-8\">Trends in Plant Science</a> that Mancuso and his colleagues \u201chave consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural, organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge\u201d. Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired. \u201cIt\u2019s an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving. For them, plants are kind of a semi-living organic machine.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All living organisms migrate. We are the only species that is not allowed to, and this is completely unnatural</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around, says Mancuso: \u201cWhen you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms, you start to use them. This is exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. We felt ourselves as outside nature.\u201d The average lifespan of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years. \u201cHomo sapiens have lived just 300,000 years,\u201d he says \u2013 and already \u201cwe have been able to almost destroy our environment. From this point of view, how can we say that we are better organisms?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps we should try \u2013 ahem \u2013 taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom\u2019s book. Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies \u2013 with a brain, or a top-level control centre, and various different organs governing specific functions. \u201cWe use this in our universities, our companies, even our class divisions,\u201d says Mancuso. This structure enables us to move fast, physically and organisationally, but it also leaves us vulnerable. If a major organ fails, it could scupper everything, and top-down leadership rarely serves the whole.</p> <p>Plants, by contrast, \u201care kind of horizontal, diffusive, decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity\u201d. Take the internet, the ultimate decentralised root system. \u201cLook at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good-quality information by using a decentralised, diffused organisation. I\u2019m claiming that, by studying plant networks, we can find wonderful solutions for us,\u201d Or take the ethos of cooperation. Plants, say Mancuso, \u201care masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms: bacteria, mushrooms, insects, even us. Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world.\u201d We may think we have the upper hand, but plants may beg to differ.</p> <p><em>The Incredible Journey of Plants by Stefano Mancuso</em><em> is published by </em><em>Other Press</em></p>",
  "<p>Six months ago the Liverpool chief executive, Peter Moore, was asked what distinguished his club from other European football giants. \u201cWe had this amazing historical figure: Bill Shankly, a Scottish socialist who built the foundation,\u201d he told El Pais. \u201cEven today, when we talk about business, we ask ourselves: \u2018What would Shankly do?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/05/liverpool-challenged-by-spirit-of-shankly-fan-group-over-staff-furloughs\">Liverpool challenged by Spirit of Shankly fan group over staff furlough</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So what would Shankly do in a global pandemic that threatens to bring the economy and the health system to its knees? The answer, it\u2019s safe to say, would not involve piggybacking on a government scheme to stop mass unemployment when you are the world\u2019s seventh-richest club. Furloughing Liverpool\u2019s non-playing staff \u2013 saving perhaps \u00a31m \u2013 when you have an annual wage bill of \u00a3310m and paid \u00a343m to agents last year is not a good look.</p> \n<p>True, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/02/pay-cuts-furlough-or-deferrals-what-are-the-premier-league-clubs-doing\" title=\"\">Newcastle and Spurs</a> did the same last week but by now we know who Mike Ashley and Daniel Levy are.

It\u2019s not too late for Fenway Sports Group to admit it has misjudged the public mood, to row back, to apologise. Even the smartest people get it wrong sometimes.</p> \n<p>However, Liverpool\u2019s problems merely reflect the trouble English football has in responding to these dislocating times. You cannot blame players who are being asked to give up \u2013 or defer \u2013 30% of their salaries for being aggrieved when they don\u2019t know whether the money will go towards the NHS or back into their owners\u2019 pockets.</p> \n<p>It is also a bit rich for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to publicly shame footballers when frontline medical staff are lethally short of PPE equipment. And, let\u2019s be honest, if the government really wanted the super-rich to contribute more in this crisis, there is an easy solution: change the tax system.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42777b302cf35f82ba4c84ed6e58874685b69aa3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42777b302cf35f82ba4c84ed6e58874685b69aa3/0_298_4474_2685/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Henderson has contacted his fellow Premier League captains to organise a coronavirus fund that will raise millions of pounds for the NHS\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Henderson has contacted his fellow Premier League captains to organise a coronavirus fund that will raise millions of pounds for the NHS</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That said it was obvious football might get a kicking weeks ago and the players, the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association and the Premier League should have anticipated it. In mid-March, donating a large sum to the NHS would have been a massive PR win. Now it looks like they are being shamed into it, while also appearing out of touch with fans.</p> \n<p>There are some who will say the game is less connected to local communities nowadays \u2013 after all, top players make more money in a week than most of us earn in a year. But the evidence suggests otherwise. Spanish academics have twice studied how much Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a mattered to the people of La Coru\u00f1a, first in 2003 and then again in 2012. \u201cOne of the most striking data,\u201d they wrote in their latter study, \u201cis the increase in the percentage of people who believe that if Deportivo disappeared, the quality of life in the city would be worse.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/04/liverpool-become-latest-premier-league-club-to-furlough-non-playing-staff\">Liverpool under fire for furloughs while PFA points to pay-cut tax trap</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Similar results have been found in England. A 2015 study asked just under 1,200 residents in Luton and Bury how important their club was to the town. A total of 47% in Luton and 39% in Bury felt their quality of life would reduce if their football club was no longer around.</p> \n<p>Bury are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/bury-demise-shows-football-league-must-tighten-ffp-rules-review\" title=\"\">already on the brink</a> and last week two chief executives in sport told me they are working on the assumption things won\u2019t get back to where they were until September. How many other Football League and National League clubs might be in trouble by then? And how healthy will other organisations, such as UK Athletics or the British Basketball League, be if no events take place by then?</p> \n<p>Certainly with the economy forecast to take the biggest gut-punch since the Great Depression it is hard to see a swift return to normalcy. Already there are predictions the business model that has supercharged the Premier League and other sports will change, with the value of broadcasting rights likely to fall.</p> \n<p>How will it not, if fewer of us can afford pay-TV? Over the coming months football would do well to learn from other sports, who have shown it is possible to work speedily and effectively for the greater good. Three weeks ago the Professional Triathletes Organisation announced it would increase its annual end-of-year bonus scheme from $2m to $2.5m \u2013 and immediately paid it out rather than wait until December.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f1a825ce-d8e2-4e99-a04d-76867977f193\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Realising that triathletes lower down the food chain would need extra help, it gave the extra $500,000 in bonuses just to men and women ranked between 21 and 100 in the world. The world\u2019s top 10 have also committed to doing online appearances and exhibitions and donating all the revenue to lower-ranked triathletes.</p> \n<p>Other bodies, such as Sport England, are also stepping up. Last week it announced a \u00a3192m package to help grassroots sport \u2013 including a \u00a320m emergency fund with grants of between \u00a3300 and \u00a310,000 for sports clubs and community organisations, those vital but unappreciated capillaries in our society. That comes down to smart leadership. And it matters more than ever.</p> \n<p>In Peter Moore\u2019s El Pais interview, he pointed out that Liverpool\u2019s owner had \u201cnot taken a penny of benefits\u201d and stressed their broader philosophy of investing to create a virtuous circle. \u201cTake care of your heritage, keep going, and surely good things will happen,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>More than just a club?

  "<p>Parks across the UK could be closed unless more people adhere to social distancing rules, after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said those using public spaces to sunbathe were putting people\u2019s lives at risk and may trigger stricter lockdown measures.</p> <p>Despite Sunday\u2019s warm temperatures, fewer people visited parks than usual, but scenes in Brockwell Park in south London on Saturday \u2013 where 3,000 people gathered \u2013 were widely condemned and led to the park <a href=\"https://love.lambeth.gov.uk/lambeth-council-statement-brockwell-park-temporary-closure/\">being temporarily closed</a>.</p> <p>Police said they also had to move more than 100 people from Primrose Hill in London after they were found with \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MPSCamandPrim/status/1246529798371004428\">full picnics or blankets, sunbathing</a>\u201d.</p> <p>On Sunday morning, Hancock said he could be forced to take action before later saying that any change would not be immediate.</p> <p>He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think this example of exercise is a really important one, because we\u2019ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it\u2019s OK to exercise on your own or with members of your own household.</p> <p>\u201cBut if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say: \u2018Well, if I can exercise then it\u2019s fine for me to do other things,\u2019 then I\u2019m afraid we will have to take action.\u201d</p> <p>But he later clarified his position, saying: \u201c\u2018We can\u2019t rule out further steps but I don\u2019t want anyone to think that any changes to the social distancing rules are imminent, because the vast majority are following the rules.\u201d</p> <p>The temporary closure of Brockwell Park and images of sunbathers from around the country triggered a debate about the use of parks by people who do not have accessible outdoor space during the Covid-19 lockdown.</p> <p>Hancock was backed by the newly-elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said his party would support either a ban on outdoor exercise or on non-essential work if it was needed to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cWe do have to take whatever steps are necessary,\u201d said Starmer, who said social distancing was difficult for people who did not have a garden to exercise in, but insisted \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get through this\u201d.</p> <p>Angela Rayner, who was elected as Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said on Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s all right for people who\u2019ve got big houses and huge back gardens to say that, but if you\u2019re stuck in inadequate accommodation, you\u2019ve got no back garden, nowhere to go, and you\u2019re on top of each other, people should do social distancing, but also be reasonable and proportionate about that.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal Parks \u2013 the charity that manages several parks in London, including Primrose Hill, Greenwich Park and Hyde Park, which were all busy over the weekend \u2013 said its spaces would remain open for now.</p> <p>\u201cOur sole priority at the moment is to keep the parks open and safe for as long as possible, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure this is the case,\u201d a spokesperson said.

  "<p>Amid an ever increasing level of scrutiny over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Matt Hancock appeared on the airwaves on Sunday to reassure the public that Downing Street was in control of the pandemic.</p> <p>Here we weigh up what the health secretary said against previous statements and the latest developments.</p> <h2><strong>What was said</strong></h2> <p>On BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve set a very clear goal for the nation as a whole. The whole life sciences industry are coming to the table on this. I didn\u2019t say it would be easy to get to 100,000 a day, I said we need to get to 100,000 a day.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Factcheck</strong></h2> <p>Hancock seemed to be describing the 100,000 tests per day as a broader ambition for the country, including the life sciences industry. When the figure was first introduced, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-sets-out-plan-to-carry-out-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">the Department of Health</a> stated that the UK \u201cwill\u201d carry out 100,000 tests for coronavirus every day by the end of this month.<strong> </strong>Is this pledge being watered down into an ambition?</p> <h2><strong>What was said</strong></h2> <p>On Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We set a goal of 10,000 tests a day by the end of March and we hit that goal.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Factcheck</strong></h2> <p>Testing passed 10,000 a day for the first time on 2 April. The government previously said the capacity for 10,000 tests was met and the shortfall in actual tests was due to hospitals failing to use this capacity to the full.</p> <h2><strong>What was said</strong></h2> <p>Also on Sophy Ridge on Sunday:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK has put more funding into the global search for a vaccine than any other country around the world.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Factcheck</strong></h2> <p>Hancock was no doubt referring to the \u00a3210m UK donation to the Coalition for Vaccine Preparedness (CEPI), which is the largest single donation since the initiative announced a target of $2bn required from international governments to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.</p> <p>However, the UK was starting from <a href=\"https://cepi.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Board-of-Directors-report-and-Annual-accounts_2017-2018.pdf\">a lower base of funding to CEPI</a> than other countries, including Japan, the US and Norway \u2013 whose total funding to CEPI <a href=\"https://cepi.net/news_cepi/norway-intensifies-covid-19-fight-with-nok2-2-billion-donation-to-cepi/\">now stands at nearly \u00a3340m</a>. Beyond CEPI funding, it is unlikely that the UK is the biggest spender on the vaccine effort, with the US signing a single $456m deal with Janssen last month and the Gate Foundation announcing last week that it would spend <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-factories-7-different-vaccines-to-fight-coronavirus-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">\u201ca few billion dollars\u201d</a> building factories for seven promising coronavirus vaccine candidates.</p>",
  "<p>Isn\u2019t it funny, in a lovely sort of way, how rewatching certain films and TV shows feels like reacquainting yourself with old friends? The idea of catching up with loved ones draws rather melancholic feelings these days. In the era of physical distancing and self-isolation, most of us having resigned ourselves to not seeing anybody in person \u2013 let alone shaking their hands or giving them a hug \u2013 for months.</p> <p>Tactile qualities \u2013 that feeling of being able to reach out and touch something \u2013 are synonymous with the beautiful handmade aesthetics of Aardman Animations, the British studio that specialises in claymation. Two of the studio\u2019s beloved franchises, Shaun the Sheep and Wallace and Gromit, belong to worlds I like to revisit when I\u2019m feeling down, finding their joie de vivre and loving, crafted constructions a kind of soul-invigorating tonic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb798e8593c281a49f743627f57097fe91643eb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb798e8593c281a49f743627f57097fe91643eb8/0_0_4800_4566/1000..jpg\" alt=\"moulded figures of dog and man in an old car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"951\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallace and his ever-faithful dog Gromit cash in with their humane pest-control outfit, Anti-Pesto, in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo Credit: Courtesy DreamWorks Animation/PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For kids, you say? Au contraire! Both franchises accommodate all ages and, in fact, all schedules too, available in snackable two-minute instalments as well as half-hour episodes and feature-length spin-offs. The briefer the running time, generally speaking, the more appropriate for young children; the short episodes usually don\u2019t have much in the way of storytelling sophistication or messages likely to resonate with adults.</p> <p>The movies are a different story. Full of visual wit, narrative ingenuity and highly creative arrangement of space and setting, they are striking achievements that reflect a unique filmmaking style.</p> <p>The depth and genius of the Shaun the Sheep Movie (which also has an excellent sequel \u2013 A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon) belies its kiddish material materials. At various points the film channels two of my favourite filmmakers \u2013 Jacques Tati and Luis Bu\u00f1uel \u2013 as well as comic geniuses from the pre-talkies era: namely Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. It is in effect a silent film, capturing in entirely visual ways the journey of the titular mammal and his friends to the big city, where they try to find their amnesia-affected farmer, who suffered a blow to the head that was entirely their fault.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae9272fbf320a5566c64e9b2d0e335a601c21f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae9272fbf320a5566c64e9b2d0e335a601c21f9c/0_0_3730_2108/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"565\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon belies its kiddish materials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Johnson/Aardman Animations</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Tati\u2019s films Playtime and Mon Uncle, speech is primarily used not for the communication of dialogue but as a kind of sound effect, reiterating the film\u2019s visual focus. When the sheep visit a fancy restaurant and pretend to be diners, co-directors Mark Burton and Richard Starzak venture into a surreal Bu\u00f1uellian space reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/28/discreet-charm-bourgeoisie-review\">The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</a>, Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s noodle-scratching 1972 oddity about a group of people who are always arriving for dinner but never get the opportunity to eat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/03/hugh-grants-guilty-pleasures-rediscovering-the-saucy-and-sapphic-curios-of-his-back-catalogue\">Hugh Grant's guilty pleasures: rediscovering the saucy and Sapphic curios of his back catalogue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a clever joke early on, the sheep hide from a maniacal animal catcher by posing in front of an advertisement depicting an idyllic green countryside; their assailant looks their way but only sees them as part of the picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/07/guardianobituaries.france\">Jean Baudrillard</a> would surely have relished this moment, in which reality has merged with a simulation and a simulation becomes reality.</p> <p>A similar idea was explored in the TV show: the fifth episode of the fourth season, to be precise (no <em>you\u2019re</em> obsessed!). An attempted installation of a 3D television goes awry, leaving a huge TV-shaped hole in the farmer\u2019s wall. To resolve this situation Shaun and the other sheep put on a performance, tricking the farmer into believing he\u2019s watching TV, including staging a tennis match that results in the farmer getting whacked in the face by a tennis ball \u2013 which he considers to be evidence of highly impressive 3D technology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6cc500b8c3c81620c42ab7a93eed3b482c28a99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6cc500b8c3c81620c42ab7a93eed3b482c28a99/0_0_3693_2462/1000..jpg\" alt=\"In Shaun the Sheep films, speech is primarily used not for the communication of dialogue but as a kind of sound effect.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Shaun the Sheep films, speech is primarily used not for the communication of dialogue but as a kind of sound effect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aardman Animations</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The feature film Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a less cerebral and more conventional (including dialogue) experience, combining a similarly wonderful, painstaking aesthetic with a midnight movie premise. When trying to invent a machine that can cure rabbits of their lust for carrots, Wallace accidentally fuses his mind with the mind of a rabbit (just run with it).

At the start of the film, for instance, we watch Wallace\u2019s ridiculous machine for getting dressed, which involves him being woken up by a retractable hand that comes out of the wall and entices him to consciousness by putting cheese under his nostrils (he loves cheese). His bed then pushes him headfirst into a long chute system, too elaborate to explain in a small amount of words, and far more entertaining to simply watch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/01/this-is-england-beloved-uk-drama-is-the-tonic-australia-needs-right-now\">This Is England: beloved UK drama is the tonic Australia needs right now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the Oscar-winning 1995 short A Close Shave, there is a different wake-up machine \u2013 this one involving Wallace falling through a hole in the floor, into a pair of pants laid out vertically, then onto a spot around the breakfast table, where he gets pelted with porridge by a malfunctioning food-serving machine. Again this kind of comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgpQ-K7n2uc&amp;list=RDIgpQ-K7n2uc&amp;start_radio=1&amp;t=41\">has a very long history</a>.

  "<p>When Victoria Gianopoulos-Johnson got a call from her midwife to say her home birth would be cancelled, panic took hold. She says she \u201clost it\u201d for two days, crying constantly, gripped by uncertainty and then anger.</p> <p>The 33-year-old from the Highlands, whose baby boy is due at the end of April, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after the birth of her first child and wants to avoid a hospital delivery at all costs. Now she has reached the decision to have a free birth, also known as unassisted childbirth.</p> <p>Maternity rights groups say there has been a rise in the number of women seeking advice about freebirthing owing to pressures on hospitals and new restrictions around birth partners.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-urged-to-turn-hotels-into-birth-centres-during-coronavirus-crisis\">NHS urged to turn hotels into birth centres during crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than a fifth of birthing centres and more than a third of homebirth services have closed due to a shortage of midwives and concerns about ambulance response times.</p> <p>Alison Edwards, of Doula UK, whose 700 members advocate for expectant mothers, says she has seen a threefold increase in calls about freebirthing in the last fortnight.</p> <p>\u201cInitially women were concerned about staff shortages,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cNow they don\u2019t want to go to hospital at all, it\u2019s about infection. It is inevitable that some who should not be freebirthing because they are in a high-risk category will give birth at home because they fear the alternative \u2013 infection from [coronavirus] or spending time in hospital without their partner\u2019s support.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists asserts a woman\u2019s right to give birth \u201cin an environment in which she feels comfortable\u201d and to be supported in her birth choice but also notes that \u201csome women have a higher risk of complications and childbirth can be unpredictable even among women at low risk of complications\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian has spoken to six women who are planning free births because community midwife services have been withdrawn in their area.</p> <p>When Gianopoulos-Johnson found out about the cancellation, she contacted her MSP, made inquiries about giving birth under another local authority and looked for an independent midwife. After exhausting those options she began researching unassisted childbirth.</p> <p>\u201cI found I was breathing for the first time,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: OK, my mind is not there yet but my body is reacting viscerally to this. I researched obsessively and enrolled in a course. Then I stopped crying and slept for the first time.\u201d</p> <p>She plans to give birth with just her husband and children present. She has made peace with her decision, saying: \u201cI feel it\u2019s not about confidence but preparation.\u201d</p> <p>For Sandra Cox, 28, from Edinburgh, whose baby is due in nine weeks, the decision to freebirth fills her with anxiety. But with the option of a home birth removed, she feels it is less risky than a hospital birth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the current stress levels in hospitals, it\u2019s not the right environment for my baby, and if I had to stay in, my partner would be unable to visit. I\u2019m also worried about coronavirus because my son has severe asthma,\u201d Cox says.</p> <p>Last week the charity Birthrights called for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-urged-to-turn-hotels-into-birth-centres-during-coronavirus-crisis\">protection of maternity rights</a>, saying it had been inundated with concerns about the removal of home birth and birth centre options without thorough investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe this action may be unlawful and could lead trusts to be responsible for significant risk to life if women choose to birth without medical assistance,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The charity said frightened women were asking about restrictions on birth partners, who in many hospitals can be present only during active labour and in a small minority of cases are banned altogether, despite strict guidelines from NHS England that birth partners should be allowed.</p> <p>The crisis has also presented a dilemma for doulas. Daisy Dinwoodie, of the Scottish Doula Network, said: \u201cTwo women have been in touch this week saying they will freebirth and asking for support. It puts me in a very difficult position because I\u2019m not medically trained, my role is emotional support.</p> <p>\u201cIn the current climate I fear doulas will be blamed for women making that choice if we are present at the birth. These aren\u2019t women who would normally opt for this \u2013 they feel pushed away from the hospital because they can\u2019t have their doula and partner present for the duration.\u201d</p> <p>Michaela Kalusova, of London Bliss Doulas, says she is supporting a woman whose due date was on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cI will help because otherwise she says she will freebirth alone. She rung in tears after her home birth was cancelled. She wanted a midwife and we discussed at length whether she feels safe without one. I made it very clear I\u2019m not a trained medic.\u201d</p> <p>Kalusova has been present at around 10 free births but says: \u201cThis is completely different. Free birth should be a planned choice but this woman feels forced into it. She says hospital is not an option due to a traumatic first birth. I\u2019m hearing of many others in the same position.\u201d</p> <p>Samia Ahmad, who is 32 weeks pregnant with her third child, is also opting for a free birth due to midwife shortages. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to have a doula because I don\u2019t have the financial resources or the timeframe to build the necessary rapport.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmad previously lodged two complaints with the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust regarding her first birth and what she calls the \u201cappalling aftercare\u201d following the unplanned unassisted birth at home of her second baby.</p> <p>She says: \u201cI feel I have no choice but to freebirth. I\u2019d like to catch the baby myself. I did it with my son, I caught him in my kitchen even though it wasn\u2019t planned and I have faith I can do it again.\u201d</p> <p>But she says that when she told her midwife she would pursue a freebirth she was warned that children\u2019s services could be notified.</p> <p>\u201cShe made me feel awful and asked how I would live with myself if something went wrong. But I know my legal rights to choose where I give birth. I\u2019m the one not getting support for the birth I want, and I\u2019m being backed into a corner.\u201d</p> <p>It is legal in the UK for a woman to freebirth and decline antenatal care. The <a href=\"https://www.aims.org.uk/information/item/freebirth?fbclid=IwAR1Z3PoRZQV08kf--exfxDPRhxNK1ggtBs44UEHlHSoeC6UxG1RaesJGuiU\">Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services</a> (AIMS) states: \u201cA woman does not have to justify her decision, nor base it on a particular reason.\u201d</p> <p>Its chair of trustees, Debbie Chippington Derrick, said: \u201cAIMS is receiving a worrying number of calls from women asking if they can birth at home when they have been refused support from a midwife. They should not be forced to choose between leaving home to birth or birthing without medical assistance.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes women refusing to attend hospital find themselves threatened with referral to children\u2019s services as a means of coercion. Referral should only be considered if there is concern about the wellbeing of the baby after it is born, not because the mother is exercising her legal right to decline care.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: \u201cThe impact of the current crisis may mean pregnant women cannot have the birth they planned. Keeping services at a single location, like a hospital, means that, at a time when resources are stretched, women continue to get the care and support they need, quickly, safely and effectively.\u201d</p> <p>Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust was contacted by the Guardian and declined to comment.</p> <p><em>*Some names were changed to protect </em><em>identities</em><em>.</em></p>",

My staff were worried too.\u201d</p> \n<p>People rely on the bakeries and he did not want to let the community down so came up with a plan to deliver bread instead. Five bakers work overnight and bag up rolls and bread that is then taken by one driver to 20 surrounding villages. Each village has a designated weekly delivery day.</p> \n<p>Reeve relies on local businesses that have been temporarily forced to close, such as the Wyndham Arms pub in Dinton, to organise orders. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be done without the village coordinators,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe landlady, Mary Gibbens, takes customer orders and card payments over the phone and we drop off once a week and people in the village collect from her.

  "<p>Scottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis that could have resulted in this year\u2019s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed.</p> <p>Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania.</p> <p>Farmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season.</p> <p>Recruitment agencies have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\">proposed chartering special flights</a> to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies.</p> <p>James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.\u201d Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs.</p> <p>Porter said Scottish farms produced about 25% of the UK\u2019s soft fruit each year. Angus Growers members produced 12,400 tons of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries last year.</p> <p>Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards.</p> <p>He said fruit picking was a skilled and demanding job, requiring speed, dexterity and knowledge about which fruit to pick. Migrant workers had been doing this work for 10 to 15 years, he said, and were extremely fast.</p> <p>New recruits also needed to learn how to work safely with machinery and equipment, and maintain physical distancing while picking to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus.</p> <p>He said it would take time and training for recruits to develop the skills his normal workforce had, and it was unclear whether the people who had signed up for this season\u2019s harvest would turn up or stay on if they found the job too demanding.</p> <p>Local recruits may also leave if their old jobs return and universities resume teaching once the lockdown is relaxed, he added. \u201cA lot of things have to line up and work this summer.

The wave of support and emotion as the man from County Offaly marched down the 72nd fairway emphasised what this meant to Northern Ireland and Irish golf. It was monumental for Lowry too, a maiden major triumph four years after he conceded a four-stroke lead after 54 holes in the US Open at Oakmont.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not bigging myself up but in this game you are only ever one week away from greatness,\u201d Lowry says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I took Oakmont so badly; when you are in that position and you let it slip, it\u2019s so hard to take.

I will probably always look back and think I should have won \u2026 but everyone has one of those.\u201d</p> <p>Lowry was to have the last laugh, including on the United States Golf Association executive who thought it smart to draw him as part of a \u201cheavyweight\u201d three ball \u2013 Kevin Stadler and Brendon de Jonge the others \u2013 at an earlier US Open. \u201cI remember I wasn\u2019t too happy about it at all,\u201d says Lowry. \u201cWhoever came up with that idea, it wasn\u2019t a very nice thing to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3788df4cd794ff3b2f7f296a177a3f09794980f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3788df4cd794ff3b2f7f296a177a3f09794980f8/201_205_3111_1867/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shane Lowry at the 2016 US Open\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lowry shows his disappointment after losing a four-stroke lead in the final round of the 2016 US Open at Oakmont.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lowry can dismiss that incident. When golf resumes, it will be fascinating to see if he can become a multiple major champion.

I feel very lucky and privileged to have done what I did, in that manner and where I did it. Genuinely, if it all ended today it would be decent but I\u2019m a very driven and competitive person. I want to keep pushing on.\u201d</p> <p>Lowry\u2019s endearing post-Open celebrations, in Dublin bars and in front of 15,000 people at a homecoming in Clara, became the stuff of legend. \u201cI knew it would be a big deal but when you are living it, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe are a great country when our sportspeople are doing well. Now, we have no problem kicking sportspeople when they are down as well.</p> <p>\u201cI used to curse the other Irish lads. All that people in Ireland asked me was: \u2018When are you going to win a major?\u2019 They don\u2019t think you\u2019ve made it unless you win a major.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rory was always the superstar.

Lowry has always set himself high standards; had his mindset been adversely affected by Portrush?</p> <p>\u201cAbu Dhabi was very difficult to take,\u201d he says. \u201cI was defending champion in a Rolex Series event and I knew I wasn\u2019t going to play on the European Tour for a while. Before I knew it I had missed the cut and I was taken aback by it. I was hard on myself, I\u2019d be pissed off sitting in the locker room changing my shoes but by the time I\u2019m back at the hotel I\u2019m fine.</p> <p>\u201cIt probably looks like I take it a lot harder than I do, I show my emotions.

I don\u2019t feel anything extra now.\u201d</p> <p>Golf\u2019s indefinite shutdown means Lowry may well set a non-wartime record as the reigning Open champion.

The pair were amateur teammates long before majors were conquered. Lowry scoffs at the notion of one as talented as the world No 1 being a source of jealousy. \u201cI\u2019m open about the fact he is the best player in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen he has his A-game, I\u2019ve said it for years, there\u2019s nobody better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe was always the superstar.

  "<p>Sweden\u2019s government is drawing up new legislation to allow it to take \u201cextraordinary steps\u201d to combat Covid-19, local media have reported, amid concern that its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/as-the-rest-of-europe-lives-under-lockdown-sweden-keeps-calm-and-carries-on\">relatively soft</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/as-the-rest-of-europe-lives-under-lockdown-sweden-keeps-calm-and-carries-on\"> approach</a> may be leading to a higher death rate than in other Nordic countries.</p> \n<p>Denmark and Norway are among the many countries to have imposed tough lockdowns, closing borders and shutting schools and non-essential stores, and Finland has isolated its main urban area around Helsinki. But Swedes are still able to shop, go to restaurants, get haircuts and send children under 16 to class.</p> \n<p>On Sunday Sweden reported a total of 401 deaths so far from Covid-19, up 8% from Saturday and greater than the totals of its three Nordic neighbours combined. Sweden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/datajournalistik/har-sprider-sig-coronaviruset/\">toll per million inhabitants</a> is 37, compared with 28 in Denmark, 12 in Norway and 4.5 in Finland.</p> \n<p>The state broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/regeringen-backar-om-kritiserat-lagforslag\">SVT said on Sunday</a> that after an outcry by opposition parties, the Social Democrat-led government had abandoned plans reported earlier in the weekend to rule by decree, bypassing MPs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Under legislation to be tabled next week, the Riksdag, Sweden\u2019s parliament, will now be consulted before the government takes any new emergency steps such as shutting airportsor train and bus stations, closing shops and restaurants, further limiting public gatherings or requisitioning medical equipment, according to SVT.</p> \n<p>Anders Tegnell, Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, has described the country\u2019s coronavirus strategy as an attempt to ensure \u201ca slow spread of infection and that the health services are not overwhelmed\u201d, arguing that it is important for a part of the population to acquire immunity.</p> \n<p>Tegnell has denied trying to build rapid \u201cherd immunity\u201d to the virus, a strategy originally adopted by the UK and the Netherlands before projected soaring death numbers prompted those countries to change course, but he has conceded that such a policy is \u201cnot contradictory\u201d to Sweden\u2019s objectives.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is important to have a policy that can be sustained over a longer period, meaning staying home if you are sick,\u201d he said recently. \u201cLocking people up at home won\u2019t work in the longer term.

Amid a sharp rise in cases in Stockholm, however, the capital is soon to open a field hospital with 140 beds, rising eventually to 600, in a convention centre.</p> \n<p>There are also growing concerns for the country\u2019s older population after a third of Sweden\u2019s municipalities reported confirmed or suspected cases of the virus in nursing homes, where distressed staff have warned publicly of a lack of protective equipment. One third of Stockholm\u2019s nursing homes are affected.</p> \n<p>Although Sweden has closed senior high schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, the prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, has preferred to rely on Swedes\u2019 sense of civic responsibility, asking rather than ordering them to avoid non-essential travel, to work from home and to stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone is responsible for their own wellbeing, for their neighbours\u2019 and for their own local community,\u201d the foreign minister, Ann Linde, said last week. \u201cThis applies in a normal situation and it applies in a crisis situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The approach has so far proved popular among voters, with 44% of respondents in a survey published last week saying they trusted L\u00f6fven, compared with 26% in February. But while Stockholm is estimated to be 70% less busy than usual, an analysis of smartphone location data showed that while visits to public places had fallen steeply in most European countries, Sweden was bucking the trend.</p> \n<p>The strategy has come under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/swedish-pm-warned-russian-roulette-covid-19-strategy-herd-immunity\">increasingly heavy fire</a> from some of the country\u2019s health experts. Stefan Hanson, a Swedish infectious diseases expert, said the situation was not lost in the whole country, with large parts of the south and north so far displaying low infections rates.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut in Stockholm it is fast becoming critical,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cThere is a real risk now that cases will rise so high that the hospitals cannot cope. Treatment choices are already having to be made by biological age.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said this was due to a \u201cvery confused and unclear policy, with no clear objectives beyond trying to protect the over-70s and imposing some rather mild physical distancing measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cecilia S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r, a professor of microbial pathogenesis and one of about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-live-news-updates-us-trump-uk-lockdown-global-deaths-cases-covid19-latest-update?page=with:block-5e7a441a8f081e5eda235f16#block-5e7a441a8f081e5eda235f16\">2,300 academics to sign an open letter to the government</a> at the end of last month calling for tougher measures to protect the healthcare system, said the government had \u201cno choice\u201d and should now lock down Stockholm.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe must establish control over the situation; we cannot head into a situation where we get complete chaos,\u201d S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r said. \u201cNo one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?\u201d</p> \n<p>Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute, said the concern was that \u201cthere is really a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies\u201d.

  "<p>The lights shone more brightly than anything I\u2019d ever seen. One million blinding watts strafed across the leaves of countless cannabis plants that peeled off in neat rows in every direction. The warehouse was as pristine as a pharmaceutical facility, and as we strode around in crisp white nylon overalls and box-fresh wellies, the atmosphere was surreal \u2013 interstellar, almost: \u2013 it felt as if we were on a mission to Mars. It was definitely a glimpse of the future.</p> <p>It was 2017 and I had been invited to visit this legal medical cannabis \u201cgrow\u201d in the town of Gatineau, near Ottawa. I was in Canada after writing a paper for the drug-law reform thinktank <a href=\"https://volteface.me/\" title=\"\">Volteface</a>, proposing an online-only, legal cannabis market in the UK as a way to break the logjam between the UK\u2019s two million cannabis smokers and those who fear legalisation. I was meeting with Canadian police and politicians to hear more about that country\u2019s plans to completely legalise cannabis the following year.</p> <p>Back in the UK, a million-watt grow like Gatineau\u2019s would put you in jail for a decade. Here, it was likely to make its owners a very cool, very legal few million in mere months. Added to that, the state would benefit, too, as taxes from sales of the crop would be collected for the common good rather than enriching criminals. It felt utopian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Were cannabis activists\u2019 hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the three decades I have campaigned to reform drug laws, I never expected to see change happen so quickly, or at such scale, as it did in Canada. But, two years on, the Canadian experiment hasn\u2019t quite turned out as we reformers had hoped.</p> <p>The Gatineau greenhouse through which I strode on that day in 2017 was owned by a firm called <a href=\"https://www.thehydropothecary.com/\" title=\"\">the Hydropothecary</a>. Now named Hexo, in October 2019 it shed 200 of its 800 staff. On 4 March one of Canada\u2019s biggest growers, Canopy Growth, announced the <a href=\"https://mjbizdaily.com/cannabis-greenhouse-retreat-continues-with-canopy-closing-two-facilities/\" title=\"\">closure</a> of two mega-greenhouses in the towns of Delta and Aldegrove \u2013 with 500 job losses. The firm also cancelled the opening of a new site in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the black market is still vibrant while cannabis stocks have crashed, medical patients say they can\u2019t get hold of essential medicines, and thousands of jobs have been lost. So what went wrong \u2013 and what went right? Were cannabis activists\u2019 hopes of a regulated cannabis market just a pipe dream?</p> <p>Canada had permitted cannabis for medical use since 2001. Medical patients were allowed to grow four plants, and licensed producers cultivated larger crops for sale online to those with valid prescriptions. But most Canadian cities had illegal \u2013 but tolerated \u2013 dispensaries where the drug was sold completely indiscriminately. These stores made Amsterdam\u2019s coffee shops look as prim as a WI cake stand. The quality and variety of cannabis on sale at these illegal outlets was outstanding, bewildering. Business was not just booming, but blazing.And it was all completely illegal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd209487d720b7d62775e673c0d05952afecd06c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd209487d720b7d62775e673c0d05952afecd06c/0_361_4572_2742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Canada made cannabis boring\u2019: plants being tended at Aurora.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Canada made cannabis boring\u2019: plants being tended at Aurora.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Canada\u2019s Cannabis Act of 2018 was a bold attempt to impose some order on this anarchic retail scene. It legalised the sale to adults of 30g of cannabis in austere packaging from government-licensed shops. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said: \u201cThe old approach to cannabis didn\u2019t work. It was too easy for our kids to get it and gangs and drug dealers were reaping the profits. That changes from now on.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief, became an unlikely cheerleader for legalisation, arguing that to do so would \u201ckeep cannabis out of the hands of youth, and profits out of the hands of criminals\u201d. Two other key goals of regulation were the protection of public health and the reduction in criminality associated with the illegal market. After 50 years of the unending, senseless drug war, peace had broken out.</p> <p>Or so it seemed. Because while Canada may have lit the fuse on an ambitious experiment, every high has a low. Within a year the industry was experiencing mass layoffs, multi-billion-dollar stock-market losses, executive firings and corporate scandals as the overhyped new sector experienced a dramatic and humbling public correction.</p> <p><em><strong>What went wrong? </strong></em>Alastair Moore, co-founder of Hanway Associates, a London-based cannabis consultancy, says the Canadian industry has been driven by vulture capitalism and wishful thinking. \u201cA mix of greed and naivety led this industry to great heights \u2013 and has left it on its knees. While some made lots of money, others lost their investments and now many others have lost their jobs.\u201d</p> <p>According to Moore\u2019s fellow founder, George McBride: \u201cThe key thing is that Canada did actually get the reforms through. In and of itself, that is a huge feat. It\u2019s the first time any major developed country has done so. And so, kudos. However, getting it through has involved a lot of politicians who didn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about designing a really complicated system.\u201d</p> <p>So just how does a state create and regulate an entirely new business of intoxication that has always existed, essentially, in a countercultural, outlaw space? Canada, it turns out, did so cautiously, with every decision deliberated over by a centralised government <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/laws-regulations/task-force-cannabis-legalization-regulation.html\" title=\"\">Task Force</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e422947c68368c78d7f47c098eb9ec75107cdfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e422947c68368c78d7f47c098eb9ec75107cdfd/0_158_4775_2866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green green grass of home: plants at Strathroy, Ontario, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green green grass of home: plants at Strathroy, Ontario, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Added to the complexity of the policy and its implementation, the needle of international capital\u2019s wonky moral compass swung straight at these lucrative new markets. Hundreds of millions of dollars were raised on global capital markets and the Canadian landscape was quickly dotted with massive new grow sites.</p> <p>The so-called \u201cgreen rush\u201d had started and production went into overdrive. Stock prices soared and fortunes were staked, made, doubled and tripled in an atmosphere reminiscent of the 90s dotcom boom, or the Yukon gold rush of the 19th century, when 100,000 prospectors headed into the Canadian hinterlands in search of riches. Many firms hoped to corner the Canadian market by throwing millions of dollars of shareholders\u2019 money into massive grow sites. This time, the gold was green. But soon, things started to fall apart.</p> <p>The main problem Canada\u2019s smokers and growers faced was access: too few retail shops were able to open to serve the eager new market. Canada is a country of 38 million people, divided into 10 provinces that are similar to US states, with provincial governments producing a patchwork of varying regulations. Over a third \u2013 13.5 million \u2013 of all Canadians live in the state of Ontario. But as of 2 March this year, Ontario had just 41 retail cannabis stores. The province of Alberta, home to 4.4 million, has 423 stores.</p> <p>And where there was product available, the price was almost double that of the illegal market. C$5.59 to C$10.23 per gram (or over \u00a340 a quarter ounce). That was caused by tax burdens and overheads: the legal market has to comply with regulations on fungicide and pesticide residue levels, and draconian security requirements for grow sites, such as huge vaults in which to store the cannabis and record-keeping for every person who enters these vaults.</p> <p>The illegal market, meanwhile, is completely unregulated \u2013 and thriving because of this. <a href=\"https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start\" title=\"\">Statistics Canada</a>, a state agency, reports that just 29% of cannabis users buy all of their product from a legal source. Four in 10 Canadians told the organisation that they bought at least some cannabis from illegal sources in 2019.</p> <p>The next problem was that many stores sold poor-quality grass, with smokers complaining that it had been poorly dried and cured, and tasted bad. Modern cannabis users are accustomed to a range of flavours, from lemon to mango, pineapple, strawberry and pine. These flavours are derived from the plant\u2019s natural aroma profile, which skilled growers preserve by careful breeding, correct harvesting and slow, cautious curing of the fragrant flowers.</p> <p>Many players in the new mass market often skipped these steps in the pursuit of profit, says David Brown, a British Columbia-based cannabis industry analyst. \u201cMany consumers have had complaints about high prices and what is perceived as lower quality, especially the tendency of many of the legal dried flower products to be overly dried, often from a rushed or improper curing and drying process.\u201d</p> <p>Why would anyone drive a few miles up the road to score bad weed from many of the government shops when your regular black-market dealer lives nearby, has better product and brings it to your door for half the price?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d421768027b42e683280b719964ab3f625de4ede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d421768027b42e683280b719964ab3f625de4ede/0_338_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The nose knows: a customer sniffs display samples at Evergreen Cannabis in Vancouver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The nose knows: a customer sniffs display samples at Evergreen Cannabis in Vancouver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s worth reflecting, also, on the psychology of some of these users. \u201cFor a long time, cannabis has been the mark of the rebel, the outsider, the outlaw,\u201d says Brown. \u201cA lot of the people who complain about \u2018bad weed\u2019 and so-called \u2018fake legalisation\u2019 are doing so because parts of their countercultural identity have been altered forever by this law change. Canada has made cannabis boring \u2013 and that was kind of the point.\u201d</p> <p>With few shops to sell to and customers clinging to their traditional dealers, the new cannabis corporations found themselves holding a glut of product. There is a stockpile of grass weighing in at 400 tonnes, at last count, according to official government inventory figures.</p> <p>The rollout of retail shops was left, in many cases, to inexperienced officials in provincial government departments, says McBride. \u201cOntario authorities said, \u2018We don\u2019t trust private organisations to run cannabis shops. We\u2019re going to do it all ourselves.\u2019 Then they tried to do it, but they squandered about $80 million trying to figure out how to do it, and got absolutely nowhere. They had to cancel it and invite private tenders. All these big, shiny grow facilities that cost C$10m, C$20m or C$30m to build, and which all grew loads of cannabis \u2013 there was nowhere to sell it, because there weren\u2019t any shops,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In a stinging irony, medical patients \u2013 the very people whose decades of activism had driven the wider reforms, faced cannabis shortages and a steep increase in price after legalisation as suppliers diverted their medical product in bulk to the new recreational market rather than in hundreds of smaller deals to medical patients.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Sutton of</strong></em> Tantalus Labs, a British Columbia-based grower that uses natural sunlight and greenhouses, says legalisation has been \u201clargely negative\u201d for medical cannabis users because of this new sales dynamic: \u201cPhysicians have been telling medical users they should buy from the recreational marketplace, which is completely inappropriate \u2013 and it loads them up with extra taxes and tariffs.\u201d </p> <p>Sutton originally built his low-impact, sunlit grow to service medical users, and still focuses on this original customer base \u2013 though they make up just 10% of his sales. \u201cMany licensed producers now don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cSome have just pulled their financial resources on their medical platforms. If a medical user can\u2019t get their medicine \u2013 for people, with, say, multiple sclerosis \u2013 that can lead to severe impairment, traffic accidents and potentially death. That blood is on those licensed producers\u2019 hands that stopped serving those users\u2019 needs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Paul North, director of communications at Volteface, which commissioned me to write the paper, says Canadian customers\u2019 response to the malfunctioning new markets is understandable: \u201cYou have to provide a superior experience to the illicit market. When it comes to cannabis, this is not easy. Dealers have no marketing restrictions, and can offer a sweet deal and deliver a product to your door. For most people, cannabis use is a relaxing, problem-free and enjoyable experience. Buying the drug needs to match that experience, and; until it does, the illicit market will continue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42bd231f5ec36a40c9b77633f7f63323ae42b06e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42bd231f5ec36a40c9b77633f7f63323ae42b06e/15_47_4090_2453/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Product placement: cannabis pills ready for sale in Quebec.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Product placement: cannabis pills ready for sale in Quebec.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hype talks, but money walks. The early euphoria in the cannabis stock market has been replaced by a major dose of paranoia.

Financing has dried up for the new industry, and small-scale retail investors \u2013 often young professionals investing via smartphone apps \u2013 have lost large sums of money. None of this is to assert that Canada\u2019s policy has been a failure. If we compare it to the UK cannabis industry, where illegally trafficked children have been found enslaved in abandoned buildings growing cannabis for gangsters, it is better by several orders of magnitude.</p> <p>Steve Rolles of UK-based drug law reform group <a href=\"https://transformdrugs.org/about-us/\" title=\"\">Transform</a> agrees that it is harsh to judge the project\u2019s success so soon. \u201cWe are still in the rollout phase. They are still in a transition from an illegal economy to a legally regulated one. It will take some time for new market equilibrium to be established, and for new social norms to emerge, and for teething problems to be addressed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Big, shiny grow facilities cost C$20m or C$30m to build and grew loads of cannabis \u2013 but there was nowhere to sell it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How best to create a legal cannabis industry is a question with a particular urgency in the UK today as we build a market for medicinal use \u2013 albeit agonisingly slowly. I strongly believe that cannabis will be legalised for adult use in the UK within five years. And it all goes back to that Gatineau greenhouse I visited in 2017.</p> <p>On that trip, I was accompanied by two Tory party insiders, Blair Gibbs, ex-adviser on police matters to Boris Johnson when he was mayor, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danny-kruger\" title=\"\">Danny Kruger</a>, son of TV chef Prue Leith, who wrote the \u201chug a hoodie\u201d speech for David Cameron. Both men experienced something of a Damascene conversion in their views on cannabis law during that trip. Days after his return, Kruger wrote in the <em>Spectator</em>: \u201cWe do not need to ban everything bad. After all, the Victorians never prohibited alcohol. They regulated it, taxed it and hedged it about with a culture of disapproval. Instead of the prohibition of cannabis we need an old Victorian virtue: temperance.\u201d</p> <p>Blair Gibbs moved to Canada in 2017 to work as a cannabis consultant, but in August 2019 he took a job in the PM\u2019s office. Both men are now at the very heart of the British government: in 2019 Kruger was parachuted into the safe Tory seat of Devizes to stand as MP in the last election and is also an adviser to Johnson.</p> <p>Whether their weed-friendly outlook survives the cold glare of Whitehall orthodoxy remains to be seen. But it is undeniable that the economic libertarians of the Tory party in 2020 are much more pro-cannabis than their newly nationalising Labour party counterparts. There are, after all, many billions of pounds to be made by the kind of people who fund the Tories: land and property owners and the banks that will finance the new industry.</p> <p><em><strong>What happens if</strong></em> you just legalise this drug? It\u2019s a question no one other than Canada has ever really asked. My view is that we have long known that all drug laws are unworkable, illogical, unjustifiable, unscientific, counterproductive and generate countless unintended consequences \u2013 in fact, drugs laws often create the exact opposite outcomes to those desired. But ironically, and with a beautifully stoned logic, it turns out that legalising cannabis in Canada has generated just as many challenges as it solved.</p> <p>What Canada\u2019s experience demonstrates is that cannabis legalisation does not instantly deliver some great social panacea. There is no promised land. But we should never lose sight of this essential truth: Canadians can no longer be jailed for growing and eating and smoking certain flowers. That is a huge, fundamental step forward, no matter what the stock market indices say.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the market vagaries and the slow shrinking of the illegal market, analyst Andrew Brown is still proud of his country\u2019s bold step into the unknown. \u201cLegalisation in Canada is hardly perfect. After all, we\u2019re less than two years into legalising a product that has been illegal for nearly a century,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a process, not a destination, and the slow, deliberate approach to a well-regulated industry is allowing Canada to set a responsible path forward that other countries can feel safe in following, even refining and improving upon.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain records smallest percentage rise in infections since start of crisis</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s death toll has risen by 674 to 12,418 in the past 24 hours, according to figures that recorded the lowest number of victims in nine days. It is also the first time since 28 March that daily deaths have dropped below 800. The number of registered cases rose to 130,759 from 124,736, Spain\u2019s ministry said. The 5% rise in infections was the smallest increase since the start of the health crisis. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections meanwhile rose by 5,936 in the past 24 hours to 91,714 on Sunday, the third straight drop in the daily rate of new cases.</p> <h2>Global cases pass 1.2 million</h2> <p>The number of confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-global-cases-pass-12m-as-trump-warns-us-of-worse-to-come\">cases globally has passed 1.2m</a>, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Just over one in four of these are in the US, which has<strong> </strong>311,544 cases. There have been 64,753 coronavirus-related deaths worldwide. The five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were the US, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased.</p> <h2>Trump talks up unproven malaria drug</h2> <p>Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease</a>, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/05/there-will-be-a-lot-of-death-trump-warning-as-covid-19-cases-in-us-pass-300000-video\">would see \u201ca lot of death\u201d</a>. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success.</p> <h2>Lombardy enacts law obliging citizens to wear face masks</h2> <p>Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst-affected by coronavirus, have enacted a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside. In the absence of a mask, people should \u201ccover their mouths and noses with a simple foulard or scarf\u201d, said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. <br>The law came as <a href=\"https://video.corriere.it/cronaca/coronavirus-napoli-tanta-gente-strada-la-spesa-ma-questa-quarantena/733d255c-7599-11ea-856e-f9aa62c97d7a\">images from major cities </a>including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days amid good weather.</p> <h2>Pandemic threatens survival of European Union, Spanish PM warns</h2> <p>The European Union\u2019s very survival is at stake and a new \u201cMarshall plan for Europe is needed\u201d to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies, Spain\u2019s prime minister has warned in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/europes-future-is-at-stake-in-this-war-against-coronavirus\">article published by the Guardian</a>. Europe must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery, Pedro S\u00e1nchez said. A critical juncture had been reached at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain\u2019s case, needed real proof of commitment in the form of \u201cunwavering solidarity\u201d.</p> <h2>African economics face \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d if virus not controlled</h2> <p>Economies in some parts of Africa face a \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d unless the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic is controlled, a senior UN official with responsibility for operations on the continent has said. Up to 50% of all projected job growth in Africa will be lost as aviation, services, exports, mining, agriculture and the informal sector all take a hit, according to Ahunna Eziakonwa, the United Nations Development Program regional director for Africa. She told Associated Press: \u201cWe will see a complete collapse of economies and livelihoods. Livelihoods will be wiped out in a way we have never seen before.\u201d</p> <h2>First case recorded in South Sudan as Iran puts death toll at 3,603</h2> <p>South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s poorest states where decades of war and hunger have already devastated infrastructure, has become one of the latest states to record a confirmed case of Covid-19. The case was a 29-year-old woman who arrived in February from the Netherlands, via Ethiopia. Elsewhere, Iran said Covid-19 infections stood at 58,226 while the death toll from the outbreak was 3,603.</p> <h2>Outdoor exercise could be banned if rules flouted, Britons warned</h2> <p>Outdoor exercise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/matt-hancock-warns-tougher-uk-lockdown-too-many-break-rules\">could be banned in Britain</a> if people flout the social distancing rules, the UK\u2019s health minister has warned. Matt Hancock said sunbathing in public spaces was against the government guidance, and told those who dared to disobey that they were putting their own and others\u2019 lives at risk. His warning came ahead of a televised address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/queen-to-make-personal-tv-address-to-the-nation-on-sunday\">by the Queen</a>, who was expected to praise Britain for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>Australian authorities cautiously optimistic</h2> <p>Health authorities in Australia have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency\">expressed cautious optimism</a> that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation\u2019s death toll reached 34. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early, saying that could lead to a resurgence in cases. The government has also warned its citizens that imported \u201chome\u201d Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the kits were not reliable and could lead to people failing to isolate themselves or seek the medical help they need.</p> <h2>Criminal investigation launched into handling of cruise ship</h2> <p>A criminal investigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">is to be launched</a> into the disastrous handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has become the single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia, the NSW police commissioner said on Sunday. Mike Fuller announced the move as it was revealed four more passengers from the ill-fated ship have died \u2013 bringing the total to 11, and accounting for more than 30% of all Australian Covid-19 deaths. The Ruby Princess has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/nsw-health-minister-defends-experts-who-handled-ruby-princess-coronavirus-outbreak\">focus of intense criticism</a> since its 2,700 passengers were allowed to freely disembark in Sydney on 19 March, despite passengers onboard showing signs of respiratory illnesses.</p>",

[To] the people watching this: if you have symptoms or <strong>if you think you may have symptoms and you meet these testing criteria, you need to get tested quickly because what we do know about the virus, that people are infectious very early on and that is why we need to make the diagnosis early</strong> and then they can go into isolation and we can immediately get those contact traces made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:40:39.625Z\">at 7.40am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8979558f080bdb9f5346bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:25:55.147Z\">7.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Michael Cusack</strong> said a drop-off in cases was expected, because SA had put in place domestic border restrictions on top of the requirements for international travellers to quarantine. </p> \n  <p>That means that the number of people coming to the state, both domestic and international travellers, has dropped. </p> \n  <p>Cusack:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Obviously once that kind of tap is switched off you would expect there would be a decline in imported disease. </p> \n   <p>What the real anxiety has been and why social distancing is so important is that where the virus is in the community, there is a risk that we start to see some community spread, and that is why it has been so vitally important that we get the public to understand why they should distance themselves.</p> \n   <p>And I would have to say in South Australia the public have been fantastic at actually buying into this and doing the social distancing, and I think it is very early days but that is perhaps starting to bleed through into the numbers.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:36:52.894Z\">at 7.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e89789d8f08c35a1d11a2f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T06:22:47.126Z\">7.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Like every other public health officer to speak today, <strong>Michael Cusack</strong> is cautiously optimistic about the ability of his team to get ahead of the spread in their jurisdiction.</p> \n  <p>Cusack said they are \u201cobviously\u201d pleased with just two new cases recorded overnight, but added that they often see a \u201cslackening off\u201d of new cases recorded over the weekend, which suggested there could be fewer checks conducted. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into this, but we have seen a gradual decline in recent days. </p> \n   <p>That leads to a question of if we should change our restrictions, and so forth.

  "<p>I\u2019m going to tell you the single worst story I\u2019ve heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I\u2019m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/TC-Energy-sells-assets-to-help-fund-Keystone-XL-14069033.php\">financing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keystone-pipeline-spill-permit/rare-permit-for-keystone-oil-pipeline-in-spotlight-after-spills-idUSKBN1XI0L0\">permits</a>, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It\u2019s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.</p> <p>And then came the coronavirus epidemic \u2013 and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment.</p> <p>In Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/what-is-jason-kenneys-energy-war-room-good-for/\">\u201cwar room\u201d</a> to fight environmentalists, <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">invested</a> $1.1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">loan guarantee</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489960-three-states-push-criminal-penalties-for-fossil-fuel-protests-amid\">made it a felony</a> even to \u201cincite\u201d such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Guidance_on_the_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workforce_Version_2.0_Updated.pdf\">memorandum</a> exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html?fbclid=IwAR3XkPugyurel_uSz86nG7Zt6eexJ_HLZNBufOWTNas8kDmJyby5UpQpe5I\">critical</a>\u201d \u2013 that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to <em>cut</em> supply.</p> <p>On Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/04/01/news/kxl-to-go-forward-amid-pandemic/8663.html\">moving workers</a> from across America into place in states along the pipeline route \u2013 although local reporters in Montana discovered they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html\">actually begun arriving</a> 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine.</p> <p>On Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">$1.25b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">n bond issue</a> for TC Energy.</p> <p>So here\u2019s how it shakes out:</p> <p>1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are \u201cessential\u201d employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet\u2019s climate system.</p> <p>2) The work is being done on the <a href=\"https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/\">edges of many Indian reservations</a> \u2013 endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html\">endured</a> 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-the-midst-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-construction-is-set-to-resume-on-the-keystone-pipeline\">put it</a> on Wednesday, \u201cthis causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally\u201d.</p> <p>3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can\u2019t make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet \u2013 but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions.</p> <p>There are plenty of targets for anger \u2013 timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame:</p> <p><em>\u201cVice-</em><em>president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project \u2013 including all pipelines \u2013 there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health</em><em> and climate justice before any project can proceed. Vice-</em><em>president Biden believes that the approach Secretary Kerry applied in analyzing the costs and benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline and other cross-border pipelines \u2013 including to national security and diplomacy \u2013 is a model to build from in establishing this process.\u201d</em></p> <p>But let\u2019s be clear: the villains here are the oil industry and the big banks. And let\u2019s further be clear: their villainy is not new. The oil industry knew about and lied about climate change for 30 years: they\u2019ve prevented us from flattening the carbon curve, and set up a tragedy far greater even than coronavirus and one which will play out for decades to come. And the banks are their invaluable allies: Chase Bank has <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">lent $268b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">n</a> to the industry since the Paris climate accords \u2013 what\u2019s another billion to build a useless pipeline and perhaps spread a fatal disease?</p> <p>Literally nothing matters to these people except money. Even in a moment when the rest of us are changing our every habit to try and protect each other, they are willing to sacrifice nothing. No \u2013 let\u2019s be clear again. In this moment they are using the cover of the pandemic to make yet more money, to do things they could not get away with at any other time. These aren\u2019t penny-ante price gougers trying to corner the local market in hand sanitizer so they can make a buck \u2013 these are cold-blooded and calculating members of the one percent. It\u2019s so over-the-top evil that it\u2019s like the comic book version of Naomi Klein\u2019s Shock Doctrine, written in blood.</p> <p>I am a Methodist, sometimes a Sunday School teacher. I don\u2019t actually believe in hell \u2013 I think God is capable of forgiving people for the worst things. But I don\u2019t think I am.</p> <p>Though the hour is late, there may still be ways to fight this blitzkrieg. The coalitions that have battled it for a decade are, even forced apart by the microbe, now coming together to try. We will do it with real and unabating rage in our hearts.</p> <p>How could anyone be this low?</p> <ul> <li><p>Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

  "<p>Balmy days are coming, with temperatures forecast to reach 20C in some regions. The warm weather will bring welcome respite to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/what-are-your-rights-in-lockdown-britain-coronavirus\"> lockdown Britain </a>- and put pressure on authorities trying to control crowds and gatherings.</p> <p>However, scientists also believe warm weather could bring new insights into the virus by showing whether it reacts to the onset of spring. Flu epidemics tend to die out as winter ends; could sunshine, similarly, affect the behaviour of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-update-live-news-usa-uk-spain-italy-china-who-middle-east-spike-world-global-cases-latest-updates\">coronavirus and its spread</a>? It is a key question, and epidemiologists will be watching for changes very closely.</p> <p>Initial studies of other coronaviruses - the common varieties that cause colds in the UK - do suggest a seasonal pattern, with peaks occurring during winter and disappearing in spring. Intriguingly, these peaks tend to coincide with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">flu outbreaks</a>. By contrast, only small amounts of coronavirus appear to be transmitted in the summer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no deus ex machina to reach out of the clouds and put this right. We have to beat the virus ourselves.</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Neuman, Reading University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A key study of the common coronaviruses - HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E - was published last week by scientists at University College London. By analysing samples collected several years ago they found high rates of coronavirus infections in February, while in summer they were very low. Other studies have also shown coronaviruses are seasonal in behaviour in temperate climates.</p> <p>The study\u2019s lead author, Rob Aldridge, sounded a note of caution, however. \u201cWe could see continued but lower levels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/is-coronavirus-seasonal-summer\">coronavirus transmission in summer</a> but this may reverse in the winter if there is still a large susceptible population at that point,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd given this is a novel virus, we don\u2019t know if a seasonal pattern will hold over the summer given high levels of susceptibility in the population. For this reason, it is crucial that we all act now to follow current health advice.\u201d</p> <p>This point is backed stressed by other scientists, who warn that the Covid-19 virus is a completely new infectious agent and so there has been no chance for populations to build up any immunity. As a result, it is likely to continue to spread at current rates despite the onset of summer.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure seasonal variations in the virus\u2019s behaviour will play a role in its spread,\u201d said virologist Michael Skinner at Imperial College London. \u201cBut compared with the effect we are having with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/social-distancing-could-needed-uk-autumn-report-shows-coronavirus\">social distancing</a>, it will be a very minor influence. It may produce some marginal effects but these will not be a substitute for self-isolation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4336a536af92d9160e182c9291e482131d5901bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4336a536af92d9160e182c9291e482131d5901bd/0_0_3550_2367/1000..jpg\" alt=\"poster warning stay home to save lives\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even in warmer weather, social distancing will remain the most effective way of containing the virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ben Neuman of Reading University was more emphatic. \u201cThis virus started in near-freezing conditions in China, and is rapidly growing both in Iceland and on the equator in Brazil and Ecuador. As winter turned to spring, the virus growth has accelerated worldwide. This is not <em>War of the Worlds</em>, and there is no <em>deus ex machina</em> to reach out of the clouds and put this right. We have to beat the virus ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>The arrival of spring does not only affect the behaviour of a virus, however. It also produces changes in the human immune system, other researchers point out. \u201cOur immune system displays a daily rhythm, but what is less known is how this varies from season to season,\u201d said immunologist Natalie Riddell at Surrey University.</p> <p>To find out, Riddell and other researchers at Surrey and Columbia Universities have been studying immune changes in humans at different seasons and different times of day. Biological samples were taken from volunteers at the winter and summer solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes. Initial findings suggest a subset of white blood cells that play a key role in the immune system appear to be elevated at certain times of day, indicating that the system responds differently at varying times. For example, B cells that produce antibodies were found to be elevated at night.</p> <p>However, the impact of seasons on cell rhythms is still under investigation, added the study\u2019s leader, Micaela Martinez of Columbia University. Results would be of considerable importance, she added. \u201cKnowing the vulnerabilities of our body to diseases and viruses across the year could inform the timing of vaccination campaigns that will help us eradicate infections.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

Easter is one week away. The White House has since pushed the date back.</p> \n<p>The White House did not reply to a request for comment for this story.

As of Thursday, the total tests conducted in the United States so far was 1.3m, Birx <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/birx-task-force-coronavirus-testing/index.html\">said</a>.</p> \n<h2>\u2018He surrounds himself with yes men\u2019</h2> \n<p>Elizabeth Spiers, one of a carousel of editors Kushner appointed during his ill-fated tenure as publisher of the New York Observer newspaper, recently <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/trump-narcissist-in-chief-global-pandemic\">described</a> her horror at the prospect of her former boss as coronavirus czar.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe short version is that Jared Kushner is incurious, not inclined to defer to experts, and surrounds himself with yes men, so he is unaccustomed to being told that his decision-making is bad,\u201d Spiers wrote. \u201cHe believes his capabilities far exceed what they are, and his assessment is reinforced by the people around him who are paid to tell him that. In this sense, he is not unlike his father-in-law.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kushner grew up in New Jersey and matriculated at Harvard after his father, Charles Kushner, gave the school $2.5m.

  "<p>\u2018The virus does not discriminate,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-52069921/coronavirus-gove-addresses-pm-and-health-secretary-s-positive-tests\">suggested Michael Gove</a> after both Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were struck down by Covid-19. But societies do. And in so doing, they ensure that the devastation wreaked by the virus is not equally shared.</p> <p>We can see this in the way that the low paid both disproportionately have to continue to work and are more likely to be laid off; in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/31/amazon-strike-worker-fired-organizing-walkout-chris-smallls\">sacking of an Amazon worker</a> for leading a protest against unsafe conditions; in the rich having access to coronavirus tests denied to even most NHS workers.</p> <p>But to see most clearly how societies allow the virus to discriminate, look not at London or Rome or New York but at Delhi and Johannesburg and Lagos. Here, \u201csocial distancing\u201d means something very different than it does to Europeans or Americans. It is less about the physical space between people than the social space between the rich and poor that means only the privileged can maintain any kind of social isolation.</p> <p>In the Johannesburg township of Alexandra, somewhere between 180,000 and 750,000 people live in an estimated <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/upgrading/case-examples/overview-africa/alexandra-township.html\">20,000 shacks</a>. Through it runs South Africa\u2019s most polluted river, the Jukskei, whose water has <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Cholera-found-in-Jukskei-river-20010118\">tested positive for cholera</a> and has run <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2016-11-03-00-sewage-spill-turns-jukskei-black/\">black from sewage</a>. Makoko is often called Lagos\u2019s \u201cfloating slum\u201d because a third of the shacks are built <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/23/makoko-lagos-danger-ingenuity-floating-slum\">on stilts over a fetid lagoon</a>. No one is sure how many people live there, but it could be up to 300,000. Dharavi, in Mumbai, is the word\u2019s largest slum. Like Makoko and Alexandra, it nestles next to fabulously rich areas, but the million people estimated to live there are <a href=\"https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/mar/20/asias-largest-slum-dharavi-is-sitting-on-time-bomb--doctor-2119164.html\">squashed into </a>less than a square mile of land that was once a rubbish tip.</p> <p>In such neighbourhoods, what can social distancing mean? Extended families often live in one- or two-room shacks. The houses may be scrubbed and well kept but many don\u2019t have lavatories, electricity or running water. Communal latrines and water points are often shared by thousands. Diseases from diarrhoea to typhoid stalked such neighbourhoods well before coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b735e7b8f284a83cd37f077d481e87b6937dcee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b735e7b8f284a83cd37f077d481e87b6937dcee9/0_136_4129_2477/1000..jpg\" alt=\"People in their shanties at Dharavi during the coronavirus lockdown in Mumbai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in their shanties at Dharavi during the coronavirus lockdown in Mumbai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rajanish Kakade/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa, Nigeria and India have all imposed lockdowns. <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-04-02-five-in-isolation-after-alexandra-registers-first-case-of-covid-19/\">Alexandra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/third-coronavirus-case-found-in-mumbais-dharavi-820685.html\">Dharavi</a> have both reported their first cases of coronavirus. But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.</p> <p>Last week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. <a href=\"https://thewire.in/labour/nearly-81-of-the-employed-in-india-are-in-the-informal-sector-ilo\">Four out of five</a> Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India\u2019s working population, are <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/india-has-139-million-internal-migrants-we-must-not-forget-them/\">migrants from elsewhere in the country</a>. Yet their needs had barely figured in the thinking of policymakers, who seemed shocked by the actions of the workers.</p> <p>India\u2019s great exodus shows that \u201cmigration\u201d is not, as we imagine in the west, merely external migration, but internal migration, too. Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason \u2013 they are not seen as \u201cone of us\u201d and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/covid-19-outbreak-migrant-workers-sprayed-with-disinfectant-in-ups-bareilly/articleshow/74888857.cms\">were sprayed</a> by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.</p> <p>All this should make us think harder about what we mean by \u201ccommunity\u201d. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88/0_208_3543_2126/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Armed soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South African National Defence Force soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township on 28 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Sola/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal\">exclusively for Americans</a>, when Germany <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3bc25ea-652c-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\">blocks the export</a> of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-portugal/portugal-to-treat-migrants-as-residents-during-coronavirus-crisis-idUKKBN21F0MC\">Portugal</a>, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation.</p> <p>The rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure divisions within. In India, Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or Bh\u0101rat Mata. But it\u2019s a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill.</p> <p>In Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don\u2019t simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all at risk from the virus,\u201d observed Gove. That\u2019s true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others \u2013 and not just from coronavirus. </p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

Once they\u2019d got them established in Osage Beach, Missouri, trying to make amends for their Chicago white-collar dodgy deals by getting into bed with, um, a Mexican drug cartel, it doldrummed a little, hence some snitty reviews, one making reference to a Poundland <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/20/breaking-bad-10-years-on-tv-is-still-in-walter-whites-shadow\">Breaking Bad</a></em>.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Sunday 5 April.</p> <h2>NSW police launch criminal investigation into Ruby Princess fiasco</h2> <p>The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, confirmed on Sunday that there will be a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess debacle that will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator.</p> <p>\u201cThere is clear evidence that [Covid-19] has been brought off that ship,\u201d Fuller says. There\u2019s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19. The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Three of the four latest deaths in NSW were passengers on the Ruby Princess.</p> <h2>Health officials \u2018hopeful\u2019 curve is flattening</h2> <p>Health authorities in Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency\">have expressed cautious optimism</a> that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak but have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered. Australia\u2019s death toll now stands at 34.</p> <p>\u201cThat is probably the lowest rise we\u2019ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve,\u201d Murphy said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>More casuals could receive jobkeeper payment</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/more-casual-workers-may-be-included-in-130bn-jobkeeper-coronavirus-scheme\">The government has opened the door</a> to allowing more of the casual workforce to access wage subsidies, as it vowed to press ahead with legislating the $130bn jobkeeper scheme this week.</p> <p>Christian Porter, the attorney general, said the government was aiming to be \u201cas inclusive and reasonable as possible\u201d on the issue of casuals and he hoped to have draft legislation ready on Monday. Parliament is due to return on Wednesday \u2013 with limited numbers of MPs attending \u2013 to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight.

Checks will be occurring. If you\u2019ve lied on an exemption form to get into our state, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll get caught and be forced to face the consequences.\u201d</p> <h2>Free hotel rooms for Victorian frontline workers</h2> <p>Victoria\u2019s frontline health workers will have free hotel stays if they need to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisis, as the state recorded 20 new cases overnight.</p> <p>The state government will provide $20m to buy hotel rooms, enabling up to 8,000 frontline workers who may test positive for Covid-19 or have unexpected and unprotected contact with a suspected patient, to self-isolate, away from family and flatmates, at no cost. The service will be available to healthcare professionals and other workers such as cooks and cleaners who directly engage with patients.</p> <h2>People warned against travelling over Easter holidays</h2> <p>Authorities in several states have warned people against travelling over the coming Easter holiday period, urging them to adhere to social distancing rules. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, was asked if police will be doing random checks on IDs to see that people have not gone on holidays and responded, \u201cwe will be stopping people and if you don\u2019t have a good reason to be where you are, you could face a $1,000 fine.\u201d Tasmania will toughen restrictions to stop people heading to their holiday homes or taking boating trips over the Easter break, the state\u2019s premier said on Sunday. Peter Gutwein said many elderly people lived in these areas, and they needed to be protected, as the state\u2019s confirmed cases rose to 82.</p> <h2>Police issue scores of fines at Queensland car rally</h2> <p>Police issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night where people were flouting social distancing directives. Deputy Queensland police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, who is also the state disaster coordinator, has professed himself disappointed and frustrated and said the behaviour of people at the rally was \u201cinexcusable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all about safety. About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated.\u201d</p> <p>A man was also charged in Tasmania for allegedly disobeying isolation requirements after returning to the state from Victoria, police said. The man had been staying at a government facility for his period of isolation but had breached conditions, police say.</p> <h2><strong>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<p>Trust is the most precious commodity in any walk of life. The baleful fact is that the British government, in the midst of a profound and unprecedented crisis, is led by a man, and the party faction he represents, who cannot be trusted.</p> <p>The atmosphere in No 10 is reported to be rancorous. Ministers, officials and special advisers are mutually suspicious. The prime minister, never a man for detail, habitually relies on foppish charm, wordplay and a ruthless readiness to make or drop any promise if it serves his interest. Whatever else this gang inspires, it\u2019s neither loyalty nor trust.</p> <p>In fairness, this is a crisis challenging governments everywhere. However, the prerequisite for navigating a path through it is a singleminded team that wants to use the state to secure the public good. Johnson\u2019s double problem is that on top of the corrosive lack of trust he engenders, he and the bulk of his cabinet believe the Thatcherite cant that has done so much to erode resilience in our public institutions. The reason so many ministers are unconvincing at the daily press briefings is that good governance is not part of their mindset. Their fallback position when challenged is bluster, slogans, wild promises and evasion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>No 10 did not want to offend the European Research Group, but this could not be honestly admitted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thus the unconvincing, and changing, answers to the issue of testing (invent a diagnostics industry in a month?) and to shortages of key medical equipment. Thus the reaction to the disclosure that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">British government had not participated in the EU scheme jointly to procure ventilators</a>. This was obviously because No 10 did not want to offend the European Research Group, but this could not be honestly admitted. Emails had gone missing; there was administrative \u201cconfusion\u201d, claimed Michael Gove. All half-truths \u2013 perhaps worse; British officials had attended at least four EU meetings in which the joint buying of medical equipment was discussed.</p> <p>The reality was ideological. There was nothing Britain could do jointly with the EU, Gove finally admitted, that it could not do as well as an independent country. That is not an attitude that signifies \u201dwhatever it takes\u201d, but puts, as critics have said, Brexit before breathing.</p> <p>The reality playing out before our eyes is that the NHS, for all the wonderful dedication of its staff, has an embedded lack of resilience. This is revealed by the chronic shortage of intensive care beds and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/17/nhs-postpone-millions-operations-tackle-coronavirus\"> the cancellation of all non-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/17/nhs-postpone-millions-operations-tackle-coronavirus\"> urgent elective surgery for at least the next three months</a>. For decades, it was understood that hospitals should operate at 85% capacity to give them the margin to deal with crises, but for the last 10 years NHS hospitals, under intense pressure from an austerity-driven Treasury to demonstrate their \u201cefficiency\u201d, have been forced to operate at 95% capacity. The accent in the British hospital is on \u201cthroughput\u201d and \u201cmaximum resource utilisation\u201d.</p> <p>The reaction over the past few weeks has been great \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">the opening, on Friday of the first Nightingale hospital, in east London</a>; the readiness of retired staff to accept recall; the response to the call for volunteers; the unflagging courage of NHS workers. But the health service started from a low base. Public health has been subordinate to the wider injunction: taxes must not rise because taxation is an encroachment on personal resource and liberty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Running the NHS with insufficient resilience turns out to be vastly more costly than any potential savings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Suddenly, we are learning that the greater encroachment on personal liberty is the weakness of the public health system, a resource necessarily funded by taxes. Already, the lockdown has caused economic carnage \u2013 an expected fall in GDP of at least a quarter in the months ahead and a viciously sharp rise in unemployment. But the longer it lasts the worse the carnage. Running the NHS with insufficient resilience turns out to be vastly more costly than any potential savings.</p> <p>Similarly, the social care sector, carelessly permitted to be largely owned and run by private equity firms, is inadequate for today\u2019s demands. The philosophy of our welfare system is to put the punishment of claimants before their needs; now it suddenly has to deal with unexpected need on a massive scale. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/16/the-strength-of-the-uk-jobs-market-is-not-as-simple-as-it-seems\">British labour market may be highly flexible</a>, allowing firms to manage their costs, but to stem a social disaster the chancellor\u2019s furlough scheme is going to cost tens of billions.</p> <p>The shortcomings extend more widely. The financial system has required a wholesale repurposing since the financial crisis. But this has not happened, nor has Britain developed robust public banking agencies that could help. Thus the weakness of the attempt to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/130k-inquiries-1k-loans-why-uk-government-had-to-tweak-help-for-small-firms\">hundreds of billions to distressed businesses</a> at the appropriate speed and volumes. Similarly, no attempt had been made to reframe the relationship between business and society, hence the patchwork quilt of business responses, a few noble but too many distressingly self-interested.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/rishi-sunak-wartime-finance-for-wartime-economic-conditions-coronavirus\">Rishi Sunak has given us wartime finance fit for wartime economic conditions | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No sustainable, vigorous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/no-10-seeks-to-end-covid-19-lockdown-with-immunity-passports\">exit from the lockdown</a> is possible unless all this is addressed.

This compares with just 19% of children in households with income of more than \u00a370,000 a year.</p> \n  <p>The findings come after the tutoring industry reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/27/school-closures-prompt-boom-in-private-tuition-online-isolation\">a boom in demand due to the Covid-19 outbreak</a>, and a number of agencies said they were offering lower cost or <a href=\"https://coronavirustutoring.co.uk/\">free tutoring</a> to less-affluent schoolchildren. </p> \n  <p>Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said the findings showed lower-income families were less able to offset the detrimental impact of the pandemic on their children\u2019s education. He said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Access to a private tutor, even at a reduced rate, is well beyond the means of most families and will be impossible for families who do not have internet access and who live in crowded accommodation. </p> \n   <p>Tutors offer parents a break and children the opportunity to learn from an experienced adult, their appeal is clear. But not all children will have access to this resource, indeed, they are a pipe dream for families living on low income. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Milburn called on universities to recognise that the school shutdown could magnify the huge educational disparity between children from richer and poorer backgrounds, and to take that into account when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">deciding who would get a university place</a>.<br></p> \n  <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research has said the shift to school lessons being delivered online during the pandemic made it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/children-must-not-become-unseen-victims-of-coronavirus-says-thinktank\">difficult for those children without suitable technology to keep up with their studies</a>.

  "<p>Europe is enduring its worst crisis since the second world war. Our citizens are dying, or fighting for their lives in hospitals that are overwhelmed by a pandemic which represents the greatest threat to public health since the 1918 flu pandemic.</p> \n<p>The European Union is facing a different war from those we have successfully averted over the past 70 years: a war against an invisible enemy that is putting the future of the European project to the test.</p> \n<p>The circumstances are exceptional and call for unwavering positions: either we rise to this challenge or we will fail as a union. We have reached a critical juncture at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain\u2019s case, need real proof of commitment. We need unwavering solidarity.</p> \n<p>Solidarity between Europeans is a key principle of the EU treaties. And it is shown at times like this. Without solidarity there can be no cohesion, without cohesion there will be disaffection and the credibility of the European project will be severely damaged.</p> \n<p>We welcome a number of significant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/eu-plans-to-spend-100bn-on-saving-jobs-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">measures</a> that have been announced over the past few weeks, including the <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2020/html/ecb.blog200319~11f421e25e.en.html\">European Central Bank\u2019s new temporary </a><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2020/html/ecb.blog200319~11f421e25e.en.html\">emergency </a><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2020/html/ecb.blog200319~11f421e25e.en.html\">purchase </a><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2020/html/ecb.blog200319~11f421e25e.en.html\">programme</a> and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_582\">European </a><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_582\">commission\u2019s SURE plan</a> for those who have lost their jobs. But these measures are not enough on their own. We must go further.</p> \n<p>Europe must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery. It must start doing so as soon as possible with measures to support the public debt that many states, including Spain, are taking on. And it must continue to do so when this health emergency is over, to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies by mobilising significant resources through a plan we are calling the new Marshall plan<em> </em>and which will require the backing of all of the EU\u2019s common institutions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Europe was born out of the ashes of destruction and conflict. It learned the lessons of history and understood something very simple: if we don\u2019t all win, in the end, we all lose.</p> \n<p>We can turn this crisis into an opportunity to rebuild a much stronger European Union. But to do so, we need to implement ambitious measures. If we continue to think small, we will fail.</p> \n<p>The United States responded to the recession of 2008 with a stimulus package, while Europe responded with austerity. We all know the outcome. Today, when we are on the brink of a global economic crisis of an even greater magnitude than that of 2008, the US has implemented the greatest mobilisation of public resources in its history.</p> \n<p>Is Europe willing to be left behind?</p> \n<p>It is time to break with old, national dogmas. We have entered a new era and we need new responses. Let us hold on to our positive values and reinvent the rest.</p> \n<p>In the coming months, the EU member states will inevitably take on greater volumes of debt to deal with the consequences of what is not just a health crisis, but an economic and social crisis. That is why the response cannot be the same as that envisaged for asymmetric economic shocks, such as a financial or banking crisis in a single state or group of states. If the virus does not respect borders, then nor should financing mechanisms.</p> \n<p>Provided that it is universal and not subject to conditions, the <a href=\"https://www.esm.europa.eu/blog/time-solidarity-europe-concerted-european-financial-response-corona-crisis\">European Stability Mechanism </a>may be useful in the initial stages to inject liquidity into EU economies through a line of credit. But this is not going to be sufficient in the medium term.</p> \n<p>The challenge we face is extraordinary and unprecedented. It calls for a single, united, radical and ambitious response to preserve our economic and social system and protect our citizens.</p> \n<p>The Spanish have always protected and defended the European project. It is time for reciprocity. With us, with Italy and with each and every one of the 27 countries of the union.</p> \n<p>It is time to act with solidarity in creating a new debt mutualisation mechanism, acting as a single bloc for the purchase of essential medical supplies, establishing coordinated cybersecurity strategies, and preparing a major emergency plan to ensure that the continent\u2019s recovery is rapid and robust.</p> \n<p>This solidarity has to ensure that there are no gaps between north and south, that we leave no one behind.</p> \n<p>These are very challenging times which require bold decisions. Millions of Europeans believe in the European Union. We must not abandon them. We must give them reasons to keep believing. And we must act now or never, because, right at this moment, Europe itself is at stake.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Pedro S\u00e1nchez is the prime minister of Spain</p></li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>A groundbreaking survey of more than 400 British and US elite athletes and coaches has found that fewer than half feel their sport actively encourages them to report doping, the <em>Observer</em> can reveal.

Just 45% of coaches and 38% of athletes surveyed felt their sport actively encourages them to report doping, for instance, while fewer than half were aware of Wada\u2019s whistleblower programme.<br><br>The report makes clear that establishing a culture of feeling able to speak up and have confidence that concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon \u2013 is the most important element of whistleblowing.</p> <p>As Erickson pointed out, fewer than a quarter of coaches (23%) and athletes (19%) surveyed felt that the public reaction to those who have reported doping in sport would encourage them to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cWhat really stood out for me was the incredible courage, strength and determination it takes to come forward and report misconduct in sport,\u201d added Eriksson, who is now director of safe sport at USA Cycling.</p> <p>\u201cOften people feel they should only report their suspicions if they have hard evidence. But the message to them should be that they don\u2019t have to do the investigation themselves. And that little piece of information they provide could be the last bit in the jigsaw.\u201d</p> <p>To raise awareness of the research, a video detailing the experiences of courageous individuals who blew the whistle on doping will be released this month. Produced by the Northern Film School at Leeds Beckett University, the research team hopes the video will help remove the barriers to speaking up to protect the integrity of sport.</p> <p>Professor Sue Backhouse, director of research at the Carnegie School of Sport at Leeds Beckett, also hoped the study would lay the foundations for Wada to develop better policies to encourage the reporting of doping.</p> <p>\u201cOur findings underscore the need to celebrate those who show courage by coming forward with information of rule violations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to recognise the vulnerability of those who do so within global policies and procedures.</p> <p>\u201cGiven this vulnerability and the uncertainty felt by those who do report, Wada needs to emphasise the positive difference individuals and groups can make when they come forward with information on wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cWada and their broader community now need to work together to establish a culture where people feel able to speak up and have confidence that their concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>What makes a hero? According to a popular meme going around at the moment, intentions matter more than actions. \u201cYour grandparents were called to war,\u201d it says. \u201cYou\u2019re being called to sit on the couch.\u201d In a way, sitting around and doing nothing is a new type of heroism, because going out and living life as normal makes you a passive bystander to a global threat. But in ordinary times, the difference between a hero and a bystander is far more clear-cut. What makes some of us the former, and some of us the latter?</p> <p>As she was boarding the tube in London on an otherwise ordinary Friday morning last November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/23/man-arrested-after-jewish-children-were-targeted-on-the-tube\" title=\"\">Asma Shuweikh</a> felt a man rush past her. He made a beeline for an orthodox Jewish family sitting by the doors\u2013 a father and two sons in kippah. Brandishing a bible, the man began to hurl antisemitic abuse at the family; as Shuweikh stood in shocked silence, she noticed he had highlighted passages in his book. When the man turned his attention to the children, she decided she could not remain silent any longer: it was time to speak up. In a video that subsequently went viral on social media, the 36-year-old can be seen calmly telling the aggressor: \u201cCome on, man, there\u2019s children here\u2026 You\u2019re on public transport.\u201d</p> <p>What made Shuweikh speak out and put herself in the firing line? The abuser later began berating her for being a Muslim woman wearing trousers. She says that faith and motherhood helped inform her actions. \u201cWhen I see something wrong,\u201d she says, \u201cI have to say it.\u201d</p> <p>According to Catherine A Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts and the author of <em>The Bystander Effect</em>, myriad complex factors make some of us bystanders and some of us heroes. These range from our self-identity to the pressure of social norms.</p> <p>Sanderson says she was inspired to write the book by both \u201cpersonal and global\u201d events: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-rape-conviction\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex offences</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/usa-gymnastics-larry-nassar-scandal\" title=\"\">USA Gymnastics</a> sex abuse scandal, and the fact that a student at her son\u2019s college died just two weeks into his very first semester. The student had been drinking heavily and had fallen and hit his head. Although fellow students watched over him, they didn\u2019t call emergency services for nearly 20 hours. By which time it was too late to save him. Her book answers the question at the heart of this incident: why?</p> <p>You may already know about the \u201cbystander effect\u201d. For more than 50 years, newspaper articles and textbooks have recounted the story of Kitty Genovese \u2013 a young woman who was murdered outside her apartment in New York in 1964. It was claimed almost 40 people heard or saw Genovese\u2019s murder, yet none of them spoke out. The term bystander effect was coined to explain the fact that individuals are less likely to help people in need when other people are present.</p> <p>The Genovese story is largely apocryphal \u2013 later research revealed that no witnesses actually saw the attack in its entirety and two people did in fact call the police. Yet this doesn\u2019t mean the bystander effect isn\u2019t without some truth. In her book, Sanderson shares a number of scientific and real-life case studies that prove the presence of others makes it more difficult for us to speak out.</p> <p>In one New York University study carried out shortly after the Genovese case, 85% of participants sought help for a man who was slurring his words when they believed only they could hear him. When they thought others could hear him, too, only 31% went to get help.</p> <p>Sanderson isn\u2019t interested in easy explanations about fearless heroes and callous bystanders. \u201cThe question of why some people act badly and others don\u2019t is not really about good and bad,\u201d she says. She notes that many of the participants in the New York study were physically distressed and argues they didn\u2019t choose not to act but were rather paralysed by a \u201cstate of indecision\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fbb2eeebf95b3db1725feff7896d292833f9df6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fbb2eeebf95b3db1725feff7896d292833f9df6/0_5187_5792_3473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of a group of around 35-40 people standing in a rough semi-circle, each going their own way\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists. They\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Franck Allais/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout her book, Sanderson references a number of neurological studies that explain our inaction. She shows that working with others reduces our feeling of control and that as the number of observers to an incident increases, the parts of our brains that prepare us to take action actually become less active. \u201cMany of the processes that drive inaction occur not through a careful deliberative process, but at an automatic level in the brain.\u201d </p> <p>Sanderson is a psychologist not a neuroscientist, so I ask why she chose to focus so much on brain activity in the book. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to understand that what they\u2019re doing is natural and probably even adaptive from an evolutionary point,\u201d she says. \u201cBut neuroscience lets us be aware of our pre-existing unconscious biases. It gives us the power to say: \u2018This is normal and it\u2019s natural, but I still have some agency and I can act.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The third section of Sanderson\u2019s book is more of a guide to how we can all change our behaviour to ensure we speak out, whether that be about discrimination on public transport, workplace fraud, sexual harassment or school bullies. Sanderson\u2019s research shows many of us often believe we would act in certain scenarios. Who among us hasn\u2019t had a casual fantasy about heroically saving the day by whistleblowing at work, saving an infant and/or granny from traffic, or karate chopping a pervert in the park? But in that fantasy, we\u2019re thinking about ourselves alone. In the real world, Sanderson says, we are often bystanders as part of a group and because of that we experience \u201cdeindividuation\u201d.</p> <p>Can we be \u201cre-individualised\u201d to ensure that we act as we hope we might? A study Sanderson references seems to suggest we can. In 2012, academics from Harvard asked people to take a maths test and offered them $1 for every correct answer. The twist? Participants scored themselves. The study\u2019s participants were divided into groups that included those who signed an honesty declaration at the end of the test after they\u2019d written down their score; and those who signed a declaration at the top of the sheet before scoring themselves.</p> <p>In the end, 79% of people who signed their name at the bottom of the page cheated by inflating their score, compared to only 37% of those who signed their name before scoring themselves. \u201cWhen we are reminded of who we are \u2013 which signing our name surely does \u2013 we are also reminded of our intentions to be a good person who does the right thing,\u201d Sanderson writes.</p> <p>By remarkable coincidence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/21/man-tells-of-using-narwhal-tusk-during-london-bridge-attack\" title=\"\">Darryn Frost</a> was reminded of who he was shortly before he ran at a terrorist with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/narwhal-tusk-and-fire-extinguisher-used-to-tackle-london-bridge-attacker\" title=\"\">narwhal tusk</a> during the London Bridge attack of November 2019. \u201cI was at a conference directly before the attack and an American woman was talking about where we learn our behaviours,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe started our session asking us for three positive and negative traits about ourselves.\u201d After this, Frost says, she prompted the audience to think about their earliest memory where they learned these traits. \u201cIt was literally just after that that everything kicked off, so my emotions at the time were really raw and on the surface.\u201d</p> <p>In general, Frost\u2019s experiences tally with Sanderson\u2019s optimism that we can overcome our inaction. Frost says he taught himself to speak out and conquer fear \u2013 he assists those in need and confronts people who are disrespectful to others when he is out in public. \u201cIt mostly comes from my schooling\u2026 My school motto was: \u2018For the brave, nothing is too difficult\u2019. They teach you to be a good citizen and to look out for your fellow man.\u201d Of his response to the attack, he says: \u201cIt did feel instinctive to an extent, but that instinct has been taught and nurtured and built over years.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In some cases you can diffuse a situation by making a simple joke</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One thing Sanderson says we all must nurture, and build in ourselves is the ability to overcome social awkwardness. Time and time again, she notes how social pressures facilitate inaction. Put simply: if we are around others, we base how we act on how they\u2019re acting. Many of us might avoid speaking out for fear that we\u2019ve misjudged a situation \u2013 after all, if it really was that bad, wouldn\u2019t others be speaking up, too? Psychologists call these worries \u201cevaluation apprehension\u201d. We\u2019re concerned we\u2019ll look stupid or sensitive or strange if we speak out. Sanderson notes that people find it easier to intervene if they are less concerned about fitting in, yet also notes those who are worried about fitting in feel social ostracisation more strongly. The neuroscience shows that for these people, rejection feels like physical pain \u2013 \u201cas if you\u2019ve twisted your ankle or burned yourself with coffee\u201d.</p> <p>Sanderson also argues it\u2019s more difficult to act when situations are ambiguous and less dramatic, noting that empirical evidence shows that in obvious emergencies such as terror attacks, people are just as likely to help whether alone or in a crowd. While Shuweikh had little doubt what was happening when she saw that man brandishing a highlighted bible, I spoke to someone who failed to act when they saw harassment on another train. Carla, 30, says she was travelling in west London when she heard some Muslim teenagers chatting. Suddenly, a trans woman stood up and shouted at the teens. Carla realised later that they had insulted the woman in a language they both spoke, but which Carla couldn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>\u201cIt took a long time to even realise that something bad had happened, so I only started weighing up whether to say something when the trans woman began telling the carriage what had happened,\u201d Carla explains. She says she felt stressed, ashamed and conflicted as she weighed up what to do \u2013 she felt as though her face went red. \u201cI felt awful for this woman, because I know how much discrimination trans people face\u2026 but I was afraid, I didn\u2019t want to be seen shouting at a group of young, visibly Muslim people in case it appeared racist.\u201d Carla also says it was late and she was in a part of town she didn\u2019t know, which fed her inhibitions. In the end, she didn\u2019t speak out except to shout \u201cgood for you!\u201d to the woman as she stood up for herself. Describing the story now, Carla apologises for being \u201ccowardly\u201d.</p> <p>Sanderson emphasises that Carla isn\u2019t cowardly \u2013 the difference between a hero and a bystander is heavily situational. In another incident, Carla was the only person to call an ambulance when someone was run over by a bus, while Frost says he was uncomfortable at being labelled a \u201chero\u201d after the London Bridge attack. He says he is \u201chaunted\u201d by the times in his adult life when he didn\u2019t speak out or take action. \u201cPeople seem to glorify my actions and yes I\u2019m proud of them, but there\u2019s a lot of times in life I regret not being a better person.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her insistence that we can\u2019t divide the world into neat dichotomies, Sanderson would be remiss not to document what makes it easier for certain people to speak out. She explains the concept of \u201cmoral rebels\u201d \u2013 people who show courage in speaking out and overcoming social pressure. These people tend to have higher self-esteem and also believe their actions will make a difference (though there are no official figures, Sanderson estimates between five and 10% of the population can be categorised this way). She is at pains, however, to make it clear that anyone can speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s not one-size-fits all,\u201d Sanderson says. She argues that not everyone has to be a knight in shining armour. \u201cYou can find a friend if you don\u2019t have the ability to do it alone\u201d or \u201cin some cases you might diffuse the situation by creating a joke\u201d. As well as social skills, learning more traditional skills also helps \u2013 early in the book, Sanderson notes that people trained in first aid are more likely to intervene in dangerous situations. \u201cThey weren\u2019t different in personality, but they were equipped with different skills.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it isn\u2019t just dangerous situations that concern Sanderson \u2013 much of her work is dedicated to how you can speak out about sexual harassment or workplace fraud. According to Sanderson, bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists with narwhal tusks, they\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too. She documents how silence perpetuates poor behaviour, citing a report that found men who have committed sexual assault believe other men accept their behaviour. Or as Martin Luther King Jr said: \u201cHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy hope is that reading this book will help people understand that they have a choice and they can act,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a courageous act, it doesn\u2019t have to be confronting the person shouting slurs on public transport, it can be going over and sitting with the victim and pretending that you know them to interrupt the situation.\u201d</p> <p>There is no doubt that Asma Shuweikh chose the courageous path. She recalls being bullied at 12 because she wore a hijab. One girl threw Shuweikh\u2019s lunch on the ground while others laughed \u2013 later that night, she went home and cried. \u201cMy mum and my brother said to me: \u2018Never, ever, ever be quiet when someone does something wrong to you.\u2019\u201d In the past, she has been targeted by Islamophobic abuse in public and felt hurt when no one spoke up on her behalf. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that situation, you just don\u2019t think about yourself,\u201d she says of witnessing the antisemitic abuse on the tube. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the discrimination, don\u2019t like the injustice, you have to say something.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008361648/the-bystander-effect-understanding-the-psychology-of-courage-and-inaction/\" title=\"\">The Bystander Effect</a> by Catherine A Sanderson (</em><em>Harper Collins, \u00a320) is published 16 April.

Were he elected pope, he would undoubtedly harken back to Pius XII, a neo-traditionalist who would \u2018reign\u2019 as pope rather than adopt the style of the Latin American [Francis], who rolls up his sleeves and takes risks to take the church out on to the street.\u201d</p> <p>The cardinal is described as \u201cextraordinarily conservative\u201d and \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with women holding positions of authority in the church\u2019s charitable network.</p> <p>In January, Sarah co-authored, with the retired Pope Benedict a book called From the Depths of our Hearts, defending clerical celibacy just as Francis was considering easing that rule in the Amazon, where there is a shortage of priests. The book was seen as a challenge to Francis\u2019s authority. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/pope-francis-decides-against-allowing-married-men-to-become-priests\">eventually decided</a> against opening up the priesthood to married men.</p> <p>Sarah has \u201cdeveloped a loyal following in conservative circles, particularly in the United States\u201d, according to Lamb. .</p> <p>Sarah has denied he is an opponent of Francis. \u201cI am loyal to the pope.

But there have been times, in these intensely difficult weeks, with our social lives narrowed down to the dimensions of our computer and mobile screens, when it has felt like nature has been taunting us with the gorgeousness of this year\u2019s spring. It\u2019s there just outside the window: the air is thick with it. But we can\u2019t get out and enjoy it. Even under the influence of intense cabin fever, I\u2019m not quite daft enough to think we can recreate the missing joys of spring with a glass of wine. But some wines do at least seem to offer a sense, however fleeting, of spring\u2019s scents and energy. The sauvignon blancs of France\u2019s Central Loire Valley certainly have this effect on me: that combination of sappy grassy greenness, with notes of blossomy white flowers, and an intense freshness and silvery liveliness all very much present in Domaine de la Rablais\u2019 example.</p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Dezat Sancerre Blanc 2018 (from \u00a316.95, <a href=\"https://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\">tanners-wines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.bbr.com/\">bbr.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.uncorked.co.uk/\">uncorked.co.uk</a>) </strong>Touraine sauvignon, drawn from a wide area of vineyards across the central Loire, is undoubtedly among the best value white wines around right now, with tonic-bringing, bright, zesty own-label expressions available from <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/\">Aldi</a> (\u00a35.79), <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/\">Sainsbury\u2019s</a> (\u00a37) and <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a> (\u00a37.99) all hitting the Loire\u2019s spring source. For extra-levels of graceful, evocative charm, it\u2019s worth seeking out the individual villages, of which Sancerre is the most celebrated. You have to be careful with Sancerre: the vineyards that fan out from the town on its lofty perch are beautiful but the quality is not always as good as the elevated price tag suggests. Like chateauneuf-du-pape down in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, this is an appellation with rather too many producers trading on the famous name. At their best, however, the wines have a quintessential Loire sauvignon mix of verdant verve and delicate raciness, and the wines produced by Andr\u00e9 Dezat and sons are undoubtedly, consistently in that category.</p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e2teau de Tracy Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 2018 (from \u00a321, <a href=\"https://www.mrwheelerwine.com/\">mrwheelerwine.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\">tanners-wines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.leaandsandeman.co.uk/\">leaandsandeman.co.uk</a>) </strong>Sancerre\u2019s rival for the greatest producer of Loire sauvignon blanc is Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. Beginner\u2019s in wine are often told that the way to distinguish Pouilly from Sancerre is to look for the distinctive whiff of gun flint \u2013 a smoky smell like someone\u2019s just let off a cap gun. I\u2019ve never been entirely convinced by this: from time to time I do pick up smoky notes in Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, but no more often than I do in other Loire (or indeed, global) sauvignon blancs. Mostly the big differences between the wines of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 seem to come down more to winemaking style and the precise patch of vineyard the producer is working with. I\u2019ve never reliably been able to tell them apart. What I do know, however, is that the sauvignon blanc of Ch\u00e2teau de Tracy is among my favourites in Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, the Loire, the world \u2026 a wine of evanescent, verdant, spirit-lifting charm.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

  "<p>Banks are wicked and Rishi Sunak walks on water. That, at least, was the narrative that prevailed until the end of last week. The dashing new chancellor, the cabinet star of the coronavirus moment, had assembled the Treasury\u2019s armoury to provide lending to British businesses on unprecedented scale. It was only the damn banks that were stopping the cash reaching intended recipients.</p> <p>This storyline now looks wrong. Sunak and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans\" title=\"\">the Treasury\u2019s \u201cfurther action\u201d, </a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans\" title=\"\">announced on Thursday night</a> to support struggling British firms, was not a mere tweak. It was a sweeping redesign of a lending scheme that had glaring flaws.</p> <p>Yes, the lending banks probably have been too slow and plodding, but they weren\u2019t the primary block in getting money to thousands of businesses. Rather, they were trying to implement a wonky and fiddly package of the Treasury\u2019s creation.</p> <p>Version two of the scheme looks much better, which is a relief. The main reform related to eligibility for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or Cbils, the part aimed at small businesses.</p> <p>In the first outing, such government-backed interest-free loans could only be offered to businesses that could not secure finance in the normal way. Cue outrage among would-be borrowers who thought Sunak had promised them ultra-cheap loans but then found that the banks were first pushing standard finance with interest and fees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some banks were asking for guarantees at launch; some weren\u2019t. No wonder borrowers were angry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the rejigged arrangement, all viable borrowers can proceed directly to the juicier Cbils product. That could be a game-changer in solving individual companies\u2019 cash flow worries, but it\u2019s worth asking how the Treasury miscalculated in the first place.</p> <p>No 11, one assumes, wanted to limit the risk to the public purse, a noble intention on the face of it because the government is on the hook for 80% of any loss of a Cbils loan. But the requirement to assess firms\u2019 eligibility for conventional finance meant Cbils wasn\u2019t having an impact. By Thursday night, only \u00a390m of loans had been approved to 983 businesses \u2013 barely scratching the surface of the problem.</p> <p>A similar point can be made about the contentious issue of personal guarantees on loans under \u00a3250,000. Some banks were asking for guarantees at launch; some weren\u2019t, or were doing so in different circumstances. No wonder borrowers were angry. But the banks themselves were confused because the Treasury hadn\u2019t made clear what it wanted. Friday brought the clear instruction not to ask for guarantees. It could have been given on day one.</p> <p>Sunak has also had to acknowledge his original design had a large hole in the middle. Cbils loans were limited to firms with an annual turnover of \u00a345m or less, with other would-be borrowers directed to the scheme for larger companies overseen by the Bank of England. That didn\u2019t work because mid-sized companies thought they needed a credit rating, which most don\u2019t have. Thus Cbils has now been extended, in effect, to firms with \u00a3500m of turnover, albeit that they\u2019ll pay interest on loans.</p> <p>Business groups have applauded the Treasury for listening to feedback. They\u2019re being polite. Many of the design flaws could surely have been anticipated if the Treasury had had a better feel for how small businesses think and act.</p> <p>Sunak, it should be said, deserves praise for his \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">underwrite 80% of wages at affected companies</a>. That is a genuinely big \u2013 and necessarily expensive \u2013 intervention that will save thousands of jobs.</p> <p>Nor should we pretend that designing a loan scheme is easy. The current crisis, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, extends almost to the entire economy. And, to repeat, the banks still need to move. But it also needs to be stated: Cbils required urgent improvement because its original design was poor.</p> <h2>Billionaires benefit from the furlough. They don\u2019t need more</h2> <p>The bill for supporting British business through the crisis will be enormous. It could not be otherwise. The government is paying 80% of the wages of millions of workers across the UK to minimise job losses and ensure the economy is fit to recover when lockdown ends.</p> <p>There will still be corporate failures \u2013 indeed, the destruction has started already on the high street with the collapse of Carluccio\u2019s and Laura Ashley. The only certainty is that action, in the form of the vast \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme, will be cheaper than inaction in the long run.</p> <p>Not all beneficiaries are alike, however. When clothing retailer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/philip-green-asks-for-taxpayer-support-to-prop-up-arcadia\" title=\"\">Arcadia put 14,500 employees into furlough last week</a>, Philip Green became an indirect beneficiary of the public purse. Or, strictly speaking, his wife, Monaco-based Lady Green, got lucky since she is the owner of the struggling fashion empire that includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins.</p> <p>This, to put it mildly, feels appalling. The Greens banked a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 but are under no obligation to return a single penny to the business in the circumstances. And there\u2019s no point asking politely for a contribution. As we saw with the BHS pension scheme, the Greens had to be chased by parliamentarians and watchdogs before agreeing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/philip-green-agrees-pay-363m-bhs-pension-fund\" title=\"\">\u00a3363m payment</a>.</p> <p>There is little, unfortunately, the government can do. It is virtually impossible to design a furlough scheme that does not apply equally to all companies.</p> <p>Ministers can, though, take a tough line when overseas-based billionaires beg for help beyond the generous furlough scheme. Virgin Atlantic, 51% owned by Richard Branson, is reportedly asking for a \u00a3500m package of soft loans and credit guarantees. The response to that should be simple: it\u2019s your turn to put your hand in your pocket.</p> <h2>In time, we must devote huge resources to restarting the economy</h2> <p>There has never been a crisis like the current one. The onset of coronavirus has crippled the advanced world, as governments effectively shut down economic and social life as we know it. Unemployment is now starting to soar as companies run out of money amid the enforced lockdowns, with early indications that joblessness in the US and UK could surpass the depths of the 1930s Great Depression.</p> <p>The jobs crisis is of our own making, an exercise in protecting the health of a nation at the expense of material wealth. It is entirely correct that a compassionate society should take such an approach. But the impact of the lockdown ought not to be overlooked: millions are facing unemployment and hardship.</p> <p>Comparisons with the second world war and the Great Depression are overwrought. Rather than attempting full-scale mobilisation, Covid-19 is overcome by suppressing the economy as much as possible. And, unlike the Depression, hope still remains that this crisis will prove shorter than any other severe economic downturn in history.</p> <p>But two historical comparisons ought to be kept in mind: the need for a New Deal akin to Roosevelt\u2019s in the 1930s, or the Marshall Plan of the 1940s, to reboot economic activity once the economy awakens from hibernation.</p> <p>When the dust finally settles on the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 a moment hoped for sooner rather than later \u2013 the government must throw as much weight behind reopening the economy as it did to shut it down.</p> <p>In the short term, support packages are welcome, despite shortcomings that mean many are still left without adequate financial aid, as the Conservative government temporarily ditches political dogma dating back decades.</p> <p>Failure to support those who lose their jobs in this crisis will only cost Britain even more in the long run, from weaker economic growth and lost tax revenues.</p>",
  "<p>While the publication dates of many books may have been pushed back in the light of the current crisis, this one is right on the money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/markoconnell\">Mark O\u2019Connell</a>\u2019s quest to locate the various manifestations of our collective apocalypse-anxiety might have been written with the long hours of global lockdown in mind. \u201cIt was the end of the world, and I was sitting on the couch watching cartoons with my son,\u201d he begins. He proceeds like Noah sensing rain in the air.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/17/real-estate-for-the-apocalypse-my-journey-into-a-survival-bunker\">Real estate for the apocalypse: my journey into a survival bunker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Connell\u2019s previous book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/23/to-be-a-machine-by-mark-oconnell-review\">To Be a </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/23/to-be-a-machine-by-mark-oconnell-review\">Machine</a>,</em> was an inspired journalistic exploration of \u201ctranshumanism\u201d, the subculture that wants to fast-forward to a technological future in which man becomes part-machine. This one is haunted by the idea that, unless we change our ways, or even if we change our ways, our species does not have much of a future at all. For O\u2019Connell, those fears had been sharpened by recent fatherhood.</p> <p>There are competing voices in his head. One insists, \u201cwe are alive in a time of worst-case scenarios\u2026 Attune your ear to the general discord and you will hear the cracking of the ice caps, the rising of the waters\u2026 Is it not a terrible time to be having children, and therefore in the end, to be alive?\u201d Another voice counters, \u201c[but] when in the scheme of things was it ever a good one?\u201d A third \u2013 generally prompted by his wife \u2013 argues for a bit of perspective: \u201cI was not John of Patmos\u2026 this was a house and people were trying to live in it.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Connell has a gift for channelling the \u201csense of looming crisis\u201d that characterises our times, but is able to step outside it, to bring it into focus. This project began for him toward the end of 2016, that disabling year, when his therapist suggested to him that \u201cit might be helpful not to spend quite so much time following the news\u201d. His response to that suggestion was a kind of personal aversion therapy: he would not shut himself off from the portents of end times that buzz-alerted his phone, but follow them to the ends of the Earth.</p> <p>To this end, he tracked down \u201cpreppers\u201d for apocalypse purchasing bunkers in South Dakota; he listened in to those disciples of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/11/elon-musk-colonise-mars-third-world-war\">Elon Musk</a> who believe our best hope is colonising Mars; he self-isolated in Alladale, the re-wilded retreat in the Highlands of Scotland; and he journeyed to New Zealand, the promised land of doom-harbingers everywhere.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like Louis Theroux cast in Heart of Darkness, he swims in the pure survivalist waters of Thiel's private lake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If there is a thread running through these travels, it is that knotted relationship between Silicon Valley plutocrats and our collective unconscious. As O\u2019Connell shows, the billionaires of digital media seem particularly in thrall to a coming apocalypse, and to lavishly self-indulgent strategies to survive it. Perhaps it is because outrageous fortunes give them control-freak dreams of immortality. Perhaps it is because they understand the darker implications of the monsters they have created.</p> <p>O\u2019Connell exposes their schemes with a likable zeal. His journey to the post-apocalypse hideaway of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation\">Pay</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/15/peter-thiel-silicon-valley-europe-regulation\">Pal founder Peter Thiel</a> is in itself a wonderful piece of journalism, in which he traces Thiel\u2019s obsessions \u2013 with disaster capitalism, cryogenics, surveillance technology, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> \u2013 to a piece of real estate on New Zealand\u2019s south island. Like Louis Theroux cast in <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, he swims in the pure survivalist waters of Thiel\u2019s private lake. \u201cI was drinking apocalypse water, symbolically reclaiming it for the 99%,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf in that moment I could have drained Lake Wanaka just to fuck up Thiel\u2019s end of the world contingency plan, I might well have done so.\u201d</p> <p>The disaster scenarios the quest is concerned with are mostly the terrors of climate change. Pestilence hardly gets a look-in, although you are occasionally given pause by prophetic allusions to our current circumstance. One surprising voice co-opted into Musk\u2019s belief that we need to colonise Mars as a \u201cbackup planet\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/space-travel-stephen-hawking-plutocrats-branson-bezos-musk\">Stephen Hawking</a>, who argued that \u201cto stay [on Earth] risks annihilation. It could be an asteroid hitting Earth. It could be a new virus\u2026 For humans to survive, I believe we must have the preparations in place within 100 years.\u201d</p> <p>As a premonition of that post-human planet, O\u2019Connell visits the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">Chernobyl </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">exclusion </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/10/nuclear-wasteland-inside-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-in-pictures-pripyat-david-mcmillan\">zone</a>. He joins an annual 36,000 tourists on a guided tour of unimaginable catastrophe. What he sees there is less \u201ca barely conceivable tragedy of the very recent past, than a vast diorama of an imagined future, a world in which humans had ceased entirely to exist\u201d. They wander the abandoned town of Pripyat as if it were Pompeii, unearthing children\u2019s drawings in crumbling schoolrooms. Inside a vast unfinished cooling tower next to the Chernobyl plant, he watches a pair of kestrels looping high above and reaches for biblical reference, the \u201cblood-fevered edict of Isaiah\u201d, of the land lying desolate for eternity, \u201ca haunt for jackals, a home for owls\u201d.</p> <p>In some ways, experiencing this abyss, this holy of holies for catastrophists, acts as something of a catharsis for O\u2019Connell. Having looked on these human ruins, he finds himself, counterintuitively, resisting <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias\">Ozymandias-like despair</a>. What brings him back to life is the birth of his second child, a daughter, who arrives with their home in Dublin in the midst of a \u201cstatus red weather warning\u201d. Her presence, that \u201ctiny engine of joy\u201d she represents, is beautifully evoked by O\u2019Connell, in passages that capture exactly that mixture of impossible vulnerability and responsibility, the enforced mindfulness of new parenthood.</p> <p>The prophet that has provided the most comfort to him in his journey has been Dr Seuss, his son\u2019s hero, and in particular those words from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/23/dr-seuss-lorax-inspired-by-orange-kenyan-monkeys\">The Lorax</a></em>, that indelible primer in apocalypse and its unlikely flipside, hope: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d He picks those words up again here, not in any mawkish way, but as a clear-eyed rejoinder to the implications of what he has witnessed in his three-year odyssey. Among other things, O\u2019Connell is good at dramatising the way we turn things over in our minds.</p> <p>Tentatively, sporadically, he finds he is losing his taste for nihilism, that insistent thrum of doom that shadows social media habits. \u201cLately, I have been glad to be alive in this time, if only because there is no other time in which it is possible to be alive,\u201d he says. O\u2019Connell\u2019s journey to this realisation \u2013 though hugely engaging - does not always make comfortable reading with the world grinding to a halt outside, but he leaves the reader with that word, which offers the gift of making any future possible: \u201cunless\u201d. </p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://granta.com/products/notes-from-an-apocalypse/\">Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back</a></em> by Mark O\u2019Connell is published by Granta (\u00a314.99)</p>",
  "<p>Detroit is planning a rapid mobilization of its engineering and manufacturing might unseen since the second world war, switching from making cars to making ventilators as the Covid-19 pandemic brings the US to breaking point.</p> <p>With coronavirus cases surging, not least in Detroit, demand for ventilators is outpacing hospitals\u2019 supply and people are dying without the machines. Now the US\u2019s largest car manufacturers are stepping in. General Motors plans to begin producing 10,000 ventilators per month by mid-April, and Ford hopes to produce 50,000 of the devices in the next 100 days.</p> <p>But producing ventilators and automobiles are two very different processes, and retooling auto factories to make ventilators presents a daunting logistical challenge. Can Detroit really save the nation from its growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo\">ventilator crisis</a>?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo\">New York only has enough ventilators for six more days, says Governor Cuomo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of research with the Center for Automotive Research, said she was initially skeptical. Automakers have already had success <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/31/gm-face-masks-ventec-warren/5097793002/\">producing personal protection equipment</a> like face shields and surgical masks, Dziczek noted, but she\u2019s been \u201camazed\u201d that they seem to be successfully gearing up to produce far more complex ventilators.</p> <p>\u201cI knew the industry had something to offer, though I never thought it could actually produce ventilators. But, in fact, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Dziczek said.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, success hinges on the automakers\u2019 addressing four challenges:</p> <ul> <li><p>Retooling plants</p></li> <li><p>Developing a supply chain</p></li> <li><p>Pulling together a workforce </p></li> <li><p>Clearing regulatory hurdles</p></li> </ul> <p>And they need to solve those issues immediately. American hospitals have about 160,000 ventilators, and only about 65,000 of the machines designed for the most severe cases. Critical care units in hotspots like New York City and Detroit already have a shortage. Eventually, up to 740,000 ventilators could be needed, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p> <p>Ventilators are designed to push air through a tube and into the lungs. They are in high demand because Covid-19 attacks the lungs, and people with severe cases need extra oxygen to survive.</p> <p>Once in production, the devices won\u2019t roll off the lines at Ford or GM\u2019s behemoth, robot-filled plants that produce F-150 pickups and Sierras. Instead, the machines will be assembled largely by hand at Ford\u2019s Rawsonville Plant in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, and GM\u2019s Kokomo, Indiana, facility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98e5dd6d09f841ac1d548ac405d9d60c41ec8728\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98e5dd6d09f841ac1d548ac405d9d60c41ec8728/0_0_3471_2083/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A General Motors assembly worker works on assembling a V6 engine last year.

Similarly, when it isn\u2019t idled, Ford\u2019s 1.7m-sq-ft Rawsonville plant produces components such as transmission oil pumps, battery packs, and air induction systems.</p> <p>The companies are utilizing those facilities because they are where \u201ca bunch of smaller parts arrive, then are assembled into larger parts\u201d, said Mark Schirmer, public relations director with Cox Automotive. \u201cThey\u2019re then shipped to the assembly plants to be installed in vehicles on the large assembly lines.\u201d</p> <p>The process for manufacturing ventilators is similar, he added.</p> <p>\u201cImagine someone at a desk putting together a complex puzzle or model by hand \u2013 lots of small-part assembly,\u201d Schirmer said, adding that the real challenge was \u201cgetting all the necessary parts together in one place for workers to assemble them\u201d.</p> <p>More than 700 parts compose the VOCSN critical care ventilators that GM is partnering with Seattle-based Ventec Life Systems to produce in Kokomo, and the automaker has tapped more than 100 suppliers to feed components. The ventilators are sought after by hospitals because they are five-in-one, portable machines with critical care ventilators, oxygen concentrators, cough assistance, suction and nebulizers.</p> <p>By contrast, Ford is producing a simple ventilator design, which will be licensed by GE Healthcare from Florida-based Airon and operate on air pressure instead of electricity. Ford and GE designers have essentially stripped down a machine used for anesthesia that functions as a ventilator.</p> <p>Aside from sourcing components from suppliers, Ford is repurposing parts that are \u201cuseful in production of other items\u201d, its chief executive, Jim Hackett, recently told CBS This Morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into our parts bins to see what can be done,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Concurrently, the automakers are helping boost production at their partners\u2019 facilities \u2013 Ventec currently produces about 200 ventilators monthly, and GM is using its suppliers and logistical team to help the company push out about 10 times that figure. Meanwhile, Ford said it was helping ramp up GE\u2019s capacity.</p> <p>Labor is perhaps the easiest challenge for the companies to solve, partly because ventilator production is not a labor-intensive job. Cox said it had found one of the nation\u2019s largest ventilator manufacturers only had about 10,000 employees worldwide.</p> <p>Automakers are asking United Auto Workers employees to volunteer to work in three shifts. Ford said it would need about 500 employees, while GM is staffing Kokomo with about 1,000.</p> <p>\u201cIf this does move forward as promoted, it won\u2019t be like world war two when automotive plants were changed over to produce tanks, planes and plane engines,\u201d Schirmer said.</p> <p>The effort got a boost when Donald Trump invoked the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/trump-defense-production-act-coronavirus-gm\">Defense Production Act</a> \u2013 wartime legislation that will allow automakers to avoid certain patent issues and provides the president with the ability to compel companies to prioritize government orders over those of other clients.</p> <p>As he announced the measure, Trump also criticized GM over the ventilators\u2019 price. However, both automakers have said they won\u2019t profit off of the project. Ventec\u2019s ventilators can cost about $18,000 each, far cheaper than the more sophisticated models, which can run up to $50,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/global-battle-coronavirus-equipment-masks-tests\">Spies, hijacks and export bans: the global battle for coronavirus equipment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The federal government is also accommodating automakers by waiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules to allow non-medical manufacturers to quickly produce the devices.

I get this impression that he thinks he has been driven by fate.\u201d</p> <p>This quiet sense of destiny and \u201cinnate hunger\u201d, Trickett said, seemed to affect much that Starmer did, and how he behaved. \u201cOne of the things I have noticed about Keir is that you can be walking through the Commons, or wherever it is, with him in a reasonably comradely way and then, suddenly, he would end up two strides ahead. It is just how he is.\u201d</p> <p>Yesterday the Surrey-raised 57-year-old son of a toolmaker and a nurse, who named their son after the party\u2019s first parliamentary leader, Keir Hardie, emerged not just strides<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/labour-gives-keir-starmer-strong-mandate-to-face-battles-ahead\"> but miles in front of his two rivals</a>, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, from the long contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/the-corbyn-project-is-over-but-keir-starmer-still-needs-the-left\">The Corbyn project is over, but Keir Starmer still needs the left</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The brilliant human rights lawyer who rose to become director of public prosecutions aged 45 in 2008 has only been an MP since 2015. But in a deeply divided party he managed to sweep up 56.2% of the vote, leaving Long-Bailey and Nandy way behind, on 27.6% and 16.2% respectively. Importantly, Starmer won a mandate across the board, winning the biggest share of the vote among MPs, members and affiliates.</p> <p>Many among Starmer\u2019s own supporters and within his campaign team, who tied him ruthlessly and repetitively to messages about unity during more than 40 hustings, had thought early on that it would be a much closer fight.</p> <p>Some believed he would appear too \u201clawyerly\u201d and wooden, while others feared that the left\u2019s candidate Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, would be propelled to victory by the pro-Corbyn organisation Momentum, which had the vital data on many of the 500,000 party members from the last two contests in 2015 and 2016. Another danger, his backers believed, was that Starmer, a London MP and star barrister with a square jaw and smart suits, would be seen in the Labour heartlands as another Blairite in left-wing clothing.</p> <p>But as it turned out, the left who had wanted Long-Bailey to win, including her union backers, fell out among themselves about how to carry Corbynism forward amid the post-general election acrimony, and her campaign never really took off. It was also not entirely clear how much she wanted the job and whether she felt forced against her better instincts to carry the torch for the Corbynistas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People wanted someone who could win,  someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing</p> <footer> <cite>Starmer supporter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe went missing for the first four weeks of the campaign, which made everyone think she was wobbling, and when it started it was pretty much a disaster. By that time Starmer was miles ahead,\u201d said one of her early backers. While Nandy impressed and won admirers, the MP for Wigan started too far behind, and was viewed as less tried and tested than Starmer.</p> <p>With the party shattered by its worst defeat since 1935, when the rebuilding process began, it was not ideological purity, flamboyance, or someone young and new that members across the Labour divide wanted \u2013 but someone reassuring and competent who they could see taking on and outshining Boris Johnson. And Starmer fitted the bill.</p> <p>Prominent names on the left such as Laura Parker, a former senior official in Corbyn\u2019s office and a former national organiser of Momentum, chose Starmer and was followed by many other Momentumites.</p> <p>Parker, who had seen him operate in Labour\u2019s Brexit sub-committee, said Starmer was \u201ctenacious, forensic, diligent, intelligent\u201d. His focus, determination and mastery of detail is something everyone who knows him observes. Importantly for Parker he had also, since the election, put forward a left-wing programme that for her was entirely credible, allowing her to feel it was a natural switch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/from-attlee-to-blair-what-starmer-can-learn-from-four-labour-leaders\">From Attlee to Blair: what Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe can seem cautious but the other side of that is that you feel you can believe the words that come out of his mouth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe has said there will be no rolling back from a radical programme \u2013 and I, like others who supported Corbyn, backed him on the basis of the policy commitments he had in his 10 pledges.\u201d</p> <p>One of Starmer\u2019s supporters who manned phone banks for him said Momentum members came over in droves. \u201cYou could just hear them peeling off on the phone. They wanted someone who could win, people wanted someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing as well as leading an effective opposition. They trusted him to do both. There is only a relatively small hardcore of the membership who think that ideological purity is more important than winning.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s supporters deny that his campaign had been long in the planning. But he has been very careful in his five years in parliament not to make political enemies either at Westminster or in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency party \u2013 and to shore up support against potential challenges from the local left.</p> <p>Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, suggests Starmer deliberately avoided being associated with trouble-making factions in the parliamentary party, even when it was riven by disagreements over Brexit policy, which he was in charge of from 2016 until the election. \u201cI am not aware that he had allegiances really, other than ones for temporary convenience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13d4e5b85c6604ee57c069f4a737b8bbe51b28dd/0_0_3955_2644/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starmer with leadership rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey, left, and Lisa Nandy, centre, at SEC in Glasgow in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Perry/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact his energy seems to have been spent on avoiding factionalism at every turn. In local Labour politics it was the same. Sally Gimson, an activist in Holborn and St Pancras, says that even when he was handling the Brexit brief in the shadow cabinet, Starmer had \u201cnever been too grand to come to the smallest fundraiser or support a tiny community group\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyer Patrick Stevens, who was international director at the Crown Prosecution Service when Starmer was there, noticed the same approach when working with him before he entered politics: \u201cHe made sure he knew every person in my team from me to the most junior official and they all felt able to call him Keir. It was how he worked. In his first year at the DPP he went to every single one of its offices around the country and made sure he talked to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s upbringing in Oxted no doubt shaped his views from a very early age. His mother was disabled and had to give up work because of a rare auto-immune disorder. He remembers spending many long nights with her at the local hospital.</p> <p>The young Keir was the only one of the four Starmer siblings to pass the 11-plus, which meant he could go on to Reigate grammar school. One of his contemporaries was Andrew Cooper, founder of the Populus polling organisation, who has memories of him as a popular and clubbable boy. \u201cHe was not brilliant in class, but near the top. What I remember of him does not quite fit with his public image now as slightly dull. He was very popular. He was often the one at the centre of the crowd telling the jokes.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s more recent friends support Cooper\u2019s view, insisting he can be the life and soul of a party. \u201cHe has got lots of friends. He is a huge Arsenal fan,\u201d says Patrick Stevens. \u201cHe goes with the same group of his mates to a pub off the Holloway Road before every match. Keir also organises five-a-side games every Sunday and Monday. He sends out the texts and collects the subs.\u201d Asked about his playing abilities Stevens added: \u201cHe is a midfield general ... with a silky left foot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/party-factions-antisemitism-and-a-global-pandemic-keir-starmers-in-tray\">Party factions, antisemitism \u2026 and a global pandemic: Keir Starmer's in-tray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer studied law at Leeds University, where he took a first before graduating from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, as a bachelor of law. He was called to the bar in 1987.</p> <p>As a barrister at Doughty Street chambers, he took on a string of high-profile human rights cases, including the defendants in the \u201cMcLibel\u201d case in 1997, which he worked on \u201cpro bono\u201d for 11 years.</p> <p>Mark Stephens, a lawyer who instructed him on many such cases before Starmer was appointed DPP, said: \u201cHe had a Rolls-Royce mind and a way to apply that mind that was wonderful to watch. There was never anything showy about him. He quietly got on with cases because he believed in what he was doing. If he had gone to the commercial bar, he would I think already be on the court of appeal and knocking at the door of the supreme court, if not already a shoo-in.\u201d</p> <p>After becoming an MP in 2015 Starmer was appointed to the front bench by Corbyn to be in charge of immigration before resigning over Corbyn\u2019s leadership in 2016. Despite this he was reappointed to the front bench as shadow Brexit secretary in 2016. While the eventual Brexit position which the party put to voters in December last year was a messy compromise, it was not for lack of effort on Starmer\u2019s part. He had wanted a clearer commitment to Remain and a second referendum but had been unable to win the day with those around Corbyn.</p> <p>As he embarks on his leadership and begins to appoint his shadow cabinet today, it will not be Brexit that will preoccupy Starmer but rather Labour\u2019s approach to the coronavirus pandemic. The new leader has won a handsome mandate from a party that has placed its trust in his forensic, tenacious approach to politics and the crises it throws up. The current crisis could hardly be bigger.</p> <p>In his statement yesterday, Starmer said: \u201cWhether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That\u2019s why in the national interest the Labour party will play its full part.\u201d The coming weeks will be a test like no other in his hitherto glittering career.</p>",
  "<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/keir-starmer-won-over-shell-shocked-labour-party\">How \u2018tenacious, diligent\u2019 Keir Starmer won over a shell-shocked party</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Covid-19</h2> <p>The coronavirus crisis is all all-consuming and will be Starmer\u2019s immediate focus. When to criticise the government, and how hard, will be a delicate political judgment \u2013 calls for a change of course, or an inquiry, will need to be carefully timed. The Brexit debate showed Starmer was at his lawyerly best when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/20/brexit-boris-johnson-eu-deal-delay-live-news\">putting ministers under pressure </a>over the fine detail of their plans \u2013 a quality now greatly needed. Yet there are competing pressures. Elsewhere in the world, opposition figures have struggled to make any impact as the outbreak has developed, which will create pressure for bolder interventions. A balancing act.</p> <h2>The economy</h2> <p>After years of disagreements since 2010, most in Labour had become united on a broad rejection of austerity and a demand on the rich to pay more tax. Starmer had accepted key Corbyn tax pledges from the 2019 manifesto. However, the costs of the coronavirus will shake up the debate and force Starmer into difficult decisions. How to pay for the fallout is not a topic of great discussion now, but it will cause problems for both main parties. The degree and speed with which Starmer proposes to repair the public finances will be highly contentious and risks opening up tensions with Labour\u2019s left.</p> <h2>Party machinery</h2> <p>During the current leader\u2019s reign, the party\u2019s left has been successful in occupying key posts and winning a majority on its powerful national executive committee. Control of the party machinery has always been critical in Labour\u2019s internal politics, and many Labour MPs are keen to see Starmer clear out the party\u2019s HQ, including the current general secretary Jennie Formby, a close ally of Corbyn and Unite union boss, Len McCluskey. However, any immediate clearout would be seen as an act of war by the left and undermine Starmer\u2019s plea for unity.</p> <h2>Antisemitism inquiry</h2> <p>Starmer will need to work out a response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">antisemitism inquiry</a> undertaken by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The issue has seriously damaged Labour\u2019s reputation among Jewish voters and beyond. While it will be a difficult moment for the party, Starmer\u2019s initial response will be quite simple \u2013 accept the report and its recommendations. He has already pledged to toughen party rules on antisemitism. The more difficult issue will be to what extent he reprimands anyone singled out in the inquiry and still employed by Labour.</p> <h2>Shadow cabinet</h2> <p>Starmer\u2019s first shadow cabinet will be a key early decision and reveal the extent to which he wants to change course or carry on with Corbyn\u2019s team. John McDonnell and Diana Abbott are both<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/john-mcdonnell-will-not-return-to-shadow-cabinet-labour\"> stepping down</a>, but what of other Corbyn allies such as Ian Lavery and Richard Burgon? And will Starmer opt to bring back big hitters like Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves, or leave them overseeing select committees? Will Corbyn be offered a new post, perhaps party president? A demonstration of unity seems to be Starmer\u2019s priority in appointing a team, so a clearout seems unlikely.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to have been the big political event of April, but the announcement of Labour\u2019s leadership result was a low-key affair yesterday, with relatively little fanfare, overshadowed by the terrifying coronavirus crisis that has swept across Britain. </p> <p>As expected, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/30/labour-leadership-interviews-sir-keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a>, the party\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, was decisively endorsed by Labour members and supporters. In a sober, impressive address, he spoke of Labour\u2019s mission in the coming weeks to save lives and protect the country through constructive opposition.</p> <p>Starmer takes over not just at a time of unprecedented national crisis, but a difficult juncture for his party. His victory comes after its most disastrous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-2019-50768605/general-election-2019-worst-night-for-labour-since-1935\">election defeat</a> since 1935, the product of a party that was mired in institutional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/corbyn-apologises-for-antisemitism-in-labour-party\">antisemitism</a>, divisions over Brexit and voters\u2019 dislike of Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news\">three-month leadership campaign</a>, Starmer has not proved as willing as his rival Lisa Nandy to speak hard truths to members about the reasons for Labour\u2019s defeat. But he was not the candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/23/labour-leadership-interviews-rebecca-long-bailey-podcast\">endorsed by Corbyn</a> and his election marks a welcome fresh start.</p> <p>There are a number of daunting tasks on Starmer\u2019s to-do list. The first is to get the substance and tenor of opposition right in these extraordinary times. Britain is crying out for a mature and responsible opposition that can forensically hold this government, whose response to the coronavirus pandemic has been marred by a lack of preparedness and transparency, to account. In recent weeks, frontbenchers such as the shadow health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/labour-urges-government-publish-findings-2016-pandemic-drill\">Jon Ashworth</a>, have led the way in asking appropriately tough questions of government about some of the chaotic aspects of its response, for example in its tardy procurement of ventilators, personal protective equipment and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/a-glimmer-of-hope-but-little-detail-experts-react-to-hancocks-test-plan\">testing capacity</a>, without looking like they are seeking to make political capital. Starmer must press for proper parliamentary scrutiny, even while MPs are not meeting in Westminster.</p> <p>Further, he must confront the toxic cultures that have polluted his party. Most importantly, he must take responsibility for rooting out antisemitism, including fully implementing the recommendations of the Equality and Human Rights Commission <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party\">inquiry</a> when it is published. The party has also proved incapable of adjudicating fairly on allegations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/labour-peer-suspended-over-sexual-harassment-and-transphobia-andrew-stone\">sexual harassment</a>. We applaud his commitment to establishing an independent complaints process.</p> <p>The country faces huge levels of uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, with little clarity about where we will be in a few weeks, let alone six months. The only known is that there will be no going back to normal. Starmer must find a way to set out a vision for a new politics that addresses the societal fragilities that have been so painfully exposed in recent weeks, while holding on to those small shoots that are already emerging from the hardships and losses that many are starting to experience.</p> <p>The same questions therefore face a party that defines itself through its aspiration for a fairer, greener world \u2013 but with new challenges attached. How would a Labour government restore a healthcare system that rightly commands huge national pride, but that will be left ravaged not just by a decade of austerity but a pandemic? What is the best way of restoring dignity and fair reward to work often labelled as \u201clow skill\u201d, but which this crisis has shown we cannot do without, jobs we are expecting people to risk their lives to do while being paid a pittance? How would Labour close the attainment gap between children from poor and affluent backgrounds that will inevitably widen as a result of the long closure of schools? What measures are needed to reduce carbon emissions while ensuring that the richest have to adapt their lifestyles, like the rest of us? And what is the future of Brexit in a probable global recession?</p> <p>These are questions that can only be convincingly answered by a party of the left. When the worst of the crisis has passed, Britain will need a progressive government more than ever. We are all relying on Starmer to get Labour there.</p>",

As the relatively wealthy countries of the northern hemisphere engage in a noisy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-the-week-explained\">struggle to repulse</a> Covid-19, alarm bells are ringing from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/india-coronavirus-cases-rise-amid-fears-true-figure-much-higher\">south Asia</a> to the Middle East and <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/02/africa-coronavirus-pandemic-violence-confusion/\">Africa</a>. Mostly they have not yet been heard.</p> <p>Anybody who has experienced the densely populated slums of Mumbai, Dhaka or Port-au-Prince knows how impossible are the concepts of social distancing and self-isolation for many of their inhabitants. Those who have seen the conditions in refugee camps in and around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/fears-over-hidden-covid-19-outbreak-in-lebanon-iraq-and-syria\">Syria</a> or Somalia know how limited are the health facilities there, even at the best of times.</p> <p>The World Health Organization has reported that at least half of the world\u2019s population did not have access to essential medical care even before the pandemic struck. As the global equality charity Plan International Australia has ominously warned, many in these communities, particularly children, suffer from serious underlying conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and malnutrition.</p> <p>People living in conflict zones are doubly vulnerable. If you are an inhabitant of Idlib, for example, there is a good chance that any attempt to follow advice, stay at home and stay safe will be disrupted by a Russian or Syrian regime bombing raid. That\u2019s one reason why Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has called for a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972\">global ceasefire</a> in the face of \u201cour common enemy\u201d. There is scant evidence that his plea is being heeded.</p> <p>The UN has also warned that people in countries whose wellbeing has been damaged by unilateral sanctions, such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Cuba, could suffer disproportionately from the spread of coronavirus. This is already the case in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-52118809\">Iran</a>. All such sanctions should be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-un-sanctions/lift-sanctions-on-iran-north-korea-venezuela-in-coronavirus-crisis-un-rights-expert-idUSKBN21I2N7\">lifted immediately</a>, said the UN\u2019s Hilal Elver, to help avoid virus-related food shortages. If the Trump administration heard her call, it has done little about it.</p> <p>Food insecurity is a growing worry in sub-Saharan Africa, notably the Sahel region. If the disease takes hold there, the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/news/number-hungry-people-spikes-central-sahel-covid-19-looms\">World Food Programme</a> says, vital humanitarian supply chains in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger could be further disrupted at a time when millions already face summer food shortages caused by drought and jihadist violence.</p> <p>From war-scarred Afghanistan to the impoverished Central African Republic, where the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/march/just-three-ventilators-to-cope-with-covid-19-in-central-african-republic/\">Norwegian Refugee Council says</a> there are three ventilators for five million people, fear of imminent disaster is compounded by a chronic lack of resources. And any responses to Covid-19 will be further hampered by unresolved political and security issues left to fester for years.</p> <p>Gaza is a case in point. Two million Palestinians are crammed into an area of 365 sq km. According to the International Crisis Group, cases of coronavirus have been identified. Now <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/26/paleastinians-brace-coronavirus-outbreak-gaza-strip-covid/\">Gaza is preparing</a> for the worst. \u201cA major outbreak would swiftly overwhelm Gaza\u2019s healthcare system, which has been devastated by years of war and Israeli blockade. The death toll could be horrific,\u201d the ICG said last week.</p> <p>The potential economic impact on the developing world is also a matter of huge concern. Low- and middle-income countries have already been hurt by falling export demand, lower oil prices and a collapse in tourism. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/23/pr2098-imf-managing-director-statement-following-a-g20-ministerial-call-on-the-coronavirus-emergency\">80 governments have asked</a> for emergency IMF funding, with one estimate suggesting a total bailout of at least \u00a32tn may be necessary.</p> <p>The resilience of vulnerable states suffering anticipated shocks of such unprecedented social and economic severity is greatly limited when compared, for example, with wealthier nations such as Britain that can call on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-announces-330bn-bailout-package-for-businesses-video\">unlimited borrowing</a>. Lasting, possibly permanent pandemic-related damage increases the risk of social disorder and state violence, as seen in South Africa.</p> <p>The incidence of Covid-19 in large swaths of Africa, south Asia and Latin America remains limited for now. But there is every reason to believe a virus that has ravaged and humbled the world\u2019s two biggest economies - the US and China - will eventually spread infection to all corners of the globe.</p> <p>It is not entirely true to say there is nothing we can do but watch. Governments and individuals should support the UN and its agencies; boost foreign aid budgets; donate to international charities; share expertise; offer refuge and succour; and, wherever possible, provide vital medical equipment \u2013 all this and more can and must be done. Covid-19 is a universal nightmare, a truly global crisis. All its victims without exception deserve help, wherever they live. If efforts to control the virus in the developing world fail, the human toll could be indescribable. And the disease could become endemic, repeatedly rebounding and recycling through migration, human contacts and second- or third-wave pandemics. It does not bear thinking about.</p>",

  "<p>At a White House coronavirus briefing late last month, Donald Trump became visibly annoyed. Jonathan Karl, ABC\u2019s chief White House correspondent, had pressed him about ventilator availability. The president snapped back with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1243672356511498240\">\u201cdon\u2019t be a cutie-pie\u201d</a> and don\u2019t act like a \u201cwise guy\u201d. This was not the pair\u2019s first rodeo. Their paths first crossed back in the mid-1990s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/front-row-at-the-trump-show-jonathan-karl-book\">'It's an exhausting story': Jonathan Karl on his up-close view of Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back then, Trump was cementing his status as a tabloid legend and Karl was a cub reporter with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post. As part of the real estate mogul\u2019s perpetual circus, he granted Karl an interview about Michael Jackson\u2019s honeymoon in Trump Tower. Meditate on that.</p> <p>Now Karl has written a book. It is an attempt to capture the madness that is the Trump presidency and the danger to democracy it poses. Aided by measured prose and healthy skepticism, Karl succeeds.</p> <p>Well-organized and respectfully written before the pandemic, Front Row at the Trump Show conveys the chaos and the characters that inhabit the president\u2019s universe.</p> <p>Also on display are Trump\u2019s preternatural disregard for the truth \u2013 \u201cTrump was a serial exaggerator long before he ran for president\u201d \u2013 and his curious soft spot for the Confederacy, the losing and slave-holding side in the American civil war.</p> <p>Front Row tells of a previously unreported White House meeting in the aftermath of the infamous 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/charlottesville-white-supremacist-james-alex-fields-heather-heyer\">the murder</a> of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Trump heaped hosannas on Robert E Lee, the defeated Confederate general, expressed sympathy for white nationalist grievance and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>Relying on three sources and contemporaneous notes taken by one participant, Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u201cgood\u201d intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-neo-nazis-vice-news-hbo\">Jews will not replace us</a>\u201d \u2013 never really registered on his radar.</p> <p>Instead, sitting at a conference table first used by Ulysses Grant, the Union general who won the war and became the 18th president, Trump opined that Lee was \u201cthe greatest strategic military mind perhaps ever\u201d and also praised Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, another Confederate general.</p> <p>Karl also delivers his take on the White House staff. It is generally damning.</p> <p>Sean Spicer, for example, never had any business working near the Oval Office. In Karl\u2019s telling, the first Trump press secretary\u2019s rage was not limited to the briefing room podium.<strong> </strong>In a pique, Spicer slammed his office door on Karl and his daughter. He later apologized.</p> <p>Sarah Sanders, the president\u2019s second press secretary, possessed a similar affection for \u201calternative facts\u201d. She fabricated a tale about non-existent disdain within the FBI toward James Comey, which the special counsel\u2019s report <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Muelller-Report-Redacted-Vol-II-Released-04.18.2019-Word-Searchable.-Reduced-Size.pdf\">examined in detail</a>.</p> <p>And then there is Anthony Scaramucci, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/reel-history-lady-jane-grey\">Lady Jane Grey</a> of White House communications directors. Karl presents Scaramucci drawing a phallic-shaped organization chart with him on top. In Karl\u2019s words: \u201cScaramucci\u2019s diagram looked like a penis. Not a propitious start for the new communications director.\u201d</p> <p>Those in attendance \u201cstruggled to keep from laughing\u201d. Scaramucci lasted 10 days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/anthony-scaramucci-post-media-company\">Maybe 11</a>.</p> <p>Karl expresses sympathy for Trump over leaked conversations with foreign leaders but reminds the president his anger should be aimed at his staff, not the press. Likewise, Karl raps Jim Acosta of CNN for his confrontational style. In Karl\u2019s view the media should not be the story.</p> <p>Parenthetically, Karl worked at CNN before joining ABC. But Karl is also the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and in that role he vigorously supported Acosta in the face of White House attempts to strip his press pass.</p> <p>Underscoring the senselessness of Trump\u2019s efforts, Karl reminds us that immediately after Acosta\u2019s credentials were restored, Trump called on him. It\u2019s not that bygones were bygones. Rather, the president can\u2019t live without a sparring partner.</p> <p>In the Age of Trump, being a reporter means having a target on your back. Karl describes <a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/journalist-recounts-the-moment-in-the-2016-campaign-where-trump-took-a-dark-turn/\">Trump\u2019s attempts to use the media as a foil and the resultant danger</a>.</p> <p>Angered by Karl during a pre-rally interview in November 2015, Trump stormed out and unleashed an obscenity-laced tirade. As a coda, the candidate enlisted the live audience by name-checking ABC, though not Karl himself.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the villains,\u201d writes Karl. \u201cHis crowds loved the attacks on the press, and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Trump continued to pour gasoline on the fire, labeling the press the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, a phrase embraced by dictators and tyrants. Karl fears \u201cTrump\u2019s war on truth may do lasting damage to American democracy\u201d.</p> <p>And this was before a global pandemic and the real possibility of economic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1245675889884626945\">depression</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefani Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, its death toll has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest\">exploded</a> at a rate surpassing that of Italy.

  "<p>Your editorial is correct about the impact of Covid-19: \u201cThe monumental shift in national behaviour has so far been brought about not by sanctions and fines but by common sense and fellow feeling\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/the-observer-view-importance-of-national-unity-coronavirus\" title=\"\">The Observer view on the importance of national unity</a>\u201d). Health workers are rightly receiving huge credit for their crucial part. But since the crisis began, the good humour and politeness of, for instance, supermarket workers has also been inspiring. Hopefully, when the emergency is over, we\u2019ll remember that many of the pandemic\u2019s unassuming heroes were checkout staff, shelf stackers and delivery drivers, and other unsung key workers, like cleaners and refuse collectors.</p> <p>We should all take the time to personally thank our supermarket staff when we go food shopping; the bin men when they call around to collect the rubbish; and the cleaners who are helping to keep safe those public spaces that remain open.<br><strong>Joe McCarthy</strong><br>Dublin<br></p> <p>Loath though I am to disagree with someone who knows immeasurably more than I do about Covid-19 (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/this-is-not-the-time-for-blame-we-need-to-get-ahead-of-the-pandemic\" title=\"\">This isn\u2019t the time to be apportioning blame</a>\u201d, David Nabarro, News), it seems to me that in politics we already know who the principal villains and incompetents are. Scientists and NGOs have been warning for years about the disease threats of the abominable wildlife trade now dominated by criminal gangs. Furthermore, we have already had dry runs for the present crisis in the Sars and Mers outbreaks. For years it has been a question of when, not if a pandemic would explode.</p> <p>Now it has, we learn that the NHS failed a stress test for coping with such an epidemic and the Tories, who for 10 years have been cutting staff and facilities, just carried on as before and fought two more general elections dancing to the same tune. Finally, in the Americas we have Trump and Bolsonaro opposing lockdown and ready to climb over mountains of dead bodies to get their economies back to planetary-destroying GDP growth in time for re-elections.

Well, connectivity is an interesting point: the countries that first suffered from coronavirus were the \u201cconnected\u201d ones, which seems to show that our mad addiction to cheap flights and exotic holidays contributed greatly to the spread of corona. Now, in a horrible copy-cat twist of fate, developing countries, which would probably have been spared the illness, if it were not for hordes of voyeuristic westerners busy spreading it, are following our lead and are going into lockdown.</p> <p>The tragedy here is that they live in close proximity and, if they don\u2019t work, they go hungry. So now they probably have to run the gauntlet of militarised police over-enthusiastically enforcing curfews.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br>Cologne, Germany<br></p> <p>I read with amazement your story, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\" title=\"\">Fruit and veg \u2018will run out\u2019 unless Britain flies in pickers</a>\u201d (News). Haven\u2019t the asparagus and cucumber growers, who have apparently already brought in 450 people from Bulgaria and say that they need up to 90,000 more, heard that there is a coronavirus crisis?</p> <p>We don\u2019t need these food growers to fly in any more workers from abroad. What we need is for them to ask the millions in their area who are at home and out of work if they would like to pick some fruit or vegetables. They could do this for the same wages that the growers were willing to pay foreign workers, plus or minus some free fruit or vegetables. If the government can with just a single announcement get 400,000 people to volunteer to help the NHS, then in these desperate times they can surely get 90,000 people in farming districts to volunteer to pick fruit and veg as and when these come into season.<br><strong>Ken Smith</strong><br>London E2<br></p> <p>The desperation referred to by Andrew Rawnsley is not as he says for people \u201cto believe in leaders\u201d, but for them to believe in leaders who it\u2019s possible to believe are capable of leading (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/in-a-national-crisis-people-are-desperate-to-believe-in-their-leaders\" title=\"\">In a national crisis, people are desperate to believe in their leaders</a>\u201d, Comment). The \u201csurge in popularity\u201d described as benefiting Gordon Brown and Boris Johnson in a crisis was deserved by the former, who prevented the world financial system from collapse, but our PM has proved incapable.

Ray Bradbury, the master of dystopian vision, wrote his short story <em>The Pedestrian</em> in 1951. His character Leonard Mead spends his evenings walking the empty city streets in AD 2053.

To \u201crip off\u201d is to steal and I\u2019m sure that the composers of Twist and Shout were justly rewarded. Great artists borrow from their peers and sometimes improve on the originals, as the Isley Brothers certainly did a little later with their cover of Summer Breeze, written by Seals and Crofts. <br><strong>Philip Stogdon</strong><br>London N8<br></p> <h2>Fish have feelings too<br></h2> <p>Yes, I expect Lamorna Ash\u2019s holding \u201cgasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands\u201d as she pulled their guts out probably did change her life (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/29/the-young-woman-and-the-sea-lamorna-ashs-adventures-on-a-cornish-trawler\" title=\"\">The young woman and the sea</a>\u201d, New Review).
