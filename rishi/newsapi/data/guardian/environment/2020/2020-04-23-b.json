Research shows that remittances help alleviate poverty in lower- and middle-income (LCMI) countries, and are linked with reductions in malnutrition, child labour, and missed school in disadvantaged households.<br><br>The dramatic fall will be felt sharply after a record $554bn was sent to LMICs in remittances in 2019 - overtaking foreign investment for the first time. The latter is predicted to drop by a whopping 35% next year, which means the decline in weekly or monthly money transfers to struggling families in countries such as Guatemala, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine will hit communities hard. The unprecedented crash in crude oil prices will also add to the woes.<br><br>The biggest falls are expected in Europe and Central Asia (27.5%), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (23.1%), South Asia (22.1%), the Middle East and North Africa (19.6%), Latin America and the Caribbean (19.3%), and East Asia and the Pacific (13%).<br><br>On the bright-ish side, the World Bank reckons that remittances will recover slightly by 2021, to rise by an estimated 5.6% to $470 billion. But - and there are a lot of buts - this depends on how the pandemic evolves across the globe during the rest of the year, and the measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. Also, remittance flows are typically counter-cyclical, as migrant workers tend to send more money to their families in times of crisis and hardship back home. But, this pandemic is truly global, and so is the economic fall-out.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:49:17.299Z\">at 8.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1ec508f08eb2f433f562f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jasonburke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:34:25.542Z\">8.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jason Burke</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, has written this dispatch on how <strong>South Africa</strong> will begin to ease its lockdown:</p> \n  <p>South Africa\u2019s president <strong>Cyril Ramaphosa</strong> spoke to the nation for the second time in three days on Thursday night, giving 56 million people the good news that the very strict lockdown that they have endured for nearly month would be lifted at the end of the month, but undoubtedly disappointing some by making it very clear that changes to the lives of many would not be substantial.</p> \n  <p>So far South Africa, which has been praised for its pro-active strategy of screening and testing to contain the Covid-19 virus, has nearly 4,000 confirmed cases and has suffered 75 deaths.

But from May 1st South Africa will move to level four, which will allow \u201csome activity to resume subject to extreme precautions\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Few further details were immediately available though Ramaphosa mentioned the phased reopening of schools. The country\u2019s borders will remain shut however. Level three would allow some social activities, but even level two would mean a continuing ban on religious services, sporting events, concerts, cinema and similar gatherings. </p> \n  <p>Ramaphosa stressed the risk of a new surge of infections, and though the president did not mention the coming winter, experts have repeatedly warned that the month ahead are likely to be difficult. Very significant restrictions look set to remain in place for six months at least. </p> \n  <p>\u201cLet us stay strong and united,\u201d Ramaphosa, a popular leader who took power in 2018 and won an election last year, said. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:37:04.367Z\">at 8.37pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1e3698f08eb2f433f55eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:24:41.881Z\">8.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Dubai</strong> has become the latest city to ease lockdown restrictions, announcing that cafes and restaurants are to reopen with a maximum capacity of 30 per cent. </p> \n  <p>Reuters reports public transportation services, including the subway, will resume from 26 April.

And amid a global pandemic, this year\u2019s month of fasting and reflection for the world\u2019s Muslims will be very different, writes <strong>Martin Chulov</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor.</p> \n  <p>Normally a sociable time, where abstaining from food and water during daylight hours gives way to sumptuous meals and gatherings at dusk, the 2020 rituals have been modified to fit public health directives that urge people to maintain a distance from each other while the coronavirus remains active. </p> \n  <p>Mosques will remain closed to evening prayers and feasting will become a more intimate affair, within the confines of family homes. Large public banquets, provided by authorities, or benefactors, have been outlawed in much of the Islamic world, where curfews and lockdowns remain rigidly enforced.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e/0_0_2691_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ahead of the fast there was even discussion about whether going without sustenance for much of the day may have an effect on immunity \u2013 and hence people\u2019s capacity to fight off Covid-19. However, with no clarity about whether this is the case, and evidence to support the contrary \u2013 that fasting may in fact be beneficial \u2013 the premise of this year\u2019s Ramadan remains unchanged.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMuslim religious authorities around the world are advocating wide restrictions on gatherings, in or out of mosques, as a result of the corona pandemic,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe mosques will remain virtually closed; the usual charity meal tables will be absent from the streets; and the frequent family socialising associated with Ramadan will be suspended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ramadan under lockdown is the antithesis of the festival. But, as Covid-19 took hold in the lead up to the fast, religious authorities and governments remained determined to ban congregational activities \u2013 a move that could deny the impoverished more than the chance to socialise. Charity is also an important part of the month, with cash, food and other donations regularly given to those with few means to afford them.</p> \n  <p>Mosques across the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have largely been shuttered throughout the crisis and will not offer shelter or seclusion to those fasting this year. </p> \n  <p>Some regional states have amended their curfew times to make it easier for people to shop during fasting hours. Coronavirus has even taken a toll on traditional Ramadan TV fare, with social distancing disrupting filming in the run-up, leaving shows unfinished. Clerical bodies, meanwhile, have encouraged people to embrace this year\u2019s restrictions by focusing on close family members.</p> \n  <p>In a statement earlier this month, Egypt\u2019s Grand Mufti, Shawki Allam, said: \u201cWe must look to the positive aspects during these exceptional times that have compelled many people to be quarantined in their homes and turn this into an opportunity for bonding and forgiveness and restoring the spirit of serenity and cooperation.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:59:57.722Z\">at 1.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea180ea8f08a1178d5b0551\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:02:56.601Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In most of the world, medical staff have been lauded as heroes for their response to the coronavirus pandemic.

He also said that children or adolescents with a fever or symptoms consistent with the coronavirus should stay at home in quarantine.</p> \n  <p>The deputy prime minister also asked children in Spain to forgive the confusion the government had caused on Tuesday after it said children would be allowed out only to accompany a parent to buy food or medicine. A huge public outcry resulted in a u-turn within hours, and the government insisting that children would have more room to roam.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI want to say sorry because over the past few days and hours, the government hasn\u2019t been as clear as it could have been when it came to explaining how you\u2019ll be allowed to go out for walks with your families from Sunday,\u201d said Iglesias. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI know this confinement hasn\u2019t been at all easy for you - you\u2019ve had to stop going to school and seeing your teachers and friends.

However, with no clarity about whether this is the case, and evidence to support the contrary \u2013 that fasting may in fact be beneficial \u2013 the premise of this year\u2019s Ramadan remains unchanged.</p> <p>\u201cMuslim religious authorities around the world are advocating wide restrictions on gatherings, in or out of mosques, as a result of the [coronavirus] pandemic,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p> <p>\u201cThe mosques will remain virtually closed; the usual charity meal tables will be absent from the streets; and the frequent family socialising associated with Ramadan will be suspended.\u201d</p> <p>Ramadan under lockdown is the antithesis of the festival. However, as Covid-19 took hold in the lead-up to the fast, religious authorities and governments were determined to ban congregational activities \u2013 a move that could deny the impoverished more than the chance to fraternise. Charity is also an important part of the month, with cash, food and other donations regularly given to those with few means to afford them.</p> <p>Mosques across the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 in Egypt Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have largely been shuttered throughout the crisis and will not offer shelter or seclusion to those fasting this year.</p> <p>With global travel grinding largely to a halt, supply lines have also suffered and there are fears that food may be in short supply in some areas. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had to worry about that,\u201d said Bashar Abu Samra, from the northern Lebanon city of Tripoli. \u201cA scarcity of food during Ramadan. Can you imagine?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bab794f7d2b1b4d521f0f4f86a0c95d45c9745b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bab794f7d2b1b4d521f0f4f86a0c95d45c9745b/0_42_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man cleans a mosque ahead of Ramadan, during lockdown of the Sindh province, in Pakistan, on 23 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man cleans a mosque ahead of Ramadan, during lockdown of the Sindh province, in Pakistan, on 23 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shahzaib Akber/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some states have amended their curfew times to make it easier for people to shop during fasting hours. The virus has even taken a toll on traditional Ramadan TV fare, with distancing disrupting filming in the run-up, leaving shows unfinished. Clerical bodies meanwhile have encouraged families to embrace this year\u2019s restrictions by focusing on intimate family members.</p> <p>In a statement earlier this month, Egypt\u2019s Grand Mufti, Shawki Allam, said: \u201cWe must look to the positive aspects during these exceptional times that have compelled many people to be quarantined in their homes and turn this into an opportunity for bonding and forgiveness and restoring the spirit of serenity and cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>In north-west Syria, where the fasting may at least put a stop to relentless war, Ahmad Mustafa, a shopkeeper in Idlib, said the month was still welcome. \u201cEverybody can pause to see where they\u2019re at. The world needs to change. And maybe this time it will happen for real.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If, nearly 20 years on, you still have nightmares about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/14/spooks-watch-along-series-one-episode-two-lisa-faulkner-takes-centre-stage\">Lisa Faulkner\u2019s head going into that industrial deep-fat fryer in Spooks</a>, then Sky Atlantic\u2019s new 10-part series Gangs of London is probably not for you. It starts with a severely beaten man hanging upside-down off a building and only gets further away from Mary Poppins territory from there.</p> <p>But if you are nightmare-free, or not made peaky by the Blinders\u2019 ways with a switchblade, you are in for a treat. Even the most brutal bits look beautiful and the story whips by so fast you will barely notice, much less care, that none of it is particularly new. </p> <p>Co-written by Gareth Evans and Matt Flannery, who made their names working on Indonesian martial arts films, Gangs of London centres on the Wallaces, a family of gangsters who are the premier predators in the city\u2019s underworld. They marshal their rival gangs in a loose coalition, ensuring everyone can go about their lucrative businesses relatively unmolested.</p> <p>So, when the Wallace patriarch, Finn (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/03/colm-meaney-the-journey-martin-mcguinness-interview\">Colm Meaney</a>), is assassinated, all hell breaks loose. We know it was done by a young lad, Darren, from the Travellers\u2019 gang, but we don\u2019t know who ordered the hit. The Wallaces suspect the Albanians, as the killing took place on their turf. Everyone else suspects everyone else, but nobody is too bothered except insofar as it affects business.</p> <p>But affect business it does. The Wallace empire is nominally headed by the man who built it alongside Finn \u2013 Ed (Lucian Msamati), his best friend since their hardscrabble childhood as victims of the \u201cNo blacks, no Irish\u201d attitude that faced their families in 50s England. His attempts to keep everything on track while they find Finn\u2019s murderer are undone in an instant by Finn\u2019s hotheaded son and heir, Sean (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/01/joe-cole-actor-interview-i-was-ready-to-deliver-a-kicking\">Joe Cole</a>), who wants retribution, as soon and as bloodily as possible. He announces the end of all factions\u2019 freedom to operate until the killer is found.</p> <p>As the hunt expands, a lowly Wallace footsoldier, Elliot (a superb Sope Dirisu), seizes an opportunity to rise up the ranks. This is mostly achieved via two astonishing set pieces. First, a mass fight in a pub that looks scornfully at any other British pub brawl committed to film and says: \u201cHold my beer.\u201d It involves a glass ashtray becoming part of someone\u2019s face \u2013 before both are shattered on the edge of the bar \u2013 and a dart perforating more people more unpleasantly than you would have thought possible. Elliot barely has time to catch his breath before we are on to the second piece of impeccably choreographed carnage. This one involves a man mountain, a cleaver and no witnesses.</p> <p>Although the violence is explicit and extreme, it is not \u2013 quite \u2013 mindless. Its victims\u2019 fear is palpable. Sometimes, so is its perpetrators\u2019. It is almost a living, breathing being in some scenes, most notably in the pre-assassination of Finn and in the awful knowledge that falls on Finn\u2019s loyal henchman as Ed talks to him on the sofa towards the end of the first episode. The violence is not integral to the story \u2013 they have chosen to include it, especially in such a form \u2013 but it is not shorn of all context or consequences.</p> <p>Overall, Gangs of London promises to be a wild and wildly polished ride, even before the twist at the end of the 90-minute opener. By the end, only Elliot has been granted enough humanity to make him anything more than a chess piece in the service of the plot, but there are hints elsewhere of more fleshing-out of others to come, which should keep viewers engaged during the bits where flesh itself is not flying. Sean\u2019s weight-throwing is obviously masking some deeper doubts and insecurities; his sister Jackie is alienated from the family for reasons yet to be explored; and Ed\u2019s son Alex seems to have some secrets. The question of quite what makes a family \u2013 how strong loyalties can be without a blood tie, how weak they can be despite them \u2013 runs underneath the whole story. If it is not sacrificed to spectacle in the coming weeks, there is going to be something really good here.</p>",
  "<p>Hospitals are having to conserve life-saving dialysis fluid in the coming days because of national shortages, as it has been revealed that 28% of coronavirus patients in intensive care who need significant help to breathe also need kidney support.</p> <p>According to the Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre, more than one in four critically ill coronavirus patients on advanced respiratory support need dialysis for an average time of four days to keep them alive.</p> <p>The shortages have forced NHS England to send out emergency guidance to trusts telling them to conserve supplies and lend fluids to each other where needed.</p> <p>The guidance advises a new strategy, including limiting trusts to four days\u2019 supply and advising equipment to connect the patient to dialysis machines can be used for longer than previous guidance stated.</p> <p>The letter said: \u201cThe revised strategy should be to conserve both fluids and sets [equipment used to connect the patient to a dialysis machine] used in CVVH [a form of dialysis] and it is recommended that the following actions are taken. In contrast to previous guidance, sets should be used for 24-48 hours. If the supply of machines allows, the use of the set may continue longer up to the recommended time permitted,\u201d said James Palmer, the national medical director of specialised services at NHS England, in a letter.</p> <p>It continued: \u201cTo further conserve fluid stocks, CVVH is preferred to CVVHD [a type of dialysis that uses more fluid], but individualised case by case. During the current clinical scenario, the addition dialysis (CVVHD mode) should be rarely needed.\u201d</p> <p>Another letter said that providers should be limited to ordering four days of supply. It added: \u201cOn Monday 27 April the supply chain constraints will be reviewed so further ordering frequency can be defined aiming to move to weekly orders as soon as stocks allow.\u201d</p> <p>The letter said: \u201cWith units who have less than four days supply in stock from 22 April, based upon recent usage, should place new orders for four days clinical requirements only (Thursday 23 April through to Sunday 26 April).\u201d</p> <p>It advised trusts to work together to support each other seeking \u201ca mutual aid solution supported by the critical care and renal networks\u201d.</p> <p>It said: \u201cThe networks should actively contact all the constituent providers to identify available stock. If a network solution is determined escalation is required to the regional incident team to determine whether a cross network solution is possible.\u201d</p> <p>Dialysis is a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned.</p> <p>Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) uses fluids to draw out the byproducts of metabolism when the kidneys are failing to pass it out. Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH) uses pressure, and less fluids that CVVHD, to filter out the byproducts of metabolism. It is a temporary treatment for patients with acute renal failure who are unstable. With CVVH, a dialysis catheter is placed in one of the main veins of the body. Different forms of dialysis use differing amounts of fluids.</p> <p>A doctor who works with coronavirus patients, speaking anonymously, said: \u201cThere is clearly a concern about the nation\u2019s ability to provide renal replacement therapy during the pandemic. Renal failure is often a complicating development in patients that are critically ill. If supplies of fluid and sets run low enough, then difficult decisions will have to be made about who receives renal replacement therapy and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt seems that [the person who wrote the letter] is worried our capacity to provide renal replacement will run dry without proper management of fluids and consumables.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the issues had with covid is around the fact that more patients need support for kidneys than previously,\u201d said the vice-dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, Dr Daniele Bryden.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, in China about 15% of patients in intensive care needed kidney support and we are noticing a higher number in the UK. In London some areas are reporting 25% patients needing some degree of support with kidneys.\u201d</p> <p>Bryden said it was unclear why this was. \u201cNo one knows why that is but one thing it may be is that we are not seeing the same population being affected, we may have a higher population in the UK of more people at risk of kidney failure.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThose with high blood pressure and diabetes are more at risk of ending up in intensive care with covid \u2026 [They are] also groups of people with low level risk getting kidney issues when they become unwell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNationally we are looking to support each other and make sure kidney support is provided so we are giving it in a different way or using support from dialysis facilities in hospital or locally if you have got them.\u201d</p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThere is significant global pressure on the supplies of the particular types of renal replacement therapies being used to treat Covid-19 patients who develop kidney problems, and the NHS is working with government and our partners to ensure supplies are maintained.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>They said it could never be done, but Stanley Tucci has managed to unite that fickle, forever bickering thing called the internet, and with an act so mundane we can only marvel at his bald, bespectacled power.</p> <p>In a video he posted on Instagram on Monday, Tucci stands in his kitchen and makes his wife, Felicity, a negroni. It\u2019s a simple enough thing to do: a negroni only has three ingredients (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12519-negroni\">gin, sweet vermouth and </a><a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12519-negroni\">Campari</a>).</p> <p>Yet ever since he uploaded the video to his Instagram page, there has been an outpouring of thirstiness for Tucci from everyone, regardless of gender or sexuality (my straight, possibly Tucci-sexual self included).</p> <p>So far the video has been viewed on Twitter 5.8m times, and one of the first users to share it summed up the mood early on:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lucyj_ford/status/1252322395614064646\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">not to be horny on main but stanley tucci doing a cocktail masterclass on igtv is the most erotic thing in the world <a href=\"https://t.co/LphyhHHKS8\">pic.twitter.com/LphyhHHKS8</a></p>&mdash; lucy ford\u2077 (@lucyj_ford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucyj_ford/status/1252322395614064646?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Muna Mire, a writer and producer, also weighed in, tweeting: \u201cStanley Tucci is hot. as a lesbian I could not affirm this more deeply.\u201d</p> <p>Tucci\u2019s masterclass was also loved by BuzzFeed \u2013 a site that seems to encounter the most exciting, epic and deep experiences several times an hour. But even in their crowded field of superlative moments, the video was still \u201cthe most soothing thing [they\u2019ve] seen all day\u201d.</p> <p>Some were slightly less restrained in attesting to Tucci\u2019s broad appeal: \u201ceverybody \u2013 literally every single adult human in the world \u2013 would fuck Stanley Tucci and if they say otherwise they\u2019re lying\u2026\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennaGuillaume/status/1252555043376476160\">tweeted Jenna Guillaume</a>.

After talking to various experts (sexually frustrated quarantined people on Twitter), I\u2019ve broken it down into five areas:</p> <h2><strong>His arms</strong></h2> <p>Like Stanley Tucci, Stanley Tucci\u2019s arms are 59 years old, and you can kind of tell. They\u2019re a bit sinewy and sag <em>ever so slightly</em>, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves: they\u2019re also bulging out of his tight polo shirt. Time may be trying its hardest, but can only take its toll so much on Tucci. Let\u2019s not mince our words, they add a certain \u2026 \u201cdaddiness\u201d to him. And if I\u2019ve learned anything from the internet, people like this.</p> <h2><strong>What he says and how he says it</strong></h2> <p>As an experiment, try making a drink and describe it as you go along. As you umm and ahh, you\u2019ll begin to realize how effortlessly charming Tucci is. Nothing he\u2019s saying in the video is that interesting, but his little flourishes \u2013 warning against drinking Martini brand vermouth while wagging his finger (\u201cmhm\u201d), calling the negroni \u201cthat ubiquitous Milanese cocktail\u201d \u2013 reminds us why so many people fantasize about hanging out with famous actors. A lot of them may be terrible people, but you imagine their ability to hold an audience makes them great company.</p> <p>Tucci\u2019s tone is also incredibly calming. As my friend Mark puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s the nonchalance he has in his voice \u2013 the same quality that Jeff Goldblum has. Staying in a low register and not giving any hints that he wants your attention.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/meaganrosae/status/1253374343666708480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The arms, the hands, the timbre and direction of his voice. like that is how i want a man to talk to me in bed</p>&mdash; la lloronavirus (@meaganrosae) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meaganrosae/status/1253374343666708480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>His handling of the cocktail shaker</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s so unnecessary for Tucci to be banging his cocktail shaker down with the force that he does. But he does it anyway, only adding to the sense that his arms could squeeze all the loneliness out of you. It also adds to the sense of confidence he exudes throughout. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/zora/status/1253397916645023745\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cCompetence\u201d being projected, not objective. That actually looks like a drink I don\u2019t want. And ordinarily faux competence only enrages me.

But none of these men are the Hollywood actor, producer, writer and author of the cookbook The Tucci Table Stanley Tucci. Some have also commented on the effect that the camera angle has, which brings you into Tucci\u2019s gaze, past his usual air of unattainable stardom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/everywhereist/status/1253394144183021574\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This video is puts the viewer on a date with Stanley Tucci.

Would we find Tucci making a negroni hot if there wasn\u2019t a global pandemic? Probably, but nowhere near as much.</p> <p>The evidence for this is everywhere: people are watching more porn now that they\u2019re under quarantine, sex toy sales are soaring in some countries and some experts are even attributing a rise in lust to something called terror management theory.</p> <p>\u201cResearch has found that when we are faced with the prospect of our own mortality, this prompts sexual desire and behavior as a coping mechanism,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-myths-sex/202003/how-the-pandemic-is-changing-pornography\">writes Justin J Lehmiller</a>, a research fellow at the Kinsey Institute. \u201cTo the extent that the Covid-19 pandemic is making mortality more salient, it would make sense that you\u2019d see a rise in horniness right now, which could partly explain why more porn is being consumed.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that last part is overthinking it. But whether it\u2019s Stanley Tucci\u2019s arms, his voice, or that little thing called terror management theory, it\u2019s comforting to know there\u2019s something we can all agree on, however trivial.</p>",

French president Emmanuel Macron also threw his weight behind the idea, saying: \u201cEurope has no future if we cannot find a response to this exceptional shock.\u201d He said the scale of the crisis demanded financial transfers to the hardest-hit states, and not just loans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-delivers-a-moment-of-truth-on-the-meaning-of-the-eu\">Coronavirus delivers a 'moment of truth' on the meaning of the EU</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and other northern countries are wary of financial transfers, preferring loans. The divide between grants and loans has superseded the previous EU split between countries seeking jointly issued EU debt and those opposed \u2013 a divide that also loosely fell on north-south lines.</p> <p> The European council president, Charles Michel, who chaired the meeting, did not ask EU leaders to sign off a formal summit text, to avoid hours of rows over a single line in a document as happened at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">the previous EU virtual summit</a>.</p> <p>Von der Leyen said that \u201carguments have been exchanged tonight but in a very constructive manner\u201d. She noted: \u201cThere will certainly be a sound balance between grants and loans, and this is a matter of negotiation within the group of member states\u201d and added that both had pros and cons.</p> <p>The commission president also warned that the \u201chealth situation is not yet fully under control and many member states have not yet reached the peak\u201d. Her economic rescue plan is likely to draw on a \u20ac2 trillion proposal drafted by her officials that includes a potential \u20ac323bn recovery fund, raising funds on capital markets, and agreeing the tortured question of the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget.</p> <p>German chancellor Angela Merkel said a recovery fund was in Germany\u2019s interest, and that her country would have to make higher contributions to the EU budget. \u201cIn the spirit of solidarity, we should be prepared to make completely different, that is to say significantly higher, contributions to the European budget over a set period,\u201d Merkel told the Bundestag before the summit.</p> <p>Joining the leaders on the call was Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank, who warned leaders of the risks of doing too little too late as she forecast that eurozone output could drop by 15% in 2020 in the worst-case scenario.</p> <p>As expected, the leaders endorsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">a \u20ac540bn rescue package</a> drafted by their finance ministers earlier this month.

These leaders are ready to go to some efforts, but they have to face their own domestic problems.\u201d</p> <p>Senior politicians fear the EU\u2019s unity could fracture if the divide widens between the strongest economies and the weaker ones which have struggled to emerge from the financial crisis. \u201cThe crisis risks damaging permanently the growth potential of member states, which already face bottlenecks to growth,\u201d an internal commission paper, seen by the Guardian, states.</p> <p>Germany, which takes over the EU rotating presidency from July, is backing calls for any recovery plan to be integrated into the next EU budget.</p> <p>In a less contentious moment, EU leaders approved guidance from Brussels on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/eu-urges-caution-in-lifting-coronavirus-lockdowns\">lifting the lockdown</a>.

Some of the details include: crucial behaviours such physical distancing and hand-washing will remain essential; those most at risk will continue to be shielded; workplaces and education settings would need to be redesigned to enable proper physical distancing; restrictions could be lifted and then re-imposed at short notice; and restrictions are likely to be lifted in stages. The priority, it says, is minimising overall harm. The report earned <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> praise from the likes of <strong>George</strong> <strong>Osborne</strong>, the former Tory chancellor, who said the UK government should \u201ctreat the public like adults\u201d by adopting the same approach. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a7b32ef7-ef5f-45ef-ab0b-ba210ae4dbb2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKcS4PNAko0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-testing-to-be-offered-to-england-key-workers-and-families\">Essential workers will be able to book their own free tests online from Friday</a>, Matt Hancock announced.</strong> The health secretary said key workers will be able to go on the gov.uk website to book tests for themselves and their relatives, the whole process will be free and the results will be sent out by text. He added that anyone unable to go online can book through their employer.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK government is introducing a contact tracing app and is also recruiting 18,000 people to work on manual contact tracing.</strong> Hancock said this figure would include 3,000 clinicians and the 18,000 workers would be trained over the coming weeks. The former Tory health secretary <strong>Jeremy </strong><strong>Hunt</strong>, who has led calls for the implementation of a mass contact tracing programme, said the announcement signalled \u201ca clear exit route from the lockdown\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>48 mobile laboratories are planned to be up and running to help the testing effort by the end of the month, the lobby briefing heard.</strong> The PM\u2019s spokesman said there are four already operating as well as 28 drive-through testing centres. The plan is for this to be extended to 48 by the end of April and for each testing centre to have a mobile lab attached to it. </li> \n   <li><strong>Around a quarter of firms may have halted trading since the lockdown, findings from an ONS survey suggested.</strong> But only 0.3% said they had permanently ceased trading. Since the lockdown was announced on 23 March, 82% of firms surveyed in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector said they had temporarily stopped trading.

He said that the recruits would be trained over the coming weeks and that having a system of \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d in place would make it easier for physical distancing measures to be relaxed.

Physical distancing, hand hygiene, and other critical behaviours will be essential in each sector. We will engage with experts in each sector to understand the practical consequences, for example, of what physical distancing would mean for schools and education, transport, business, and recreation. The capacity of business and industry to innovate to find different ways to function will be critical here.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says those most at risk will continue to have to be shielded.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some form of continued shielding to protect those who are most at risk will almost certainly be required as restrictions are lifted.

It may be that restrictions on some outdoor activity are eased before those on indoor activities - however, all of this will be evidence led.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>It says restrictions could be lifted, but then re-imposed.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our plans to respond and recover must take account of the possibility of a cycle of lifting and re-imposing restrictions. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>According to some of the briefing coming out of No 10, this is one option London is particularly keen to avoid.

He said four mobile laboratories were already operating, including in Teesside, the Isle of Wight and Salford. There are 28 drive-through testing centres already open, and the government wants to extend that to 50 by the end of the month. The spokesman said the plan was for every testing centre to have a mobile laboratory attached to it. He also said that Amazon was being used to deliver testing kits to some people who needed them at home.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that there was still a \u201cgreat deal more to do\u201d on testing. </strong>The capacity for testing has reached 48,273 tests a day, he said. But the latest daily figure for the number of tests carried out (in the 24-hour period up to 9am yesterday) is 22,814 tests. The number of people tested in that period was just 13,522. (Some people need to be tested twice.) The spokesman said that 111,637 NHS and care workers and their relatives in total have been tested - up more than 10,000 on the previous day\u2019s total. The government is committed to getting the number of tests carried out up to 100,000 a day by the end of this month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed reports saying that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-test-immunity-antibodies-government-study-covid-19-matt-hancock-ons-a9479416.html\">the government is recruiting 20,000 households to take part in antibody testing</a> to establish how widespread coronavirus infection has been in the population.</strong> Eventually the study aims to cover 300,000 people over the course of year, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>No 10 played down the prospect of an early announcement about a new policy on wearing masks.</strong> The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, has finalised its latest advice, but the recommendation has only just gone to ministers and they will review it before a decision is announced. A formal announcement now seems unlikely before the end of the week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the NHS England staff absence rate linked to coronavirus was now 4.2% for doctors and 8.3% for nurses, down from 4.4% and 8.4% respectively the previous day, and 6.6% and 9.5% respectively on 4 April.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson spoke to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, yesterday, the spokesman said.</strong> And Johnson also had an audience with the Queen by telephone.

living with Covid-19, which may include cycling in and out of strict lockdown at short notice, according to a document just published by the Scottish government, which sets out its framework for progressing beyond the current lockdown restrictions.</p> \n  <p><a

26-page document (pdf) </a>summarises the Scottish government\u2019s approach as follows:</p> \n  <p><strong>Suppress</strong> the virus through compliance with physical distancing and hygiene measures, ensuring that the reproduction number remains below 1 and that the NHS remains within capacity.</p> \n  <p><strong>Care</strong> for those who need it, whether infected by the virus or not.</p> \n  <p><strong>Support</strong> people, business and organisations affected by the crisis.</p> \n  <p><strong>Recover </strong>to a new normal, carefully easing restrictions when safe to do so while maintaining necessary measures and ensuring that transmission remains controlled, supported by developments in medicine and technology.</p> \n  <p><strong>Protect </strong>against this and future pandemics, including through effective testing, contact tracing and isolation.</p> \n  <p><strong>Renew</strong> the country, building a fairer and more sustainable economy and society.</p> \n  <p>It warns the public to expect a cycle of lifting and re-imposing restrictions, with the possibility of restrictions being re-imposed quickly if transmission suddenly escalates; talks about the urgent need to redesign workplaces and education settings to allow for proper social distancing; the need for \u201cunprecedented levels of support and compliance from the whole population\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It also concludes that<strong> </strong>now is not the right time to relax restrictions, but that<strong> </strong>over the next few weeks, based on the evidence and expert advice, options will be considered that include the easing of restrictions in a phased manner, for example easing restrictions on some outdoor activity before those on indoor activities, as well as tailoring options to specific geographies and sectors, or parts of the rural economy, or those able to work outdoors.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

While opinion among experts around the world is divided, Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said there is no research to support wearing a mask if you\u2019re fit and well. </p> \n  <p>Marshall echoes the advice from the World Health Organization, which said there is little evidence that wearing a mask in the community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/face-masks-cannot-stop-healthy-people-getting-covid-19-says-who\">prevented healthy people from picking up respiratory infections</a> including Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said it would however make sense for someone to wear a mask if they are \u201ccoughing and spluttering\u201d. He added people can chose to cover their faces with a bandanna to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage) is expected to discuss the usage of masks in a meeting on Thursday. It follows a decision by all German states to make face masks compulsory when travelling on public transport and going to the shops to combat the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Marshall told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s no research evidence to support wearing masks if you are basically fit and well, indeed if people wear masks there\u2019s a risk they play around with it, they play with their eyes more and maybe you\u2019re even at a higher risk of picking up an infection.</p> \n   <p>However, it is common sense that if they are coughing and spluttering then it makes complete sense to wear masks in order to protect other people.<br></p> \n   <p>I think the guidance that we\u2019re expecting to hear is that the wearing of face masks is a voluntary activity not mandated and it certainly makes a lot of sense to focus limited resources that we have at the moment on those who have greatest need and that\u2019s the health professionals.<br></p> \n   <p>This sophisticated kit is likely to be more rigorous, more useful, but actually it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to wear a bandanna around your mouth or whatever, that will work, it won\u2019t be quite as good but it will be good enough.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/public-can-choose-scarves-instead-of-masks-say-uk-scientists\">Public can choose scarves instead of masks, say UK scientists</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin and will be manning the liveblog until Andrew and Lucy come on later this morning.

Schools in Germany are due to reopen from 4 May and Merkel and state leaders are due to meet again on 30 April to review how to proceed after that.</p> \n<p>In France, Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that a detailed plan to exit lockdown would be unveiled early next week. Pupils will return to French schools from 11 May, and the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said he hoped retailers other than restaurants, bars and cafes could reopen from the same date.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want all retail outlets to be able to open in the same way, out of fairness,\u201d said Le Maire. Bars and restaurants were unlikely to reopen before mid-June \u201cbecause they are places of mixing\u201d, he added.</p> \n<p>Retailers would need to limit the number of people in their shops at one time, Le Maire said, and the hardest-hit regions, such as eastern France and greater Paris, may have to wait longer for shops to reopen. Older people\u2019s movements may also be restricted.</p> \n<p>The public health authority chief, J\u00e9rome Salomon, said avoiding a second wave of infections remained the priority.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrance\u2019s goal is not to create collective immunity by creating a second and then a third wave,\u201d he told a parliamentary hearing. \u201cThat seems too dangerous to us.

But on Thursday it revised the date to 8 April, with 70,500 believed to have been infected.</p> \n<p>As EU leaders haggled over a rescue package that has reignited a bitter north-south divide between member states, Merkel also said Germany was ready to make \u201csignificantly higher\u201d EU budget contributions to help the bloc cope with the fallout from the pandemic.</p> \n<p>She added, however, that calls from some EU countries for common debt with common liabilities were not the way to go. \u201cThat would be a very difficult process, cost time and wouldn\u2019t even help anyone in the current situation, since we need rapid-fire instruments to tackle the crisis,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-3902MP5ItExoBXF9/\" data-alt=\"Guardian graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-3902MP5ItExoBXF9/\">Guardian graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In other developments:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Global infections passed 2.6 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with nearly 185,000 deaths.</p></li> \n <li><p>The latest US jobless figures confirmed that 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the past five weeks.</p></li> \n <li><p>The number of new coronavirus cases in Russia fell for a second day.

  "<p>Experts have voiced growing frustration over the UK government\u2019s claim that it is \u201cfollowing the science\u201d, saying the refrain is being used to abdicate responsibility for political decisions.</p> \n<p>They also raised concerns that the views of public health experts were being overlooked, with disproportionate weight given to the views of modellers.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a scientist, I hope I never again hear the phrase \u2018based on the best science and evidence\u2019 spoken by a politician,\u201d Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the Guardian. \u201cThis phrase has become basically meaningless and used to explain anything and everything.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has repeatedly said it is being \u201cled by the science\u201d on decisions ranging from banning mass gatherings to closing schools, the use of face masks and, most recently, the prospects of lifting the lockdown.</p> \n<p>However, Sridhar and others argued that scientific views on these topics could be wide-ranging and dependent on a scientist\u2019s field of expertise.</p> \n<p>The diversity of scientific views was apparent in March when case numbers were rising rapidly but the government chose not to ban mass gatherings or introduce wide-reaching physical distancing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWorld Health Organization advice, and what we\u2019ve learned from lots of previous outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries, is that the faster you move at the start, the better, because it\u2019s exponential growth,\u201d Sridhar said. \u201cIn public health, a test, trace and isolate campaign would\u2019ve been where your mind first went.\u201d</p> \n<p>Instead, she said, the government appeared to be basing policy on the presumption of a binary choice between two scenarios, played out in computer models, of either eradicating the virus or it becoming endemic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"694eca0f-6d8c-491d-b329-2be5c5bcc847\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZYXGxByRUwE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Mark Woolhouse, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said modelling had had a disproportionate influence. \u201cI do think scientific advice is driven far too much by epidemiology \u2013 and I\u2019m an epidemiologist.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re not talking about in the same formal, quantitative way are the economic costs, the social costs, the psychological costs of being under lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that the government is being advised by economists, psychiatrists and others, but we\u2019re not seeing what that science is telling them. I find that very puzzling.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woolhouse said that while it was understandable that saving lives was the top priority, the idea of doing this at any cost was naive.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith any disease there is a trade-off. Public health is largely about that trade-off. What\u2019s happening here is that both sides of the equation are so enormous and so damaging that the routine public health challenge of balancing costs and benefits is thrown into incredibly stark relief. Yet that balance has to be found.\u201d</p> \n<p>Others expressed concern about the lack of transparency around the evidence affecting decision-making. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who sits on Sage [the government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies], we see very little of the papers that go to Sage,\u201d said Prof Sheila Bird, the former programme leader of the Medical Research Council\u2019s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge. \u201cThat scientific underpinning is not evident.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sridhar said the failure to fully consider the perspectives of experts beyond epidemiology may have contributed to misguided decisions. Models appear not to have factored in the role of hospital staff shortages, which may have diverted attention from the urgent need for adequate personal protective equipment, she said.</p> \n<p>The concept of shielding the most vulnerable \u201clooks beautiful\u201d in models, she said, but in reality care homes are facing major outbreaks and multigenerational households are struggling to isolate the vulnerable. \u201cYou can\u2019t take these people out of the system and isolate them as if they were a data point on a graph,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real problem if you have a collection of people from the same background, the same field, the same institutions; that can lead to blindspots and groupthink,\u201d Sridhar added. \u201cDiversity is clearly important for better decision-making.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Some fear the prominence given to science in supporting political decisions risks burdening scientists with unrealistic expectations and could ultimately erode trust in their expertise.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government isn\u2019t using expertise simply to validate claims, it also appears to be using it as an insurance policy,\u201d Prof Christina Boswell, a political scientist at the University of Edinburgh, <a href=\"https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/covid19perspectives/2020/04/14/the-return-of-the-expert-by-professor-christina-boswell/\">wrote </a><a href=\"https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/covid19perspectives/2020/04/14/the-return-of-the-expert-by-professor-christina-boswell/\">this week</a>. \u201cIf things go wrong \u2013 and the curve gets too steep \u2013 it will be the scientific advice that is to blame.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Who\u2019s who: the experts</h2> \n<p><strong>Prof Chris Whitty: the truthteller<br></strong>Chief medical officers have a tradition of speaking their mind, often to the chagrin of governments. Whitty, however, has appeared to be in perfect harmony with the UK government at the Downing Street briefings on Covid-19. The reality is probably that ministers are in step with him \u2013 or even a step behind. On Wednesday, Whitty, a practising NHS consultant physician, told a starker truth than politicians have dared: that physial distancing needs to be in place until at least the end of the year.</p> \n<p><strong>Sir Patrick Vallance: the political naif<br></strong>Vallance has had a career in medicine at University College London and St George\u2019s, University of London, researching vascular biology and endothelial cell physiology, and also in the pharmaceutical industry. From 2012 to 2018, he was president of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, where, unusually for the industry, he advocated greater openness about innovation and partnerships with other companies.</p> \n<p>He left to become the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, but is not an instinctive politician. He was partly blamed for the government\u2019s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity, saying in March that the strategy was to reduce the peak, not suppress it completely. \u201cAlso, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease.\u201d Afterwards it was denied he meant herd immunity should be the goal; it was simply an outcome.</p> \n<p><strong>Neil Ferguson: the workaholic<br></strong>Ferguson leads the modelling behind the UK response through the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, which he founded with colleagues at Imperial College.

  "<p>The biggest assessment of global insect abundances to date shows a worrying drop of almost 25% in the last 30 years, with accelerating declines in Europe that shocked scientists.</p> <p>The analysis combined 166 long-term surveys from almost 1,700 sites and found that some species were bucking the overall downward trend. In particular, freshwater insects have been increasing by 11% each decade following action to clean up polluted rivers and lakes. However, this group represent only about 10% of insect species and do not pollinate crops.</p> <p>Researchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said.</p> <p>Insects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/human-race-just-001-of-all-life-but-has-destroyed-over-80-of-wild-mammals-study\">outweighing humanity by 17 times</a>, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon.

Its estimated rate of decline was more than double that in the new study. Other experts estimate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/13/insect-apocalypse-poses-risk-to-all-life-on-earth-conservationists-warn\">50% of insects have been lost</a> in the last 50 years.</p> <p>Recent analyses from some locations have found collapses in insect abundance, such as 75% in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers\">Germany</a> and 98% in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/insect-collapse-we-are-destroying-our-life-support-systems\">Puerto Rico</a>. The new, much broader study found a lower rate of losses. However, Roel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said: \u201cThis 24% is definitely something to be concerned about. It\u2019s a quarter less than when I was a kid. One thing people should always remember is that we really depend on insects for our food.\u201d</p> <p>The research, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aax9931\">published in the journal Science</a>, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. \u201cEurope seems to be getting worse now \u2013 that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level.</p> <p>Elsewhere, data is much more sparse. \u201cBut we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat \u2013 it is not rocket science,\u201d said van Klink. \u201cThis is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There\u2019s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don\u2019t have the data.\u201d</p> <p>Van Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. \u201cWe found that very striking and a bit shocking \u2013 it means something\u2019s going wrong there.\u201d</p> <p>Losses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows\">pesticides</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/22/light-pollution-insect-apocalypse\">light pollution</a>. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite <a href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13477\">obvious local examples</a>. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location.</p> <p>But he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/13/7271\">significantly cutting grasshopper abundances</a> on prairies in Kansas, US. \u201dThat is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: \u201cPeople should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: \u201cMany insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb6861\">comment article in Science</a>, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. \u201cEmbracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Van Klink said: \u201cWe definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.\u201d</p>",

France\u2019s Bernard Laporte, who is running for election as World Rugby\u2019s vice-chairman, has also proposed a club World Cup which would effectively kill off Europe\u2019s elite cross-border club competition, an idea later described as \u201ca misunderstanding\u201d by Bill Beaumont, World Rugby\u2019s chairman.</p> <p>European Professional Club Rugby, however, has stressed it is looking at staging the closing stages of its tournaments in mid-October on the weekends allocated for the first two rounds of the 2020-21 campaign and is calling for proper consultation with its leading officials. \u201cWe absolutely do not accept a schedule of international rugby in October,\u201d said Simon Halliday, EPCR\u2019s chairman. \u201cThat directly clashes with us and we are informing World Rugby we fully intend to use our October window if we need it. We could play our semis and finals on those two weekends or, alternatively, just use one of them for the final and try and find two other dates in August and September for the quarters and semis.\u201d</p> <p>Uncertainty clearly still surrounds the precise date when a resumption of rugby in Europe will be practicable but EPCR has strongly denied whispers from Ireland that the 2019\u201120 season might be curtailed early. \u201cWhen you have club tournaments locked into multi-year contracts with partners and broadcasters, which is the lifeblood of the game, you can\u2019t just cancel everything.

But we\u2019re all connected, we\u2019re all part of the same game. The value of our tournament, the Premiership, the Pro14 and the Top 14, collectively, is close to a billion pounds.

Shopping in physical stores, recreational activities, personal services, and a long list of other types of spending have been sharply reduced.</p> <p>As a result, the businesses that normally provide these goods and services have sharply reduced activity, or shut down entirely. Absent any policy response, most of the employees of these businesses would lose their jobs, and face a dramatic reduction in income. In contrast, those working in sectors whose output is still in demand, for example food retail and online businesses, face no reduction in income at all or even experience increased income.</p> <p>But they are still unable or unwilling to consume goods and services that require social contact, so they end up with a large involuntary increase in savings. </p> </blockquote> <p>But there is some good news....

  "<p>I have never seen my A&amp;E department so still, so well-staffed and so uncannily calm. Usually, it\u2019s a frenzy of swishing bodies as paramedics deliver new patients into a soundscape of PA announcements, bleeps and phone referrals. But this week, the \u201cshop floor\u201d, as we like to call it, is eerily quiet. Attendances in A&amp;E departments across the country are down, in some cases <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/cancer-referrals-fallen-two-thirds-18133838?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=ce19e79271-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_23_06_08&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-ce19e79271-190561903\">by up to 80%.</a></p> <p>We run simulations now, pounding down on the plastic chests of dummies, or click through e-learning modules. It feels a little like we have passed into the eye of the storm.</p> <p>There is an obvious reason for the calm: people are not out and about. Pedestrians are not walking out in front of cyclists. Cyclists are not diving over car bonnets. Asthmatics are not wheezing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/11/positively-alpine-disbelief-air-pollution-falls-lockdown-coronavirus\">through the fumes</a> of Oxford Street. But there is something more worrying at play, too \u2013 people who need us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/fears-seriously-ill-a-and-e-numbers-drop-coronavirus-nhs\">are not coming in</a>.</p> <p>In normal times, you get used to the mix of patients who flow through the swinging doors of A&amp;E. They come with problems relating to one of a few chronic diseases: diabetes, COPD or sickle cell anaemia. Then there\u2019s the elderly \u2013 falling over, forgetting, or attending with care and social needs<strong>.</strong> There are patients who have had too much, or not enough, of their legal and illegal drugs of choice. </p> <p>Then there are the more typical emergencies: wounds needing sutures, tummies needing surgeons, hearts needing cardiologists, a broad range of infections needing our drugs. A few weeks ago, a single entity displaced most of the above. A&amp;E became a subspecialty, a Covid-19 ward. Those anxious days are behind us now, but we have not seen a return to normal.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52361519\">week ending 10 April</a> there were around 18,500 deaths in England and Wales \u2013 about 8,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year. Only 6,200 of those deaths has been attributed to Covid-19. So what of the rest? Some could be due to undiagnosed infection, a theory that marries well with the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/03/why-has-the-uk-lagged-behind-in-testing-for-the-coronavirus\">Britain has failed</a> to implement widespread testing, but there are corollaries to any outbreak and we are beginning, in this tumbleweed-week, to sense their cost.</p> <p>I am worried that people who need us are not coming in, scared that hospitals are vectors for infection rather than cure. This was brought home the other day when my mum felt an intense pain in her lower leg and required my cajoling, via phone, to attend A&amp;E, where she discovered that she\u2019d snapped her achilles tendon.</p> <p>Patients are tarrying when their chest pain kicks in, when they experience a sudden facial droop, or fall, or bleed, or faint. There is little reason to believe lockdown alone is shifting the numbers; it is more likely that the small tragedies of life are still playing out, out of sight, out of mind, only breaching the surface every now and then when we squint at statistics. </p> <p>If this is the eye of the storm, the wind will pick up again soon. And then we might be dealing with a surge of patients who haven\u2019t been able to attend their GP or regular clinic in months, whose operations have been cancelled and scans delayed, whose chronic diseases have flared.</p> <p>I have sympathy with the instinct to steer clear. Despite the use of personal protective equipment, segregated wards, obsessive handwashing and the stringent infection control measures rolled out when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/18/what-is-the-superbug-la-mrsa-cc398-and-why-is-it-spreading-on-farms\">MRSA</a> was public enemy No 1, Covid-19 has been transmitted in hospital settings. Doctors are trying hard not to admit anyone without Covid-19, because our typical hospitalised patients \u2013 elderly and with overlapping disease \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to the virus.</p> <p>But we can\u2019t put our vulnerable people in germ-free bubbles. So, like much of medicine, this involves a delicate balance: we need to ensure that patients are admitted when they need to be, and at the same time we need to protect others by sending them home.</p> <p>But to do this, we need to see you first, and the balance is getting skewed before we can make such a judgment. So if you need us now, get in touch. We\u2019re here for you, waiting patiently, unrushed, game-faced. Please don\u2019t let fear turn to harm. The virus will cause enough of that as it is.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Fabes is an A&amp;E doctor and author of the forthcoming book Signs of Life: To the Ends of the Earth with a Doctor</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The public have been warned to brace themselves for another year of physical distancing measures, with the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, saying it is time to be realistic about what lies ahead.</p> \n<p>But what would a new normal of physical distancing look like?</p> \n<h2>Sector by sector</h2> \n<p>Construction and manufacturing are likely to be at the forefront of a phased return that would be based on a traffic-light system, particularly given the pressure from Conservative MPs. The government recently issued guidance saying such work could continue if done in line with physical distancing rules \u201cwherever possible\u201d.</p> \n<p>Shops could return next, subject to reduced opening hours and strict rules on customer numbers at any one time, , including DIY retailers and garden centres, plus hairdressers.</p> \n<p>In terms of non-essential services, they could be followed by restaurants and pub, though again with physical distancing on tables and a cap on customer numbers.</p> \n<p>Last to come back would be arts and culture, including cinemas and theatres, while Premier League football matches would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/football-formula-one-horse-racing-when-will-sports-fans-be-able-to-see-live-action-again\">initially be played behind closed doors</a>, perhaps with some screened on free-to-air TV. The National Theatre is hoping to reopen in July while planning for scenarios that might push it back as late as January or beyond.</p> \n<h2>The shielded</h2> \n<p> The government said in March it would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/which-conditions-mean-that-you-should-isolate-for-12-weeks\">contacting 1.5 million people</a> to tell them they should be \u201cshielding\u201d on account of being at a higher risk due to factors such as their age or underlying health conditions.</p> \n<p>That number could grow. The increase would be driven by information provided by GPs tasked with finding out more about other patients.</p> \n<p>If such groups have to confine themselves to their homes for another year, or until a vaccine is ready, then enhancements are likely to be made to processes including the employment of an army of volunteers and online delivery systems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Generational divide</h2> \n<p>One approach that has been discussed by policymakers, and proposed by researchers such as those <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/releasing_young_adults/\">at Warwick University</a>, involves a youth-first policy allowing for younger worker in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents to return to work first.</p> \n<p>While younger groups are not impervious to Covid-19, they are regarded as the most resilient. Such an approach has led some to joke there could even be a maximum drinking age in the bars that might open at the same time.</p> \n<p>By contrast, vulnerable and older people \u2013 specifically those aged above 70 \u2013 might have to remain in their homes for at least another year or until a vaccine is developed.</p> \n<h2>Back to school</h2> \n<p>While there is a case for reopening smaller schools first, one proposal is for secondary schools and above to open initially, as older students would be more likely \u2013 in theory \u2013 to abide by physical distancing and travel by themselves.

But with a week to go, the UK finds itself with capacity for 40,000 tests a day \u2013 and only half that number being carried out. It is well short of the pledge and, more importantly, if the intention is for the UK to test its way out of lockdown, it is not enough.</p> <p>If the target is missed, there is a risk that blame may be deflected on to the tens of thousands of health workers and key workers themselves. Hancock has already said that they are not turning up at the drive-through centres in the numbers expected. But in fact nurses and doctors have ended up self-isolating because of the long distances they would have to drive to get tested \u2013 and there have been stories of some being turned away when they get there.</p> <p>And as strategists and politicians start to map out the exit from lockdown, the question of resources for local public health teams that have been stripped back over a decade of austerity will become increasingly urgent. The regular \u2013 perhaps weekly \u2013 testing of those on the frontline and tracking down contacts has to be done locally. It cannot be run, as so much of the epidemic response has been, from Westminster.</p> <p>But to understand how that pledge has begun to seem so out of reach, it is essential to look at how the government\u2019s approach to it began: slowly. The UK started ramping up testing too late, having abandoned it as a core principle on 12 March, when Johnson declared the virus could no longer be contained. People with symptoms should just stay at home, he said. Only hospital patients would be tested. Thus Britain went to the back of the queue for testing kits, reagents and other commodities that the world was scrambling for.</p> <p>Testing, followed by contact tracing and quarantine, is the standard public health response to an infectious disease epidemic, supported loudly by the World Health Organization, whose director general said it should be \u201cthe backbone of the response in every country\u201d. The UK had other ideas, but as the numbers admitted to hospital rose and NHS staff began to stay at home because they or their family fell ill, the calls for testing became more vocal.</p> <p>Promises began to be made. In an odd disconnect, NHS and Public Health England had <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/nhs-to-ramp-up-coronavirus-testing-labs/\">said they intended to reach 10,000 tests a day</a> on 11 March, the day before Johnson declared the containment phase over and said people with symptoms should stay home untested. Just 1,215 people had been tested by that stage.</p> <p>The issue got hotter. On 18 March, Johnson declared the UK would do 25,000 tests a day, but did not say when. On 29 March, Hancock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1244180361371955201\">tweeted</a> that they had reached the 10,000 target and were on course for 25,000. The watchdog organisation <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-test-targets/\">Full Fact</a>, however, later said the data did not support the claim. The highest number tested in a day in England at that time had been 9,114.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e3fdcdd234514357c1d5617b6494c31de6a21c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e3fdcdd234514357c1d5617b6494c31de6a21c3/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drive-through testing facility\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Military personnel assist at Haydock Park drive-through testing facility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uk Ministry Of Defence/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 2 April, Hancock made the pledge that threatens to \u201ccome back and bite him\u201d, according to the Telegraph this week, citing \u201ca No 10 insider\u201d. They would do 25,000 tests a day by mid- to late April, and 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.</p> <p>With the prime minister in isolation in Downing Street with symptoms, and a need to quash difficult questions about why the UK lagged behind, the health secretary made some admissions.</p> <p>Unlike Germany, the UK did not have a huge diagnostics industry, he said, so had been \u201ccatching up\u201d. He acknowledged that global demand had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents. The swabs issue had been fixed but \u201cwe are still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge\u201d, he said.</p> <p>In a rare moment, he admitted that the government had not got everything right: \u201cThere will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified.\u201d But he also had a reassuringly substantial-sounding plan for what was next, from bringing in commercial partners to scaling up Britain\u2019s diagnostic capacity: the \u201cfive pillars\u201d.</p> <p>However many pillars there were, 100,000 tests a day was such a big number that it was assumed the government was including antibody tests to demonstrate people had been infected in the past, as well as the PCR swab tests for people with symptoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The government had been enthusiastic about the possibility of a fingerprick antibody test that anyone could do at home, like a pregnancy test. Johnson on 19 March said: \u201cTo give you an idea of what is coming down the track, we\u2019re in negotiations today to buy a so-called antibody test, as simple as a pregnancy test, which can tell whether you have had the disease. It\u2019s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable. Because obviously it has the potential to be a total game-changer.\u201d</p> <p>Public Health England\u2019s director of infections, Prof Sharon Peacock, elaborated on 25 March, telling the science and technology committee of MPs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days\">a simple home test would be available within days.</a></p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t to be. Oxford University scientists have been evaluating some of the 3.5m antibody tests Hancock bought from a number of companies. He had placed orders for a further 17.5m. The best of them are 70% accurate. Most are only right half the time. Having previously claimed that it had struck deals which meant no payment would be made until the tests were proven, the government is now trying to get its money back.</p> <p>So the 100,000 tests are PCR swab tests for current viral infection only, and all the stops have been pulled out to get there. On Wednesday, the Department for Health and Social Care hailed the \u201cbiggest network of diagnostic labs in British history\u201d, built in five weeks flat. Three mega-labs would process samples from 27 of the planned 50 drive-through centres. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies were lending equipment. The UK\u2019s two biggest drug companies, Astra Zeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, are collaborating on a fourth lab in Cambridge.</p> <p>And yet, only half the daily 40,000 test capacity is being used. Hancock talked of lower than expected demand and has opened the scheme to other key workers outside the NHS, including social care workers, police, prison officers, social workers and benefits staff.</p> <p>But there is a fundamental problem. Key workers don\u2019t want a long drive at the end of a gruelling shift to get tested.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from the frontline is that nurses are driving up to two hours, feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus, to testing stations, and sometimes if you haven\u2019t got an appointment you\u2019re turned away and told to come back another time,\u201d Dame Donna Kinnair, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, told the health and social care select committee.</p> <p>The British Medical association estimated on Wednesday that nearly 100,000 health workers were self-isolating because the testing sites were not easy to get to.</p> <p>Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for north-west England, said the government\u2019s battle plan against Covid-19 had been so centralised and top-down that they hadn\u2019t asked people what would work for them in their locality.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to go to them. They should be testing them as they leave work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same issue with immunisation.\u201d Offering nurses flu jabs in the hospital as they arrive or go home has successfully raised rates in the past.</p> <p>Importantly, testing is not an end in itself. When the UK attempts to lift the lockdown, testing, tracing the contacts of anyone who is positive and ensuring they isolate themselves is essential. Key workers running higher risks may have to be tested weekly. That needs to be run locally, by people who understand the community they live and work in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/testing_centres-zip/giv-3902N61Lyh8EDQEK/\" data-alt=\"map of testing sites\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/testing_centres-zip/giv-3902N61Lyh8EDQEK/\">map of testing sites</a> </figure>  <p>But regional public health teams have been decimated. Local authorities were given responsibility for public health in the Andrew Lansley reforms. Cash-strapped town halls have raided the public health budgets, which are down by at least 30%. Public health teams \u201care a shadow of what they were\u201d, said Ashton.</p> <p>In the 1970s, Liverpool had 6,000 public health staff, including community nurses, health visitors, food hygiene staff and many others. \u201cNow they\u2019d be lucky to have 30 or 40 staff,\u201d he said. \u201cBolton has got four in its public health team.\u201d</p> <p>The epidemic will not behave in the same way in every part of Britain. Once out of UK-wide lockdown, cases will flare in one region or another, and the best firefighters will be local public health teams. These are people who know their communities. It is the local teams, says Ashton, who could have made the next chapter less disastrous than the current one.</p> <p>\u201cThey are the ones that should be leading on contact tracing and testing programmes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can\u2019t be done from Whitehall.\u201d The problem is, in many cases, they barely exist.</p>",
  "<p>When Boris Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">recovering in hospital</a> after his admission to intensive care, he was advised not to work. There was no suggestion this time from No 10 that he would even be supplied with a red box. The prime minister\u2019s decision to work remotely following his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/boris-johnson-and-coronavirus-inside-story-illness\">coronavirus diagnosis</a> seemed misjudged given how he deteriorated, so there was an effort to get him to watch films rather than look at paperwork. However, he did manage to call a handful of ministers \u2013 one of whom was Matt Hancock.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/matt-hancock-dominic-raab-ppe-care-badges\">beleaguered </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/matt-hancock-dominic-raab-ppe-care-badges\">health secretary</a> has been in the news this week as a <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/is-matt-hancock-being-lined-up-as-the-government-s-fall-guy-\">potential \u201cfall guy\u201d</a> for the government over its handling of coronavirus. Among the hostile briefings, a No 10 source <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/20/matt-hancocks-pledge-test-100000-people-day-coronavirus-arbitrary/\">complained to the Telegraph</a> that Hancock\u2019s promise in a press conference earlier this month of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">100,000 tests</a> by the end of the month would \u201ccome back to bite him\u201d and suggested the figure was \u201carbitrary\u201d. Meanwhile, senior Tories are speculating that he will be moved from his brief before any public inquiry.</p> <p>While Hancock is the minister most clearly in the firing line, there has been a change over the past week. As the prime minister\u2019s health has improved, MPs and ministers have become more loose-lipped when it comes to concerns over the government strategy and lockdown \u2013 with senior Tories kicking off about the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52389967\">economic impact of lockdown</a> and a growing cabinet debate over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/20/doves-hawks-uk-covid-19-lockdown-policy\">exit strategy</a>.</p> <p>In recent weeks, there has been annoyance within the government at the 100,000 test target. When Hancock made that promise at a press conference in early April, it followed a few days of bad headlines for the government which included mixed messaging and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/01/alok-sharma-draws-the-short-straw-and-makes-an-april-fool-of-himself\">uninspiring performance</a> from the business secretary, Alok Sharma, the day before.</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s high energy performance, after which he took follow-up questions from assembled journalists for the first time, won immediate plaudits from the media. But it irked many who had been working behind the scenes and in other departments. There was a sense that the health secretary was enjoying the limelight a little too much.</p> <p>This Downing Street likes to pride itself on not dancing to the media\u2019s tune, but announcing a timelined target was seen in some quarters as an example of doing just that. Although the prime minister had previously spoken about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-testing-in-uk-timeline-of-ministers-mixed-messages\">250,000 tests</a>, he had not given the same hard deadline. While the government still believes it could reach 100,000 capacity by the end of the month, getting that many people to take the tests will be more difficult. At the moment, around half the capacity is going unused each day. And any failure on testing will be used to paint a picture of a government on the back foot over coronavirus.</p> <p>While Hancock may not be minister of the month \u2013 he\u2019s also not enemy No 1. And in the weeks ahead, No 10 and the Department of Health are likely to form an important alliance when it comes to the exit strategy. The expectation in the government is that so long as his recovery continues, it will now be the prime minister who makes the final decision on easing lockdown in a few weeks.</p> <p>When it comes to the whole cabinet \u2013 not just the four ministers (Hancock, Rishi Sunak, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove) who lead the coronavirus subcommittees \u2013 it is currently weighted in favour of a significant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/advisers-warn-over-coronavirus-lockdown-relaxation-amid-cabinet-split\">easing of lockdown measures</a> in three weeks\u2019 time.</p> <p>One of the reasons Hancock has received a hostile reception from his cabinet colleagues is that he is viewed as the chief lockdown \u201cdove\u201d of the cabinet \u2013 the minister who is the most cautious about easing any restrictions. This is in many ways natural as his brief is health \u2013 just as so-called hawk Sunak\u2019s is the economy.</p> <p>Inside the government there is frustration that the ministers not involved in the day-to-day decisions have taken to knocking those who are in the engine room. \u201cThere are two types of people during a pandemic: those who spend all their time dealing with a pandemic and those who aren\u2019t involved and spend their time complaining,\u201d says a government source.</p> <p>Hancock could soon have an important ally in the prime minister. While Johnson is not back in Downing Street, he has met with his top team and is said to be very cautious about easing the lockdown. Ministers who had thought Johnson\u2019s return would help the cause of the hawks look set to be disappointed. Although there is still an expectation of some movement, the priority is avoiding a second peak of cases.</p> <p>While Hancock looks set to have support in the coming weeks, there\u2019s another reason to expect him not to be the scapegoat in any government inquiry. Blaming a Tory minister in that forum would be an implicit acceptance that the whole strategy was flawed. \u201cIt won\u2019t be blue-on-blue,\u201d says one government figure.</p> <p>Instead, as becomes clearer with each press conference and each rebuttal, any defence will be focused on the scientific guidance. Already there are concerns among scientists that they <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-uk-scientists-human-shields\">could be in the firing line</a>. The Tories in the line of fire are more likely to be figures from the Theresa May ministry. Questions are being repeatedly asked about the lack of government preparedness for a pandemic \u2013 but much of that goes back a few years.</p> <p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",
  "<p>When the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price for May futures contracts \u2013 an agreement to buy or sell the commodity at a predetermined price at a specified future date \u2013 tumbled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">-$38 a barrel</a>, the Covid-19 economic crisis appeared to have taken a turn to the surreal. Traders, some of whom buy oil not to use but as a financial asset, were paying people to take oil from them because only a few had the capacity to take delivery in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-usa-storage/no-vacancy-main-us-oil-storage-in-cushing-is-all-booked-idUSKCN22332W\">Cushing, Oklahoma</a>, where storage space is virtually full.</p> <p>What happened in oil trading on Monday 20 April was an epiphenomenon conjured by oil as a financial commodity. Nobody thought that oil demand had permanently cratered, and indeed the WTI price for June delivery stayed just above <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52350082\">$20 a barrel</a>, as did the price of Brent crude, the benchmark for European, Middle Eastern and African oil.</p> <p>However, this does not mean there isn\u2019t trouble brewing in the oil markets, and as a result, for the rest of us. Even at the June price, the going rate is dangerously low. For the past few years, a worldwide oversupply means oil has been sold too cheaply for producers to extract oil profitably or finance petrostates, such as Saudi Arabia. This was the outcome of an overshoot in the industry as US producers sought to frack shale oil. This made up for a previous undersupply in global markets, but ensured that by 2014, the addition of shale to the conventional oil supplied by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia had produced a glut.</p> <p>When too many producers wish to sell too much oil, they engage in a destructive race to the bottom. When that price reaches a crisis point, it is in the producer states\u2019 interests to cooperate to constrain supply to force prices back up. This dynamic is what pushed Saudi Arabia and Russia to form a reluctant alliance in November 2016 in what became known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/30/russia-saudi-arabia-extend-deal-opec-oil-output\">Opec+</a>. But Saudi-Russian cooperation also allowed American shale companies to freeride on higher prices.</p> <p>After the US <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50875935\">slapped sanctions on Moscow</a> over the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline \u2013 a project that would allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/25/nord-stream-2-russian-gas-pipeline-likely-to-go-ahead-after-eu-deal\">Russia to export more gas to Germany</a> \u2013 at the end of last year, Vladimir Putin became increasingly reluctant to facilitate US freeriding by cutting Russian output.</p> <p>As Covid-19 hit and the global economy started to grind to a halt, Opec+ came apart. It seems that when Putin refused to cut production to stabilise prices, Mohammed bin Salman decided to flood the market instead to procure a bigger market share. Given<em> </em>that demand was evaporating<em>, </em>this was<em> </em>a spectacular misjudgment by the Saudi crown prince, and it caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/09/markets-plunge-crash-financial-crisis-coronavirus-ftse-italy-oil-price-dow-business-live\">share and bond markets to crash</a> during the week beginning 9 March.</p> <p>If the collapse in the May contract on 20 April was a transitory illustration of the problems in oil markets, the fact that 2022 futures prices for that day were not much above $30 emphatically does not bode well. Oil needs to be expensive enough to cover the costs of production,<strong> </strong>and in the case of American shale oil to service the debt sustaining the sector.<strong> </strong>Without higher prices there will be insufficient supply to restore growth, and oil will cause cascading defaults across credit markets that will risk another banking crisis. The Mexican state oil company, Pemex, is already reeling under a debt crisis, and the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-pemex-moody-s/moodys-says-pemex-debt-makes-it-hard-to-recover-investment-grade-idUSKBN2222KN\">this week downgraded</a> Mexico\u2019s sovereign debt because of Pemex\u2019s woes.</p> <p>The bad news for those who think the collapse in oil prices is good for the climate is that our financial markets, economies and politics are inescapably intertwined with oil, and the oil industry is in trouble. There can be no rapid transition to a green economy because there are not yet sufficient alternative energy sources to replace the volume of economic and daily activity that oil powers. It is quite possible that oil demand will not hit 100m barrels per day again for a long time, if ever. But there will be no beginning to an economic recovery from the global shutdown that does not involve consumers buying more expensive oil and oil-dependent goods. </p> <p><br>\u2022 Helen Thompson is professor of political economy at Cambridge University<br></p>",

And even the very notion of humanity is in flux thanks to the widespread creation of human-alien hybrids during the occupation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b304851e5dbd573edb2cd1a93da952f6880bdbb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b304851e5dbd573edb2cd1a93da952f6880bdbb1/86_0_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More finessed battles \u2026 XCOM Chimera Squad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More finessed battles \u2026 XCOM Chimera Squad</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: XCOM Chimera Squad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chimera Squad takes place in City 31, which is not unlike the Los Angeles depicted in 1980s sci-fi franchise Alien Nation. In an experiment in integration, humans and aliens live alongside each other \u2013 and the city\u2019s police force has to reflect the multi-species make-up of the people it\u2019s protecting. Players must command a squad of human, alien and hybrid law enforcers, harnessing their various abilities to tackle a new threat to the city\u2019s uneasy peace.</p> <p>Lizard woman Torque can lash out her tongue and yank enemies from across the map; Axiom the Muton can race up to foes and pound them into meat with his fists; and Verge, a former Thin Man (the infiltration arm of the alien\u2019s invasion force), can access enemies\u2019 minds and control them like puppets. After years of being tormented by these abilities in previous XCOM games, it\u2019s wonderfully cathartic to finally use them for yourself.</p> <p>Then again, not much else has really changed. In essence, Chimera Squad is XCOM 2 with some genetic splicing. The base building is gone, although you\u2019re still tasked with researching weaponry and training recruits in between fights, and the scope is limited to a single city rather than the whole planet. But now you have a permanent crew of unique characters, and battles are smaller and more finessed.</p> <p>Rather than attacking with your team then waiting with fingers crossed for the computer to have its go, in Chimera Squad you can see the order in which each combatant will make their move. This allows you to focus assaults on the enemy who will attack next, and even change the turn order with special moves. It\u2019s satisfying to work your way through a room, methodically picking off the most urgent threats, although it does tend to make the game a little easier than its predecessor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZnpl3hWfVM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aZnpl3hWfVM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Perhaps the most radical change is the introduction of a team of superheroes with unique abilities; battles can play out very differently accordingly to which squad members you select. The flipside is that, unlike in XCOM 2, the characters cannot die. If they bleed out, you\u2019re simply sent back to the last save. This takes away some of the tension of the previous games, all those times spent agonising over whether to press on or replay a lengthy level because one of your squad bought it at the end. Still, the little snippets of characterisation are welcome in what can be a clinical genre \u2013 although the developers could have gone further, perhaps adding crew-specific missions as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jan/14/mass-effect-2-game-review\">Mass Effect 2</a>, or something akin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/jul/25/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch\">Fire Emblem</a>\u2019s relationship building.</p> <p>XCOM: Chimera Squad is essentially the Agents of Shield to XCOM 2\u2019s Avengers. It gently plays with the formula, and tells the peripheral stories of a much wider world on a much tighter budget and with much smaller stakes. In other words, it\u2019s XCOM but chilled \u2013 and, in these desperate times, that\u2019s just fine.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has inevitably made coronavirus about immigration. \u201cIn light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252418369170501639\">Trump </a>tweeted, \u201cI will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!\u201d Nativism renders this \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d visible in the form of human beings who can be painted as a threat and blamed for our problems.</p> <p>Staff then rushed to draft an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-immigration-green-cards.html\">executive order</a> that comports with Trump\u2019s tweet. But travel bans already covered Europe and China, land borders with Mexico and Canada were mostly closed, unauthorized border crossers were automatically deported, refugee resettlement was globally suspended, and ordinary visa processing was frozen. That\u2019s on top of Trump\u2019s prior banning of people from Muslim-majority and African countries, slashing refugee admissions, and forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico. Immigration had already been all but halted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nativism has always thrived by providing visible substitutes for 'invisible enemies'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It turns out, however, that exceptions will be made for guest workers. That\u2019s because nativism have always run up against business\u2019 demand for labor. This emergency, however, could reset the contours of that debate, just as the first world war-era red scare weakened business opposition to restriction, facilitating the passage of the national origins quotas, which sharply limited immigration along brazenly racist lines from the 1920s through 1965. This is the golden age that nativists like Stephen Miller take inspiration from.</p> <p>Trump is moving to hermetically seal the country, making real the fantastic promise of his pledged \u201cimpenetrable WALL\u201d. What ordinary politics could not secure, a global pandemic has delivered: a nativist, if temporary and ad hoc, fever dream. It could get much worse, and more permanent, too.</p> <p>Coronavirus has accelerated the dynamics that enabled Trump\u2019s nativist presidency and the global rise of the far right. The countries that long benefited from global dominance have for decades failed to broadly redistribute empire\u2019s benefits to their citizens: neoliberalism decimated worker power, stagnated wages, and funeled wealth to the richest. The same geopolitics that delivered such massive wealth and power to the global north also led to the mass arrival of migrants. Without a powerful left, nativist nationalism is the interpretative frame that won out. Nativism has always thrived by providing visible substitutes for \u201cinvisible enemies,\u201d from the abstract violence of global capitalism to the US empire raging against its unexpected limits.</p> <p>Since the Clinton administration, business has been content with a bipartisan war on \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and the militarization of the border as long <em>legal</em> immigration remained untouched. While Trump has failed to secure legislative cuts to legal immigration, he has done a lot to restrict it administratively. Covid-19 provides him with incredible new opportunities. But the guest worker exemption shows that business still wields ample power in the conservative coalition, and that racist and culture war policy must bend to the profit imperative.</p> <p>Trump and his allies have celebrated the ban in the language of rightwing populism, emphasizing its purported economic benefits for working-class Americans. In court, however, the executive order will likely be defended on the same national security grounds that were successfully marshalled to defend the Muslim ban, this time under the guise of the nation\u2019s public health.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pandemic, of course, has exposed the inescapability of human sociality and proven the libertarian premise that every man is an island to be a lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic, of course, has exposed the inescapability of human sociality and proven the libertarian premise that every man is an island to be a lie. Nationalism\u2019s promise to protect Americans behind secure borders has likewise been shown to be empty: as long as coronavirus exists in one place it threatens every place. But contrary evidence has never easily demolished powerful ideologies.</p> <p>Instead, the trajectory of the pandemic will, if left unchecked, reaffirm the very status quo that is facilitating its spread. The same global inequalities that drive immigration and facilitate the xenophobic response to it could create a situation where the virus is tamed in the global north while it ravages the global south. Massive outbreaks in poor countries could then lead to this temporary shutdown in human movement transitioning into a more permanent system that locks much of the poor world behind a massive cordon sanitaire.</p> <p>If Trump\u2019s suspension of immigration survives legal challenge, creating this new multi-tiered system of travel and immigration restriction will only require that he selectively lift bans on particular countries. Declaring wealthy countries as \u201ccorona-free\u201d would provide a facially non-discriminatory public health pretext for enacting a fundamentally racist program. The only way to exit the nativist hellscape is to fight for a redistribution of the resources that the global south needs to fight the pandemic. The struggle against the xenophobic far-right is now also fundamentally a fight for a globally just response to Covid-19, including massive debt relief. The solution to a global pandemic must be global in scope. If it\u2019s not, Trump\u2019s makeshift solution will be to further split the world into pieces.</p>",
  "<p>Spain\u2019s footballers will undergo daily coronavirus tests under a protocol for a return to training La Liga hopes to set in motion from the second week of May.</p> <p>There will be three stages to training \u2013 individual, small group and full team \u2013 and the first tests are pencilled in for next Tuesday. From the second stage, squads will be obliged to live together in isolation, away from their families. A match-day protocol, first drafted in March, is being updated, with the league\u2019s president, Javier Tebas, warning clubs that fans are unlikely to be able to attend games until after Christmas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/a-player-above-millions-the-night-brazilian-ronaldo-lit-up-old-trafford\">'A player above millions of others' \u2013 the night Ronaldo lit up Old Trafford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An eight-hour meeting Tebas had with the Spanish federation president, Luis Rubiales, and the secretary of state for sport, Irene Lozano, last weekend ended with what the minister described as \u201ca commitment to restart training with a view to completing the season\u201d.</p> <p>There is recognition from all parties, though, that any return requires approval from health authorities. Fan groups are unhappy at a return behind closed doors and as yet there are no proposals to compensate them, but within the game\u2019s authorities there is a broad acceptance that it will be impossible to restart with supporters.</p> <p>The league\u2019s three scenarios for a return to competition, in line with Uefa and Europe\u2019s major leagues, plan for a restart on 28 May, 6 June or 28 June. Tebas does not want to contemplate the season being annulled, claiming the cost would be around \u20ac1bn (\u00a3870,000).</p> <p>The protocol calls for clubs to be given a month of training where possible, with two weeks of group and full-team sessions following two weeks of individual training. Some clubs are concerned about the plausibility of that plan and returning to competition without sufficient training. That process begins with a four-part protocol written by doctors from three first division clubs and reviewed by medical departments at a further four clubs across the top two divisions. The protocol was distributed to every La Liga side and discussions with medical staff began on Wednesday. It has been shared with other European leagues.</p> <p>The preliminary stage (phase one) of the protocol for the resumption of training involves at least three tests being carried out on every player before a return to activity, beginning with polymerase chain reaction and serology tests. The league hopes to carry out a first round of tests on 28 April to gain a picture of where they are and establish which players have built up an immunity to the virus. The final test of the first phase must be conducted two days before a return to activity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"613be469d3f122575ef1d9414a85b44281abe81c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/613be469d3f122575ef1d9414a85b44281abe81c/0_133_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An interior view of Real Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u ground\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The plan is to play La Liga matches behind closed doors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Naranjo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once sessions begin, up to two weeks after that first test, players will be subjected to daily serology antibody tests which the league has acquired.

Dressing rooms are not to be used and there will be a maximum of six players on any pitchand no more than 12 on site. No more than two players will be allowed in the gym and no interaction with coaching staff will be allowed.

Those groups will be split across three dressing rooms, ensuring no more than three players are together. After sessions, they will return to their rooms.</p> <p>Multiple dressing rooms, disinfected after every use, will also be used for the phase four, the final stage. At that point, teams will be able to train together for the first time with a view to a return to competition. In an ideal scenario the whole process will take a month, although there is a recognition of the fluidity of the situation.

schools\u2019 demands</a> to guarantee their funding.</p> \n  <p>Independent schools face a dropoff in enrolments as parents cut back due to hard times, and because the student census date is in August (term 3), declining enrolments will hit their government funding. </p> \n  <p>They want the census date brought forward to term 1 and payments brought forward.</p> \n  <p>Tehan said the best thing schools could do to ensure their viability is to reopen, but he also sounded open to the funding guarantee.</p> \n  <p>Asked what the federal government could do to assist, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For instance, there are payments which are made throughout the year. So we could look potentially at bringing some of those payments forward to help with cash flow. </p> \n   <p>There are regulatory things that we ask of independent schools and the Catholic schools, so the non-government sector. So some of those things we could ease the regulatory burden on. There\u2019s issues around census dates. These are all the things we said we would explore. </p> \n   <p>Some of these issues we have to talk to states and territories about and we\u2019ve begun those discussions. So we understand that these are difficult times for the non-government sector and we said we would work with them. </p> \n   <p>But we also gave a very clear message that what we wanted to see was them reopened and providing that classroom teaching to children.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T08:58:29.988Z\">at 9.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea151f98f08a1178d5b0311\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T08:35:40.161Z\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Queensland police has intercepted more than 100,000 vehicles since the border closures four weeks ago.</p> \n  <p>There\u2019s been swarms of gidgee bugs, hauls of cannabis and cross-border campfires to keep NT police and Queensland officers warm. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/QldPolice/status/1253129741739024384\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stink bugs, dodgy border pass fashion and drug busts - our officers have seen it all!

I think we were in about 24 hours before the United States, but we made the decision about the same time and it was the extraordinary discipline of our Chinese Australian community, which meant that we resisted that first wave of cases. The wave of cases that impacted Australia came from predominantly returning Australians from other parts of the world, where the virus had transmitted to out of China. <br></p> \n   <p>What\u2019s important is that we work together in a transparent way. The World Health Assembly is coming up in May. <br></p> \n   <p>There are opportunities to pursue that matter there. And that\u2019s our first port of call. I\u2019ve obviously shared my views, as has the foreign minister, with other like-minded countries, about the need for a transparent process here and for a fair dinkum look at how these rules are working. Our purpose here is just pretty simple: we\u2019d like the world to be safer when it comes to viruses. It seems like a pretty honest ambition that I\u2019m sure most people in the world would agree with. So it would be great if we could achieve that and that\u2019s the spirit in which we\u2019re pursuing this and I would hope that any other nation, be it China or anyone else, would share that objective. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T02:49:09.257Z\">at 3.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0fd468f084784dca5848f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T02:28:52.032Z\">3.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian government has hired an additional 5,000 people during the Covid-19 crisis. <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>5,000 is how many additional people have been brought into the task and that includes with service providers.

So, we just need to look at what is reasonable in the circumstance. <br></p> \n   <p>Obviously New Zealand is a very low-risk country for us given the very low numbers of cases, and people would have to go into quarantine in accordance with the state jurisdiction\u2019s Department of Health requirements so, if the Warriors were to come into NSW or Queensland they would have to go through two weeks of isolation, as would be the case for everybody else \u2026 we just need to clarify what [Palaszczuk\u2019s] position is and the position of the premiers otherwise, so there\u2019s a lot of work to do but we all want to see it up and started as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:49:54.574Z\">at 2.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0efdb8f084784dca58448\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:31:29.500Z\">2.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Well, something didn\u2019t go to plan <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jekearsley/status/1253132555030638592\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chief Medical Office Professor Brendan Murphy says authorities including NSW Health carried out a training exercise in May last year = for a cruise ship arriving into Sydney - with a pandemic on board. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@9newsaus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RubyPrincess?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RubyPrincess</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a></p>\u2014 Jonathan Kearsley (@jekearsley) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jekearsley/status/1253132555030638592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0ef278f08a1178d5b00d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:29:52.313Z\">2.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The AFL is preparing to restart its season:<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/sydney-should-be-considered-for-hub-as-afl-prepares-to-set-return-date\">Sydney 'should be considered' for hub as AFL prepares to set return date</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>There are no AFL islands being discussed, but there are hubs.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Mason Cox </strong>had a few things to say about how his homeland was handling the pandemic.

The strikes against us in this crisis go on and on. Which is what makes it all the more galling to see a resurgence in the deeply retro \u201ccan women have it all?\u201d narrative.</p> <p>One <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8234977/Desperately-happy-housewives.html\">Daily Mail article</a>, with portraits of newly WFH or furloughed women proudly wielding feather dusters and cakes, frames the lockdown as a sort of spiritual (as well as literal) homecoming for career women. Thanks to a deadly virus, we\u2019re back where we belong; pottering around in aprons and absolutely loving it. See, women <em>can\u2019t </em>have it all, this says. And they\u2019re happiest back home in their natural habitats, like those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2020/mar/31/goats-take-over-empty-welsh-streets-llandudno-coronavirus-lockdown-video\">goats</a> that took over that town in Wales. Because everyone knows a goat is at its happiest when in walking distance of a Superdrug.</p> <p>Obviously there\u2019s absolutely no shame in doing, or even enjoying, most or all of the housework. Stay-at-home mothers are some of the least appreciated, hardest-working people on earth. And anyone who disputes this has clearly never met a child. But to wrap up this en masse \u201chomecoming\u201d of women (those who don\u2019t count towards the legion of key workers, of course) in 1950s housewife faux nostalgia is unhelpful at best.</p> <p>I nearly did a spit take on reading this line from a recent <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-like-the-handmaids-tale-how-lockdown-turned-career-women-into-reluctant-stay-at-home-mums-nwwvzkckp\">piece in The Times</a> on being a woman who \u201chas it all\u201d: \u201cWhen I realised that lockdown meant that the cleaner couldn\u2019t come, it was clear I was living through a dystopian nightmare.\u201d Ironic or not (in this particular case), some of the tone deafness of the more conservative media\u2019s coverage of women and coronavirus is a lot to handle. And which one is it, then? Has Margaret Atwood\u2019s darkest work been brought to life, or are we living the domestic dream? Could it possibly be that neither is the case?</p> <p>It would be nice for the same narrative to be applied to men. Multiple articles about men swapping their suits for aprons and marigolds would, of course, be equally condescending. But at least they would be a change from the surprisingly <em>present </em>focus on what \u2013 during a global pandemic \u2013 constitutes the \u201cperfect\u201d woman.</p> <p>The fact is that, as before the Covid days, women (working or otherwise) do more housework. With the closure of schools and nurseries, that\u2019s been exacerbated to the point of a crisis in unpaid labour. This isn\u2019t cute. It\u2019s not pleasingly mid-century, it\u2019s \u2013 for countless overworked women \u2013 a living nightmare. And that\u2019s not to mention those who are self-isolating with abusive partners. Or single mothers who were already struggling before the entire world imploded.</p> <p>If we\u2019re going to look at the \u201cnature is healing\u201d-type positives to have come out of Covid-19, it\u2019s hard to argue that more work and less money is one of them. No matter how aesthetically pleasing this may be to the kind of people who feel nostalgic for blancmange and corporal punishment in schools.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of talk of \u201cachieving your full potential\u201d during lockdown, which is all the more unfair when other people get to define exactly what that full potential is. When you\u2019re trying to prioritise staying sane and alive, it would only be polite for the question of \u201ccan women have it all\u201d to get on the tube and lick a handrail.</p> <p>\u2022 Eleanor Margolis is a writer and columnist at the i and Diva magazine</p>",
  "<h2>30. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8VZe5kqEM\">The Cure</a></h2> <p>A standalone single that came out of the early sessions for the 2018 soundtrack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/31/a-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper\">A Star Is Born</a>, The Cure pinches too liberally from the tropical-tinged \u201cSpotify sound\u201d of the time, but under the twinkly synths sits a heartfelt lyric about the healing power of love. Premiered at Coachella in 2017, it was dedicated not only to her fans, but also to a close friend who had cancer.</p> <h2>29. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohs0a-QnFF4\">GUY</a></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/07/zedd-edm-dance-electronic-music\">The German EDM producer Zedd</a> helps concoct a ludicrous melange of grinding synths, house breakdowns and vaudeville on the third single from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/07/lady-gaga-artpop-review\">2013\u2019s chaotic </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/07/lady-gaga-artpop-review\">album Artpop</a>. Lyrically, Gaga explores the power moves behind specific sexual positions (GUY stands for Girl Under You), then ruins the whole thing with this clunker: \u201cLove me, love me, please retweet.\u201d</p> <h2>28. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7HvURBhMGE\">Speechless</a></h2> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/09/lady-gaga-the-fame\">2008\u2019s debut album The Fame</a> teased the idea of Gaga the megastar, 2009\u2019s eight-track spin-off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/22/lady-gaga-the-fame-monster\">The Fame Monster</a> cemented it. As its only conventional ballad, Speechless sticks out like a sore thumb. But its slurred, whiskey-soaked vocals and over-the-top 70s rock production lend it a knowingly playful edge. Also: during those early hi-NRG, hit-packed shows, it was the perfect excuse for a bar/loo break.</p> <h2>27.

What starts out as a muted piano ballad balloons into a joyous, galloping Europop stomper, complete with a central lyric about the loneliness of fame that doesn\u2019t make your eyes roll out of their sockets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29b224963e9995a71e4829ad0b59e67733dd3047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b224963e9995a71e4829ad0b59e67733dd3047/81_60_1782_2887/617.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga's famous meat dress\" width=\"617\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A different cut ...

One for the anti-pop brigade who remain unconvinced about her vocal prowess.</p> <h2>24. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyN5157_Xos\">Heavy Metal Lover</a></h2> <p>With its central synth riff and its lyrical reference in the bridge, the throbbing, horned-up Heavy Metal Lover is the cooler older sister to the eager-to-please Born This Way (from the homonymous<em><strong> </strong></em>album). \u201cI want your whiskey mouth all over my blond south,\u201d coos Gaga, before seemingly reading from a Countryfile voiceover script as she intones: \u201cDirty pony, I can\u2019t wait to hose you down.\u201d</p> <h2>23. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1XFjoddYG0\">You and I (Mark Taylor Remix)</a></h2> <p>You and I originally appeared on the setlist for the Monster Ball tour in early 2011 as a contemplative piano ballad. By the time it appeared on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/18/lady-gaga-born-this-way-review\">Born This Way</a> later that year, it had mutated into a strange hybrid of Queen (Brian May plays guitar on it) and Shania Twain (Twain\u2019s long-term collaborator and ex-husband Mutt Lange produced it), but without leaning enough into either camp. On the far superior Mark Taylor remix, the riddle is solved and Twain reigns supreme.</p> <h2>22. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_efYhYU2A\">Shallow</a></h2> <p>Sure, Bradley Cooper has a pleasant growl of a voice, but it is Gaga who takes A Star Is Born\u2019s instantly vintage-sounding dustbowl anthem and shoots a rocket up its backside. The line: \u201cI\u2019m off the deep end, watch as I dive in,\u201d is the song\u2019s devastating centrepiece, but surely the Oscar was in the bag from the moment she spectacularly shifted through the gears on those wordless moans that spawned a million memes.</p> <h2>21. Million Reasons</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPiWHR16rHI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hPiWHR16rHI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Spectacular ... watch Gaga\u2019s performance of Million Reasons at the Super Bowl in 2017.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In hindsight, Gaga had essentially auditioned for her role in A Star Is Born on Joanne, with this lovely, stripped-back ballad showcasing her more rough-hewn vocals and the idea of fighting for love against all the odds. It was propelled into the US Top 5 three months after its initial release following <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPiWHR16rHI\">her spectacular performance at </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPiWHR16rHI\">Super Bowl LI in 2017</a>.</p> <h2>20. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn599R0ZBwg\">Perfect Illusion</a></h2> <p>An emblem of how keen Gaga was to move away from her old self came early in the campaign for Joanne. Premiering its lead single, Perfect Illusion, on BBC Radio 1, she was keen to let the public know the lyrics had been crafted on an old typewriter, as if even putting pen to pad left her too open to claims of frivolity. A similar joy vacuum almost upends the song itself, but there is just enough recklessness in its heady swirl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/04/tame-impala-psychedelic-disco\">Kevin Parker</a>-assisted glam rock.</p> <h2>19. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVBsypHzF3U\">Telephone (feat Beyonc\u00e9)</a></h2> <p>Despite being one of her biggest songs, <a href=\"https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-lady-gaga/\">Gaga confessed to hating Telephone during an interview with Popjustice in 2011</a>, describing its production and mixing process as \u201cvery stressful\u201d. Originally rejected by Britney Spears (her demo leaked online in 2010), a subsequent duet between the two was then rumoured to have been curtailed by Gaga, who opted for Beyonc\u00e9 instead. Either way, the result is a turbo-charged, constantly mutating dancefloor behemoth about suffocating relationships. It has the audacity to utilise Beyonc\u00e9 sparingly and somehow get away with it.</p> <h2>18. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mB0tP1I-14\">LoveGame</a></h2> <p>The story goes that LoveGame was written in just four minutes, with Gaga buzzing from a previous night\u2019s club-based escapades. Noticing a man she fancied, she apparently marched up to him and declared: \u201cI wanna take a ride on your disco stick,\u201d a chat-up line she would later work into the track\u2019s opening couplet. </p> <h2>17. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prvNKMGKl2U\">Monster</a></h2> <p>There is more penis chat on this throbbing slab of dance-pop that delves into Gaga\u2019s relationship with sex, and bad boys in particular. As she would explore later with Born This Way\u2019s Judas, dynamics become increasingly important as the song goes on, with the zipping, chunky synths of the verses giving way to a sunburst chorus.</p> <h2>16. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pco91kroVgQ\">Applause</a></h2> <p>As Gaga\u2019s fame increased, so her worldview seemed to shrink. The lead single from Artpop focused on the not-exactly-relatable feeling of missing having thousands of people screaming for you; it was written after she was forced to cancel her Born This Way Ball stadium tour due to a hip injury. It houses one of her most uplifting choruses, with Gaga sounding delirious throughout.</p> <h2>15. Stupid Love</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6xyaeiV58\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5L6xyaeiV58?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Thundering dance-pop ... watch the video for Stupid Love.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>After the muted reaction to Joanne was followed by the huge success of A Star Is Born, many felt Gaga might persist with that more rustic, singer-songwriter fare. Thankfully, the neon-hued Stupid Love (the lead single, co-written with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/25/were-not-made-to-be-famous-max-martin-the-powerhouse-of-pure-pop\">Max Martin</a>, from the pending-but-delayed album Chromatica) is a big, dumb return to Born This Way\u2019s thundering dance-pop, complete with an exceptional pre-chorus \u2013 \u201cI freak out, freak out, freak out\u201d \u2013 perfect for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/15/from-yoga-to-crossfit-the-10-best-online-home-workouts\">cooped-up isolation workouts</a>.</p> <h2>14. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vheNbQlsyU\">Always Remember Us This Way</a></h2> <p>Gaga\u2019s finest ballad is also her character Ally\u2019s theme song in A Star Is Born. Like most of her best songs, it was written and recorded quickly, with the creases and scuffs in her vocals adding to the emotion behind the delicate pre-chorus, before she finds more solid ground on the gorgeous open road of a chorus.</p> <h2>13. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1FrqwZyKw\">Born This Way</a></h2> <p>Born This Way represented Gaga\u2019s first real misstep in the eyes of the public. There were criticisms about the gay-saviour lyrics, the use of racial stereotypes and, perhaps most crucially from a tabloid angle, the accusation it ripped off Madonna\u2019s Express Yourself. As it was cravenly written to be a plain-speaking, empowering anthem, any accusations of a lack of nuance seem to miss the point, and there is something undeniably intoxicating about that mammoth chorus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ff091eeb4f3bb9ab18d3629387e60ec0ba43c8bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff091eeb4f3bb9ab18d3629387e60ec0ba43c8bf/0_0_949_1688/562.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga performs during One World: Together At Home, the charity concert she organised that raised $127m for coronavirus relief\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isolation inspiration ... Gaga during One World: Together at Home, the charity concert she hosted that raised $127m for coronavirus relief.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images for Global Citizen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Abk1jAONjw\">Just Dance (feat Colby O\u2019Donis)</a></h2> <p>Wherefore art thou, Colby O\u2019Donis? To be fair, it could just as easily have been Gaga that time forgot, with this hedonistic debut single coming at a time when the charts were hardly lacking in dancefloor-ready pop bangers. The producer RedOne, who worked extensively on The Fame and The Fame Monster, utilises the one-finger synth figure and chunky bass that would become his trademark, while Gaga attacks the vocal with the passion of someone who realises this is her big break.</p> <h2>11. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cggNqDAtJYU\">Marry the Night</a></h2> <p>Swathes of the sprawling Born This Way album nod to religion, but on Marry the Night \u2013 which opens with a plaintive church organ before exploding into a club banger imbued with prime Whitney euphoria \u2013 Gaga sings the praises of her home town, New York, and of the courage it took not to fall into a post-fame Hollywood trap.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sNi9nIXxVo\">Schei\u00dfe</a></h2> <p>Like the majority of Born This Way, the gleefully ludicrous Schei\u00dfe was recorded on a tour bus as Gaga traversed the planet on the Fame Monster Ball tour. Inspired by a heavy night in Berlin, it sandwiches the city\u2019s techno scene between a layer of cheesy Eurohouse, complete with a pogoing synth riff and an earworm hook of garbled German.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueeLMXo8-gE\">Dance in the Dark</a></h2> <p>Originally mooted as the third single from The Fame Monster, but rejected by Gaga in favour of Alejandro, Dance in the Dark has always been a fan favourite. Opening with orgasmic moans and a stuttering vocal sample, it blossoms into a deliciously outrageous, sky-scraping chorus that pierces through the mesh of synths like a laser. Lyrically, Gaga fuses gothic imagery with the idea of physical shame during sex.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_701WL_azrY\">Sexxx Dreams</a></h2> <p>While Artpop\u2019s favoured first single Applause was about being Gaga \u2013 with the fame she had craved now a prison of sorts \u2013 the superior Sexxx Dreams celebrated nothing more than the joys of fantasising about \u201cdoing really nasty things\u201d with another person. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m telling you this, but I\u2019ve had a couple drinks and ... Oh my God!\u201d Gaga giggles halfway through, drunk on lust.</p> <h2>7. Poker Face</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bESGLojNYSo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"345\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bESGLojNYSo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Smash hit ... watch the video for Poker Face.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As if to prove her debut single, Just Dance, was no fluke, Gaga and RedOne upped the ante with its follow-up. Built around a similarly intoxicating synth riff, and an early trait of wordless, repetitive hooks, the global No 1 was inspired by Gaga\u2019s efforts to hide the fact she spent her time in bed with an ex-boyfriend fantasising about women. Suffice to say, the line: \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m bluffin\u2019 with my muffin,\u201d is not about a trip to Greggs.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Okq8xHrIZ8I\">Hair</a></h2> <p>Inspired by ludicrous heavy metal bands such as Kiss and Iron Maiden, as well as the driving rock of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/15/bruce-springsteen-where-to-start-in-his-back-catalogue\">Bruce Springsteen</a>, Hair feels like the soaring centrepiece to an imaginary, leather-clad jukebox musical. In fact, if you think of it like that, the song\u2019s central premise \u2013 that identity and self-confidence can be influenced by a haircut \u2013 feels less trite, with the song\u2019s broad strokes and naive charm creating something undeniably joyous.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wagn8Wrmzuc\">Judas</a></h2> <p>Dismissed at the time as Gaga\u2019s attempt to remake Bad Romance, Judas plays out more like that track\u2019s gloriously unhinged, turbo-charged sequel. Gaga alternates between a robotic half-rap, a strange caterwauling shriek and then, on the Steps-esque chorus, a pure pop vocal perfect for radio ubiquity. Underneath the lyrical blasphemy, RedOne cooks up an industrial-strength soup of house, pummelling electro and, at the 2min 40sec mark, the sound of a synth disintegrating punctured perfectly by a levity-inducing \u201cEww\u201d from Gaga.</p> <h2>4. Alejandro</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niqrrmev4mA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/niqrrmev4mA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Timeless ... watch the video for Alejandro.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Initially given a lukewarm reaction by US radio, Alejandro has become one of Gaga\u2019s most enduring singles. Perhaps that is down to its timeless influences, be it the lyrical references to Abba, or the way its mid-tempo BPM recalls the 90s Eurodance boom of Ace of Base, a sound that has endured thanks to Scandinavia\u2019s continued pop dominance. Gaga, occasionally testing out a dodgy Spanish accent, sings her goodbyes to a trio of no-good men with a delicious flourish.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2smz_1L2_0\">Paparazzi</a></h2> <p>While Just Dance and Poker Face were still being dismissed as flukes, this more featherlight affair, complete with a yearning chorus, showcased a different side to Gaga\u2019s artistry. It also highlighted her early obsession with every facet of being famous, with the song\u2019s central theme of struggling to balance success and love refracted through the prism of wooing the paparazzi. In an early example of her theatrical flair, she performed it at the 2009 MTV VMAs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2PJ46Uro5k\">while swinging from a chandelier covered in fake blood</a>.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeWBS0JBNzQ\">The Edge of Glory</a></h2> <p>Born This Way\u2019s third single kept things refreshingly simple. Inspired by the death of her grandfather, its uplifting central message of living in the moment is buoyed by a straightforward pop structure that never complicates the near flawless chorus. Keen to add to the song\u2019s Springsteen-esque rush, Gaga convinced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/19/clarence-clemons-obituary\">E Street Band member Clarence Clemons</a> to freestyle a sax solo.</p> <h2>1. Bad Romance</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrO4YZeyl0I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qrO4YZeyl0I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Pop perfection ... watch the video for Bad Romance.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The pop landscape into which Bad Romance was released in 2009 was overrun with buoyant, hands-in-the-air pep. Gaga had helped prop up the party on The Fame, but quickly saw an opportunity to become pop\u2019s gothic-tinged outlier, one who would actively crave an emotionally devastating bad romance, as opposed to delicately unpacking the fallout from it over a club-lite production. On Bad Romance, she stomps petulantly around RedOne\u2019s churning cacophony of ever-expanding synths, veering in and out of dangerous infatuation. It is a song built on layers and layers of undeniable hooks, from the opening \u201cOh, oh, oh\u201d to the inbuilt chant of her surname (perfect for cementing that cultural ubiquity) to the section where she sings in French for no obvious reason. Delirious, delicious pop perfection.</p>",
  "<p>The phrase Generation X, when Douglas Coupland coined it over two decades ago, was always supposed to be a placeholder, an unknown variable. We were the generation who didn\u2019t know what the terms of our generation were. Now we know. Covid-19 has solved for x. We belong to Generation Lockdown.</p> <p>As we all joked on Twitter, there was always something inevitable about our generation being asked to save the world by sitting at home watching television. Covid-19 affects everyone; it is killing older people and it is ruining the childhoods of the young. But it belongs, in a unique way, to those of us who find ourselves with young children and elderly parents. For that cohort, the feeling of being under lockdown is oddly familiar. At moments, Covid-19 feels like no more than an allegory for the condition of my generation: we have been inside, behind screens, while a global catastrophe unfolds, since our 20s.

Everyone breathes the same air. It\u2019s all the same spit. The solutions to the problems of the 21st century, like the solution to Covid-19, will come only one way: through an empowered bureaucracy informed by expertise. That\u2019s it. Nothing else will solve it. Libertarianism in the 21st century is about as relevant as geocentrism.</p> <p>In the 21st century, it is solidarity or death. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been shown. That\u2019s what Covid-19 is, a crisis of intimacy that can only be solved by solidarity. This has been, in hindsight, the task of our generation: the confrontation with crises of intimacy, the shattering of the terms of intimacy and the attempt to put them back together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-is-a-dress-rehearsal-for-what-awaits-us-if-governments-continue-to-ignore-science\">The coronavirus pandemic is as a dress rehearsal for what awaits us if governments continue to ignore science | John Hewson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The consumer culture built since the second world war exists to destroy union, to break communion, to collapse community, to eviscerate solidarity. \u201cEach in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom,\u201d is how WH Auden put it.

The fury of the millennials has been well earned: why any one of them would believe in or participate in the system as it currently exists is beyond me. Surely this catastrophe will point them towards an alternative future. One thing that has become clear in each of the crashes: the responsible suffer, the irresponsible triumph. At what point does it become beneath basic human dignity to continue to play a rigged game? Careerism is futile, yet somehow it is the only ism standing. The 60s enjoined the boomers to turn on, tune in, drop out. I don\u2019t see how younger people have any choice but an even more wholesale rejection.</p> <p>And yet this time, as desperate as it has been, has been the first time I have felt hope since I can remember. The choice of the 21st century has been clarified: how much mass death is acceptable to maintain the economic status quo? We have seen that governments can take significant interventions. We have seen that the vast majority of people are willing to go on a war footing to protect their fellow citizens in emergencies. This is a realization with profound consequences. Economic interactions are not the sum total of human society. Market fundamentalism has its limits.</p> <p>As for the Generation formerly known as X, a generation educated in radical skepticism now must find a way to collective action.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/08-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19\">The dates</a> are by now well-rehearsed. 31 December: China informs the World Health Organisation that cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause have been detected in Wuhan. 20 January: human-to-human transmission is confirmed. 24 January: scientists publish <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\">an article in the Lancet </a>noting the coronavirus\u2019s \u201cpandemic potential\u201d. 9 March: Italy imposes a national quarantine and enters lockdown. To this list of key moments, we can now add 24 March: Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\u2019s publisher announces that he has written a book about coronavirus.</p> <p>That\u2019s roughly 100 days between the outbreak of Covid-19 and \u017di\u017eek firing up the presses. It\u2019s an impressive feat, and for a prolific philosopher-provocateur known for his use of humour, feels like it was designed to be the punchline to a gag: what reproduces itself more quickly, the coronavirus or the commentary?</p> <p>But <em>Pandemic!: Covid-19 Shakes the World</em> is thin on humour. In fact, \u017di\u017eek wonders aloud whether he should exercise caution with his distinctive flights of conceptual fancy, given his \u201c(as yet) safe external position\u201d from the widespread suffering. He doesn\u2019t. Over the course of the short book, he enlists those typically \u017di\u017eekian thinkers and tactics \u2013 Hegel, Lacan, an analogy for capitalism\u2019s health derived from Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <em>Kill Bill</em> \u2013 to form 10 impressionistic chapters. Each circles a different subject, very occasionally landing on the thesis: a \u201cnew form of what was once called communism\u201d is needed to avoid this pandemic resolving into a global nightmare.</p> <p>The opening gambit is to use Jesus Christ\u2019s injunction on resurrection to Mary \u2013 \u201cTouch me not\u201d \u2013 to explain how social distancing can underwrite solidarity. \u017di\u017eek describes himself as a \u201cChristian atheist\u201d, so it\u2019s not a surprising start and is also a little too neat. An odd chapter on \u201cPutogan\u201d, a portmanteau of Russia and Turkey\u2019s leaders, allows him to write about the refugee crisis, oddly implying that it is the main challenge facing European \u201coperational unity\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cPolitical correctness\u201d, one of the philosopher\u2019s bugbears, is mentioned twice. It\u2019s hard to shake off a sense that \u017di\u017eek, with the speed and efficiency of a just-in-time production line, has simply corralled events into a shape that fits his pre-existing interests and logical operations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u017di\u017eek powerfully makes the point that the moral task during this pandemic is to alleviate suffering, not to 'economise'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is nothing inherently wrong with that. But what in the book works? There is a nice passage that counters the view that humanity is being \u201cpunished\u201d by this epidemic for exploiting the natural world. \u017di\u017eek thinks that such arguments have a reassuring function, since they assume that humans \u201cmatter in some profound way\u201d; the really difficult thing to accept is that this \u201cstupid self-replicating mechanism\u201d, as he describes the virus, \u201chides no deeper meaning\u201d. He is at his most powerful \u2013 useful, even \u2013 when simply pointing out that the moral task during this pandemic is to alleviate suffering, not to \u201ceconomise\u201d. There is something profoundly radical in the way states have adhered to this anti-economistic logic by locking down, and the temptation to return to \u201cnormal\u201d at the expense of the sick must be resisted.</p> <p>That said, \u017di\u017eek has an inner liberal that stops him from praising China\u2019s leaders \u2013 pioneers of the lockdown \u2013 for their handling of the crisis. He endorses journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\">Verna Yu</a>\u2019s comment that \u201cif China valued free speech, there would be no coronavirus crisis\u201d, in reference to the muzzling of whistleblowers. This disguises an inconvenient truth: as the months pass, China will likely emerge as the most effective superpower at dealing with the pandemic; the comparison with the poorly organised systems centred in Washington and Brussels is already stark. A crisis of legitimacy will follow and in anticipation of this \u2013 to find a way out of the binary between an incompetent western barbarism and ruthlessly efficient eastern totalitarianism \u2013 \u017di\u017eek plumbs the present to find the unfolding of a latent \u201ccommunism\u201d.</p> <p>When \u017di\u017eek uses the term \u201ccommunism\u201d he is not talking about the \u201cold-style\u201d states of the 20th century, he tells us, but the necessity for a \u201cglobal organisation that can control and regulate the economy as well as limit the sovereignty of nation states when needed\u201d, and a coordinated shift away from the market. He sees stirrings of this in the massive mobilisation of state resources to pay private sector wages, nationalise services and direct industrial production.</p> <p>When Donald Trump is issuing cheques to millions of Americans, and a Conservative British government is effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/29/northern-rail-franchise-to-be-renationalised\">nationalising the railways</a>, old orthodoxies melt into air. And what further encourages \u017di\u017eek is that this newfound solidarity is not based on leftwing idealistic sloganeering, but bare necessity. In Israel, the prime minister Benjamin<strong> </strong>Netanyahu \u201cimmediately offered help and coordination to the Palestinian authorities\u201d to fight coronavirus because, as \u017di\u017eek puts it, \u201cif one group is affected, the other will inevitably also suffer\u201d. Communism is the translation of this epidemiological reality into a durable politics.</p> <p>Though this is interesting, it\u2019s an image of communism that lacks a central scene: the fate of the working class. In the global south, where most of the world\u2019s labourers live, millions find themselves desperate and immediately without income. In countries where there are fewer ventilators than cabinet members, where social distancing in crowded slums is impossible, where debt repayments to western creditors are set to rise, where there are no powerful central banks to issue bonds that investors will trust, \u017di\u017eek\u2019s \u201ccommunism\u201d means little. And contrary to his sketch of the situation in Israel, reports show Palestinians are worried about coronavirus overwhelming the West Bank after one sick labourer was \u201cunceremoniously dumped\u201d at the border by Israeli police. Israel has also linked the political conditions of returning captured soldiers to any future coronavirus-aid to Gaza, Reuters reports. It turns out the logic of domination trumps even the rationalism of \u201cbiological\u201d solidarity.</p> <p>\u017di\u017eek has spent his career writing in anticipation of a world-historic moment like the coronavirus pandemic, a truly totalising event that would allow the Hegelian philosopher \u2013 Hegel\u2019s being a totalising philosophy \u2013 to deploy his skills on the frontline. But this first attempt from our philosophical key-worker is forgettable. It\u2019s frustrating, because there are moments when his analysis would be clearly useful, as when he asks: \u201cWhere does data end and ideology begin?\u201d It\u2019s a vital question as we spend our days glued to fatality graphs, but he doesn\u2019t answer it. That, as he argues, \u201cthe virus hides no deeper meaning\u201d must be a chilling prospect indeed.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Pandemic!: Covid-19 Shakes the World by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek is published by OR Books and is available from <a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/\">www.orbooks.com</a></em></p>",

  "<p>The dread that many people are feeling these days about the coronavirus is nothing new to those acquainted with climate grief. As terrible as the virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century. In the face of so much loss, grief is understandable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\" data-alt=\"box\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\">box</a> </figure>  <p>In his bestselling book How to Change Your Mind, journalist Michael Pollan reports that 80% of terminally ill patients in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and New York universities felt less anxiety and depression after taking psychedelic drugs. Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for the Nation and author of HOT: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth, interviewed Pollan about whether those same drugs might also benefit people struggling not with their own death as much as the death of loved ones, future generations, and civilization as we know it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <p><strong>MH: Let\u2019s be clear </strong><strong>\u2013 in those clinical trials, terminally ill patients took psychedelic drugs under close medical supervision, right? But the results sound remarkable</strong></p> <p>MP: Yes. Most of them had remarkable journeys that reset their thinking about death in many ways, removing their fear completely. And in most cases their depressions lifted.</p> <p><strong>MH: Do those experiences and your other research suggest that psychedelic drugs can be an antidote to climate grief?</strong></p> <p>MP: The first person I talked to about this was Rachael Petersen, an environmentalist. She worked at the World Resources Institute developing software that allows you to watch fires around the world in real time to see whether deals to protect lands, specifically in the Amazon, were being honored or not. This was incredibly depressing work. She watched the Earth burn in real time and as a result entered into a serious depression. She received psychedelic therapy, and while it was not a panacea she felt it helped her, allowed her to reset and continue to do this difficult work.</p> <p><strong>MH: How did that reset happen?</strong></p> <p>MP: I can\u2019t speak for her, but one of the things psychedelics can do is [help] people find more hope in their circumstances. After these experiences, they tend to feel less isolated and more connected \u2013 more connected to other people, to the community, and to nature. It made her realize that there were a cohort of people like herself who\u2019d been working on this issue a long time. They\u2019ve seen us go backwards under the Trump administration, and they\u2019re incredibly discouraged to the point of despair. To call it an antidote is perhaps a bit strong, but having an experience like this may help them deal with their depression.</p> <p><strong>MH: If \u2018</strong><strong>antidote</strong><strong>\u2019 is too strong, would \u2018</strong><strong>treatment</strong><strong>\u2019 be a better word?</strong></p> <p>MP: Yeah, I think it is a potential treatment. Does it fix the environmental crisis? No. But keeping these people mentally healthy is very important to all of us. This could shift their thinking in ways that allow them to go on doing really hard work that they might otherwise give up in despair. I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment.</p> <p><strong>MH: But climate grief is different in important ways from an individual facing a terminal diagnosis. Climate grief is not necessarily about your own death but more about the death of the world around you</strong><strong> \u2013 a kind of collective, civilizational death</strong></p> <p>MP: Yeah, and here\u2019s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist!</p> <p><strong>MH: Are psychedelics relevant to climate grief in any other ways?</strong></p> <p>MP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called \u201cnature connectedness\u201d \u2013 the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of \u201cnature connectedness\u201d went up consistently and fairly dramatically.</p> <p>This rings true to me and to many of the people I\u2019ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there\u2019s a single subject \u2013 you \u2013 while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis \u2013 our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has \u2013 at least theoretically \u2013 the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that.</p> <p><strong>MH: You\u2019re a parent. I\u2019m a parent; my daughter just turned 15. A big part of my climate grief relates to the future she\u2019s going to inherit. And not just her but the countless other kids around the world in her generation. Can psychedelics be helpful to parents dealing with climate grief?</strong></p> <p>MP: I think potentially [it can], to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There\u2019s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there\u2019s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill.</p> <p><strong>MH: I\u2019ve covered climate change as a journalist for 30 years, and when people ask, I always say that the only solution to climate grief for me is taking action </strong><strong>\u2013 doing something to make me feel I\u2019m having an effect on this. Taking action is clearly a climate solution. Are psychedelic drugs, in a different way, also a climate solution?</strong></p> <p>MP: No, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices \u2013 giving up meat, for example \u2013 is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics \u2026 But what\u2019s exciting and new is that we\u2019re coming to recognize psychedelics\u2019 therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This story originally appeared in </em><em><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/\">the Nation</a> and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to strengthening coverage of the climate story</em></p></li> </ul>",

The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said we must learn from this pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are risks with wildlife wet markets and they could be as big a risk to our agricultural industries as they can be to public health, so we have to understand them better.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\"><strong>Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</strong></a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Fourth Newmarch resident dies</h2> \n<p>The operator of the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney, Anglicare, says the 79-year-old resident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/fourth-person-dies-at-coronavirus-stricken-newmarch-house-aged-care-home-in-sydney\">had tested positive for Covid-19</a> and died very early this morning.

The company has 150,000 employees across offices in more than 100 countries, and is still focused on developing the software and consumer electronics that made them a household name \u2013 Windows, PCs, Xbox. But after a temporary slump following their heyday in the 1990s, they have also once again become innovators, developing world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing products.</p> <p>The company hopes to bring that innovative approach to its climate policies, in part by widening how it calculates its carbon footprint, beyond most corporate responsibility plans. Historically, Microsoft has only counted those emissions that fall within the scope of their own business operations \u2013 employee travel, company vehicles, heat and electricity in company buildings, and so on.</p> <p>From now on, it plans to take responsibility for the emissions produced by its entire supply chain, including the full lifespan of the products it makes and the electricity that customers may consume when using its products.</p> <p>Meanwhile, increasing the scrutiny on Microsoft\u2019s plan are its dealings with fossil fuel companies, which have been highlighted by some as evidence of hypocrisy as it makes climate pledges. In 2019 alone, the technology company had entered into long-term partnerships with three major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, that will be using Microsoft\u2019s technology to expand oil production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The staggering amount of carbon this would release into the atmosphere would not be included on Microsoft\u2019s expanded carbon ledger.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps</p> <footer> <cite>Klaus Lackner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Microsoft, however, partnering with oil companies is not considered hypocritical. The company is hedging its climate bets on carbon capture and removal technologies that they believe will be able to offset some of the environmental harm caused by fossil fuels during the transition to a more sustainable future, despite such technologies being still in their nascent stages and not yet proven to work at scale.</p> <p>Those who devised the plan at Microsoft argue that they are responding directly to a new reality: cutting emissions is not enough and all routes to non-catastrophic temperature increase will also require removing carbon from the atmosphere. So, as well as shifting to a 100% supply of renewable energy for all of their data centers, buildings and campuses by 2025, Microsoft outlines a number of carbon reduction methods it is backing to try and hit its bold targets.</p> <h2> Protecting forests</h2> <p>To begin, Microsoft will focus on protecting forests and planting trees to capture carbon. This strategy has long been used to offset emissions, but Microsoft is hoping to improve their outcomes by <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2020/02/success-of-microsofts-moonshot-climate-pledge-hinges-on-forest-conservation/\">using</a> remote-sensing technology to accurately estimate the carbon storage potential of forests to ensure no major deforestation is occurring in their allotments. To achieve these goals, Microsoft will be partnering with Pachama, a Silicon Valley startup that will survey 60,000 hectares of rainforest in the Amazon, plus an additional 20,000 hectares across north-eastern states of the US for the company.</p> <p>According to Kelsey Perlman, a climate campaigner at the forest conservation NGO Fern, Microsoft\u2019s commitment to hi-tech reforestation is encouraging, but she stressed that conservation is a complex, multifaceted process that goes beyond technical issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about how much carbon a forest can hold but also who traditionally uses the forest, how they might be kept out, and how biodiversity will be prioritized,\u201d she said. </p> <h2><strong>Biomass energy carbon capture storage</strong></h2> <p>Microsoft will initially focus on nature-based solutions to reduce their carbon footprint over the next five or so years. But in order to start drawing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit by 2030, it will need to shift to technology-based solutions that can scale up and accelerate carbon removal.</p> <p>To this end, Microsoft is betting on biomass energy carbon capture storage, otherwise known as BECCS, to transform how energy is generated. Instead of burning coal, a BECCS power plant burns biomass, like wood chips. The carbon produced when burning the biomass is captured before it is released into the atmosphere and then injected at a very high pressure into rock formations deep underground. Not only does this remove carbon from the natural cycle, the biomass absorbs CO2 as it grows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3f6d5a064586118c5e3f528202af7efa4cdf4ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3f6d5a064586118c5e3f528202af7efa4cdf4ae/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of Microsoft\u2019s ambitious carbon removal project is the usage of bioenergy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Greg Betza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A world powered by biofuel, however, raises two looming questions. First, scientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral.</p> <p>The second concern is that the transition from coal to biofuel would require setting aside vast tracts of arable land \u2013 some <a href=\"https://www.fern.org/fileadmin/uploads/fern/Documents/Fern%20BECCS%20briefing_0.pdf\">estimates</a> say one to two times the size of India. According to climate campaigner Perlman this would mean that the energy industry would probably have to compete with food production in a world where 10 billion people will need to be fed, while vastly enlarging industrialized plantations and reducing biodiversity. \u201cWe would likely see massive land use change and massive private purchases of land, the knock on impacts of which could be quite dangerous,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Direct air capture</h2> <p>Perhaps the most futuristic of the technologies outlined in Microsoft\u2019s carbon negative plan is <a href=\"https://carbonengineering.com/our-technology/\">direct </a><a href=\"https://carbonengineering.com/our-technology/\">air </a><a href=\"https://carbonengineering.com/our-technology/\">capture</a> (DAC). This involves machines that essentially function like highly efficient artificial trees, drawing existing carbon out of the air and transforming it into non-harmful carbon-based solids or gasses.</p> <p>While the image of air-conditioner-like machines sucking carbon out of the air is captivating, capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/14/17445622/direct-air-capture-air-to-fuels-carbon-dioxide-engineering\">requires</a> a lot of energy and is very expensive. In 2011, extracting carbon from the air cost $600 a ton of CO2. In 2018, estimates <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611369/maybe-we-can-afford-to-suck-cosub2sub-out-of-the-sky-after-all/\">brought</a> this down to anywhere between $94 to $232 a ton. But given that Microsoft expects to emit 16m metric tons of carbon this year, if they were to reach carbon zero using only DAC, their bill might cost as much as $3.5bn.</p> <p>According to Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, a large part of the reason why carbon removal remains so expensive is because the markets around these technologies are still immature. The company\u2019s strategy over the coming decades is maturing these markets through intensive and directed investment. \u201cWe\u2019re making a bet on certain technologies that don\u2019t exist at the scale or price point we need them to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we want to get them, we need to start investing.\u201d</p> <p>The company, he said, already has a model for raising funds internally to support climate innovation. In July 2012, Microsoft became one of the first companies to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/microsoft-internal-carbon-fee\">institute</a> an internal carbon price, charging different divisions in the business $15 a metric ton of carbon emitted. The funds raised were then used to pay for sustainability improvements, which helped the company achieve their goal of going carbon neutral.</p> <p>Previously, this carbon price only extended over emissions Microsoft was directly responsible for. According to their new plan, in July this year Microsoft will extend this internal carbon price over emissions produced across direct and indirect emissions. The increased revenue raised from the expanded internal carbon tax, along with a $1bn climate innovation fund, will be used to invest in capture and removal technology. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is put this money in the market in a way that is highly additional,\u201d Joppa said. \u201cThis is how we\u2019re going to get nature-based solutions and tech solutions at a price point and scale we need.\u201d</p> <p> Microsoft\u2019s plan for intensive investment in this industry is exciting for those working in the field. Klaus Lackner, a theoretical physicist working on DAC, has been arguing since the 1990s that carbon removal is the only feasible way to stop significant temperature rises. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that this method is technologically feasible, but nobody has wanted them,\u201d he said. \u201cMicrosoft have said \u2018we get it\u2019. It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps.\u201d</p> <p>While the technologies that Microsoft are betting on are still in their nascent stages, in the past few years there has been some encouraging progress in the negative emissions industry. Lackner and Arizona State University recently signed a deal with Silicon Kingdom, an Irish-based company, to manufacture his carbon-suck machines. The plan is to install them on wind and solar farms, and then sell the captured carbon to beverage companies to make carbonated drinks. In the UK, Drax power plant, which was once among Europe\u2019s most polluting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/27/drax-power-plant-to-stop-burning-coal-with-loss-of-230-jobs\">has transitioned from coal to biomass</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb96c0a51634dfb16569ce05d2e35c6952d0c53c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb96c0a51634dfb16569ce05d2e35c6952d0c53c/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of Microsoft\u2019s carbon removal strategy is to store carbon underground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of Microsoft\u2019s carbon removal strategy is to store carbon underground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Greg Betza/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But many attempts at scaling carbon negative projects have also failed. The Kemper Project in Mississippi, which was billed as America\u2019s flagship carbon capture project, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/clean-coal-america-kemper-power-plant\">abandoned</a> in 2017 \u2013 it was $5bn over budget, three years late and still not operational.</p> <h2><strong>Moral hazard</strong></h2> <p>Given the not insignificant risk of failure, some <a href=\"http://smartstones.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kevin-Anderson-2016.10.13-the-Trouble-with-Negative-Emissions-Science-2016.pdf\">propose</a> that relying on nascent or future technology as a solution to the climate crisis represents a moral hazard \u2013 the promise of carbon removal functions as an incentive for governments and major polluters to not change their behavior now.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s extremely hard to lead if there\u2019s no one there to follow</p> <footer> <cite>Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to Chris Adams, a tech worker who organizes an <a href=\"http://climateaction.tech/\">online community</a> of technology professionals agitating for climate action from within the industry, the fact that Microsoft is still partnering with big oil companies demonstrates the moral hazard in action. \u201cThey are protecting the fossil fuel industry from changing while the rest of the world will pay most from this gamble if it fails in the long term,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Adams added that many of the encouraging ideas around carbon reduction in Microsoft\u2019s plan have come from internal organizing from concerned employees, but that this mostly goes unacknowledged in Microsoft\u2019s official vision. Emphasizing future technology while overlooking activism in the present, Adams said, represents a certain way of approaching problems that is typical of technology companies. \u201cIf you have spent the last 10 years amassing influence by approaching most problems with technology it\u2019s understandable you see all problems through this lens, particularly if you don\u2019t have to have conversations about power,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When asked about this concern by the Guardian, Microsoft\u2019s Joppa responded that in the short term, the energy demands of a growing global population will probably still need a mix of renewable and traditional energy sources. By remaining in discourse with these industries, he said, Microsoft hopes to help them change and transition to a better model in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to lead if there\u2019s no one there to follow,\u201d he added.</p> <p>As to whether the technology outlined in their plan will scale, he said there is inherent risk, but this is why they call it a \u201cmoonshot\u201d. \u201cWhen it comes to our plan it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got it all figured out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to do what the science says the whole world needs to do. There\u2019s really no other choice.\u201d</p> <p><em>This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

What if James Cameron\u2019s film is stranger, wilder or just plain different from my complacent mental image? One great thing about life is its habit of confounding expectations.

More beautiful and fine-grained, more vivid and exciting. What if Titanic is like Madrid?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/23/titanic-favorite-best-picture-oscar-winner\">My favorite best picture Oscar winner: Titanic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1997, Titanic was all but inescapable. It cleaned up at the Oscars. It earned a billion dollars at the global box office. At that time, I was writing a weekly film review column and going to screenings pretty much every night and yet still somehow conspired to avoid the biggest film of them all. Heaven knows why. I hope I wasn\u2019t dumb enough to frame this dereliction of duty as some kind of principled stance. That would be insufferably snobbish and wilfully perverse, like a music critic bragging that they\u2019ve never listened to the Beatles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LOrwvyQey8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LOrwvyQey8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And so, very belatedly, I sit down and watch Titanic, in which the young Kate Winslet is swept off her feet by the young Leonardo DiCaprio and an extra in the crow\u2019s nest shouts \u201cIceberg straight ahead!\u201d, and God almighty, maybe I <em>have</em> seen it before because it\u2019s pretty much exactly as I thought it would be. \u201cTo hardly know it is to know it well,\u201d as Cary Grant nearly said in The Philadelphia Story. It\u2019s not just the foreknowledge that the ship will sink. It\u2019s knowing most of the beats that lead up to the sinking. Titanic moves forward as if on tramlines, helpfully indicating every twist and turn in advance. It transpires that what Rose actually says is: \u201cJack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls\u201d \u2013 but this is the film\u2019s biggest rabbit-from-the-hat surprise.</p> <p>So OK, Titanic is not the Beatles. It runs wide but not deep and has left virtually no cultural footprint. But nor is it Madrid, because there is never any danger of us becoming interestingly lost and discovering some side-street or subtext that the other tourists have missed. If anything, Titanic is Essen, a city in the industrial heartland of Germany which \u2013 inasmuch as I\u2019d ever thought about it at all \u2013 turns out to be pretty much as one would expect it to be. It\u2019s functional, accommodating and entirely built for purpose. In one early scene, a posh lady stands on the quay and says, \u201cSo this is the ship they say is unsinkable.\u201d The dialogue hardly gets any less stiff and formal from there.</p> <p>In the real world, people are strange and confusing. In Titanic they\u2019re not. The good people are the poor ones who appreciate painting and dancing. The bad people are the rich ones who disapprove of Picasso and have never heard of Freud. As with many inherently conservative films, it likes to think of itself as siding with the radicals and underdogs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d34a86894a88c91fd49c1e370db06593a5cab8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d34a86894a88c91fd49c1e370db06593a5cab8d/0_37_3004_1803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gloria Stuart in Titanic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just another goodie ...

Here, she plays the older version of Rose, who is being interviewed on camera by a bunch of marine explorers. The woman holds her audience spellbound with a tale of forbidden love below deck. She says things like, \u201cIt was the most erotic moment of my life,\u201d and asks with a twinkle, \u201cYou mean, did we do it?\u201d Midway through the film, I half-hoped that old Rose would eventually be unmasked as a charlatan or a fantasist, spinning lurid tales of servant sex. But no \u2013 it turns out she\u2019s another goodie after all.</p> <p>For all that, I didn\u2019t dislike Titanic. The director David Fincher once said that there are films and there are movies and that these should never be confused, because measuring them by the same criteria is like comparing apples with oranges. Titanic, perhaps, is the movie-est movie of the lot \u2013 a delivery system for broad emotions and enormous set-pieces and as distinct from the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/dec/22/news.obituaries\">Robert Bresson</a> as it is from an elk, a pen or a thong. Cameron\u2019s handling is commanding and professional. He effectively grabs your head in order to direct your gaze this way and that, like a brutish schoolmaster manhandling a daydreaming pupil. But he\u2019s also smart enough to allow just one rogue element \u2013 and it is this that makes all the difference.</p> <p>Playing the role of Jack Dawson, Titanic\u2019s emblem of youthful promise, DiCaprio looks as though he\u2019s dropped in from a completely different movie \u2013 or more likely a different film. DiCaprio (22 years old at the time of shooting) is loose and limber where the other players are stolid. Even during the non-dancing scenes, he moves with the lightest of steps through Cameron\u2019s world of waxwork dummies, as though recognising them all for the cheap impostors that they are. The actor is better than this material, geared for better things. But he\u2019s exploring and experimenting; happy to stretch his muscles and find his range. He\u2019s like a brilliant tour guide, at once respectful and irreverent, strolling back and forth around Essen and making it feel like Madrid.</p>",

I turn to the left and see families with picnics and beach umbrellas and bright swimsuits. As soon as I turn right, a huge wave lifts me up. I look down and can see the ocean floor with big starfish and colorful rocks, but they are cartoonish, like the ones in SpongeBob SquarePants.</p> <p>A bunch of beach chairs cartwheel over me; they hit me on the head. I\u2019m not scared or bothered by any of this. The wave sets me back down, and it\u2019s as if no one else on the beach even saw it. The people I was walking with are having a picnic. I join them. I look out at the lifeguard on his tower in the middle of the ocean. He is dressed as a carnival barker.</p> <h2>Mila, 13, Canada</h2> <p>We were notified that there was a tsunami coming, but we weren\u2019t really sure. Then we saw the horror scene of the water drawing back, and that\u2019s when we ran.</p> <p>At first, the water was really dark and the sky was gloomy. We were running away from the water to try and get off the ground. One person got caught up and was washed away.</p> <p>I was trying to climb up this sand hill and there were these dead trees I was trying to grab to hoist myself up. I made progress until two-thirds of the way, and then it became really step and I couldn\u2019t get the rest of the way up, as the sand was just falling out beneath my feet.</p> <p>This blonde guy got up and reached his arm out to me. Before I took his hand, I looked down and I could see the water rushing between this sand hill and another mountain. It was really blue-green, tropical, a postcard kind of blue.</p> <h2><strong>Anna Swartz, </strong>Massachusetts</h2> <p>I was on my way to work and I had stopped at something like a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, only I had invented it in my mind; one of those places that only exists in a dream but feels very real.</p> <p>I was up at the counter and was ordering 30 egg sandwiches \u2013 round little circles of egg on English muffins. I was going to bring them into work to surprise all my co-workers (I don\u2019t even have 30 people on my team at work, but in my dream it was the right number).</p> <p>I was up at the counter making my order when I suddenly remembered there was a global pandemic and that I shouldn\u2019t even be going to work! I left the sandwiches at the counter and rushed back home.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>1) Cincinnati Bengals</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-burrow?id=32194255-5267-9731-81c8-48673dcec5e2\">Joe Burrow, quarterback, LSU</a>.</strong> The Bengals have to take Burrow. He has the potential to lead them for the next 15 years and to finally get Cincinnati that playoff win Andy Dalton failed to provide. Burrow excelled in his final year at LSU leading the Tigers to an undefeated college championship. Burrow completed 76.3% of his passes for 5,671 yards, 60 touchdowns and six interceptions. Free agency showed a new era may be dawning in Cincinnati and Burrow is the man to make it concrete.</p> <h2><strong>2) Washington</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1ybSN9WWQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vj1ybSN9WWQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chase-young?id=3219594f-5514-6550-d662-263c81d981b1\">Chase Young, edge rusher, Ohio State</a>.</strong> Washington have a no-brainer of their own in Young. Ron Rivera can build a strong defensive identity with a player following in the footsteps of premium Ohio State edge defenders, Joey and Nick Bosa. A 6ft 5in wrecking-ball whose tremendous speed off the line allowed him to rack up 16.5 sacks, 21.5 tackles for a loss and seven forced fumbles across 12 games in 2019. Tua Tagovailoa could be an upgrade on Dwayne Haskins but the inability to assess the quarterback\u2019s fitness up close makes Young the sensible pick.</p> <h2><strong>3) Detroit Lions</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeffrey-okudah?id=32194f4b-5519-2813-7f59-b79efab52dd1\">Jeffrey Okudah, cornerback, Ohio State</a>.</strong> The Lions need a replacement for Darius Slay after trading him to Philadelphia. Okudah can slip straight into Slay\u2019s role as Detroit\u2019s leader in the backfield and make an impact as the best shutdown corner entering the league.</p> <h2><strong>4) New York Giants</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jedrick-wills?id=32195749-4c62-6320-8b63-20c37d057bf8\">Jedrick Wills, offensive tackle, Alabama</a>.</strong> Offensive line is a must-upgrade for the Giants. Wills, Mekhi Becton and Tristan Wirfs all would do exactly that for head coach, Joe Judge, but Wills makes sense as Judge was once Nick Saban\u2019s assistant in Alabama. Familiarity tips the scales in Wills\u2019s favour without the ability to meet with prospects this year owing to lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>5) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LYdrN7nM7Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_LYdrN7nM7Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-herbert?id=32194845-5203-1169-a699-ce41d700202a\">Justin Herbert, quarterback, Oregon</a>.</strong> The Dolphins can pick from the best of the rest with Burrow off the board. Herbert gets the nod over Tagovailoa due to the latter\u2019s fitness problems. His 6ft 6in frame and huge arm pass the eye test. Three rushing touchdowns against Wisconsin in Oregon\u2019s Rose Bowl victory showed he can shift when needed too.</p> <h2><strong>6) Los Angeles Chargers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9593a1aab4f64ff41fa8deac600cc2fe0d0f0aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9593a1aab4f64ff41fa8deac600cc2fe0d0f0aa/0_108_3240_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is no questioning Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s ability but his injury history may see him drop down the draft\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is no questioning Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s ability but his injury history may see him drop down the draft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vasha Hunt/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tua-tagovailoa?id=32195441-4762-0344-3a46-269f5e5e854e\">Tua Tagovailoa, quarterback, Alabama</a>.</strong> The Chargers need some pop on their offense and Alabama\u2019s QB offers just that. The talent is there - Tagovailoa was on course for a monster season before a dislocated hip cut it to nine games. And Tyrod Taylor can start the season if Tagovailoa requires extra time to prepare. The Chargers\u2019 intimidating defense needs an offense to match.</p> <h2><strong>7) Carolina Panthers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">Isaiah Simmons, linebacker, Clemson</a>.</strong> Matt Rhule\u2019s first pick as Carolina head coach is made easy by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">the highly versatile Simmons\u2019 availability</a>. Rhule has emphasised his preference for speed so Simmons is perfect. The Panthers are handily just a short trip into North Carolina from Clemson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">Is the positionless Isaiah Simmons a glimpse of the NFL's future?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>8) Arizona Cardinals</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derrick-brown?id=32194252-4f39-3541-fadb-33b669a1b580\">Derrick Brown, defensive tackle, Auburn</a>.</strong> Wide receiver was the problem area for Kliff Kingsbury before the Houston head coach, Bill O\u2019Brien, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/16/deandre-hopkins-arizona-cardinals-houston-texans-trade-nfl\">gifted DeAndre Hopkins to the Cardinals</a>. Brown would tie in well with general manager Steve Keim\u2019s additions of linebacker Devon Kennard and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips. Brown is a great player with immense power behind his 326lb frame to disrupt an offense.</p> <h2><strong>9) Jacksonville Jaguars</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javon-kinlaw?id=32194b49-4e70-8236-d068-74d6202e4019\">Javon Kinlaw, defensive tackle, South Carolina</a>.</strong> Jacksonville\u2019s once-great defense is in tatters across the board but tackle is a glaring hole that needs filling. Kinlaw is the next man up from Brown. His combination of imposing size, raw power and quickness make him an immediate starter for the Jaguars.</p> <h2><strong>10) Cleveland Browns</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tristan-wirfs?id=32195749-5237-0129-a756-9a5ceb881ea0\">Tristan Wirfs, offensive tackle, Iowa</a>.</strong> Wirfs is a good fit for the Browns coach, Kevin Stefanski, whose zone-blocking scheme matches with Iowa\u2019s system. Wirfs is a superb athlete who blew the field away at the combine with an OT record 36.5in vertical jump, a 10ft 1in broad jump that tied the record and a class-topping 40 time of 4.85sec.</p> <h2><strong>11) New York Jets</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mekhi-becton?id=32194245-4381-4547-3cf4-9d445d134d9a\">Mekhi Becton, offensive tackle, Louisville</a>.</strong> Sam Darnold needs protection and Becton can make an instant impact for both the passing game and by creating running room for Le\u2019Veon Bell. He tips the scales at 364lb but has quickness despite his gigantic 6ft 7in frame.</p> <h2><strong>12) Las Vegas Raiders</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ceedee-lamb?id=32194c41-4d13-8457-fcbe-d37fdbd87233\">CeeDee Lamb, wide receiver, Oklahoma</a>. </strong>The cream of a highly-talented crop of receivers. Lamb has drawn comparisons to DeAndre Hopkins due to his ability to make contested catches. His impressive speed and strength after the catch shows he has a path to becoming a better player than Hopkins.</p> <h2><strong>13) San Francisco 49ers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/henry-ruggsiii?id=32195255-4731-8217-5970-b4a47789eeaf\">Henry Ruggs, wide receiver, Alabama</a>.</strong> Ruggs could provide another dimension to Kyle Shanahan\u2019s offense in 2020. A blistering 40 time of 4.27sec, the third best ever at the Combine, could be the perfect complement to Deebo Samuel\u2019s versatility. Hands you can trust with five passes dropped in three seasons at Alabama.</p> <h2><strong>14) Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrew-thomas?id=32195448-4f02-5763-1c5b-1459b2c5ddf0\">Andrew Thomas, offensive tackle, Georgia</a>.</strong> Tom Brady will be 43 when the season (hopefully) starts in September. The Bucs must keep him standing at all costs. Thomas is the best available lineman to let Brady remind Bill Belichick what he\u2019s missing.</p> <h2><strong>15) Denver Broncos</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQmtcaoEC0g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQmtcaoEC0g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerry-jeudy?id=32194a45-5541-5291-9f8b-8595dc100c90\">Jerry Jeudy, wide receiver, Alabama</a>.</strong> Denver need a receiver to partner Courtland Sutton, so Jeudy is the pick. He\u2019s so good at shedding coverage that \u201cto Jeudy\u201d has become a verb around his home of south Florida.</p> <h2><strong>16) Atlanta Falcons</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a.j.-epenesa?id=32194550-4541-5291-9369-b9d0c170a565\">AJ Epenesa, edge rusher, Iowa</a>.</strong> Atlanta have beefed up their offense, so logic dictates the Falcons going the opposite way in the draft. Epenesa is a premium edge rusher who can help solidify Dan Quinn\u2019s frontline.</p> <h2><strong>17) Dallas Cowboys</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/k%27lavon-chaisson?id=32194348-4103-1652-cb42-0c501912b1a9\">K\u2019Lavon Chaisson, edge rusher, LSU</a>. </strong>Chaisson can fill the void left by Robert Quinn on the edge and form a formidable pass-rushing partnership with DeMarcus Lawrence. The line as a whole starts to look a little scary with Gerald McCoy and Dontari Poe in the mix.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/22/why-the-nfls-lockdown-draft-may-be-the-oddest-and-best-yet\">Why the NFL's lockdown draft may be the oddest and best yet</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>18) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-jackson?id=32194a41-4304-1754-a4d4-5902e423feaa\">Austin Jackson, offensive tackle, USC</a>. </strong>The Dolphins need help to protect their shiny new quarterback. Jackson, at just 20, is a long-term project who can grow with Herbert and allow the quarterback to play with more time than Ryan Fitzpatrick was allowed last season.</p> <h2><strong>19) Las Vegas Raiders</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/c.j.-henderson?id=32194845-4e05-3672-fd87-85ca08961509\">CJ Henderson, cornerback, Florida</a>. </strong>After adding a receiver earlier in the first-round, the Raiders\u2019 thoughts should turn to the formidable passing attacks in the AFC West. Eli Apple\u2019s deal may have gone awry but Henderson\u2019s athleticism can be a building block to a solid secondary.</p> <h2><strong>20) Jacksonville Jaguars</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a.j.-terrell?id=32195445-5227-2956-3d70-15eacafe6b00\">AJ Terrell, cornerback, Clemson</a>. </strong>Jacksonville\u2019s defensive rebuild continues with Terrell in the backfield. A tough, fast corner to begin the project of replacing Jalen Ramsey and AJ Bouye.</p> <h2><strong>21) Philadelphia Eagles</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c56bdaeb8461347172084b6949c46fef2d7d2628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56bdaeb8461347172084b6949c46fef2d7d2628/0_0_2220_1480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Jefferson could team up with Carson Wentz in Philly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Jefferson could team up with Carson Wentz in Philly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Bazemore/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-jefferson?id=32194a45-4626-9287-c454-479b942cbd26\">Justin Jefferson, wide receiver, LSU</a>.</strong> Alshon Jeffrey can\u2019t stay healthy while Nelson Agholor has deserted to Las Vegas. The Eagles select Jefferson, adding a receiver with pace to burn and great hands.</p> <h2><strong>22) Minnesota Vikings</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kristian-fulton?id=32194655-4c73-3491-274a-7b3b8a1d4f92\">Kristian Fulton, cornerback, LSU</a>.</strong> The departure of Xavier Rhodes, Trae Waynes, and Mackensie Alexander mean the Vikings have to work on their secondary. Fulton, drawing comparisons to All-Pro Tre\u2019Davious White, should be an immediate starter.</p> <h2><strong>23) New England Patriots</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenneth-murray?id=32194d55-5256-3490-574a-1b8a86aa691f\">Kenneth Murray, linebacker, Oklahoma</a>.</strong> The pick everyone is waiting for. Jordan Love? Nope. The Pats go after Murray and get a playmaker in the spine of their defense who is versatile, fast and a future leader for Belichick.</p> <h2><strong>24) New Orleans Saints</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/patrick-queen?id=32195155-4530-8806-168a-7e9ee3bd3f96\">Patrick Queen, linebacker, LSU</a>. </strong>New Orleans have one of the strongest rosters so they can pick up the best player still on the board, Queen. A strong, imposing defender who will instantly strengthen their linebacker unit.</p> <h2><strong>25) Minnesota Vikings</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tee-higgins?id=32194849-4738-7791-9f89-d556c4b59b9a\">Tee Higgins, Clemson, wide receiver</a>.</strong> Much like their previous pick, the Vikings need to repair holes left in free agency. Stefon Diggs is out the door and passing him on the way in is Higgins. At 6ft 4in he would be an excellent weapon for Kirk Cousins on the outside and in the redzone.</p> <h2><strong>26) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1ilIYyfaCY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N1ilIYyfaCY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/denzel-mims?id=32194d49-4d62-4399-5aee-b92ce1fc40e6\">Denzel Mims, wide receiver, Baylor</a>.</strong> Miami jump on the receiver train to continue bolstering their offense and join up with DeVante Parker. Mims has an impressive highlight reel of acrobatic catches at Baylor.</p> <h2><strong>27) Seattle Seahawks</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/yetur-gross-matos?id=32194752-4f61-0423-9bac-e2b343fce23e\">Yetur Gross-Matos, edge rusher, Penn State</a>.</strong> Jadeveon Clowney appears not be re-signing in Seattle so they need someone new who can get to the quarterback. Gross-Matos recorded 9.5 sacks in 2019 and fits with Pete Carroll\u2019s defensive philosophy.</p> <h2><strong>28) Baltimore Ravens</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cesar-ruiz?id=32195255-4941-5291-5447-fa1de6f9c62b\">Cesar Ruiz, center, Michigan</a>.</strong> Ruiz can play across the interior line positions so chimes with Baltimore\u2019s penchant for versatile players. Ruiz might struggle to fill Marshal Yanda\u2019s shoes but the Ravens still have to find a way to maintain their explosive offense this season.</p> <h2><strong>29) Tennessee Titans</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylon-johnson?id=32194a4f-4834-1277-a78d-0224e4072abc\">Jaylon Johnson, cornerback, Utah</a>.</strong> Johnson can fill a void in the slot for Tennessee while providing depth to defend against the pass.</p> <h2><strong>30) Green Bay Packers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ki92VlkEic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0ki92VlkEic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-love?id=32194c4f-5613-0776-be4c-ce231b05c522\">Jordan Love, quarterback, Utah State</a>.</strong> Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers to Love. Rodgers may not be finished but Green Bay have nothing in reserve, yet. Love can learn from the best until it\u2019s time to take on the mantle.</p> <h2><strong>31) San Francisco 49ers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ross-blacklock?id=3219424c-4124-6567-64a2-94c97f8f8038\">Ross Blacklock, defensive tackle, TCU</a>. </strong>Blacklock showed he can pass rush from the inside in college using speed from the snap to get to the quarterback. May not replace DeForest Buckner but the Niners need help on their d-line.</p> <h2><strong>32) Kansas City Chiefs</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-chinn?id=32194348-4965-0621-179b-1e6fa9b75e74\">Jeremy Chinn, safety, Southern Illinois</a>.</strong> Running back is tempting for the Super Bowl champions but the smart move would be an upgrade to their defense. Chinn and Tyrann Mathieu could become an imposing tandem at safety.</p> <h2><strong>Sleepers: talented players who may fall down the draft</strong></h2> <p><strong>1) <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/clyde-edwards-helaire?id=32194544-5781-5562-8963-df06e680f700\">Clyde Edwards-Helaire, running back, LSU</a>.</strong> On film Edwards-Helaire looks like a raw Mark Ingram, creative at finding room and an excellent catcher out of the backfield.</p> <p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacob-eason?id=32194541-5338-2386-3401-72035bd47e1c\">Jacob Eason, quarterback, Washington</a>.</strong> New England and Indianapolis are rumoured to be interested in the 6ft 6in passer.</p> <p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cole-kmet?id=32194b4d-4520-0895-f027-61d779beeff4\">Cole Kmet, tight end, Notre Dame</a>.</strong> If a team want a giant receiver who can burst through tackles then Kmet is their guy.</p>",
  "<p>The talk is of misconduct, match-fixing, potential bankruptcies and tour cancellations when after two weeks of blissful sunshine at the start of the season we expected to be discussing Jimmy\u2019s rib, Jofra\u2019s elbow, Jos in the IPL and Joe\u2019s inability to consolidate an innings.

Nor do the counties, who, like everyone else, are far more concerned with keeping afloat.</p> <p>My guess is that with the circumstances surrounding his departure from the EFL likely to remain an unresolved case with differing opinions, Watmore\u2019s nomination will stand and he may be capable of doing the job well in the most trying of circumstances. But it is not a good look.</p> <p>Surrey\u2019s chairman, Richard Thompson, meanwhile, says that \u201cif we lose a county I don\u2019t think it will be a small one\u201d. It will not be Surrey either, who are less dependent on ECB contributions than any county.</p> <p>His assessment is borne out by the situation at Somerset where Gordon Hollins, once of the ECB and now the chief executive at Taunton, has taken over in interesting times. He has hardly met anyone and has been catapulted into crisis management from the start. \u201cI think the most difficult thing I\u2019ve had to do is to tell 67 of our 76 staff that their services are not required at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>This was a financial necessity. The furlough system has become vital to the survival of our counties and the smaller ones can apply it to a higher percentage of their staff. Hollins also mentions a cost that cannot be quantified in pounds. \u201cAttending a cricket match is not like going to a concert,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a social get-together; friendships are built there and it becomes a big part of our supporters\u2019 lives.\u201d</p> <p>Uncertainty abounds over when professional cricket might resume and, yes, those overseeing this must \u201cfollow the scientific advice\u201d about mass gatherings. Yet alongside the chaos there can also be moments of clarity. One little example came from Moeen Ali in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/ask-moeen-the-england-all-rounder-answers-guardian-readers-questions\">a Q&amp;A with Guardian readers</a>. \u201cIf there was a Test match tomorrow and I got the call, I\u2019d say \u2018yes\u2019\u201a\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all missing cricket right now and coronavirus makes you realise what you love.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has changed perspectives and that can apply on a broader scale as the ECB and counties try to plot a way forward.</p> <p>John Carr and Alan Fordham of the ECB are locked away with their spreadsheets and their hypotheticals and a task which must make scoring runs for Middlesex and Northamptonshire respectively three or four decades ago seem like child\u2019s play.</p> <p>They start by trying to concoct an international schedule and then must attempt to figure out some sort of domestic programme. They have to embrace the concerns of so many people: the scientists, the politicians, the players at home and abroad, the umpires, the members, the gatemen and the Sky TV executives. Oh, and the press corps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/nothing-would-give-me-more-pleasure-captain-moore-to-visit-mclaren-hq\">Captain Tom Moore invited to ring Lord's bell and offer England team-talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Too much speculation is pointless at this stage, but there may be no Championship cricket and no Hundred this summer, which could be both a source of despair and rejoicing to cricket lovers.</p> <p>In fact whatever one\u2019s view of the Hundred, it makes sense not to launch it with all the complications: the overseas \u201cstars\u201d may well be reluctant to come and even the ECB recognises that a major priority must be to give some succour to existing cricket fans rather than reaching out to the millions out there it hopes to attract to this funny, complicated old game. Understandably the focus will be to deliver the Blast.</p> <p>There may be no better time to swerve and experiment. Two-match Test series with West Indies and Pakistan could only take place at the end of the summer. Perhaps in exceptional circumstances and with a shortage of time, four-day Tests could be tried.</p> <p>In between them a completely different England side could fulfil ODI fixtures against Australia and Ireland. At domestic level there might be time for a rejuvenated 50-over competition for the counties alongside the Blast with a red ball and white clothing. Why? To offer the fans a full day\u2019s entertainment and to discover if any batsmen can still cope when the red ball moves. The lie may be almost unplayable but we have to make the best of it.</p>",

By now you will be getting a strong whiff of a distinctive, testosterone-filled musk. Yes, you\u2019ve wandered into the habitat of that fearless, self-assured celebrity creature: the ageing, raging, white, male, \u201cscientific\u201d truthteller. He\u2019s here to cut through the bullshit for you, whether you like it or not.</p> <p>This particular specimen, Michael Shermer, is the author of many previous works, including <em>The Moral Arc: How Science and Reason Lead Humanity toward Truth, Justice and Freedom</em> (2015), and the more fun-sounding <em>Why People Believe Weird Things</em> (1997). A onetime evangelical Christian, libertarian and professional bicycle racer turned historian, he\u2019s best known as an enthusiastic, atheistical debunker of pseudo-science.</p> <p>His latest volume is a collection of almost 30 \u201creflections\u201d published over the past 15 years, repackaged and organised around five themes: freedom of speech, religion, politics, \u201cscientific humanism\u201d and examples of \u201ctranscendent thinkers\u201d. Your opinion of the book will almost certainly depend on your fondness for quick, super-brief journalistic takes on large, complicated issues. Reading it is a bit like being stuck next to a well-meaning but opinionated guy on a (safe, boring, post-coronavirus) transatlantic flight \u2013 you\u2019re unlikely to learn anything very profound, and you probably won\u2019t want to stay in touch, but if you\u2019re in the mood, it passes the time to have a chatty stranger mansplain the meaning of the cosmos, the genius of the Founding Fathers, and how he got rid of his beloved .357 Magnum during an unfortunate period of marital strife. (Or you could just turn away, pop in your earplugs, and binge on the free movies.)</p> <p>Shermer\u2019s project is to open our eyes to supposedly rational, scientific ways of analysing and mastering knotty, controversial subjects, from gun control in America, through the \u201cnatural\u201d foundations of economic prosperity, to the prospects for a global advance of civilisation. Try to be reasonable, he patiently explains. It\u2019s good to keep an open mind and listen to what others have to say. Look out for confirmation bias. We should accept or reject ideas only \u201caccording to their evidentiary standing\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately the brevity of Shermer\u2019s chapters means that his application of these unobjectionable principles often results only in banal truisms. You might not need to read his essays on God and religion to appreciate that Scientology is a money-making cult; that both atheists and people of faith deserve to be treated as intelligent and worthy of respect; that many Americans these days define themselves as agnostic; or that \u201cthe universe per se cannot have a purpose\u201d in an anthropomorphic sense because, well, it isn\u2019t a human being.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30aad8ab58c2dc02f1d7ad1ee8095d3aaa3a7ab3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30aad8ab58c2dc02f1d7ad1ee8095d3aaa3a7ab3/0_132_3840_2304/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Michael Shermer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Shermer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, one person\u2019s platitude can be another\u2019s revelation. The book\u2019s essays on gun violence grapple with some peculiarly American presumptions, such as the notion that guns prevent violence, or that their private ownership provides an essential bulwark against governmental tyranny. What is remarkable is not so much the fairly basic evidence and arguments that Shermer marshals to oppose such views, but the poignantly recent evolution of his own stance. He starts off as a lifelong gun-loving libertarian, and even less than a decade ago, while acknowledging the \u201cstaggering\u201d toll of other gun-related deaths in the US, he dismissed mass shootings as \u201chighly improbable\u201d events, largely impossible to prevent unless we \u201cvote to change our government into a Chinese-like communist regime\u201d. By 2017 he was suggesting that the media should stop naming and publicising mass murderers, to prevent their gaining fame and inspiring others. And the longer he debated with gun-rights advocates, the more he came to realise that their minds were never going to be changed by all the data and PowerPoint slides he could muster: their disagreements went much deeper than that.</p> <p>More satisfying is Shermer\u2019s thought-experiment on a more off-beat topic, the governance of any future human settlement on Mars.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/15/elon-musk-cyborgs-robots-artificial-intelligence-is-he-right\"> Elon Musk</a>, the busy, self-regarding Californian tech-billionaire, wants to establish a base there as soon as possible. He also seriously thinks that a such a community of over a million settlers could and should be run as a direct democracy. On Musk\u2019s Mars, any law that 40% of the people came to oppose would automatically become invalid, \u201cto overcome inertia\u201d. All Martian laws, he\u2019s prescribed, \u201cmust be short, as there is trickery in length\u201d, and would be also time-limited, \u201cto prevent death by bureaucracy\u201d. Everyone would constantly vote on every issue, and laws would be continually expiring and need to be re-established: apparently, that\u2019s the best route to personal \u201cfreedom\u201d (which is naturally the ultimate goal of Musk\u2019s political utopia).</p> <p>As well as pointing out the inherent flaws in this libertarian fantasy, Shermer seeks out the views of scientists, science fiction writers, Martian enthusiasts and students of different kinds of \u201cunintentional\u201d Earth-bound communities, such as the survivors of shipwrecks, to come up with an alternative model. Why do some groups of thrown-together people end up murdering and eating each other, while others co-operate and flourish? The answers aren\u2019t so startling (it helps to start with a balanced sex ratio, emphasise teamwork, and avoid racism), but it\u2019s certainly fun to consider the mutiny on the Bounty as a test-case for how (not) to go about colonising other planets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a79e9f2757b5c08fb154888c4e2719852a9db7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a79e9f2757b5c08fb154888c4e2719852a9db7d/0_118_5519_3312/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A lesson to colonists ... the mutiny on the Bounty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lesson to colonists ... the mutiny on the Bounty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though this book is billed as \u201ca timely and full-throated defence of free speech\u201d, that is sadly a field in which it makes no substantive contribution. The basic problem is that, like any polemicist masquerading as an impartial observer, Shermer proceeds from so many questionable premises that he raises far more questions than he answers. All human communication requires rules, merely to be intelligible. And it\u2019s at least arguable that the freedom to debate any subject, however contentious, might legitimately co-exist with, or even depend on, rules of civility or evidence. But that\u2019s too nuanced an approach for Shermer; or perhaps it smacks of the \u201cidentity politics\u201d and \u201cfar-left dogma on college campuses\u201d that are among his pet peeves.</p> <p>Instead, he starts with the blunt (though conventional American) presumption that communicative laws and norms always reek of \u201ctyranny\u201d and \u201cdictatorship\u201d, and approvingly cites the claim that the Holocaust denier \u201cmust be given <em>extra</em> protection because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with\u201d. In this abstract, dehumanised vision of speech, utterances never harm anybody. All regulation is presumed \u201ccensorship\u201d, \u201csilencing\u201d, and intrinsically contradictory \u2013 for, bizarrely, one of his overarching free speech \u201ccommandments\u201d is that all \u201cArguments in favour of censorship and against free speech are gainsaid the moment the speaker speaks \u2013 otherwise we would be unaware of their arguments if they were censored.\u201d Ironically, given its commitment to clear thinking and fearless iconoclasm, <em>Giving the Devil His Due</em> is at its sloppiest and most lazily conventional on the subject of free speech.</p> <p>For many years now, as the Washington Post and other reputable media outlets have reported, women have been coming forward with claims of sexual harassment and assault by Shermer. He has never been charged with any offences and he denies the allegation. Recently, some of his public speaking engagements have been cancelled as a result. A few months ago, Scientific American<em> </em>discontinued his longstanding column for the magazine. Perhaps all this helps to clarify why, though <em>Giving the Devil His Due </em>is a deeply American work, it is not (unlike all his previous books) being published by any US firm, but only by Cambridge \u2013 though it certainly doesn\u2019t explain why that reputable scholarly institution, the world\u2019s oldest publishing house, was keen to do so. In any case, as Shermer himself would doubtless agree, even if objectionable and muddle-headed people are given a platform to speak, no one is obliged to listen to them.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Fara Dabhoiwala is writing a global history of free speech.

And the potential generation is expected to be 6,000 megawatts when this was written down, but initially engineers are saying production won\u2019t exceed 2,000, so there will never be excess.

Last year at this time, the water was plentiful.\u201d</p> <p>The Blue Nile offers a terrifying picture of the climate crisis \u2013 not just for Sudan\u2019s water resources but for the entire region. Ali walks over cracked soil as he points at the remaining crops with his cane, his long white robe billowing in the winds.<br><br>As Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia argue over the Nile Basin\u2019s waters, the climate crisis is encroaching. Ali wants the river to sustain his crops, which this year featured much more alfalfa because it can be grown in dry areas. But this meant fewer profits; alfalfa does not generate as much profit as the tomatoes and okra he sells in Khartoum. The lack of water also meant money was needed for a diesel-powered pump for irrigation.<br><br>He knows the exposed riverbed means that communities downstream will experience drought. The water levels were so low, he was convinced that the Ethiopian authorities had begun filling the dam\u2019s reservoir, decreasing the flow to the Blue Nile. \u201cI think the dam is affecting us here,\u201d he says, repeating the fears of other local farmers.</p> <p>The lack of water is already displacing people. \u201cI know farmers who have given up their land and have moved to work with others who can afford pumps,\u201d says Ali, who fears the same fate if he can\u2019t keep up with the increasing costs. \u201cWe have never been tired like this year. With this amount of water, how can I farm? We don\u2019t go to the government for the solution,\u201d he says bitterly.<br><br>Further up the bank, cotton farmer Hassan Khallafallah was proud of this year\u2019s crop, but worried about next year.

On the banks of the main channel that supplies water to his fields, he says: \u201cYou see \u2013 there\u2019s less water in the channel. We expect that after April, there just won\u2019t be enough.\u201d<br><br>Khallafallah has been buoyed by Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy, and says he would like to push the government on the issue of water in future. \u201cThis is a problem for the irrigation ministry. I would go to Khartoum to talk to them.\u201d</p> <h2>Hydropower</h2> <p>Yet Sudan\u2019s Gerd negotiator, Salih Hamad Hamid, of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources, is confident the country can handle some loss of water resources while reaping the benefits of cheap hydropower.</p> <p>\u201cSudan seeks to secure its water rights and achieve optimal benefit from the shared Blue Nile waters. The Sudanese proposal optimises the power generation from the Gerd \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s objective \u2013 and minimises harm during filling and operation to both downstream countries of Sudan and Egypt,\u201d he said in a statement to the Guardian.<br><br>Hamid stressed that the countries had \u201cagreed on a filling timetable of seven stages. This can increase or decrease from seven years\u201d, according to drought and water levels, lengthening the timetable if the water levels of the Blue Nile are lower than average.<br><br>A shared filling timetable is needed because the dam will <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/vanishing-nile-a-great-river-faces-a-multitude-of-threats-egypt-dam\">create a reservoir</a> twice the size of the Hoover Dam\u2019s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, decreasing the flow of the Blue Nile by up to 25% and potentially decreasing the power of Egypt\u2019s Aswan dam.</p> <p>While the preliminary agreement mentions potential dry periods, there has been extraordinarily little mention of climate change, an undeniable threat to water resources.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"566afa166e9f9479ce716c78d63d55bdee49339e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/566afa166e9f9479ce716c78d63d55bdee49339e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters against the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam in Khartoum, Sudan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters against the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam in Khartoum, Sudan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sudanese supporters of the dam say the annual rainy season that helps the Nile flood provides more than enough water.

Scientists from the American Geophysical Union have <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019EF001247\">warned</a> that, \u201cdespite projected increases in regional precipitation due to climate change, the frequency of hot and dry years is likely to also rise due to warming.

  "<h2>Top story: Researchers to test 300,000 in UK for immunity</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with the stories that should be top of mind this morning.</p> \n<p>Guardian research has revealed that ethnic minorities in England are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19\">dying in disproportionately high numbers compared with white people</a>. Minority groups appear to be over-represented among coronavirus deaths by as much as 27%. The Guardian analysis found that of 12,593 patients who died in hospital up to 19 April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/what-is-happening-is-not-normal-we-100-need-answers-this-is-not-adding-up\">19% were Black, Asian and minority ethnic</a> (BAME) even though these groups make up only 15% of the general population in England. \u201cThere have been health inequalities that have existed in the [BAME] population but what is being reflected in this pandemic is that those inequalities are actually coming out,\u201d said Wasim Hanif, professor of diabetes and endocrinology at University Hospital Birmingham. The Labour shadow equalities minister, Marsha de Cordova, has called for an independent investigation into the impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities.</p> \n<p>The UK is embarking on a large-scale study of 300,000 people to find out what proportion of the population has already caught and become immune to coronavirus. In the first wave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/uk-plans-to-test-300000-for-immunity-to-coronavirus\">about 25,000 people in England will be invited to take part in testing</a>. It is expected it will be extended to 300,000 people over the next 12 months.</p> \n<p>More than 232,000 people may have been infected in the first wave of Covid-19 in mainland China, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/china-coronavirus-cases-might-have-been-four-times-official-figure-says-study\">more than four times the official figures</a>, according to a study published in the Lancet by academics at Hong Kong University\u2019s school of public health. China\u2019s national health commission issued seven different case definitions for Covid-19 between 15 January and 3 March, and the Hong Kong study found these changes had a \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on how many infections were officially recorded. \u201cIf the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by 20 February 2020 there would have been 232,000 \u2026 confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55,508 confirmed cases reported,\u201d the study said.</p> \n<p>The world is on track for a recession of \u201cunprecedented depth in the post-war period\u201d, ratings agency Fitch has said.

But what if the premise is undone by circumstance? What if it turns out that we <em>are</em> hapless victims of a force arrayed against us, that will mercilessly hijack the machinery of our lives, that is silent and invisible and leaves us with nothing to do but cower in our homes and wash our hands and hope that it will pass us by? Is there a role for therapy in a pandemic?</p> <p>Those are not the kind of questions I used to start my work day with, unless my first patient was someone with paranoid delusions. But then again, until a month or so ago, I didn\u2019t start my working day by sitting down in front of my computer and clicking a patient into view. I\u2019m already getting accustomed to it; the human capacity for adapting is remarkable. But the one thing I can\u2019t get used to, so far anyway, is the way my patients\u2019 faces appear in this simulacrum of intimacy. I may have sat for hours with them, watched their faces contort in anguish, or beam in satisfaction. I may have searched out their eyes, tried to bring them back into contact from their safe haven on the ceiling. I may have thought I knew every inch of these faces, and no longer even needed to ask what their expressions meant.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t wrong, not exactly. I just didn\u2019t realise that all that searching was done against so many tempting distractions: the catalpa trees outside my window, the paintings on my wall, the little corner of ceiling tile that was chipped 30 years ago and has never been repaired. I could swivel in my chair, adjust my posture, look at the clock, and then back to the face. Now that it has been reduced to a flat image in the middle of a flat screen, and I have no easy elsewhere to look, I\u2019m realising that half the work was the struggle to behold those faces, and half the satisfaction was succeeding in wrestling attention to the task at hand. And maybe half the treatment was their observing that struggle, feeling the love in it.</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s more to the video than just the face, and distractions aplenty on the screen. But they are unfamiliar to me, and not in the world I share with my patient. Take this patient, just a guy trying to figure out his life now that his wife has left him. I might have known all about his sex life and his financial woes, but not that his couch was brown and his living room painted sky blue. It feels a little indecent to be seeing it. It\u2019s one thing to penetrate the hidden meaning of his words \u2013 after all, that\u2019s what he\u2019s paying me for \u2013 and quite another to catch a glimpse of something I\u2019m only seeing because that\u2019s where the best wifi is. Can I ask him what it means that the shelves above the couch are empty? Would that question be a sign of love, or just impertinence?</p> <p>But still, that face. It\u2019s right there. I can\u2019t escape it, as I imagine he can\u2019t escape mine. I keep looking at the postage-stamp version of what he is seeing. It\u2019s vanity that draws my attention back to that corner of my screen, but it\u2019s also curiosity. This hard and wrinkled face, this half-smile, these hooded eyes: this is what my patient sees? So much of my job is making sure I understand what I am conveying, labouring to launch my words across the room with the right inflection, the right expression, the one that carries my concern as well as my scepticism, that challenges and supports in equal measure, and watching myself watching myself, I can see that I haven\u2019t got the slightest idea of how I am coming across \u2013 and I am far too interested in finding out. I click off the view of my own face.</p> <p>So we are focused on each other\u2019s faces, but there is still at least one thing missing: that moment when your mutual darting attention comes to rest and you make real eye contact, not the off-kilter kind that comes from peering at a screen located a few inches from a camera, but an actual meeting of actual eyes transmitted through the air of a shared room. You look into each other, and you see, even if you don\u2019t say it out loud (and you rarely do) just how rare and precious this is, this intimacy that you have kindled by agreeing (and again mostly without saying so) to be honest with each other, and to sit with the consequences. Which is the whole point, the reason they pay and I work, and the means, if there is one, of healing, if there is any.</p> <p>God, I miss that.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If anything unites the disparate branches of psychotherapy, it is the belief that trauma twists the timber of the self, and determines the precise shape of our suffering. Freud identified this as the \u201crepetition compulsion\u201d, the unconscious tendency to place ourselves in situations that are versions of the past \u2013 or to construe them that way. Some traumas are more obvious than others, outright violation easier to identify than the diffuse ineptitude of some parents, or their inability to provide both love and sustenance on a sales assistant\u2019s salary, or the manifold humiliations children suffer at the hands of other children. But as capable as we might be at burying them, our traumas are more capable of haunting us. Therapy is the work of exhuming them, bringing them to light, and then putting them behind us.</p> <p>This idea that the pain of the past shapes our present experience has never been scientifically proven, but it is very likely that this idea is part of how you understand your own history, whether or not you ever enter into therapy. And if you do come into my office, we will ferret out the trauma at the source of your discontent, and, having found it, if our work is successful, you will recognise it as the moment that turned your life, and as the moment that you must leave behind.</p> <p>But what if the trauma is not hidden in the mists of time, but right here, in the midst of life? What if it grows at every moment, in every encounter, at no one\u2019s hand in particular but at everyone\u2019s hands \u2013 especially if they were unwashed and touched the apple that you are right now hesitating over in the supermarket. Maybe that guy on the other side of the apple bin is smiling at you, understanding exactly what you are thinking, or maybe he\u2019s glaring at you, trying urgently to dissuade you from putting the apple back into the pile. You can\u2019t tell, of course, because, like you, he is wearing a mask. And the only thing worse are the people who are not \u2013 the people who, encouraged by a president with a Jack-o\u2019-lantern smile, believe that the cure is worse than the disease and have brought their entire families to the grocery store to escape their lockdown. Complain to me right now, in the middle of this video therapy session, about that president or the masks or the guy who touched the apple and put it back, and am I really going to tell you that your outrage is about your father \u2013 even if, in some ineluctable way, it is?</p> <p>Or maybe you work in a hospital emergency department and you come home from your shift every day and take your clothes off in the garage and shower in the basement before joining your family upstairs, and you\u2019re trying to snuggle with your kids, but all you can think of is the intubation you did, in full hazmat kit, and all those virulent droplets the patient expelled as you slipped the tube down his throat? Or you work in a nursing home and your ex-wife won\u2019t let you see your children, even at a distance, until this whole thing is over, which is when, exactly? Or you are stuck at home in a marriage that depended for its success, you are just finding out, on your not being stuck at home together. Shall we go down memory lane in search of the trauma that has you ricocheting between boredom and terror? Shall we dissect your emotions so that you can see just how neurotic your response is?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a2a872ba7bbdcfd8d136da0a0af5f3bb5376369\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a2a872ba7bbdcfd8d136da0a0af5f3bb5376369/584_383_5065_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sigmund Freud circa 1932.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sigmund Freud circa 1932.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freud promised his patients nothing more than the ability to trade in neurotic misery for common unhappiness. Still, he harboured some optimism, albeit a strange variety. He would surely have scoffed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/27/the-greatest-anne-frank-quotes-ever\" title=\"\">Anne Frank\u2019s assertion</a> that in spite of everything, people are still good at heart, but he did believe we have a heart, and that it could be convinced to ache less, if only we could tell it the right story. That story would have to be realistic. It could not be the \u201cnursemaid\u2019s lullaby\u201d of religion or the paranoid person\u2019s account of a world out to get him. Its hero would be the stoic, who could accept the price he paid for the comforts of civilisation: the never-ending need to restrain his animal nature, and to never lose sight of the inescapability of nature\u2019s red tooth and claw. It was a tall order, but Freud was convinced that we could accommodate ourselves to reality rather than pretending reality was other than what it is.</p> <p>Freud placed his bet on the human, as the source of both suffering and balm. He didn\u2019t reckon with a nemesis so indifferent as a virus, any more than he worried about a meteor crashing into the Earth or the sun suddenly being snuffed out. The nice thing about depravity is that we can imagine ways to suppress it, and even succeed, if fitfully, at doing so. It\u2019s not clear yet if we are ingenious enough to do that with this virus, and even if we are, that outcome is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\" title=\"\">a long way off</a>. In the meantime, we are stuck with the imperative to restrain ourselves to a degree that Freud did not anticipate. At a time when we need each other badly, when we are under attack not by human nature but by nature itself, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another. Even Freud at his most misanthropic never imagined that.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps this is not the time to ask \u201cWhat would Sigmund do?\u201d. He\u2019s not much of a role model in normal times, let alone times like these. It\u2019s certainly not what I am asking right now, as I prepare for another day in front of the unblinking camera. What I am asking is the same thing that manufacturers turning their assembly lines to ventilator production or retailers improvising kerbside services are asking: how can I put my experience, my knowledge, my talents \u2013 suddenly rendered irrelevant and impotent \u2013 to use in a new and unfamiliar world?</p> <p>Some things are the same. People still complain about their wives and their kids and their bosses. They still have dreams, although it seems like a lot of them recently are about being trapped. They still well up with sadness or bite off their words in anger. They still look to me for support and guidance. They still laugh at my stupid jokes and tell me theirs. They still show up \u2013 although occasionally, if the appointment is in the evening, with a glass of wine. They still talk to me, answer my questions. They still pay me, if by online transfer.</p> <p>It\u2019s reassuring, this continuity. It may help to explain one of the differences I\u2019ve noticed: the ease with which people who are frequently evasive or argumentative or, as Freud would put it, resistant, seem to have suddenly shed their ambivalence. The man who could not talk about being molested now wants to, the woman whose abandonment by her husband left her too humiliated to speak of it now speaks of nothing else; the couple who always showed up to the office five or 10 minutes late now sign into my virtual office five or 10 minutes early, and are perched eagerly on their sofa when I open my screen.</p> <p>Is it possible that the screen creates just enough distance to provide a safety that my words and gestures cannot? Have we inadvertently found a sweet spot between the detachment of everyday life and the cloud chamber of face-to-face therapy? Or are people so sick and tired of being cooped up with family, or alone, that they are spilling over with the desire to talk to someone else at any opportunity?</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had time to interrogate this yet. I suppose if lockdown keeps up or gets more stringent, I will have to. Or maybe people will discover a new way to protect themselves from my intrusions, as the old forms of intimacy, the ones that require physical presence, recede into memory and the video version becomes the new normal. Perhaps Covid-19 has only accelerated a trend already under way.</p> <p>But the immediate question is not for the patients, but for me: what exactly am I supposed to do when I slip on the headphones and turn on the camera and another person in the midst of this crisis comes into view? The gambit of therapy is that the therapist is a few steps ahead of the patient, like a caving veteran leading a novice into a cavern unfamiliar to both; he may not know the particulars, but his headlamp is a little brighter and he knows how to find his way around. But this cave is unfamiliar and my lamp is dim. I don\u2019t even have a name yet for the strange admixture of emotion \u2013 fear and helplessness and disorientation and sadness and anger, in constantly shifting measure \u2013 that has taken hold in the last month or so, and that has become the new background of my life, too. I\u2019m just as terrified as my patients are, maybe more so \u2013 and not just of drowning in Covid-19 or infecting my wife or losing my friends to disease. I\u2019m as afraid of the aftermath as I am of the illness. Police are using helicopters to enforce social distancing. To those who defer to scientists and public health authorities, that may seem like a good idea. To those who crave power and who understand science well enough to know that this virus will be with us for a long time, it may seem like an opportunity.</p> <p>So I do not know what I am supposed to do when confronted with those worried, perplexed faces. I am making this up as I go along. I\u2019m making more jokes than usual. I\u2019m talking about my life more than I normally would, maybe because my patients hear my dogs barking or see the piano that sits in view of my camera as inexplicably as those empty shelves. And I am finding myself saying words I don\u2019t remember saying, at least not so often: \u201cExtraordinary times\u201d, \u201cunprecedented stress\u201d, \u201cuncharted waters\u201d. To the man who can\u2019t sleep, to the woman so racked by anxiety that she has begun to pull out her own hair, to the miserable college student whose postgraduate plans have evaporated along with the economy, to the parents of the high schooler who suddenly believes that the furniture in the house in which he is trapped is alive, and who, in less extraordinary times, probably would not have become psychotic, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d is all I seem to have to offer.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>These are not the circumstances for which therapy is designed. The events that bring us into therapy generally have the decency to be limited in time and place. A global pandemic is global, and it may never fully recede, or it may be replaced by another, and either way, we will have learned what few people alive today know firsthand: that, despite our dams and cities, despite our weather forecasts, despite our medicines and ventilators, despite the vast knowledge and dedication of our scientists, the genius of our artists, and the scale of our achievements \u2013 despite everything we have built to keep ourselves safe, we are not. We can be undone \u2013 not only by one another, but by a strand of proteins, and not only in a moment, but with months of warning and over more months, perhaps years, of fear and illness. The horizons on which nuclear holocaust or global warming are gathering are just distant enough to remain abstract, and they are at least theoretically under human control. Not so with a virus.</p> <p>Therapists knew this long before Covid-19. Sit with people stunned by loss for any length of time and listen, really listen, to them, and it becomes clear that everyone will be confronted with grief and no one knows how it is supposed to go. So, if nothing else, we have got good at consolation. We know how to comfort, how to help people speak the unspeakable. Perhaps I will find use for other old tools, or the trauma of this pandemic will not prove as pervasive or persistent as it seems at this moment. But for the moment, this is what I have to offer those expectant, beautiful faces that are far away and so close: help in cataloguing the losses, and at grappling with them even as they mount. I can only hope it is sufficient.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The government must not ignore the \u201cslave-like\u201d conditions of migrant workers making rubber medical gloves in Malaysia in its rush to source protective equipment to keep frontline NHS staff safe from coronavirus, human rights groups say.</p> <p>Malaysia is the world\u2019s largest producer of rubber gloves, but the industry has been accused of grossly exploiting its workforce, mostly impoverished migrants from Bangladesh and Nepal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/09/nhs-rubber-gloves-made-in-malaysian-factories-accused-of-forced-labour\">NHS rubber gloves made in Malaysian factories linked with forced labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Illegal recruitment fees, long hours, low pay, passport confiscation and squalid, overcrowded accommodation are commonplace, workers have claimed. Experts say such conditions leave them vulnerable to forced labour and debt bondage, which are modern forms of slavery.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must redouble its efforts to protect all workers, both the NHS staff who use protective equipment to save lives and the factory workers who supply it,\u201d said Phil Bloomer, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/\">Business and Human Rights Resource Centre</a>. \u201cThis means strengthened supply chain checks and the government using its leverage to improve conditions for workers.\u201d</p> <p>The government has been heavily criticised for its failure to provide sufficient personal protective equipment to NHS staff, leaving some doctors and nurses to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\">cobble together their own protective kits</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile the surge in the global demand for rubber medical gloves has left glove factory workers in Malaysia more vulnerable than ever. While most of Malaysia remains in lockdown, glove factories are back to full production, with employees working round the clock to meet demand.</p> <p>In the rush to ramp up production, some glove manufacturers are failing to protect their staff, workers have told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really afraid. The company is not enforcing social distancing. Everyone clocks in using the same thumb print scanner; 45 people travel to work on the same bus. All the workers arrive at the same time so the main entrance becomes very crowded,\u201d said a worker from Nepal.</p> <p>The migrant workers sleep in 24-person dorms, go to work on crowded company buses and stand shoulder to shoulder on 12-hour shifts for six days a week, making social distancing impossible. In return, some earn as little as \u00a37 a day.</p> <p>\u201cOur biggest fear is getting infected by local [Malaysian] workers. If they bring the virus in from outside there\u2019s a very high risk that we will get infected,\u201d said another Nepali worker.</p> <p>Neill Wilkins, head of the migrant workers programme at the Institute for Human Rights and Business, said the government must ensure that its suppliers prioritise the health and safety of their workforce. \u201cWorkers should be given clear instructions on how to keep safe, adequate PPE should be provided and social distancing practised. Measures should be taken to reduce overcrowding in living and sleeping spaces and to ensure enhanced sanitation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite the glove industry\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights, the NHS spent over \u00a375m on rubber gloves in 2018, most of them sourced from Malaysia.</p> <p>In March, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-52063563\">the government reportedly bought </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-52063563\">88.5m</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-52063563\"> gloves from Supermax</a>, the European arm of a Malaysian firm.</p> <p>Workers employed at Supermax in Malaysia <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2019/11/clean-gloves-dirty-practices-debt-bondage-in-malaysias-rubber-glove-industry/\">alleged last year</a> that they had to pay high fees in their home countries to secure their jobs, worked up to 30 days without rest and were penalised if they complained. Supermax denied the allegations, saying they operate in accordance with Malaysian law.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/09/nhs-rubber-gloves-made-in-malaysian-factories-accused-of-forced-labour\">Guardian investigation in late 2018</a> into two of the then largest suppliers of medical gloves to the NHS, Top Glove and WRP, found migrant workers who alleged they were subject to forced overtime, withheld wages and passport confiscation. Top Glove and WRP denied the allegations.</p> <p>NHS Supply Chain, an organisation that manages the sourcing, delivery and supply of healthcare products for the NHS, said they no longer have contracts with Top Glove and WRP, but would not say if their current suppliers source from these companies, citing commercial sensitivity.</p> <p>There are around <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_447687.pdf\">3 to 4 million migrant workers in Malaysia</a>, mostly low-wage workers from Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Indonesia.

  "<p>\u201cThe sun never sets on the empire of the dandelion,\u201d said <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_W._Crosby\">Alfred Crosby</a>, the historian of science and technology, talking about the biological expansion of Europe and the \u201cportmanteau\u201d of plants and animals carried by colonists to establish in new worlds.</p> <p>The vibrant solar voice of the dandelion speaks for the global flow of species but some remain particular and personal. There is a voice inside my head and it\u2019s not mine. The voice belongs to a song thrush. He began singing at the waxing moon, a couple of days before it was full, and sang until it began to wane. He would start at dawn from the topmost branch of one tree, then move to the topmost branch of another in the afternoon until the moon rose. Each day he did the same and his song followed the same patterns but never exactly: each phrase repeated three or four times, some sharp and yellow as celandines, some soft and blue as violets.</p> <p>Song is the wrong word; the thrush laid a promise, a grimoire of magical objects cast into the sky, to bridge sunrise to moonrise, to go silently into woods of the night and then return to the fantastic idea that shook his body and mind each day. There is nothing more urgent than this, nothing that draws joy and pain through the public air until all delight is gone. \u201cBirds are noisy,\u201d says a voice behind the fence. The loudest voice raised against death, that\u2019s his <em>because</em> (not that he needs one). Then he stopped. It was as if the air was exhausted and became too thin to carry him, until the midnight hailstorm.</p> <p>The following morning, the thrush broke radio silence when there was a cool wave through trees and across gardens and fields on which to skim his oratory. Broadcasting in short durations, morning and evening, from different trees, sometimes missing a whole or most of the day, this was no longer the crazy obsessive. This was the voice returned as a bird, louder than blackbirds and robins but a thrush nevertheless, as bright and imperial as a dandelion.</p>",

The company indicated that aspects of the project might have changed since it submitted documentation to the federal government but it would not provide any detail.</p> <p>The company has pitched its Collinsville coal proposal as having the potential to reduce carbon emissions by allowing the closure of higher-emitting power stations elsewhere in the state.</p> <p>But a lack of available water allocation at Collinsville poses a technical challenge for the financing, design and construction of any plant that would emit a lower proportion of carbon, compared with the last generation of coal plants built in Queensland \u2013 which has the newest fleet in Australia.</p> <p>Shine has submitted information that shows that by using a dry-cooling system the plant\u2019s emissions intensity would be comparable to the last two plants built in Queensland \u2013 Kogan Creek, commissioned in 2007, and Millmerran, commissioned in 2002. Both produce emissions at a rate slightly above .80 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour.</p> <p>Sources say Shine\u2019s studies identified it could pollute about 10% to 15% less carbon dioxide if it built a plant with a wet-cooling system, which requires large volumes of water.</p> <p>Plans to build a large dam at the nearby Urannah Creek have been <a href=\"https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/just-add-water-unlocking-a/2820175/\">touted as </a><a href=\"https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/just-add-water-unlocking-a/2820175/\">a way to supply water to heavy industry, including a coal-fired power station</a>. But while the Urannah Dam is <a href=\"https://www.whitsundaytimes.com.au/news/Urannah_Dam_divides_stakeholders/3014197/\">backed by many of the same political and business interests</a> as the proposed power station, it is bitterly opposed by local Indigenous traditional owners, including Shine Energy and some of its directors.</p> <p>The Shine Energy chief executive, Ash Dodd, told Guardian Australia in February that the power generator proposal would not rely on the Urannah Dam.</p> <p>\u201cWe as Birri and Widi traditional owners stand opposed to the [Urannah Dam] project as it will have a major environmental impact on our sacred rivers and all water rights belong to our people.\u201d</p> <p>Richie Merzian, the climate and energy director at the Australia Institute, said the federal government had spent $1.3bn attempting to improve the emissions intensity of coal since 2003.</p> <p>\u201cIt is damning that the best technology they can find now has the same emissions intensity as plants built 15 years ago,\u201d Merzian said. \u201cIf the best they can do is build another plant like Kogan Creek, it will do little for reliability, given this plant is <a href=\"https://reneweconomy.com.au/australias-least-reliable-coal-generators-are-the-oldest-and-the-youngest-58717/\">the most unreliable on the grid</a> per unit of energy.\u201d</p> <p>Dodd has raised the prospect that Collinsville could allow for the closure older, dirtier plants, including the privately operated Gladstone power station (.95 tonnes CO2 per MWh), though the Queensland government is firmly opposed to that suggestion and Gladstone has commercial energy supply contracts running until 2029.</p> <p>The state\u2019s opposition to the Collinsville plant could also prove problematic for Shine in its efforts to obtain finance.</p> <p>In interviews, Dodd has said the company has held discussions with overseas-based investors and would apply for Naif financing.

  "<p>Last Thursday I was one of the thousands of expats who scurried home to Australia as the Covid-19 crisis erupted.

Almost every weekend I would gallivant around clubs including the Berghain and its accompanying Panorama Bar, finding solace in the knowledge I was surrounded by people like me, with no ties to who I was back home, listening to dance music that had the ability to transcend and transform. Clubbing and dance culture can seem frivolous to the average onlooker but for me they were a form of therapy. Entering a club could somehow feel as though I was the only person in the world but also a speck in a field of glitter.</p> <p>In primary school I was in the dance troupe until my final year. When I started high school, I quit dancing, thinking that boys my age just didn\u2019t do that sort of stuff. My high school years ticked by, and I only came out three days after I graduated. Stepping on to the dancefloors in Berlin was like finding that primary school boy again. Through swaying my body, sometimes erratically, I understood that I could express both my masculine and feminine sides, and the clubs helped me become the person I was always supposed to be. When bans on large public gatherings began, the threat of not being able to step into these spaces became frighteningly real \u2013 even more so when I made the incredibly hard decision to return to Australia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was content with the fact I was dancing alone in my quarantine hotel room, lapping up the ridiculousness of it all</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the last 13 days I\u2019ve been in a hotel in Sydney, waiting out the Australian government\u2019s mandatory 14 days of quarantine. My experience has been better than what I\u2019ve seen at other hotels or in other states, but that\u2019s not to say cabin fever hasn\u2019t been lining the walls of my king-sized bedroom. I\u2019m naturally an extrovert so the idea of being trapped for two weeks wasn\u2019t exactly ideal, but I swiftly found ways to keep my mental health in check, one of which is turning my room into a makeshift dancefloor.</p> <p>On my first day, after doing a lousy excuse for a hotel workout, I began to just naturally have a boogie to whatever house mix I was listening to. All of a sudden, the anxiety about returning home and feeling confined subsided; I closed my eyes and was back on the dancefloor. What began as just a random shake of my ass quickly turned into a daily ritual. I put on a fun shirt or something of the sort for my workout and alternated between drawing the curtains to create a dark and moody atmosphere and leaving them wide open, letting the locals watch me flail my arms to Madonna. I would sometimes imagine I was on a dancefloor, filled with queer bodies but just as often I wouldn\u2019t do any daydreaming; I was content with the fact I was dancing alone in my quarantine hotel room, lapping up the ridiculousness of it all. Funnily, both feelings weren\u2019t dissimilar, I felt as alone in the world when I envisioned myself in a club and when I looked out the hotel window at Sydney Harbour. Finding comfort in solitude was calming and cathartic when the world felt so distant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/02/my-first-mardi-gras-last-year-forced-me-to-embrace-the-culture-im-now-so-fond-of\">My first Mardi Gras last year forced me to embrace the culture I\u2019m now so fond of | Ben Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a form of dance called ecstatic dance, usually held in halls or studios pre-corona. The only rules are that you shouldn\u2019t wear shoes and you can\u2019t stop moving. I went to one of these sessions in Berlin. The music began quite ambient, before progressing into classical, then tribal, crescendoing into deep techno, and then descending back into the ambient music that started the class. This method of dance is said to help people reach a state of ecstasy, diminishing the stresses of the outside world, allowing them to focus only on their bodies and the rhythm. I found my version of ecstatic dance to be really helpful in practising mindfulness \u2013 giving me a break from the insanity of Covid-19.</p> <p>There were moments in clubs in Berlin where I felt complete, unadulterated joy. Never before in my life had I experienced such a feeling. I\u2019ve learnt now not to reminisce about what I\u2019ve lost but rather to hold on to the belief that this feeling can exist.</p> <p>I really didn\u2019t think I would ever be trapped in a room for two weeks amid a pandemic, but I also wouldn\u2019t have imagined I\u2019d be able to handle it so calmly. While you may not be in a government-sanctioned quarantine hotel, nothing is stopping you from closing the curtains, dimming the lights and popping it back to some Kate Bush in your lounge room. It\u2019s my last night in quarantine tonight and I think I\u2019m going to blast Madonna\u2019s Into the Groove:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only when I\u2019m dancing can I feel this free, <br>At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see,<br> I\u2019m tired of dancing here all by myself, <br>Tonight I want to dance with someone else.</p> </blockquote> <p>Though it\u2019s doubtful the security guard outside my door will want to join me, I know that even trapped in a hotel amid a global crisis, I\u2019m going to feel completely free.</p> <p>\u2022 Ben Freeman is a writer from Sydney.

  "<p>Roger Federer\u2019s surprise suggestion that the governing bodies who have separately run men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis for decades should merge to steer the game through the global health crisis and beyond has set alight discussion on social media.</p> <p>Although combining the different ranking systems, schedules and rules of the ATP and the WTA is superficially appealing, considerable political obstacles remain. The existing hierarchies will take some persuading to vote themselves out of high office, for a start, whatever the passing observations of a universally admired legend of the game who has won 20 majors and whose opinion carries probably more weight than that of any other player.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/tennis-owes-debt-players-cost-lockdown-coronavirus\">Tennis owes a debt to its supporting cast counting the cost of lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Federer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rogerfederer/status/1252922285096423424\">asked his 12.7m Twitter followers</a> on Wednesday: \u201cJust wondering, am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis to be united and come together as one?\u201d Judy Murray reposted a #strongertogether hashtag in apparent approval of Federer\u2019s remarks. However, Nick Kyrgios responded: \u201cDid anyone ask the majority of the ATP what they think about merging with the WTA and how it is good for us?\u201d</p> <p>Federer added: \u201cI am picturing a merger between the WTA and ATP. I am not talking about merging competition on the court, but merging the two governing bodies (ATP and WTA) that oversee the men\u2019s and women\u2019s professional tours. It probably should have happened a long time ago, but maybe now is really the time. These are tough times in every sport and we can come out of this with two weakened bodies or one stronger body.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rogerfederer/status/1252922285096423424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just wondering\u2026..am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis to be united and come together as one?</p>&mdash; Roger Federer (@rogerfederer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rogerfederer/status/1252922285096423424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>He replied to one follower who complained that having two strands of governance was confusing and unnecessary. \u201cI agree with you. It\u2019s too confusing for the fans when there are different ranking systems, different logos, different websites, different tournament categories.\u201d</p> <p>The Association of Tennis Professionals, formed in 1972 to represent the interests of male players after the upheaval that followed the arrival of the Open era, has its global headquarters in London, and has morphed into an uneasy alliance of tournament directors and the players\u2019 council, led by the world No 1, Novak Djokovic. The Women\u2019s Tennis Association, inspired by the pioneering work of Billie Jean King and eight other active players, came into existence a year later, with headquarters in Florida. It governs a sport with players in more than 100 countries competing for $146m (\u00a3118m) in prize money, and has parity with the men\u2019s Tour at grand slams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3f768aa5aa1a3ec828b18ea099a297f382cb8920\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f768aa5aa1a3ec828b18ea099a297f382cb8920/0_528_2483_1490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billie Jean King\u2019s activism led to the creation of the WTA in 1973.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billie Jean King\u2019s activism led to the creation of the WTA in 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anonymous/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Merger is an idea that has been mooted before but has not been seriously discussed by either organisation recently, until the onset of the coronavirus crisis. Last week the ATP\u2019s new chief executive, Andrea Gaudenzi, drew back from agreeing with combining the administrative capacity of both organisations, but agreed closer cooperation was a good idea. \u201cIt is extremely important and I think it is one of our biggest advantages towards our competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only do we have a great women\u2019s product, but also our audience is fairly split among women and men.\u201d</p> <p>Gaudenzi, who reached a career-high No 18 in the world, said the game was most marketable when it had men\u2019s and women\u2019s events in the same tournament. \u201cA combined event, I strongly believe, is a better event both on site and [through the] media. It is just great. The variety is great. Our fans, they love both. We have strong combined tournaments within the ATP and the WTA and the grand slams are combined.</p> <p>\u201cIt is really a no-brainer and actually we are lucky to be at the forefront in that regard. Other sports should be looking at what we have done so far. It is really important and it is a huge opportunity because it becomes very appealing content for the broadcasters.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Federer, however, wants the game to go a step further: he is speaking the unspoken. Even Chris Kermode, one of the ATP\u2019s most innovative leaders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/13/atp-head-chris-kermode-hurt-ousted-by-players\">whom Gaudenzi succeeded</a> in January, did not explore the possibilities of a merger. It is not the first time the subject has been raised. In 2005 the then chief executive of the WTA, Larry Scott, was in favour but he said if it did happen it would not be as the result of a \u201cbig bang\u201d, as John McEnroe and Andrea Agassi proposed at the time.</p> <p>Scott, who had been No 2 at the ATP, revealed that the outgoing ATP chairman Mark Miles had asked him if he wanted the men\u2019s job. He declined but said: \u201cI told him what I would be interested in is bringing the tours together. I believe that would be a great step for the sport, whether it\u2019s as a joint venture or a complete merger.\u201d</p> <p>It did not happen then and, as one highly placed insider said on Wednesday: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen now. Way too much politics.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Murray, meanwhile, says he is uncertain if a short spell of illness that forced him to self-isolate last month was Covid-19. \u201cI was a little bit sick for two or three days about four weeks ago,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cSo, before the quarantine started, I was isolating for probably four or five days. Most people I\u2019ve spoken to have had some sort of symptoms and felt a bit sick. But it\u2019s difficult to know whether you have actually had the virus or not. Obviously, the test should be saved for people that are in severe situations and the frontline NHS workers in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Murray, still working on his fitness after a groin strain sidelined him five months ago, is pessimistic about the game\u2019s early return. \u201cLet\u2019s say things in Europe have improved, but there are certain countries that might still have issues... in South America, for example, and France was not allowing flights in from South America or certain countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have a tournament, basically, where people or players from a certain continent or countries are not allowed to come in to compete.</p> <p>\u201cI think the tournament loses. We\u2019d have to feel as though the whole world is working normally and traveling normally again before tennis can come back, especially the major competitions.\u201d</p>",

My old friend\u2019s recent death offers an eerily timely punctuation on this virus and a reminder that we can\u2019t forget to protect one another, and the animals that roam the Earth. \ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0f This virus has created a different version of me. My hope is to be stronger, healthier, smarter about the virus at large. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99After 10 days of ups and downs, feeling good one-day and terrible the next, I am now working hard to get my son, Mario, through the virus. My heart hurts more than my head over his infection. This virus does not discriminate. While kids are more resilient, they can suffer same severity of symptoms. I\u2019m applying a modified version of my remedies for his protocol with a focus on lots of vitamins. Since his sense of smell and taste have disappeared, I am feeding him healthy foods that I normally can\u2019t get him to touch. I kept a diary of the past week including my remedies and things that I did to stay sane through it all. \ud83d\ude4f Link in bio, as they say.</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/cristinacuomo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Cristina Cuomo</a> (@cristinacuomo) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-04-22T17:41:41+00:00&quot;>Apr 22, 2020 at 10:41am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0d82b8f0898fe360d660a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T23:50:19.249Z\">12.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That briefing has now ended.
