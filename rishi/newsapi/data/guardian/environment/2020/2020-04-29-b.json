  "<p>Clover Moore has again demanded that Angus Taylor explain where he got the altered document which he used to call her a hypocrite on climate change after revelations that he was not interviewed personally by New South Wales police and answered all queries via his lawyer.</p> <p>\u201cA minister of the crown used fraudulent documents in an attempt to tarnish my reputation and that of the city,\u201d said Moore, lord mayor of Sydney.</p> <p>\u201cSix months later it is nearly beyond belief that the minster is yet to provide an explanation for the origin of those documents,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/28/angus-taylor-and-scott-morrison-wont-be-able-to-brush-off-uncomfortable-questions-much-longer\">Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison won't be able to brush off uncomfortable questions much longer | Malcolm Farr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The controversy over the \u201cdoctored document\u201d erupted again this week, after the NSW parliament published answers to questions on notice by NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller on the police investigation.</p> <p>Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/23/doctored-documents-angus-taylor-news-corp-climate-clover-moore\">first revealed</a> the existence of the falsified document in October which was used by the energy minister to lambast Moore about City of Sydney\u2019s travel costs . It was then fed to the Daily Telegraph which published a story prominently.</p> <p>The NSW police interviewed Moore and obtained documents from the council but did not have jurisdiction to obtain documents from the minister\u2019s office in Canberra. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/02/afp-chief-defends-decision-not-to-investigate-angus-taylor-over-doctored-documents\">A subsequent investigation by the Australian federal police was dropped.</a></p> <p>Taylor has told parliament the document provided to the Telegraph was accessed directly from the council\u2019s website on either 6 or 9 September and printed out.</p> <p>On 25 October, Taylor said: \u201cOn 9 September, my office, in preparing a reply to a letter from the City of Sydney lord mayor, accessed a report on the City of Sydney website. The details in that report were the basis of my letter to the lord mayor,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is clear now, is that the numbers in that document were not correct. I reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the document in question: however, I will be writing to the lord mayor to offer my apologies.\u201d</p> <p>Fuller revealed they had reviewed IP addresses of visits to the 2017-18 annual report and there were no downloads from the minister\u2019s office on the dates Taylor has specified.</p> <p>Taylor has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/25/angus-taylor-apologises-clover-moore-document-used-to-attack-her\">repeatedly insisted</a> that <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-02/angus-taylor-says-police-probes-thorough-clover-moore-sydney/12018960\">the false document</a> he used to wrongly attack Moore for her travel-related emissions was from the council\u2019s own website.</p> <p>However Fuller\u2019s answers, published on 22 April by the NSW parliament, raise more questions about the origin of the document and raise the possibility that they were downloaded by a third party and sent to the minister\u2019s office.</p> <p>Taylor has refused to release internal emails and one external email sent from a third party, under freedom of information laws, despite requests from Guardian Australia and the Nine newspapers.</p> <p>Fuller said his investigations had revealed there was no downloads from IP addresses at Taylor\u2019s office on either 6 or 9 September 2019, the two dates Taylor has nominated in parliament as the date the report was accessed.</p> <p>Fuller also revealed the first date the police found that the document was accessed by Taylor\u2019s office was 29 September 2019 \u2013 the date of Taylor\u2019s letter to Clover Moore.</p> <p>This raises the question of where the document provided to the Telegraph came from.</p> <p>A NSW government information request to the City of Sydney by Guardian Australia earlier this year revealed 14 computers accessed the 2017-18 annual report on the website on the 6 and 9 September.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 14 IP addresses associated with 38 line entries in the logs requesting downloads of the 2017/18 annual report statutory returns, either PDF or Word, for the two dates. I understand that some of the entries indicate unsuccessful downloads,\u201d the council said.</p> <p>\u201cI used an IP address look-up for each address. Two led to a major city council in another state (not Canberra). All the others, as I understood the information, led to an internet provider such as Telstra,\u201d the council officer said.</p> <p>The city was unable to provide further details due to privacy laws.</p> <p>Police are able to request details of the owners of IP addresses from internet service providers such as Telstra. Major organisations such as the federal parliament usually run their own internet service provider.</p> <p>Last year Taylor released a report compiled by his department which showed different computer operating systems produced slightly different formats of the report, but has not been able to again locate the version of the report he said was accessed on either the 6 or 9 September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/28/angus-taylor-makes-distinction-between-downloading-and-accessing-document-in-clover-moore-attack\">Angus Taylor makes distinction between 'downloading' and 'accessing' document in Clover Moore attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesman for Taylor pointed to evidence given by officials in Taylor\u2019s department of Environment and Energy to Senate Estimates. The officials said an investigation by the departmental IT team showed the Minister\u2019s office did access the City of Sydney\u2019s website on 9 September.</p> <p>\u201cThe Department has no records of PDF or Word file documents being downloaded from that visit. The Department\u2019s system allows individuals to directly print from a website. The Department does not provide a capability that would allow a user to edit a PDF directly on a website.\u201d</p> <p>Fuller also revealed that NSW police were unable to speak directly to Taylor and that \u201call documentation was provided by Mr Stuart Hetherington of Colin Biggers and Paisley Lawyers on behalf of minister Taylor.\u201d</p> <p>He also revealed there was no evidence the altered document had existed on the City of Sydney\u2019s website, as Taylor insists.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been the community\u2019s expectation that the truth would surface, and that the minister would be held accountable. Now we learn the minister did not even speak with police, despite telling us in no uncertain terms he would cooperate fully,\u201d Moore said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the midst of an unprecedented crisis, and right now that should be the focus of all levels of government. But I look forward to a day, where through further investigation or internally driven accountability, we learn the truth of the matter. If the government intends on restoring the community\u2019s trust, it owes us that much,\u201d she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/28/angus-taylor-makes-distinction-between-downloading-and-accessing-document-in-clover-moore-attack\">A spokesman for Taylor on Tuesday told Guardian Australia </a>the police report supported the minister\u2019s positions.</p> <p>\u201cWe have always maintained that the report (from the council website) wasn\u2019t downloaded,\u201d said the spokesman.</p> <p>\u201cAs per minister Taylor\u2019s statement on October 25 the report was accessed from the City of Sydney\u2019s website and printed directly from the site which evidence provided by the department (of energy) in response to questions on notice supports.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSW police are only confirming what we have said all along.\u201d</p> <p>Through a spokesman Taylor also has rejected news reports he refused to be interviewed by police investigating the matter.</p> <p>It is understood Taylor provided police with a statement and answered questions in writing through his lawyers.</p>",

So far the March coronavirus appeal has generated $1bn.</p> \n  <p>The extra money would be used to help with testing, basic aid as well as the easing the logistics of continuing the delivery of aid in a pandemic. OCHA expects the biggest impact may be economic due to collapse in commodity prices, fall in trade flows, elimination of tourism and ending of remittances home.</p> \n  <p>Mark Lowcock, the head of the agency, is predicting for the first time in 20 years the proportion of people living in poverty will rise. One reason will be that the numbers classified as one step away from famine and dependent on food aid will rise from 130m to 260m. He is arguing with wealthy countries that unless they respond there will be a spate of famines, and problems stored up for as long as a decade, including migration and terrorism.</p> \n  <p>Overall OCHA has proposed $90bn could protect the poor with two thirds dedicated to social protection programs coming from the strengthened balance sheets of international financial institutions. The remaining third - $30bn \u2013 may will have to be delivered by humanitarian agencies funded by an increase in official development assistance.</p> \n  <p>Novel forms of protection are being experimented in low income countries, including open air education, less frequent food distributions, an increase in cash distribution through text messaging and on line education of health workers</p> \n  <p>The increased appeal comes despite a slower than expected spread of the virus than previously foreseen, but OCHA admits information on the spread of virus is still primitive in some countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea9bd138f087455863180d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lorenzo-tondo\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T17:51:22.528Z\">6.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A video emerged on Wednesday of an illegal horse race in Palermo, <strong>Italy</strong>, that went ahead in defiance of the coronavirus lockdown, writes <strong>Lorenzo Tondo</strong>, who is based in the city. </p> \n  <p>The clips show dozens of scooters, surrounding the horses that are running in a street near the University of Palermo.

  "<p>Hopes of an effective drug treatment for coronavirus patients have risen following positive early results from a trial of remdesivir, a drug first tried in Ebola patients.</p> \n<p>Data from the trial on more than 1,000 severely ill patients in 75 hospitals around the world show that patients put on the drug recovered 31% faster than similar patients who were given a placebo drug instead. Remdesivir cut recovery time from a median of 15 days to 11.</p> \n<p>Scientists also suggested the drug could have an effect on survival. In the group on the drug, 8% died, compared with 11% among those given a placebo.</p> \n<p>Remdesivir, made by the US company Gilead, is not a cure for Covid-19 and these results must be confirmed by more data, but experts think it could potentially help those who are acutely ill, probably in combination with other drugs that are yet to be shown to work. Multiple trials are taking place in hospitals around the world.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial\">earlier trial of the drug, in patients with </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial\">severe illness in China, showed no effect</a>, but it was stopped early because insufficient numbers of people could be recruited as the epidemic tailed off.</p> \n<p>The new trial was sponsored by the US\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Dr Anthony Fauci, a top US public health official, on Wednesday called the early results \u201cquite good news\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThis will be the standard of care.\u201d</p> \n<p>Patients in the Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-EU/UK), launched at the start of April, received remdesivir or a placebo through a drip every day for 10 days. It aimed to recruit 440 patients but ended up with more than twice that number.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/world-stock-markets-coronavirus-treatment-remdesivir-drug-trial\">World's stock markets soar on coronavirus treatment hopes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Recovery in this study was defined in three ways: being well enough to come off oxygen despite remaining in hospital; being well enough for hospital discharge although not quite back to normal health; or being out of hospital and returned to normal activity levels. In the trial, patients were given remdesivir every day for 10 days while they remained in hospital.</p> \n<p>Professor Mahesh Parmar, director of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, who has overseen the trial in the EU, said: \u201cThis is the first large-scale international trial to report on the use of the drug remdisivir to treat patients hospitalised with Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese results are very promising indeed. They show that this drug can clearly improve time to recovery. Before this drug can be made more widely available, a number of things need to happen: the data and results need to be reviewed by the regulators to assess whether the drug can be licensed and then they need assessment by the relevant health authorities in various countries. While this is happening we will obtain more and longer-term data from this trial, and other ones, on whether the drug also prevents deaths from Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<p>Experts agreed the results were hopeful. Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, is running the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/world-biggest-drug-trial-covid-19-uk\">Recovery</a> trial of repurposed drugs that could be useful in Covid-19. He hopes to include remdesivir but has not yet managed to secure supplies because of global demand. He was involved in a trial of the drug in China, however.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe four days shorter time to clinical improvement in Covid patients receiving remdesivir reported by Dr Fauci from the NIAID trial is similar to the five days difference we saw in our trial in Chinese patients treated within 10 days of illness onset,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis suggests that this is a real effect and that remdesivir can help patients with Covid-19. We need to see the full results, but if confirmed this would be a fantastic result and great news for the fight against Covid-19. Our trial and the NIAID trial are quite similar in design and a joint \u2013 analysis of the combined data will provide even greater certainty over the effectiveness of remdesivir. The next steps are to get the full data out and work on equitable access to remdesivir.\u201d</p> \n<p>Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London, pointed out that this was a randomised controlled trial, in which half the patients were given placebo, so the results were more reliable than in observational studies where all patients receive the drug.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are promising preliminary results,\u201d he said. \u201cIn normal times this drug would still be many months or years away from being approved for use on patients. But given these extraordinary circumstances, medicine regulators may decide to provide special fast approval in the near future, provided that there are ongoing controlled studies of its safety and efficacy.\u201d</p> \n<p>A statement from the US regulator the Food and Drug Administration said that the agency has been talking with California-based Gilead \u201cregarding making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible, as appropriate\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some clinicians are already giving the drug to their patients on so-called compassionate grounds.</p> \n<p>A separate set of results published by the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday of a trial conducted in moderately ill patients in China concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients\u2019 condition. Gilead said previously that those findings, released inadvertently by the World Health Organization last week, were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.</p>",

  "<p>The new chairman of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> has refused to rule out the permanent closure of some department stores when the government\u2019s high street lockdown ends.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/sharon-white\">Sharon White</a>, who took over in February and immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/06/new-john-lewis-chair-sharon-white-store-closures-job-losses\">warned of potential store closures</a> and job cuts at the group which also owns Waitrose, said she could not confirm any plans until it was clear when department stores would be allowed to reopen under the government\u2019s effort to control the spread of coronavirus and that \u201cno decisions had been taken\u201d on specific stores. The department stores were battling to return to profitability even before the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not clear enough at the moment,\u201d White said. \u201cWe are doing financial modelling looking at when lockdown is going to end and looking at what life outside lockdown will be like. We will have to look at the financial position for us when we get more certainty over the second half [of the financial year to the end of January] before taking those decisions [on jobs and stores].\u201d</p> <p>She said it could take up to six weeks from when the government announces the lifting of restrictions to prepare department stores for reopening, because they would need cleaning, displays would have to be reorganised, protective equipment would have to be installed and staff trained to work in the new environment.</p> <p>That delay could give time for completion of a strategic review of the business, which has already been brought forward by several months to this summer.</p> <p>The decision on the future of department stores will be partly influenced by the review but also by how long John Lewis is forced to keep stores closed.</p> <p>There are fears that department stores may be asked to remain shut until the end of the summer or even into the autumn, as the last non-essential stores allowed to reopen. That would put further pressure on the already stressed sector which has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/house-fraser\">House of Fraser</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/debenhams-appoints-administrators-and-liquidates-irish-chain\">Debenhams fall into administration</a> and permanently close dozens of outlets between them.</p> <p>White said that the \u201cpattern of trading\u201d at John Lewis had not changed since a recent business update that revealed sales at the department store group had fallen by 17% year on year since mid March despite an 84% surge in online trade.</p> <p>Sales at Waitrose have risen 8% partly thanks to demand for home deliveries as well as the closures of restaurants and cafes, which has forced more people to cook at home.</p> <p>White expects the shift to online shopping seen at both John Lewis and Waitrose in recent weeks to be sustained even after lockdown ends.</p> <p>\u201cOnline is going to be a bigger deal. When we look at Asia and Europe, even without social distancing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/will-shoppers-return-to-the-uk-high-street-after-lockdown\">people are not flocking back to stores</a>. They are worried about being with other people.\u201d</p> <p>She said the company was also considering ways to offer more services, expanding its brands beyond stores, potentially including a tie-up with a strategic partner.</p> <p>The group has moved into new markets in the past by partnering with another business, such as its investment in the then tiny start-up Ocado to help develop grocery home shopping. White said the group was now looking at how it might increase its presence in areas such as consumer finance or home maintenance, or add new services, again with a partner.</p> <p>But White said John Lewis was also looking at ways to capitalise on signs of a shift to more sustainable shopping. Haberdashery sales, for instance, have jumped as shoppers enjoyed mending clothes and crafting while they had more time at home. \u201cWe are definitely looking at opportunities in the way shopping habits have changed,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>Covid-19 has accomplished in weeks something that UK governments spent a decade failing to do. It has drastically cut labour migration. Lockdown prevents the gathering of real-time data, but it is a reasonable assumption when international travel has stopped that net migration is currently happening at a rate well below 100,000 per year.</p> <p>That was the target <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/the-failure-of-david-camerons-migration-policy-has-been-spectacular\" title=\"\">adopted by David Cameron</a> in 2010 and pursued aggressively by Theresa May at the Home Office and in Downing Street. It was never met before being abandoned last year. What happens next is uncertain. This week would have seen the government\u2019s post-Brexit <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-immigration-bill-to-end-free-movement-introduced-to-parliament\" title=\"\">immigration bill</a> return to the Commons, but the timetable has been discarded, not least because parliament\u2019s digital systems are not yet ready for remote voting.</p> <p>There is no indication that ministers are reconsidering the new regime, which is based on a points system designed to select \u201cskilled\u201d workers over \u201cunskilled\u201d labour. The distinction is meant to favour what ministers call \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d while deterring those whom decades of political rhetoric have cast as undesirable. The charges against that latter group are various: poaching jobs from British-born citizens, depressing wages, failing to observe cultural norms and generally upsetting people with conspicuous otherness.</p> <p>The vilification reached its apogee in the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. The promise to \u201ctake back control\u201d of borders had strong emotional appeal, but was never rooted in the reality of modern Britain, where migrants of all skill levels and income brackets keep the economic and social wheels turning. That awkward fact was always bound to emerge over time, but it has been revealed abruptly by the pandemic.</p> <p>Farmers are already warning that fruit will rot in the fields without seasonal labour normally provided by EU citizens. Attempts to entice UK workers to fill the gap are failing. Immigrants have kept public transport running, delivered goods and, most poignantly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/08/the-nhs-needs-them-uk-urged-to-join-countries-mobilising-migrant-medics\" title=\"\">kept the NHS and social care services operational</a>. They have put their lives at risk for a country that has been, at best, ambivalent about their entitlement to live here at all.</p> <p>There is no longer an explicit commitment to make Britain a \u201chostile environment\u201d for immigrants, but the apparatus of automatic suspicion and bureaucratic bullying developed under that rubric has not gone away. An appeal court this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/hostile-environment-appeal-court-judges-landlords-tenants\" title=\"\">upheld the law</a> obliging landlords to check the immigration status of tenants, despite an earlier finding by the high court that the rules led to discrimination on racial grounds. Many immigrant workers, already in precarious employment or on visas that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/labour-urges-give-migrants-benefits-lockdown\" title=\"\">prohibit access to benefits</a>, will suffer disproportionately from the economic impact of the pandemic.</p> <p>It would be shameful if the heroic contribution and sacrifices made by immigrants in these difficult times were met with callous ingratitude by the government. Fallacies and prejudices that have informed UK policy for a generation are being exposed by the current crisis. The debate has been oriented in entirely the wrong direction, with all the emphasis on a burden that should more rightly be understood as a blessing. It will not be easy to reverse that trend, but the opportunity is there if our politicians have the honesty and the courage to take it.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s perhaps not surprising that the worth of healthcare companies should emerge during a global pandemic, but we should offer thanks for the UK\u2019s big pharma twins \u2013 AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline.</p> <p>The former, with its share price at all-time high, is now jostling with Shell and Unilever for the title of biggest company in the FTSE 100 index. Successful research bets, especially on cancer drugs, have transformed Astra.</p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline, in share price terms, isn\u2019t there yet, but seems to have turned a corner \u2013 its own first-quarter figures on Wednesday continued a recent encouraging trend. But Glaxo is also at the heart of the global response to Covid-19, throwing resources at vaccine development via multiple collaborations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/14/gsk-and-sanofi-join-forces-to-work-on-coronavirus-vaccine\">notably with French group Sanofi</a>. If the long-term solution to Covid involves vaccines, it will probably also involve Glaxo, the world\u2019s biggest producer.</p> <p>If the value of the two firms now seem obvious, remember recent history could have been different. In 2014, Astra almost fell to a hostile bid from US group Pfizer at a price (one can now say confidently) that would have been a steal. It was a close-run thing; David Cameron\u2019s government flapped ineffectually and it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/pfizer-failed-takeover-bid-astrazeneca\">stout resistance of Astra\u2019s own board</a> that made the difference.</p> <p>Would the UK\u2019s life science industry have suffered if Astra had been bought? Almost certainly. Pfizer\u2019s pledges about investment in the UK looked watery and unenforceable. Astra operates around the globe but independence, complete with enormous Cambridge HQ, is the surest guarantee of commitment to the UK.</p> <p>Takeover rules, despite talk at the time, were never changed to include a firm public interest test for critical 21st century industries such as life sciences. Now would be a good moment to re-think, while the risk of predatory takeovers is low. Look around the FTSE 100 and you\u2019ll struggle to find two more important companies for the UK\u2019s post-Brexit, post-pandemic future.</p> <h2>Barclays must take successful quarter with pinch of salt</h2> <p>A vindication of Barclays universal \u2013 meaning retail and commercial plus investment banking \u2013 model? Well, up to a point, it was.</p> <p>Uncertainty is terrific for generating volatility in bonds, equities and currencies, and the traders in Barclays\u2019 investment bank enjoyed their best quarter in years. That\u2019s a useful point for chief executive Jes Staley (or his successor) to trumpet when activist agitator Edward Bramson next demands that the investment bank be shrunk.</p> <p>The problem, though, is a single quarter\u2019s boom in trading fixed-income products offers only modest compensation for the expected pain elsewhere. Impairment charges of \u00a32.1bn clobbered the overall numbers for the group, resulting in a 38% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a3913m.</p> <p>It\u2019s wishful thinking to believe Barclays was engaged in an artful game of \u201ckitchen sinking\u201d its provisions. The whack looks more like a clear-headed assessment of how recession will sour a lot of loans.</p> <p>Barclaycard, which enjoys stellar returns when the sun is shining, is most exposed since defaults on unsecured credit card debt always rise in a downturn. As for the UK retail bank, in addition to bad loans, it can expect to be squeezed by ultra-low interest rates and enforced generosity to borrowers via mortgage holidays, fee waivers and suchlike.</p> <p>On the plus side, Barclays capital ratio, though down from 13.8% from 13.1%, remains well above regulatory minimums. Add it all up, though, and the day when the group makes its longer-for double-digit returns on equity has become more distant. The figure was 5.1% in the first quarter.</p> <p>Bramson, who needed a share price twice the current 110p to make money on his 5% stake, chose the wrong target at the wrong time.</p> <h2>Next is exception, not the rule</h2> <p>It was quite a boast by Next. Even if full-price sales plunge 40% this year, the clothing retailer still expects to pay off \u00a3300m of debt this year. The mechanics are actually easy to follow: suspend dividends and share buy-back; mortgage a few warehouses; cancel \u00a31bn of stock; don\u2019t refit stores and so on.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the bad news: the central \u201cscenario\u201d (please don\u2019t call it a forecast) of a 35% decline in sales imagines zero profit versus the mighty \u00a3734m that was envisaged in January. On balance, shareholders should be sanguine. Next is plainly a survivor and is well-placed to bounce back in 2021.</p> <p>The read-across for the rest of the clothing retail sector looks horrible, however. Not everyone has dividends to cancel, let alone spare cash to pull from buy-backs. Nor do most competitors, in a normal year, make half their revenues online. As ever, Next is likely to be exceptional.</p>",
  "<p>As coronavirus tore through jails and prisons across the United States, California reduced bail for most low-level offenses to $0, allowing thousands of defendants<strong> </strong>to wait out their court dates at home instead of in custody.</p> <p>The response across the criminal justice system in the state has been disparate, echoing longstanding tensions about reform. Prosecutors in Tulare county have \u201cworked around the clock\u201d to oppose the early release of more than 1,000 defendants, according to the district attorney there. In Los Angeles, leaked emails showed the district attorney\u2019s office instructing prosecutors to seek a loophole in the new bail schedule for some cases. And police unions in cities across California have argued the emergency schedule will lead to an uptick in crime.</p> <p>Hanging over the bail schedule debate is a referendum in November, when Californians will get to <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/pretrial.htm\">decide</a> whether the state should eliminate its bail system moving forward. The success or failure of the emergency guideline, beyond the infection rate of the state\u2019s inmate population, has the very real possibility of becoming a talking point in all future debates for bail reform for years to come, criminal justice reform advocates say.</p> <p>\u201cI hope when this is said and done, we can all look back and radically rethink the criminal justice policies that exacerbated this public health crisis,\u201d said Lydia Kives, a staff attorney with the Bail Project, a not-for-profit that provides free bail assistance for thousands of low-income individuals each year. \u201cWe should never have had this many people at risk in jail just because they could not afford bail.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Outdated, unsafe, unfair\u2019</h2> <p>The emergency bail schedule issued on 6 April by the state\u2019s judicial council, the policymaking body for California\u2019s courts, works in two parts: those held on bail pre-trial will be released from jail and any people arrested during the course of the pandemic for most misdemeanors and low-level felonies will be held on $0 bail, and thereby released.</p> <p>Serious and violent felonies such as murder, rape, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping are excluded from the emergency schedule, as well as domestic abuse, violating a protective order and driving under the influence. Judges also retain discretion to keep inmates detained before their trial for good cause, or to put conditions on their release, said Blaine Corren, the public affairs analyst with the judicial council.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5e835b948e94c80347dd09876fc44532380dc63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5e835b948e94c80347dd09876fc44532380dc63/0_0_6987_4500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jails and prisons across the country have reported alarming clusters of infections among inmates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jails and prisons across the country have reported alarming clusters of infections among inmates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind the rollout was a sense of panicked urgency as jails and prisons across the country reported alarming clusters of infections among inmates. The top doctor at Rikers Island <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-public-health-disaster\">warned</a> at the start of April that the notorious New York jail was a \u201cpublic health disaster unfolding before our own eyes\u201d. The Cook county jail in Chicago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-us-jails-incarceration-death-toll-study\">reported</a> hundreds of infections among its inmates.</p> <p>But they also followed years of debate around America\u2019s money bail system, which advocates say has created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/25/california-bail-system-tiffany-li-joseph-warren\">a two-tier justice system</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/20/bail-reform-legislation-money-bail-incarceration-us-jail\">fuels mass incarceration</a>. In California, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/04/11/not-it-justice/how-californias-pretrial-detention-and-bail-system-unfairly\">more than 63% </a>of inmates in the county jail system have not been convicted or pleaded guilty, meaning that the majority of the state\u2019s jail population is incarcerated while awaiting trial. While some may remain in custody due to the severity of the crime that they have been accused of, more remain simply because they cannot afford to pay the bail needed to guarantee their freedom.</p> <p>Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, who chairs the judicial council, previously <a href=\"https://newsroom.courts.ca.gov/news/governor-signs-legislation-to-revamp-california-s-bail-system-protect-public-safety\">called </a>the money bail system \u201coutdated, unsafe, and unfair\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s not our intent to let people off the hook\u2019</h2> <p>The response to the emergency guidelines has followed the fault lines that have long formed that debate: public defenders cheered it, police unions raised alarms about it. Some prosecutors and courts streamlined the process while others questioned certain releases, creating delays.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in this Covid pandemic is an attempt to see people truly as people and get them out of jail so that they don\u2019t get sick, and not let their poverty be a reason why they stay in and risk infection and possibly death,\u201d said Ricardo Garcia, the Los Angeles county public defender. \u201cUnder this crisis, it is no longer only people of means who are able to get out of the potentially dangerous environment of jail. Now everyone, including the poor, have the same opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Police unions, on the other hand, argue<strong> </strong>the state is sitting upon a powder keg that is about to ignite. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot more victims,\u201d said Paul Kelly, the president of the San Jose Police Officers Association.</p> <p>Since 5 April, an estimated 3,174 inmates have been released from county jails across California for issues related to Covid, according to <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=82b29a92ea9a4a0ea7aa480f1287e137\">the Board of State and Community Corrections</a>. The statewide adult inmate population has dropped from 72,437 in late February to 54,561 in mid April. Bookings into custody dropped from 17,140 to 6,880 during that same time period.</p> <p>But not all jurisdictions have followed the emergency schedule equally. In San Francisco, where the district attorney, Chesa Boudin, <a href=\"https://sfdistrictattorney.org/article/san-francisco-district-attorney-chesa-boudin-announces-elimination-cash-bail\">already had a policy</a> in place since January that instructed his prosecutors to not ask for bail, the jail population fell from 1,097 in early March to 701 in mid April. Under $0 bail, Boudin said only in very rare cases \u2013 for example, if a defendant had a history of reoffending or if the crime was very serious \u2013 would his prosecutors seek a way to keep the person in custody.</p> <p>\u201cEvery level of government is saying we must reduce the prison population, and we must do it quickly and we must do it properly,\u201d Boudin said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable for any local jurisdiction to choose not to follow the law when that insubordination puts the health and wellbeing of everyone at risk.\u201d</p> <p>In Tulare county, a rural region in the heart of the Central Valley, Tim Ward, the district attorney, <a href=\"https://tulareda.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-13-20-Emergency-Bail-Order-PR.pdf\">called</a> the $0 bail \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ca disservice to victims of crime, business owners, and the community as a whole\u201d. In a statement, his office said prosecutors \u201cworked around the clock\u201d filing motions opposing the early release of more than 1,000 defendants.</p> <p>In Los Angeles county, where the courts instituted a reduced bail weeks before the statewide order, the jail population <a href=\"https://www.vera.org/covid-19/criminal-justice-city-spotlights/los-angeles\">has been reduced</a> from 17,076 to 11,883, but it\u2019s unclear how many of those inmates were released because of bail and how many were released through other population thinning efforts.</p> <p>Jackie Lacey, the Los Angeles district attorney, came under fire earlier when emails leaked showing her office instructing prosecutors to essentially seek a loophole in the new bail schedule. Gina Satriano, a director in Lacey\u2019s office, wrote that if a defendant is cited and released, \u201cbut law enforcement brings in for a warrant\u201d, that prosecutors \u201cshould use the old bail schedule that lists a dollar amount, otherwise no one would get arrested on that warrant\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cKeep in mind,\u201d Satriano wrote, \u201cthe court may still lower bail to zero.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=Email%20from%20Gina%20Satriano&amp;extract=%22In%20the%20second%20scenario%2C%20where%20the%20defendant%20was%20cited%20and%20released%2C%20but%20law%20enforcement%20brings%20in%20for%20warrant%2C%20we%20should%20us%20the%20old%20bail%20schedule%20that%20lists%20dollar%20amount%20otherwise%20no%20one%20would%20get%20arrested%20on%20the%20warrant.%20%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3E%0AKeep%20in%20mind%2C%20in%20the%20second%20scenario%20the%20court%20may%20still%20lower%20the%20bail%20to%20zero.%22\" data-alt=\"email extract\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=Email%20from%20Gina%20Satriano&extract=%22In%20the%20second%20scenario%2C%20where%20the%20defendant%20was%20cited%20and%20released%2C%20but%20law%20enforcement%20brings%20in%20for%20warrant%2C%20we%20should%20us%20the%20old%20bail%20schedule%20that%20lists%20dollar%20amount%20otherwise%20no%20one%20would%20get%20arrested%20on%20the%20warrant.%20%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3E%0AKeep%20in%20mind%2C%20in%20the%20second%20scenario%20the%20court%20may%20still%20lower%20the%20bail%20to%20zero.%22\">email extract</a> </figure>  <p>The emails, said Kate Chatfield, a senior policy adviser for the Justice Collaborative, a criminal justice advocacy group, were not honoring the intention of the emergency regulations.</p> <p>Lacey told the Guardian that the email \u201cidentified a small loophole\u201d, but only for very limited cases<strong>.</strong> She pointed at a public integrity case that was nearing the end of the statute of limitations. \u201cEven though we\u2019re not doing those kind of cases right now and the case will probably be heard some time after 1 June, it still needed to be filed,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re filing for a warrant, we have to have some dollar amount. You can\u2019t have a zero bail warrant.\u201d</p> <p>But California prosecutors only have to file a complaint to ensure that they do not violate the statute of limitations on a case, and a Los Angeles county prosecutor, who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation, said it\u2019s not necessary to file a dollar amount on an arrest warrant to file a complaint.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, with the coronavirus, there are a limited amount of people who are trying to get out of their criminal cases,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cWe\u2019re letting people out and putting cases over, but it\u2019s not our intent to let people off the hook for criminal behavior that should be addressed.\u201d</p> <h2>Frustrated officers</h2> <p>Since the start of the pandemic, overall crime and calls for services have gone down across California. The state\u2019s police unions have attributed the decline to the stay-at-home order \u2013 with more people indoors, there are fewer potential victims \u2013 and think it\u2019s only a matter of time before crime will pick back up, in part because of the $0 bail schedule.</p> <p>Some law enforcement departments have publicly aired their frustration with the new bail.<strong> </strong>\u201cDon Joseph was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle and released from custody per the statewide $0 bail order,\u201d <a href=\"http://nixle.us/BS9E8\">said the Chino Hills </a><a href=\"http://nixle.us/BS9E8\">police </a><a href=\"http://nixle.us/BS9E8\">department</a>. \u201cReleased on court order zero bail \u2026 37 mins later he walked to Dublin (Bart station) and carjacked victim,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ACSOSheriffs/status/1252328587576750080?s=20\">tweeted</a> the Alameda county sheriff\u2019s department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"415536d6710b1e15832ab8dbfde575931371450e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415536d6710b1e15832ab8dbfde575931371450e/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Overall crime and calls for services have gone down across California since the start of the pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Overall crime and calls for services have gone down across California since the start of the pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople are incarcerated because they did bad actions,\u201d said Craig Lally, the president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the LA police union. \u201cPeople who are in jail are most likely in jail because they did it more than once,\u201d he added, though<strong> </strong>many defendants held in jails have not yet been convicted, and are there because they can\u2019t afford bail.</p> <p>Police officers right now are frustrated, Lally said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to do their job, they\u2019re trying to protect people the best they can, and when they get the criminal elements, and they get the person they\u2019ve arrested before, who have been doing it pretty much their whole lives, you\u2019re never going to reform that person,\u201d Lally said. \u201cThat\u2019s the lifestyle that they chose probably since they were 16 years old. They\u2019re never going to change and the only thing you can do is warehouse them.\u201d</p> <p>John Raphling, a senior researcher with the Human Rights Watch said that while America\u2019s standard approach to criminal justice may be incarceration, the country should rethink its procedures amid a pandemic. \u201cPeople are getting sick. People are dying. It\u2019s going to stay in the jail and spread in the jail and get sent back outside,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Raphling pointed out that making the jails safer from an outbreak went beyond reducing the numbers of detainees. Los Angeles county made huge strides in reducing its population from 17,076 to 11,883, but the facility was rated at capacity at 12,000. The county got the population down to just below what the jail was supposed to have at capacity, meaning there would be little room to create physical distancing and isolation and quarantine quarters.</p> <h2>\u2018It shouldn\u2019t take a global pandemic\u2019</h2> <p>From the response he\u2019s seen so far to the emergency bail schedule, Raphling feels a cautious sense of optimism about the future of bail reform in California.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of things about this disease that have exposed the problems with our society, and mass incarceration, the jailing of people for fairly harmless behavior, that\u2019s a huge problem in this country and hopefully people are seeing that,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People are getting sick.

It\u2019s a matter of justice and public health, and I\u2019m confident that the data on the impact of these emergency measures will be on the side of meaningful reform,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that we shouldn\u2019t have so many people held in jails awaiting trial or court hearings,\u201d Kives continued. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a global pandemic to highlight the public health argument for decarceration, but that\u2019s where we are, and I hope it\u2019s a wake-up call.\u201d</p>",

Gove is one of the ministers who attends the daily C-19 meeting in Downing Street, which is referred to by insiders as the coronavirus \u201cwar cabinet\u201d, and he chairs<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-government-structures-to-coordinate-response-to-coronavirus\"> a coronavirus implementation committee</a> in charge of \u201cpreparedness\u201d across much of the public sector and critical national infrastructure, excluding the NHS.</p> \n  <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exclusive-ministers-warned-nhs-could-not-cope-pandemic-three/\">exclusive report</a> on Exercise Cygnus published at the end of March, the Sunday Telegraph said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The NHS failed a major cross-government test of its ability to handle a severe pandemic but the \u201cterrifying\u201d results were kept secret from the public.</p> \n   <p>Ministers were informed three years ago that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a severe outbreak amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE), an investigation has discovered ... </p> \n   <p>Despite the failings exposed by Cygnus, the government never changed its strategic roadmap for a future pandemic, with the last update carried out in 2014. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Summarising <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exercise-cygnus-uncovered-pandemic-warnings-buried-government/\">the conclusions from the exercise </a>in the Sunday Telegraph, <strong>Paul Nuki </strong>and <strong>Bill Gardner</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But it was not the pandemic itself that was causing those gathered in Whitehall to grimace but the nation\u2019s woeful preparation. The peak of the epidemic had not yet arrived but local resilience forums, hospitals and mortuaries across the country were already being overwhelmed. </p> \n   <p>There was not enough personal protective equipment (PPE) for the nation\u2019s doctors and nurses. The NHS was about to \u201cfall over\u201d due to a shortage of ventilators and critical care beds. Morgues were set to overflow, and it had become terrifyingly evident that the government\u2019s emergency messaging was not getting traction with the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gove told the committee he had read the report. But, when pressed by the committee\u2019s chairman <strong>William Wragg</strong> as to when he had read it, he said last week.</p> \n  <p>When Wragg expressed surprise about this, Gove said: \u201cSome of the product that flowed from that report I had read beforehand.\u201d Asked what he was referring to, Gove said he was referring to recommendations relating to the need for emergency legislation, to the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed and to the need to de-prioritise non-urgent operations.</p> \n  <p>Gove said the report had led to the development of an influenza pandemic stockpile. But Exercise Cygnus specifically covered a flu pandemic, and Gove said the fact that coronavirus was a different sort of virus meant that there was a need for \u201ca recalibration of our approach towards PPE [personal protective equipment]\u201d.

It was as if the two protagonists were trying to outbid each other in evidence-based discourse and common sensical decency. It is very likely to be the case that debates in cabinet ministerial committees get more unpleasant and abrasive than what we witnessed at PMQs today. If Raab was getting rattled, he only really let it show right at the end, when he sought to lecture Starmer (mildly) on being opportunistic. Ironically, this was probably the point at which Raab\u2019s argument - that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d of the kind published by the Scottish government at all isn\u2019t really an exit strategy, because it does not commit to policy - was at its strongest. Raab did not really have much of an answer to Starmer\u2019s question earlier about how the PPE problems were going to be fixed. Starmer probably had the better of the exchanges, although it did not sound like the convention PMQs \u201cwin\u201d, not least because his performance included gushing praise for the government\u2019s performance on boosting NHS capacity. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea963518f08db9df42df808#block-5ea963518f08db9df42df808\">12.24pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>This might not be what people are used to at PMQs, but there is probably method in Starmer\u2019s approach. It was strongly reminiscent of what <strong>Tony Blair</strong> wrote about how to succeed at PMQs in his memoirs. Blair wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I always tried to make [what he said at PMQs] telling. The aim was to get the non-politician nodding. I would wonder not what appealed to a Labour party conference in full throttle, but what would appeal to my old mates at the Bar, who wanted a reasonable case to be made; and who, if it were made, would rally ...</p> \n   <p>Yes, it\u2019s not like calling your opponent a liar, or a fraud, or a villain or a hypocrite, but the middle-ground floating voters kind of shrugs their shoulders at those claims. They don\u2019t chime. They\u2019re too over the top, too heavy, and they represent an insult, not an argument. Whereas the lesser charge, because it\u2019s more accurate and precisely because it\u2019s low-key, can stick.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea96f578f08db9df42df8b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-29T12:18:00.535Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer says UK risks 'falling behind' if government does not publish exit plan</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are quote from the final exchanges at PMQs between <strong>Dominic Raab</strong> and <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, where Starmer was claiming the UK would fall behind other countries if it did not publish an exit plan soon. Starmer said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland and Wales have all published exit plans of one sort or another. [Raab] said, \u2018well what are the proposals, what should they cover?\u2019. If you look at those plans, as he\u2019s done and I\u2019ve done, it\u2019s clear that there are common issues such as schools reopening, business sectors reopening.</p> \n   <p>These are the issues that, if he wants me to put them on the table, I absolutely will.</p> \n   <p>Delay risks not only falling behind other countries, but also the successful four-nation approach so far.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab said it would be wrong to publish an exit plan before the scientific advice said it was safe to start relaxing the lockdown. And he said the Scottish government had not published one. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Scottish government has not set out an exit strategy.

  "<p>With no live sport to watch or play, exercise has never been more precious. Those minutes of freedom, an uncurling away from bad posture on the sofa, lifting the spirits and boosting the heart rate. But, as you slurp your morning lungfuls of air, have your noticed a change? Think the sky has looked a more perfect cornflower, noticed the stars shining a little brighter?</p> <p>You would be right on all three, the falling levels of air pollution a tiny silver lining to our dreadful predicament. Yet air pollution also has a more sinister role in the coronavirus story.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/21/preliminary-study-links-air-pollution-to-coronavirus-deaths-in-england\" title=\"\">preliminary studies</a> in the US seem to suggest a link between a high death rate and high levels of pollution (a similar link was found during the Sars outbreak in 2003), with Covid-19 able to attach itself to particulate pollution. So improving air quality might be one of the ways out of this crisis, as well as helping the 4.2 million people who die annually from your bog\u2011standard air pollution. But where does sport fit in?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/cricket-climate-crisis\">The Spin | Cricket feels heat as climate crisis creates corridor of uncertainty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know athletes are particularly at risk from poor air quality because of their higher respiratory rates during exercise \u2013 children in particular. And around the world athletes have started to complain: Novak Djokovic, who criticised pollution levels in China; the New South Wales spinner Steve O\u2019Keefe, who described the air quality during a Sheffield Shield game as fires burned outside Sydney as like \u201csmoking 80 cigarettes a day\u201d; the tennis player Dalila Jakupovic, who pulled out of her Australian Open game because she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>Not only that, but pollution also seems to impede performance. A fascinating <a href=\"https://sustainabilityreport.com/2020/04/23/air-pollution-tackling-sports-invisible-threat/\" title=\"\">essay by Matthew Campelli in the Sustainability Report</a> this week examines just that, revealing that early trials seem to show air pollution reducing the productivity rates of German footballers and impeding decision-making in chess players and baseball umpires.</p> <p>This dovetails alarmingly with the <a href=\"https://basis.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hit-for-Six-The-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Cricket.pdf\" title=\"\">Hit for Six report</a> published last September, which described the effects of extreme heat not only on cricketers\u2019 ability to function physically but also their capacity, and umpires\u2019 capacity, to make decisions.</p> <p>Throw in the bushfires in Australia last year which threatened the cricket season, the cancellation of matches in the path of a super typhoon during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, cricketers vomiting on the pitch because of air pollution in Delhi, cricket stadiums being destroyed by hurricanes in the West Indies, the ski season literally melting away and rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure, and the picture of sport in a climate emergency starts to look less than rosy.</p> <p>Add our current crisis, with normal sporting relations unlikely to restart any time soon, and sport is looking at an extremely complicated situation. Maybe the Premier League can restart in a couple of months, but what about European football? Players may get special passports which mean they avoid quarantine at airports, but what about away supporters? In Japan, meanwhile, nervous voices are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/29/tokyo-olympics-not-reliant-on-covid-19-vaccine-senior-ioc-member\" title=\"\">expressing doubt over the Tokyo Olympics</a> mark two, pencilled in for the summer of 2021.</p> <p>An existential problem then, and one that coincides with an enforced period of contemplation. Much like the rest of the world, sport has the opportunity to hit the reset button. It is going to have to work within a smaller framework, with a much emptier purse, in a world where air travel is expensive, and perceived as dangerous to human health as well as the planet, as the earth grows ever warmer \u2013 with 2020 already set to be the hottest year yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26041a775be684677e6a615ba7ab2f0aed4ffbc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26041a775be684677e6a615ba7ab2f0aed4ffbc9/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic said he had experienced air quality issues in tournaments in China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic said he had experienced air quality issues in tournaments in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TPN/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some might argue that with no gate receipts, no bar takings and a fixture list with more holes than games, sport is in no place to be gazing at its environmental soul.

The idea is to hold a similar meeting weekly for the foreseeable future, to try to hammer out a way for sport to move forward.</p> <p>Russell Seymour, chief executive of Basis, says: \u201cThis is not how we want to live our lives, locked down, insular. But this is the moment, the opportunity for sport to reflect and decide to rebuild its operations in a more environmentally sustainable way. After the economic crash in 2008 people said: \u2018We clearly have to make a change, the current way we are living our lives isn\u2019t working.\u2019 Then global emissions jumped by 6% the following year.

Why must the Olympic Games move to a different city every four years? Why squeeze every drop out of athletes for maximum profit until they cannot cope and break down, both mentally or physically?

  "<p>The chickens they are a-roosting. Covid-19 has claimed many things in its dastardly travails \u2013 lives, jobs, a common sense of security \u2013 and it might well add Australian sport to its list of casualties. Not in the sense that it is gone. But the chronology of the way top-level sport is administered in this country will reveal it as having two identities: one pre-coronavirus, the other post-coronavirus. In this sense the crisis might in time be seen as a blessing in disguise. When the virus reached Australia and paused life as we knew it, it swept through sport in the shape of a grim reaper with scythe in one hand and spotlight in the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/28/playing-the-waiting-game-shutdown-of-sport-is-beginning-to-test-patience\">Playing the waiting game: shutdown of sport is beginning to test patience | Jonathan Howcroft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spotting the difference between mismanagement and lavish government might be an exercise in futility. But if some Australian sporting organisations haven\u2019t exactly been guilty of the former, the roadkill left in the coronavirus\u2019s wake suggests the latter has been rife and unchecked in certain quarters. Until now. In the words of Robert Louis Stevenson: \u201cDon\u2019t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.\u201d</p> <p>For too long Australian sport has been judged, feted even, by its harvest: spiralling broadcast deals and player wages, and the subsequent benefits that high revenues bring. Now is the time to dig deeper and look at those seeds. Nobody saw Covid-19 coming, and nobody could rightly have prepared for the damage it would cause. But what the pandemic has done is lift the hood on Australian sport; the chassis might be a Bentley, but the engine powering it is somewhere between a Holden and a Victa. We thought sport in Australia was rich, but in reality it\u2019s been living pay cheque to pay cheque. And now the rainy day has arrived.</p> <p>The times of coronavirus have already claimed two high-profile scalps: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/todd-greenbergs-cards-were-marked-once-peter-vlandys-landed-in-rugby-league\">Todd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/raelene-castle-becomes-latest-casualty-of-australias-flawed-rugby-system\">his equivalent at Rugby Australia, Raelene Castle</a>. The picture is barely brighter elsewhere.

Little wonder Allan Border wondered last week where all the money had gone when in 2016 Cricket Australia sat proudly on $199m in cash reserves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/australia-only-cricket-series-would-turn-disaster-into-something-bold\">Australia-only cricket series would turn disaster into something bold | Adam Collins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Football is one sport long thought to be living beyond its means. Fox Sports was already losing money hand over fist by broadcasting the A-League and W-League. But the fight FFA has on its hands to keep its domestic competitions viable has been accelerated by Covid-19, with the broadcaster recently refusing to pay a $12m rights fee instalment. Netball Australia, having watched its game grow over the past few seasons, is now counting the cost of lost sponsorship dollars and the loss of momentum that will follow. The AFL, like the rest, has laid off staff, cut player wages and pruned costs to stay afloat. But while tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be soon enough for the code to resume competition, it has assets and half a billion dollars of bank-funded credit. Where the NRL\u2019s manoeuvring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/29/what-the-restructured-nrl-season-will-look-like-with-28-may-restart-date\">to return to the playing field</a> has bordered on desperate, the AFL\u2019s relative comfort is reflected in its more measured approach.</p> <p>And the NRL is desperate. Greenberg has become the poster boy of rugby league\u2019s failure, the scapegoat the NRL had to have as a marker point to a brighter future. But while the departed chief executive\u2019s extravagant spending might have turned a pot of gold into dust, the clubs themselves must accept their share of culpability. As former Blues Origin coach Laurie Daley said: \u201cI think there has been a lot of wastage in rugby league. If you get a $10m grant, which they won\u2019t going forward, I believe if you want to sack a player or coach that should come off your grant.\u201d</p> <p>And now, as perhaps it always has been, it\u2019s all about the money. The jostling between broadcasters and ruling bodies is on in earnest. Cricket Australia is caught between the proverbial rock and hard place, arguing reasonably that if the coming summer is played in its entirety then their payments under the $1.18bn rights deal should not be reduced. But with Foxtel and Seven West Media in the grips of their own financial crises, squeezing blood out of stones won\u2019t serve the game in any shape or form. Where FFA and Rugby Australia end up on their next broadcast deals is anyone\u2019s guess. In striking a deal ahead of the 28 May resumption of the NRL season, Nine successfully argued crowd-less games were detrimental to the viewing experience. On these lines agreements will be reached.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/give-up-on-the-w-league-to-keep-a-league-going-thats-just-crazy\">Give up on the W-League to keep A-League going?

They now talk about the need for \u201ca test, track and trace\u201d policy.</p> \n<p>But critics said they are making a mistake by failing to talk about a tougher isolation response, which in some other countries involves a longer, 14-day period of quarantining for confirmed cases and asking some to quarantine in state facilities. China has even made forcible quarantining mandatory, although that is unlikely to occur in the UK.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee and a former health secretary, told the Guardian: \u201cThe key point about the success [of] South Korea and Taiwan is that it was as much a quarantining strategy as it was a contact tracing strategy, with the object to take out of circulation anyone who has Covid or is likely to have Covid.\u201d</p> \n<p>At No 10\u2019s daily press briefing, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England suggested the government could look at relocating care home residents sick with coronavirus to the largely empty Nightingale hospitals as part of the strategy to bolster quarantining in the future. However, they said it would have to be done carefully and was only one of the options under review.</p> \n<p>The UK may also consider asking those with confirmed coronavirus to quarantine for longer than the seven days currently required.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the House of Lords, James Bethell, a health minister, signalled this was actively under review. \u201cThe question of isolation remains one for which we are reviewing our advice. We are in constant contact with other countries to learn more about best practice,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the UK ought to require a 14-day period of isolation for those with symptoms, in line with the WHO. \u201cAt the moment it probably doesn\u2019t matter a great deal, because we\u2019re not trying to stop every transmission, but if we manage to get to the point where there are very low numbers in the community, letting people out before 14 days is a significant source of concern,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Under such circumstances, he said, more thought needs to be given to increasing compliance. \u201cOnce we\u2019re back to small numbers we cannot afford to allow rogue citizens to do what they like. There are undoubtedly people in the UK who ignore guidance. Not many, but some. A person like that could ultimately be responsible for going into a care home and introducing the infection, causing 20-30 residents to die over the next month. We\u2019ve got to take that seriously.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another expert, Devi Sridhar, the global public policy chair at the University of Edinburgh, said the government could consider recommending isolation outside the home if confirmed cases live with vulnerable people.</p> \n<p>\u201c\u2018Test, trace, isolate\u2019 only works if each of those components are included,\u201d she said. \u201cThere needs to be work in tandem across these three areas including on how incentives are created for people to isolate at home for 14 days or alternative housing arrangements if they live with elderly or vulnerable individuals.\u201d</p> \n<p>No 10 has repeatedly talked about the possibility that lockdown restrictions could be both loosened in some areas and tightened in other areas, as the government seeks a balance between returning to normal life and trying to avoid a second peak of the virus.</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, signalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/patel-uk-will-consider-quarantine-and-thermal-screening-at-borders\">tougher quarantining requirements</a> on new arrivals in the UK are also under consideration when she appeared before the home affairs committee on Wednesday. </p> \n<p>Further restrictions could include asking people to wear face coverings in enclosed public places, which is already recommended in Scotland.</p> \n<p>Social bubbles is one of the possible ways of easing restrictions, but other possibilities include letting some shops reopen, encouraging people to go back to work with staggered start times and social distancing, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-schools-across-england-reopen-phases-education-secretary-gavin-williamson\">reopening schools</a> with smaller class sizes and different opening hours.</p> \n<p>Asked on Wednesday whether the government was considering social bubbles, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe have said there\u2019s extensive work going on in government to look at the next phase of the coronavirus response and also talked about how we could relax measures in some areas and toughen them in others.

  "<p>The high street is shut, the world has ground to tortoise pace and people who previously bought sliced bread are spending hours <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-stress-baking-sourdough-kneading-relax\">nurturing sourdough starters</a>. So it could be a good time to learn a skill that can set you up for life: sewing.</p> <p>As the pandemic brings news of warehouse workers and drivers being forced to put themselves in harm\u2019s way to deliver clothes to our doorsteps, the need to slow down fashion has never been more pressing. As one recent report stated, the global fashion industry is a major factor in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/07/fast-fashion-speeding-toward-environmental-disaster-report-warns\">putting the planet on course for environmental disaster</a>, due to the throwaway nature of seasonal trends.</p> <p>One way to help tackle this is to stop buying new clothes \u2013 and to make the most of what you have. From mending and customising to darning, we asked the experts for tips on rejuvenating and repairing your wardrobe.</p> <h2><strong>Fixing holes</strong></h2> <p>\u201cDarning is easy,\u201d says Layla Totah, a sewing teacher at <a href=\"http://nestknitting.com/\">Nest in London</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s the same method for holes in socks as it is for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/22/how-to-mend-moth-holes\">moth holes</a> in jumpers.\u201d</p> <p>If you have never used a needle and thread, it would be worth going through the basics before you start darning. Totah recommends Wendy Ward\u2019s <a href=\"https://wendyward.wordpress.com/2019/09/05/new-book-sewing-basics-for-every-body/\">Sewing Basics for Every Body</a> and Tilly Walnes\u2019s <a href=\"https://shop.tillyandthebuttons.com/products/love-at-first-stitch\">Love at First Stitch</a> as good books for beginners. Lily Fulop\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.wwnorton.co.uk/books/9781682684344-wear-repair-repurpose\">Wear, Repair, Repurpose</a> has some good illustrations for newbies, too.</p> <p>Before starting to stitch, you will need something solid to put behind the hole, to make it easier to work on. If you don\u2019t have a wooden darning mushroom, Totah recommends an orange or a rounded glass. The idea is to create a weave to cover the hole. First, working from the fabric around the edge of the hole, stitch horizontally across the hole with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui6cZF6GPgQ\">running stitch</a>. Then, do the same vertically. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially creating an extra layer of fabric,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui6cZF6GPgQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ui6cZF6GPgQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>How to do a running stitch.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>If the hole is fairly big, you will have to make your stitches longer to cover it, but otherwise keep them small. Be careful not to stitch too tightly, as this can distort the hole.</p> <p>Use a yarn that is similar to the garment. \u201cSometimes knitted garments come with a length of the yarn that\u2019s been used to make it,\u201d says Lauren Guthrie, who owns the <a href=\"https://guthrie-ghani.co.uk/\">Guthrie and Ghani</a> sewing shop and school in Birmingham (it also has excellent online resources for beginner sewers). This is useful if you want to colour-match your repair job. If not, don\u2019t worry. \u201cYou can make it into a feature and use contrasting colours,\u201d says Totah. \u201cChoose a rainbow of colours and repair each hole in a different one. It looks really beautiful.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Bringing frayed jeans and jackets back to life</strong></h2> <p>Knees, bottoms, thighs and elbows have a tendency to fray \u2013 especially on denim. The simplest thing is to buy an iron-on denim patch. If you want to do it properly, though, you will need a sewing machine.</p> <p>Find a piece of denim that is bigger than the frayed area and is close in colour to the garment. Pin the fabric behind the frayed area and tack (roughly stitch) it in place. \u201cThen put it into the sewing machine,\u201d says Totah. \u201cGo backwards and forwards many times with a wide, tight zigzag stitch to create a dense mass of stitches all around the edges.\u201d Totah says you could also \u201cstitch within the patch itself. If you\u2019ve picked a matching thread, this should help to make it blend in.\u201d</p> <p>If it is a larger hole, Guthrie suggests making a feature of the repair with a patch. Totah suggests using a contrasting, textured fabric, such as flannel or corduroy. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEz-QspHLAg\">Straight stitch</a> or <a href=\"https://cyberseams.com/knitting/knitting-pattern-examples/knitting-tips-what-is-an-edge-stitch/\">edge stitch</a> around the patch by hand to attach it. You can make a feature of this, too. Totah points to the Japanese art of <em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/25/18274743/visible-mending-sashiko-mending-fast-fashion-movement\">sashiko</a></em> \u2013 a form of repair that is traditionally done with white thread on indigo fabric.</p> <h2><strong>Fixing hems and seams</strong></h2> <p>Again, this is pretty straightforward, says Totah. Iron-on webbing will do the trick quickly (be careful with synthetic fabrics under the heat of the iron, though). For a more thorough job, fold the hem over twice to fully cover the raw edge and, with a matching thread, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JWY8xwNUNPE\">catch stitch</a> your way around the hemline.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWY8xwNUNPE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JWY8xwNUNPE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>How to do a catch stitch.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>To do this, bring the needle up through the fold from behind with your first stitch, then, says Totah, \u201cat a diagonal angle, take another stitch on the garment, but only catching a few fibres. Repeat this, going back under the fold so that the stitch only goes into the folded fabric \u2013 the hem \u2013 and not into the outside of the trouser or skirt.\u201d The idea behind the stitch, she says, is that \u201cit doesn\u2019t show on the right side \u2013 you only see little pin pricks, if anything at all.\u201d</p> <p>Seams are even easier, says Totah. They can be done by hand or using a machine. \u201cSew on top of the original stitching line where it has come unattached, making sure to overlap some of the remaining stitches and back stitch at either end so it doesn\u2019t unravel,\u201d she says.</p> <h2><strong>Replacing</strong><strong> a button</strong></h2> <p>The basic method is to thread a needle and sew through the fabric and the buttonholes over and over until it is attached. But why not double up your thread to speed things up, says Totah. \u201cEach stitch will count for two.\u201d</p> <p>If you want to give your standard buttons some of the resilience of <a href=\"https://www.totallybuttons.com/shank-buttons/\">shank buttons</a> (those that are threaded through a loop of metal or plastic at the back), leave a few millimetres of thread each time you stitch the button, so that you are not pulling it tightly against the fabric. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve finished sewing it on, you\u2019ve created a little shank \u2013 wrap your thread around it a few times.\u201d This technique is particularly useful for replacing buttons on thick garments such as coats.</p> <h2><strong>Removing stains</strong></h2> <p>If you have clothes at the back of your wardrobe that you have not worn since that unfortunate incident with a bottle of red wine, there may be hope. The internet is awash with good stain removal advice, from the broad (<a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/remove-dried-fruit-stains-1900486\">how to rid items of fruit stains</a>) to the specific (<a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Silly-Putty-Out-of-Clothes\">how to get rid of Silly Putty</a>).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Learn to recognise your stain type \u2013 greasy, protein or tannin \u2013 and act accordingly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Lisa Ackerley, AKA <a href=\"http://thehygienedoctor.co.uk/\">the Hygiene Doctor</a>, recommends <a href=\"https://www.cleanipedia.com/gb/home.html\">cleanipedia.com</a>, while Stephanie Zia\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Done-Dusted-Organic-Home-Budget-ebook/dp/B003A01ZME/\">Clean: Organic Household Tips That Don\u2019t Cost the Earth</a> is full of ideas.</p> <p>With most stains, the Martha Stewart-approved rule of thumb is: act fast. But not always. \u201cSome stains are set by hot water, some by soap, some by ironing,\u201d says Zia. \u201cTrickier stains don\u2019t always come out the first time; for those, it is about repeating the process rather than acting fast.\u201d</p> <p>Stain removal is a vast field of science, but Zia has a few basic rules. Learn to recognise your stain type \u2013 greasy, protein or tannin \u2013 and act accordingly. For grease, say engine oil, use hot water and washing up liquid, but don\u2019t leave it soaking for too long. For protein stains, say cheese or sweat, use cold water and washing up liquid. For tannin stains, say coffee, perfume or spices, avoid soap, but do use hot water.</p> <p>Beware of combination stains, though \u2013 the way you would treat a straight-up coffee stain is complicated if you take yours white with sugar. Dye stains, she writes, such as from cherries or blueberries, \u201care one area where a commercial stain removal product is worth keeping handy in your store cupboard\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Repurposing</strong><strong> your old clothes</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e980217d2587710c9405f12c43de8247406d210e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e980217d2587710c9405f12c43de8247406d210e/213_0_1707_2133/800.jpg\" alt=\"These tie-dye joggers are \u00a344 from Urban Outfitters.

Alternatively, add texture by binding small objects such as coins and pebbles into your fabric.</p> <p>Transforming old jeans into shorts is a classic, and easy, way to repurpose them, says Totah. Cut to the length you want them to be, then \u201csew a line of stitching in the same colour around the hem \u2013 you\u2019d still have a raw edge, but it would be a barricade to stop it unravelling too much\u201d.</p> <p>Guthrie says: \u201cEmbroidery is also a lovely way to add some personalisation.\u201d Adding details to collars or back pockets can make old items sing again.</p> <p>If all these skills designed to extend the lifespan of your clothes have you feeling creative, maybe it is time to learn to make your own clothes. Start small, with a tote bag or a sunglasses case. Remember: even Versace had to start somewhere.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4\u2019s latest programme could be a sign of where television is heading in the pandemic era.</p> <p>Snoop Dogs, a rapidly commissioned series announced on Wednesday, recreates the feel of Through the Keyhole by offering viewers the chance to take a tour of a celebrity\u2019s house and guess who lives there. The twist is that because producers can\u2019t access people\u2019s homes due to physical distancing, the crew are strapping cameras to the celebrity\u2019s pets and sending the animals in to do the filming.</p> <p>The show\u2019s announcement \u2013 which immediately led to it being dubbed \u2018Through the Catflap\u2019 and \u2018Beagle\u2019s About\u2019 \u2013 comes amid warnings that broadcasters are at risk of running out of high-quality original television programmes due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Global television production ground to a halt in mid-March, destroying long-planned shooting schedules and leading to warnings that viewers will notice a lack of material on-screen for years to come. EastEnders, already broadcasting on a reduced schedule, is at risk of running out of new episodes by the summer, while this autumn\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing could be filmed without a studio audience.</p> <p>In response the industry is now seeking programmes that can be filmed while abiding by physical distancing rules \u2013 prompting talk of sending keen young actors, directors, and crew into long-term quarantine in order to restart filming and keep popular shows on air and the nation entertained. New series of long-running BBC shows such as The Apprentice, Top Gear, and Dragons\u2019 Den are also set to be delayed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"481417759afdd31f71d5bc786041cb449cff489c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/481417759afdd31f71d5bc786041cb449cff489c/0_0_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Characters from shows that are being delayed or cancelled due to coronavirus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Characters from shows that are being delayed or cancelled due to coronavirus.

Although his team pushed to finish filming on some projects in early March as it became apparent that the lockdown would shut down production \u2013 meaning they can now be edited remotely for broadcast \u2013 other programmes were less lucky.</p> <p>The result is that big Channel 4 programmes such as The Great British Bake Off have been delayed indefinitely, while production of some high-end scripted dramas were pulled off air mid-shoot. This raises questions about whether the original footage will have to be scrapped even if production can be resumed many months later.</p> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t scope to be making drama for quite a few months,\u201d said Katz, suggesting there may be an increased need to rely on archive footage as he announced new commissions such as Ramadan in Lockdown and Sex Tips in Isolation. He added that this posed a problem for broadcasters as audiences are desperate to watch shows that don\u2019t involve people trapped at home: \u201cThis craving for escapism is only going to get greater.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>His comments echo those made by Piers Wenger, head of BBC drama commissioning, who said on Tuesday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/29/bbc-could-quarantine-actors-and-crews-on-dramas-to-aid-filming\">one option under consideration by the corporation</a> is \u201cquarantining actors and crew in order to allow actors to interact in the same space\u201d.</p> <p>British-filmed productions are likely to be prioritised over foreign productions. Wenger said the BBC was also looking at ways to film new episodes while observing physical distancing rules by looking to the Australian television industry: \u201cThere are ways of cheating, actors being close enough together to act in a scene. Neighbours is experimenting with different ways of shooting while social distancing is in place.\u201d</p> <p>As a result the cost of unloved already-produced shows has suddenly jumped, with the likes of Netflix keen to use its chequebook to buy up programmes that had been filmed pre-lockdown but are available for purchase in certain territories. ITV Studios, which makes programmes for many broadcasters, has been advertising shows it made for audiences in the US and China which they hope to sell to broadcasters elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>There is also the risk that commercial broadcasters, who are currently seeing record-high viewing figures with record-low advertising income as the economy contracts, could be left with major gaps in their autumn and winter schedules. Channel 4 has already had to make enormous cuts to its programming budget in order to avoid financial collapse.</p> <p>Charlotte Moore, BBC director of content, told an Edinburgh TV festival session that audiences were tiring of programmes that look like they were filmed on videoconference calls and are instead yearning for more substantive and slick programmes.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very keen not everything is made on Zoom,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment people are enjoying \u2018we\u2019re all in it together\u2019 and seeing inside everyone\u2019s house \u2026 But there\u2019s also a massive appetite for all the flashy shows.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the first episode of <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/976412/index.html\" title=\"\">The Gentle Touch</a> in April 1980, Maggie Forbes was promoted to detective inspector and, hours later, became a widow when her police constable husband was murdered. It was a symbolic moment for British television: for once, in a police drama, men were getting sidelined and women moving to the front rank.</p> <p>Jill Gascoine, who has died aged 83, played DI Forbes in the trailblazing series from 1980 to 1984. \u201cThe Gentle Touch had been the first telly drama to base itself around a female copper,\u201d she told an interviewer in 2008. \u201cHelen Mirren and Prime Suspect came after me.\u201d</p> <p>Before The Gentle Touch, 1970s police dramas such as The Sweeney and The Professionals marginalised women so assiduously that they could readily be satirised decades later. Forbes was a new kind of detective. She tackled topical crimes involving prostitution, racism, euthanasia, antisemitism and mental health more empathetically than would have been possible for her predecessors.</p> <p>\u201cWe really should talk, woman to woman ... My name is Maggie,\u201d she told a sex worker in one episode. Forbes struggled not only with institutionalised sexism in the office (personified by her grumpy boss DCI Bill Russell, played by William Marlowe), but as a single mother with a troubled teenage son, Steve. Her heavy load was all too rarely lightened by romantic dalliances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68d7624ae46dd74f926e5cf58bba360c1c246d3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d7624ae46dd74f926e5cf58bba360c1c246d3a/0_0_2759_3000/920.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Gascoine, centre, in C.A.T.S.

Eyes, with Leslie Ash, left, and Tracy Ward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In The Gentle Touch there were fewer car chases than in traditional shows \u2013 possibly because Gascoine could not drive. In scenes on the road, her car was towed behind the camera truck. And such action as there was departed from convention. In one episode a woman, distraught after a breast cancer diagnosis, blew up the fictional Seven Dials police station with hand grenades, injuring Forbes. In another, Forbes went undercover as a sex worker, beating up a hooded assailant who tried to kidnap her.</p> <p>The Gentle Touch was created by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0270317/\" title=\"\">Terence Feely</a>, whose previous writing credits included The Avengers, The Saint and The Persuaders. It was a huge success \u2013 one 1982 episode was the fifth most popular programme that year, with more than 18 million viewers, one place higher in the ratings than a programme that carried on as if feminism had never happened, The Benny Hill Show.</p> <p>But Gascoine was not alone for long in the fight against small-screen sexism. Four months after The Gentle Touch aired on ITV, the BBC replied with <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/976585/index.html\" title=\"\">Juliet Bravo</a>, scripted by the former Sweeney writer Ian Kennedy Martin and featuring the struggles at a Lancashire police station of Inspector Jean Darblay, played by Stephanie Turner. </p> <p>The Gentle Touch changed the rules. That said, the writing was not always of the best. The young actor playing the sex worker had the stage name Lynda Marchal and she reckoned she could write more believable dialogue. Encouraged by Gascoine, she went on to do just that: using another pseudonym, Lynda La Plante, she wrote some of the most highly regarded woman-centred television crime drama, including Prime Suspect, first screened in 1991.</p> <p>As for Gascoine, once The Gentle Touch finished in 1984, she took the lead in another Feely drama, C.A.T.S. Eyes. Its premise was that Forbes had joined Eyes, a private detective agency in Kent, which was a front for an all-woman Home Office team, Covert Activities Thames Section. Gascoine was later disparaging about this sequel: \u201cC.A.T.S. Eyes got a bit silly \u2013 Charlie\u2019s Angels in Kent \u2013 and I was given a new love interest every week.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"20b0f22476f36b84bb39c8b2474c4caf3dc477a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20b0f22476f36b84bb39c8b2474c4caf3dc477a8/0_0_2156_3315/650.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Gascoine with her husband, the actor Alfred Molina, in 1994,\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Gascoine with her husband, the actor Alfred Molina, in 1994,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Davidson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After C.A.T.S.

She moved to Los Angeles in the 90s with her second husband, the actor Alfred Molina, and wrote three successful novels.</p> <p>Gascoine was born in Lambeth, south London, the daughter of Irene (nee Greenwood) and Francis Gascoine. After boarding school, she turned to acting and worked with Ken Loach at the Living theatre, Leicester, in the 60s, and at Dundee rep, where she met her first husband, Bill Keith, a hotelier. But the marriage ended in divorce: she earned \u00a328 a week in Dundee and lived with her two sons in a tiny flat, where her elder boy, Sean, had to sleep in his mother\u2019s bed, while his baby brother, Adam, slept in a drawer.</p> <p>During the 70s, she became well known for television roles in Z-Cars, General Hospital, Dixon of Dock Green, Softly, Softly: Taskforce and Within These Walls. She also had a regular role in the BBC period drama The Onedin Line as Letty, James Onedin\u2019s second wife.</p> <p>She met Molina when they starred together in the London production of the musical Destry Rides Again in 1982. \u201cIt was a classic showbiz tale,\u201d Molina recalled. \u201cWe met doing a musical western at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden, the romance developed during the show and we still haven\u2019t closed. Just moved to a bigger theatre.\u201d They married in 1986 and settled in Hollywood. Molina\u2019s career took off while Gascoine\u2019s roles dwindled, though she had parts in TV shows such as Northern Exposure, and did some theatre work in Los Angeles.</p> <p>She suffered for some years with clinical depression, which she said stemmed from her unhappy times as a child at boarding school. In 1995 she told an interviewer: \u201cI take a low dose of Prozac daily and, thank God, it has evened out my life. It doesn\u2019t take away the feeling of low days, but I just wanted to feel able to deal with day-to-day things. Sometimes it was so bad I couldn\u2019t pick up the phone.

  "<p>Among the many events cancelled this spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, one in particular stands out.</p> <p>The 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe, which takes place this May, was due to be a genuinely international occasion. In Berlin, 8 May was declared a public holiday and a major commemoration was planned. In London, there were to have been three days of celebrations, including a procession of war veterans down the Mall. Across the continent, thousands of street parties, concerts, festivals and commemorative church services were planned. Almost all of these events have now been called off \u2013 though today we learned that in the UK the Queen will address the nation and there will be some form of Vera Lynn singalong.</p> <p>For many veterans and survivors of the war, this would have been their last chance to take part in a major celebration of this kind. Sad though this is, perhaps it will give us time to rethink the way we remember the second world war. Commemorations in recent years have become toxic, divisive affairs.</p> <p>At the D-Day 75th-anniversary commemorations in Portsmouth last year, a steel wall had to be erected around the festival site: organisers were worried about demonstrations against Donald Trump, who was attending. Vladimir Putin was not even invited, and Russian officials responded to the snub by saying that D-Day was not worth commemorating anyway, because by that point in the war Russian heroes had already won all the truly important battles.</p> <p>Similar tensions have marred commemorations across Europe. This January, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/polish-president-pulls-out-of-holocaust-event-in-israel-over-snub\">pulled out of attending a Holocaust remembrance ceremony</a> in Jerusalem. He was angry that Putin would be delivering a speech there. Putin replied by boycotting a similar ceremony in Poland for the Auschwitz liberation anniversary.</p> <p>In Croatia, Serbs, Jews and Roma have for years refused to attend Holocaust commemorations, in protest against the rise of the Croatian far right. Jewish groups in Hungary and Austria did the same in 2014 and 2018, claiming that populists were hijacking the commemorations for their own purposes.</p> <p>The European parliament has become so concerned that last September it passed an extraordinary resolution condemning the growing trend across Europe to glorify fascists, communists and their many wartime collaborators. </p> <p>In such an atmosphere, taking a break this May might not be a bad thing. While we are confined to our homes on VE Day, perhaps we should use the time to take stock of what exactly it is we are remembering \u2013 and, just as importantly, what we are forgetting.</p> <p>In Britain we have come to view the war as a simplistic battle between absolute good and absolute evil. We have lost all appreciation of the hard moral choices we had to make along the way \u2013 particularly when it comes to the bombing war, or our abandonment of eastern Europe in 1945.</p> <p>Not all of our war veterans were saints and heroes, as they themselves were often the first to admit. During the commemorations of D-Day last year, the British war veteran Harry Billinge told a BBC interviewer that much of what is spoken today is \u201cbullshit\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me, and don\u2019t say I\u2019m a hero,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAll the heroes are dead.\u201d</p> <p>The American veteran Leonard Creo agreed. When I interviewed him before his death last Christmas, he told me that he wasn\u2019t interested in commemorations, because he found the cult of second world war heroism absurd. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more adulation every day that passes, because we\u2019re getting fewer and fewer,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty soon they\u2019ll see who\u2019s the last one. And then they\u2019ll put it all on one little guy, who could have been a cook or a clerk or something.\u201d</p> <p>In mainland Europe there is a corresponding cult of the martyr. At least 35 million people died there, and memories of the carnage still provoke strong feelings. But once again, not all of the victims were themselves entirely pure.</p> <p>Greece suffered terribly under German occupation. Yet as many people died at the hands of their own countrymen in the savage civil war that followed. In France, 1944-45 was not only a period of liberation \u2013 it was also months of head-shaving and vengeance on collaborators.</p> <p>One of the nations to suffer most in the war was Ukraine, where partisans waged a heroic war of resistance against both the Nazis and the Soviets \u2013 but they also conducted a murderous campaign against Polish and Jewish minorities. Are these people heroes, martyrs or monsters?</p> <p>Those who actually lived through 1945 remember how morally complicated life was at this time. Their generation understood that war was not something glorious, but something terrible from which no nation emerged with its morals intact. It is for this reason that our grandparents put aside their differences and set up a whole host of global institutions after 1945, including the United Nations, the European Union and the World Health Organization.</p> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/donald-trump-boris-johnson-coronavirus\">national leaders</a> are already comparing the current coronavirus crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-covid-19-response\">to the last war</a>. Perhaps it is time they followed our grandparents\u2019 example and learned to work together once again, to tackle Covid-19.</p> <p>If we can emerge with dignity and cooperation \u2013 and, crucially, without resurrecting old resentments \u2013 then perhaps we too will have something worth telling our own grandchildren about.</p> <ul> <li><p>Keith Lowe is the author of Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II. His new book, Prisoners of History, is published this July.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2020 to reflect the fact that, with the surrender of Germany, 8 May 1945 marked the end of the second world war in Europe.

  "<p>\u2018What about the Oscars?\u201d might not be the question at the top of your mind as you consider the manifold uncertainties raised by the coronavirus pandemic. A Hollywood awards ceremony scheduled for the end of February 2021, one might think, has fewer immediate concerns than most cultural institutions do right now. Yet panic has been rising within the Academy: the show itself may go on, but with cinemas closed for the foreseeable future and dozens of major titles either rescheduling or indefinitely delaying their release dates, will it have have enough standout films to celebrate?</p> <p>For some weeks now, the joke around the industry has been that Leigh Whannell\u2019s hit psychothriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/29/the-invisible-man-film-review\">The Invisible Man</a> \u2013 one of the few popular and critical successes to be released in the year\u2019s early months \u2013 may as well collect its gongs now. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/academy-awards-oscars-streaming-films-coronavirus\">a crucial rule change announced on Tuesday</a> by Academy CEO Dawn Hudson and president David Rubin has ensured that it will face some competition after all, even if its rivals never see the inside of a cinema.</p> <p>For the first (and, they claim, only) time, the Oscars are lifting anti-streaming rules, granting eligibility to \u201cfilms that had a previously planned theatrical release but are initially made available on a commercial streaming or VOD service\u201d \u2013 as long as they\u2019re put on a members-only streaming site within 60 days of their digital release. </p> <p>It\u2019s a change that ensures a film such as Eliza Hittman\u2019s acclaimed, festival-feted abortion drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/never-rarely-sometimes-always-review-powerful-abortion-drama\">Never Rarely Sometimes Always</a> still has a shot at Oscar glory. Having had its scheduled cinema release scrapped by the lockdown in March, the film\u2019s distributors opted to release it straight to VOD: a switch that in other years would have rendered it ineligible because the Academy required films under consideration to have a one-week theatrical run in Los Angeles county.</p> <p>It\u2019s a condition that famously forced Netflix to release prestige Oscar hopefuls including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/alfonso-cuaron-wins-best-director-oscar-for-roma\">Roma</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/04/why-the-irishman-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar\">The Irishman</a> in cinemas, though Academy members have shown resistance to their streaming overlords. Vocally led by such champions of the theatrical experience as Steven Spielberg, anti-Netflix sentiment in their ranks was thought to be a significant factor in Roma\u2019s contentious best picture loss last year, not to mention The Irishman\u2019s zero-for-10 wipeout at this year\u2019s ceremony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0892ae7c5b45d7ab5c8d18aa1d7937c1c97f1a76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0892ae7c5b45d7ab5c8d18aa1d7937c1c97f1a76/0_48_3095_1858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sidney Flanigan in a scene from Never Rarely Sometimes Always.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worthy contender \u2026 Sidney Flanigan in a scene from Never Rarely Sometimes Always.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angal Field/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now more conservative voters will have to adapt and accept online releases as, to haul out a ubiquitous phrase these days, a new normal. Even when cinemas do reopen, the Academy will have to adjust its restrictions. With the pileup of postponed films likely to exceed screen availability, Oscar-qualifying releases will need to be extended to include cities other than Los Angeles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/amc-us-cinema-chain-boycott-universal-studios-home-streaming\">AMC, largest cinema chain in US, announces boycott of Universal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hudson and Rubin were quick to stress that the new streaming rule is a one-time-only change, made to accommodate the extraordinary circumstances of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>. Still, at a time when the future of the cinema-release model is in doubt \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/amc-us-cinema-chain-boycott-universal-studios-home-streaming\">Universal having bluntly announced that the premium-VOD release approach</a> it took with Trolls: World Tour will continue to be its strategy when cinemas reopen \u2013 many in the industry are wondering if this is a genie the Academy can put back in the bottle.</p> <p>For now, voters can cling to some sense of tradition. The stipulation that films under consideration must have had a previously planned theatrical release still eliminates direct-to-Netflix fodder such as, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/15/to-all-the-boys-ps-i-love-you-netflix-sequel-lara-jean-lana-condor\">To All the Boys: PS I Still Love You</a> from contention. It raises more of a question mark in the case of, say, the buzzy Hugh Jackman film Bad Education, which premiered as a theatrical feature at Toronto last year but was repurposed for TV when it was acquired by HBO. That renders it ineligible for the Oscars even under the Academy\u2019s new rule, but the distinction is now a nominal one: surely it\u2019s only a matter of time before younger members ask what a theatrical release even means any more. As it stands, it took a global pandemic to finally accelerate a conversation that has been pressing on the Oscars for years.</p>",
  "<p>The white goods giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/whirlpool-corporation\">Whirlpool</a> <a href=\"https://washingmachinerecall.whirlpool.co.uk/\">is to recall an extra 55,000 washing machines </a>after identifying possible faults in a further 21 models, nearly five months after announcing its original recall of more than half a million units in UK homes which were at risk of catching fire.</p> <p>Up to 519,000 appliances sold under its Hotpoint and Indesit brands between October 2014 and February 2018 were a fire risk because they could be affected by a door lock flaw that could lead to overheating, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/17/whirlpool-washing-machines-to-be-recalled-over-fire-hazards-in-uk\">the US company admitted</a> in December last year.</p> <p>The company revealed today it has now located 210,000 affected machines on its original recall list \u2013 equivalent to 40% \u2013 since launching a national campaign to track them down in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/10/whirlpool-recall-washing-machine-fire-risk-hotpoint-and-indesit\"> January</a>. That month it added another 5,000 to the list.</p> <p>But today it further expanded the recall, saying the integration of Indesit\u2019s computer system with Whirlpool had recently revealed the additional \u201cat risk\u201d machines.</p> <p>More than 3.1 million people have now contacted the company to check if their washing machines are part of the recall, it added, while over 95% of these people have been given peace of mind that their appliances are not affected.</p> <p>The announcement, made in agreement with the government\u2019s Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) which is monitoring the situation, sought to reassure owners of the machines that might be faulty that they can still have them repaired by engineers or replaced \u2013 for free \u2013 during the lockdown. Engineers entering peoples\u2019 homes will be required to adhere to social distancing and will wear full personal protective equipment, it said.</p> <p>The company is continuing to advise consumers with affected models to unplug their machine until it can be repaired or replaced, or to wash at only 20C or colder if they have to use it. The alternative is washing by hand as public launderettes are now closed.</p> <p>Jeff Noel, a vice president of Whirlpool, said: \u201cWe remain committed to this recall in spite of the global coronavirus pandemic. With people spending more time at home under the current social distancing measures, it\u2019s more important than ever that this safety issue is tackled swiftly.\u201d</p> <p>Electrical safety and consumer groups expressed their concern that potentially dangerous machines were still in UK homes. Lesley Rudd, chief executive of the charity Electrical Safety First said: \u201cIt is alarming that five months into this recall we are only now hearing of these extra models which pose a risk to owners. This new discovery throws into question the robustness of the original investigation. It\u2019s vital that these machines are removed from people\u2019s homes as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The washing machine recall comes in the wake of criticism of Whirlpool for selling more than 5m fire-prone tumble dryers that the company failed to recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/24/indesit-and-hotpoint-issue-fire-risk-warnings-over-tumble-dryers\">for four years</a> until forced to do so by the government\u2019s regulator.</p> <p>Unlike the issues relating to the washing machine recall there were a number of high-profile fires linked to the recalled tumble dryers which were reported to have caused devastating damage.</p> <p>At the end of last year, Whirlpool agreed to pay an undisclosed amount in compensation to victims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/19/fire-crews-tackle-blaze-at-shepherds-bush-tower-block-london\">the Shepherds Court fire</a> which broke out in 2016, leaving many residents in the west London tower block needing alternative accommodation.</p>",

  "<p>In common with the many thousands of people whose lives have suddenly been devastated by Covid-19, Ken Sazuze cannot know exactly when the coronavirus landed on his family and wreaked its terrible damage. His wife, Elsie, was 44, a much-loved nurse, mother to their children, Anna, 16, and Andrew, 22; she was his soulmate and best friend, a \u201cgenuine person,\u201d he says. Elsie died on 8 April, on a ventilator, in Birmingham\u2019s Good Hope hospital.</p> \n<p>Ken believes she became infected sometime in that eerie, frightening week after Monday 16 March, when Boris Johnson\u2019s government reconsidered its previous light-touch approach, which had envisaged 60% of the population \u2013 40 million people \u2013 would become infected, and while many would die, the majority would recover and attain \u201cherd immunity\u201d. That week, although more physical distancing had been advised by Johnson, normal life mostly continued until the compulsory lockdown; pubs, restaurants and gyms stayed open, as did schools, until Friday 20 March. Sazuze, who served 10 years in the British army before studying to be a nurse himself, says he \u201cnever liked that herd immunity idea\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bfbec52fe2b60312f5f87f832ea1848727717a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bfbec52fe2b60312f5f87f832ea1848727717a3/28_225_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Elsie Sazuze\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsie Sazuze.

I strongly believe that if the government had acted more quickly we wouldn\u2019t have lost so many lives, and my wife could be here today.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, supported by Downing Street, has persistently denied that attaining herd immunity, by allowing the disease to infect most people, was ever a policy, goal, strategy or even \u201cpart of the plan\u201d. Well-placed government sources said on the strictest reading of the word \u201cpolicy\u201d that may be true. But they do not understand how the government can claim that herd immunity was not part of its plan.</p> \n<p>The Guardian\u2019s account of the government\u2019s response to the crisis is based on interviews with sources in or close to Downing Street, the Department of Health and Social Care, the Cabinet Office, Cobra and Sage, as well as other advisers and experts. Many asked not to be named, because they were not authorised to speak publicly. Some said that while they had concerns, they were holding back some of their criticism because they did not want to damage public trust in government at such a delicate time. All are wary of being wise in hindsight, and sympathetic to ministers who took decisions they felt were right at the time.</p> \n<p>But with Covid-19 having spread virulently, particularly during those first three weeks of March, more than 21,000 people have now died in hospitals alone and Britain is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-deaths-in-uk-hospitals-surpass-10000\">predicted to be possibly the worst affected country in Europe</a>. There are profound questions to be answered, about why Johnson\u2019s government stood alone among the countries of the world, pursuing that herd immunity approach, and why, when they realised stricter measures were needed, the lockdown was still delayed.</p> \n<p>Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead scientist on the Covid-19 response team at Imperial College London, whose <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">advice paper of 16 March</a> is credited with convincing the government to change course, responded extensively to questions from the Guardian for this article. He emphasised that one alarming estimate in that paper was not new: that under the \u201cmitigation scenario\u201d, which apparently envisaged herd immunity as one outcome, and included measures then being considered by the government, 250,000 people would die.</p> \n<h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2> \n<p>Viewed from today\u2019s unimaginably changed perspective, this year\u2019s pre-crisis months can seem like a parallel world. Johnson\u2019s media backers were feting him then for winning the \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d election, and his private life, since criticised by some as a distraction, was portrayed as a cause for national rejoicing when on 29 February he and Carrie Symonds announced their engagement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-1\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-31-january-2020\">took Britain out of the European Union</a> on 31 January, portraying the moment as an opportunity to \u201cunleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom.\u201d A day earlier, an emergency committee of the World Health Organization declared that Covid-19, which had broken out in China and spread to 18 countries, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">was a </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">public </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">health </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">emergency of </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">international </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">concern</a> (PHEIC). The WHO stated then, as it has emphasised throughout, that this highest state of alert required an immediate response. In the absence of a vaccine, the WHO insisted that the virus should be addressed like the operation mounted in South Korea, with extensive testing, tracing people with whom a person testing positive has had close contact, and isolating all of them, \u201cto interrupt virus spread\u201d.</p> \n<p>David Nabarro, the WHO Covid-19 envoy, told the Guardian that he and the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, knew then that the coronavirus was going to become \u201chuge\u201d and would be \u201creally difficult\u201d for governments.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoronaviruses are horrible,\u201d Nabarro said. \u201cThey\u2019re rather stable and incredibly well designed to wreak havoc among populations because they are very, very easy to transmit and quite tough to contain. You can\u2019t just let this thing go, and let it wash over your society, because it will kill lots of old people, and a few younger people, it will make hospitals into a big mess, and it will endanger health workers.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 3 February, Johnson made <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">another triumphal Brexit speech</a>, in which he even sounded a note against responding too strongly to Covid-19, arguing it ran counter to his vision of Britain as a \u201csupercharged champion\u201d of global free trade.</p> \n<p>He was labelled a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/28/boris-johnson-not-to-hold-coronavirus-crisis-meeting-cobra-until-monday\">\u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d</a> by the Labour opposition on 28 February, after he spent 12 days away at the Chevening country residence in Kent, and did not attend four of the first five meetings of the Cobra committee, convened to consider Britain\u2019s response to Covid-19, until one on Monday 2 March. He did go to a meeting in late February, attended by senior officials, but only very briefly, without making a substantial contribution, which one attendee says seemed strange. Asked about this, a Downing Street spokesperson clarified that Johnson went to be updated on coronavirus, and left after that.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s decision-making on Covid-19 has since become a focus of fierce scrutiny and much criticism, partly for its lack of transparency. Cobra, the forum for considering emergencies, attended by ministers and their officials, meets in secret. It takes scientific advice from Sage, whose membership was not made public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-whos-who-on-secret-scientific-group-advising-uk-government-sage\">until the Guardian revealed the names of participants</a>. They included Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, and another Downing Street adviser, Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, and is said by one Sage attendee to have \u201cbehaved as Cummings\u2019 deputy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Supposed to be impartial and free from political influence, Sage responds to questions passed down from Cobra. Its own makeup has been criticised by some as too narrow, overly reliant on epidemiologists who specialise in mathematical modelling. One participant told the Guardian that Sage lacked diversity and was \u201cway too slow\u201d to consider how other countries, including those in south Asia, were managing to contain the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, rejected those criticisms, saying the scientists are engaged with experts in other countries and \u201ccontainment strategies form part of those discussions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sage receives advice from three expert groups: Nervtag, which examines the science of the virus itself; SPI-M, which models how it spreads; and SPI-B, which involves behavioural scientists in considering how people may respond to restrictive measures.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902rB07aqC7wGcf/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902rB07aqC7wGcf/\">graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Following initial criticism, the government has published some details, making public the Nervtag membership and minutes of meetings, and some limited papers from SPI-M and SPI-B. Yet even these few documents do establish that Covid-19\u2019s catastrophic threat to life was communicated clearly to ministers by the scientific advisers.</p> \n<p>On 2 March, a brief \u201cconsensus statement\u201d from SPI-M reported very stark assessments to Sage. \u201cIt is highly likely that there is sustained transmission of Covid-19 in the UK at present,\u201d it said. The coronavirus was noted to be highly contagious, with each infected person infecting two to three more. If \u201cstringent measures\u201d were not imposed, \u201cit would correspond to around 80% of the population [53 million people] becoming infected\u201d. SPI-M\u2019s best estimate of the death rate was 0.5% to 1%: between 250,000 and 500,000 people. Of those requiring hospital treatment, 12% were likely to die. If, like Elsie Sazuze, they needed to be put on a ventilator, they had only a 50% chance of survival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-2\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet somehow, the genuine peril and need to act fast was not seized on by the government. The first phase of a plan to contain the virus with testing and tracing was ended on 12 March, and the policy moved to try to delay the peak of the infection. Later, the plan was for \u201cmitigation\u201d, for a series of measures to be gradually brought in: \u201ccase isolation\u201d of seven days for somebody who felt they had symptoms, then \u201chousehold isolation\u201d for everybody living with them to quarantine themselves for 14 days, then at some point, to shield elderly and vulnerable people.</p> \n<p>The day after the 2 March Cobra meeting and SPI-M statement, Johnson held the first televised press conference with Vallance and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Whitty did say solemnly that a worst-case scenario estimated 80% of people could become infected, and 1% of those could die, but the message best remembered is Johnson joshingly telling the nation: \u201cI was at a hospital the other night where I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd75780859586d069ccd9d3e98a86ffa764bccdc/0_434_6517_3911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson flanked by Chris Whitty, left, and Patrick Vallance, during a news conference 3 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson flanked by Chris Whitty, left, and Patrick Vallance, during a news conference on 3 March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s advice was: \u201cWe should all basically just go about our normal daily lives.\u201d He also advised: \u201cThe best thing you can do is to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the next fortnight, as Italy moved to impose a lockdown, France and Spain began to do the same, and Germany embarked on physical distancing measures coupled with Europe\u2019s most extensive testing and contact tracing operation, Britain did comparatively little. Hand-washing was still the main advice, along with case isolation of people feeling symptoms.</p> \n<p>The first official report of somebody dying in hospital having tested positive for Covid-19 caught in the UK came on 5 March. Still, elderly and vulnerable people were not given any advice to shield themselves. A member of one Sage advisory committee said that around this time there was a gap between the scientific advice and political messaging. \u201cThe prime minister was going around shaking people\u2019s hands to demonstrate that there wasn\u2019t a problem. There was a disconnect at that point. We were all slightly incredulous that that was happening.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some experts believe Britain\u2019s exceptional response arose in part because government preparations for a pandemic were so weighted to a flu outbreak. Prof Graham Medley, a Sage member and the chair of SPI-M \u2013 which stands for scientific pandemic influenza \u2013 modelling \u2013 explains. \u201cEverything \u2013 government preparedness, the modelling \u2013 was based on pandemic influenza. And that\u2019s not because of lack of awareness on our part, that\u2019s because that got the government attention and the funding. We could persuade them that flu was important.\u201d The group\u2019s terms of reference were eventually broadened to include different kinds of pandemic but the emphasis lingered.</p> \n<p>Scientists are used to seeing flu spread through populations very fast, then become milder as it mutates, and to seeing people indeed develop immunity and populations become resistant. Covid-19 is lethally different, new, its properties more uncertain, and the idea of addressing it by allowing it to move through the population and attain herd immunity was widely condemned for risking far too many lives.</p> \n<h2><strong>Herd immunity</strong></h2> \n<p>Given the repeated denials, it can be overlooked that the reason the world believes that attaining herd immunity was the government\u2019s approach is largely because Vallance said it was. On Friday 13 March, when the virus was spreading exponentially, he set out publicly to explain the government\u2019s strategy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-3\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOur aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely,\u201d Vallance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">explained on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme</a>: \u201cAlso, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity, so more people are immune to this disease, and we reduce the transmission. At the same time, we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked on Sky News what proportion of the population would need to become infected to achieve herd immunity, Vallance replied: \u201cProbably about 60% or so.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ac61c94c4cb5321daef12f99ac894d0ee70d048\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ac61c94c4cb5321daef12f99ac894d0ee70d048/0_211_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds in the stands during day four of the Cheltenham Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds in the stands during day four of the Cheltenham Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Few mitigation measures were yet put in place. The week is remembered for the mega-events that went ahead: the Cheltenham Festival of horseracing, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, the Stereophonics concert in Cardiff. In allowing them, the government was indeed, as it consistently said, following the UK science that, surprisingly to many, considers that \u201cmass gatherings\u201d do not have a major impact on virus transmission. The numbers of people infected will almost certainly never be known, but the pictures of packed stands, particularly at Cheltenham, have become emblems of the government\u2019s delay and inaction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-early-coronavirus-events\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-early-coronavirus-events&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-early-coronavirus-events</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On 11 March, the WHO formally declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Tedros, the director general, maintained that the virus spread could still be confronted, and criticised \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by some countries.</p> \n<p>That same day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">a further explanation of the government\u2019s strategy</a> was given by Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, which it advises. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you\u2019ll want to cocoon, you\u2019ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don\u2019t catch the disease, and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity\u2019s been achieved in the rest of the population.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">press conference the following day</a>, Johnson famously said: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whitty announced then that the initial effort to contain the disease by testing and tracing had been abandoned, yet despite that, and Johnson\u2019s dire warning, the measures discussed for the new \u201cdelay\u201d phase were almost negligible. People over 70 were advised not to go on cruises. Johnson said even \u201chousehold quarantine\u201d would not be required until sometime \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf\">published plan</a> did say that social distancing and school closures could be considered.</p> \n<p>That evening, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt spoke on the BBC, saying he was concerned Britain had become an \u201coutlier\u201d. Hunt says now he became worried that Whitty was too resigned to the virus spreading: \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why they were so certain that nothing could be done to stop nearly 60% of our population becoming infected, when I had figures showing that even in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak in China, less than 1% of the population actually became infected.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vallance made his media appearances the following day, explaining the herd immunity approach. He was asked on Sky News why in the UK \u201csociety was continuing as normal\u201d, and it was put to him that a 60% infection rate would mean \u201can awful lot of people dying\u201d. Vallance replied that it was difficult to estimate the number of deaths, but said: \u201cWell of course we do face the prospect, as the prime minister said yesterday, of an increasing number of people dying.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49816b747a8b3331eb855f242f53b8cb6e0afc20\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49816b747a8b3331eb855f242f53b8cb6e0afc20/0_115_2127_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, arrives for a meeting at Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock, the health secretary, arrives for a meeting at Downing Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vedat Xhymshiti/News Pictures/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, issued the first denial that herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s plan, despite Halpern and Vallance having days earlier indicated that it was, in a column in the Sunday Telegraph on 15 March. \u201cWe have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists,\u201d Hancock wrote. \u201cHerd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.\u201d</p> \n<p>By then, a dizzying number of experts were sounding the alarm. An <a href=\"http://maths.qmul.ac.uk/~vnicosia/UK_scientists_statement_on_coronavirus_measures.pdf\">open letter</a> issued on 14 March dismissing herd immunity as \u201cnot a viable option\u201d and calling for stricter social distancing measures so that \u201cthousands of lives can be spared\u201d was signed by more than 500 UK scientists.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the evidence that appears to have prompted the change of course was contained in the Imperial College paper, published on 16 March.</p> \n<h2><strong>A political decision</strong></h2> \n<p>Ferguson\u2019s paper has been greatly reported on but somewhat misunderstood. It did suddenly warn that the NHS would be overwhelmed \u201ceight-fold\u201d, resulting in \u201chundreds of thousands of deaths\u201d if the government did not change its strategy from mitigation to \u201csuppression\u201d. But the reason was comparatively technical: experience in Italy and of the first UK cases had shown that double the number of intensive care beds was required than previously estimated. The paper sets out the measures that would apparently comprise a mitigation policy, which the government was then planning: \u201cCase isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f19e9999c03fdf7122b1f2a0208fb53279f9175\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f19e9999c03fdf7122b1f2a0208fb53279f9175/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Ferguson, professor at Imperial College London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Ferguson, professor at Imperial College London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Angus/Imperial College London</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ferguson made it clear to the Guardian that the estimate in that paper of 250,000 deaths was not new and was based on \u201cthe mitigation scenario\u201d. The paper indicated that, in effect, the virus had to be allowed to spread initially, so that over time people would become infected, recover, and attain immunity: \u201cIntroducing such interventions too early risks allowing transmission [of the virus] to return once they are lifted (if insufficient herd immunity has developed).\u201d</p> \n<p>Ferguson held a press conference on 16 March to explain the new findings. His colleague, Prof Azra Ghani, said: \u201cUnder strategies we were pursuing, we were expecting a degree of herd immunity to build up. If we now realise it\u2019s not possible to cope with that in the current health system, and it may not be acceptable in terms of the numbers, then we need to try and reduce transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked Ferguson how that policy could be contemplated, if it predicted that 250,000 people would die. He emphasised that he was never sanguine about people dying, and made it very clear that it was the politicians, not the scientists, who decided on policies to pursue. \u201cWhile policy can be guided by scientific advice, that does not mean scientific advisers determine policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I do try to make it clear to policymakers what the potential consequences of different policies might be, to the extent the science allows.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Graham Medley, another Sage member, and chair of its influential modelling subcommittee, agreed that while the scientists gave their analysis on the epidemic to inform the politicians, deciding what to do was \u201ca political decision\u201d. Medley told the Guardian that Johnson, Hancock and other ministers continually saying they have been guided by the scientists has \u201csometimes gone a bit past the mark\u201d. Asked if he meant that the politicians were passing the buck, Medley replied: \u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018Drastic action\u2019 needed</strong></h2> \n<p>Even after the stark warning that the NHS would be overwhelmed if the policy did not change, Johnson and his government still hesitated. He made another speech that day in which he advised \u201cdrastic action\u201d was now needed, but the measures were advisory and still tentative. People over 70, pregnant women, and those with some health conditions were advised only to \u201cavoid all unnecessary social contact\u201d. Britons were asked \u201cwhere they possibly can\u201d to work from home, and Johnson told them \u201cyou should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d, although all were permitted to stay open.</p> \n<p>The delay to introducing stricter measures, until the lockdown was finally ordered on 23 March, appears to have been at least partly based on a flawed misreading of the government\u2019s own scientific advice. In early March, Whitty mentioned the idea that the government should wait to impose restrictions because people might tire of them, later saying this was based on both \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cbehavioural science\u201d. \u201cWhat we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock supported that, suggesting it was the result of official advice. \u201cThe evidence of past epidemics and past crises of this nature shows that people do tire of these sorts of social distancing measures, so if we start them too early, they lose their effect and actually it is worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe social science and the behavioural science are a very important part of the scientific advice that we rely on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet this concept of \u201cfatigue\u201d was rejected by the behavioural scientists appointed by the government itself to Sage\u2019s subcommittee, SPI\u2013B. \u201cThe word was never used in any of our committee reports,\u201d said Susan Michie, a SPI-B member. \u201cIt is just not a concept that exists in behavioural science, and it was unhelpful for it to be used.\u201d Four other members of SPI-B also told the Guardian that the committee never advised that people would tire of restrictive measures.</p> \n<p>The publicly available summaries of their conclusions show the group advised that people should be given clear explanations and reasons for social distancing measures, and warn that those measures would affect people unequally, but nowhere do they suggest that people will become \u201cfatigued\u201d. Three behavioural scientists on SPI-B, Stephen Reicher, John Drury and Clifford Stott, even wrote an article for <a href=\"https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/two-psychologies-and-coronavirus\">the Psychologist journal</a>, rejecting the notion of \u201cfatigue\u201d and suggesting that delaying stricter social distancing measures on that premise was taking a risk with lives. \u201cPsychological considerations were put at odds with what medical science demanded,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that Halpern\u2019s Behavioural Insights Team, or \u201cnudge unit\u201d, was also opposed to this view that people would tire of restrictive measures. One senior Whitehall source said Whitty himself was the main advocate of the \u201cfatigue\u201d notion, based partly on his own experience of patients in medical practice who do not see drug prescriptions through to their completion.</p> \n<p>A Downing Street spokesperson, responding on behalf of Whitty, emphasised that he was indeed concerned about timing interventions, and their impact on people\u2019s wellbeing if introduced too early, and that Sage had agreed a balance needed to be struck between the impact of measures, and the time the public could feasibly sustain them.</p> \n<p>During the week after 16 March, there was a fierce debate within government about whether a stricter lockdown needed to be imposed. \u201cSeveral of us thought measures needed to be introduced earlier,\u201d one source close to the Cabinet Office said. Hancock appears to have been under great pressure, stretched between that view and resistance elsewhere to taking genuinely drastic action. A senior source at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recalled discussions about the herd immunity policy continuing, despite Hancock having disowned it, and a senior official still advocating it. \u201cHis basic view was that we were all going to develop antibodies, and ultimately the question was how to manage the release of the disease into the population over time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary is said by another well-placed source to have argued forcefully for a lockdown in one Cobra meeting, chaired by Michael Gove, with a junior treasury minister who was resisting due to its huge economic impact and worries that a lockdown would itself kill many people. The source said Hancock kept referring to the modelling that predicted deaths would surge dramatically without a lockdown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b533fe0d3483449e7a91d766872021d58755ce4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b533fe0d3483449e7a91d766872021d58755ce4/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings, the chief adviser to Boris Johnson, listens during a press conference at Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings, the chief adviser to Boris Johnson, listens during a press conference at Downing Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The DHSC source sums up this period soberly: \u201cThey knew we would have to go into lockdown; they were debating when. Every single day they wasted, every day we weren\u2019t in lockdown, was resulting in people contracting the disease \u2013 people who have since died.\u201d</p> \n<p>One source on Sage said there was also nervousness among their group that week, a feeling that the virus was getting out of control and they were not sure the politicians understood its exponential spread. The advice was being communicated, the source said, but they were told that Whitty and Vallance were having to cajole the politicians in the right direction, and there was \u201cfriction\u201d.</p> \n<p>Reflecting on the presence at Sage of Cummings and Warner, some attendees now say the group\u2019s deliberations were affected by a sense of what could feasibly be done, with a government run by politicians to whom a lockdown looked unthinkable, although others say they were not. Then, that week, when stricter measures were needed, some say it was useful to have Cummings there, because they knew he would communicate that directly to Johnson.</p> \n<p>One source in Downing Street who personally urged the prime minister to stop delaying and move into lockdown that week said his reticence was partly down to his \u201clibertarian instinct\u201d. \u201cThere was also a bit of \u2018rabbit caught in headlights\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Incubation</strong></h2> \n<p>Ken Sazuze remembers that week very well. He and Elsie, who grew up together in Malawi before he came to Britain and joined the army, were worried, he recalls, particularly about Elsie working without personal protective equipment suitable for Covid-19, and about the coronavirus spreading in Birmingham. She had moved last year from working in NHS hospitals to caring for people in nursing homes, so she could have more regular shifts and help Anna with her GCSEs. That week, Anna\u2019s school was open, Andrew was travelling on public transport to Wolverhampton University, where he is in the third year of a finance degree. Ken was on a placement during the final year of his nursing degree, while Elsie was working.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was still life as normal,\u201d he says. \u201cEverywhere was open. People weren\u2019t social distancing; they didn\u2019t know what to do. We went to the gym, to the shops, to uni, to the library.\u201d On Wednesday 18 March, they went into Birmingham, to the Bullring, shopping for presents for Anna, whose 16th birthday was 10 days away. They went to Marks &amp; Spencer looking for perfume, he remembers, and to an Apple store, where they bought her some AirPods.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were infecting ourselves,\u201d Ken says. \u201cI am really annoyed when I start thinking about it too much. I am furious with the government, with people making decisions, that the virus was spreading at that time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Given the incubation period of Covid-19, Boris Johnson may have contracted the virus that week too. The nation was given the highest profile demonstration of Covid-19\u2019s destructive force, as the prime minister went into hospital days later, then into intensive care. While there was great sympathy for Johnson undergoing that personal ordeal, some experts have argued that the spectacle of Johnson, Cummings, Hancock, Whitty and other advisers contracting the virus indicated that the government was not taking social distancing seriously enough. One source in Downing Street the week before the lockdown said they were surprised to find staff at No 10 still shaking hands with visitors.</p> \n<p>A Downing Street spokesperson made clear they do not accept that Johnson should have been more careful, saying that No 10 did enforce social distancing where practical.</p> \n<h2><strong>Lockdown</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"chapter-3\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On 23 March, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">lockdown was finally imposed</a>, Johnson clasping his hands during his televised address to the nation, telling people they must stay at home, to save lives and protect the NHS, and go out only for exercise and to shop for essentials.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c0a1eab18566d58074eefc22ca0781e254b7e73\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c0a1eab18566d58074eefc22ca0781e254b7e73/0_350_5437_3262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson addresses the nation on 23 March, announcing the UK would be placed in lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson addresses the nation on 23 March, announcing the UK would be placed in lockdown.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That week, apart from work, Sazuze says he and Elsie only went to Asda and Costco. But on Wednesday 25 March, Elsie began to feel unwell. The unthinkable happened very quickly. Three days later, at 2am, she was struggling with her breathing and had a very high temperature, so they called an ambulance which took her to hospital. By 2 April, Ken had a call with her, on FaceTime, before she was put on a ventilator.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was my last goodbye with my wife,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew it was 50-50 if she went on the ventilator. She said: \u2018Ken, I\u2019ve prayed, I\u2019ve talked to the doctor, I\u2019m happy to do this. I love you, and if anything happens, you look after the children.\u2019 I told her: \u201cHoney, come on, let\u2019s think positive; let\u2019s not think you\u2019re not going to pull through.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"714064e2c147c41f5cffff3703886e87a5b8decb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/714064e2c147c41f5cffff3703886e87a5b8decb/0_14_1125_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elsie Sazuze and her family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsie Sazuze with her husband, Ken, and their daughter, Anna, 16, and son, Andrew, 22.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They were called on 8 April at 1am and told to rush to the hospital.

A spokesperson replied in a statement:</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice. We are so grateful for the response of the public, who have helped us to slow the spread of the virus and stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. The government has been working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives. Herd immunity has never been a policy or goal. We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs, made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it and taken unprecedented steps to support businesses and workers, to protect the economy.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spokesperson for Vallance said: \u201cHerd immunity was a scientific point, that ultimately immunity is an important way to tackle infectious disease, ideally through vaccination.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ken Sazuze says he understood that this was an unprecedented pandemic, but could not understand how the government could say its response had been faultless. \u201cI\u2019m in a different world now,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s something you can\u2019t believe. I am angry as well. It would help if they accept their mistakes and apologise. It was slow, the testing and PPE was not adequate, and this virus was allowed to spread.

  "<p>The chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland has stepped into the debate over the staging of last month\u2019s Cheltenham Festival by suggesting that the event should \u201cprobably\u201d not have taken place because of growing concerns about spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>In the course of a 30-minute <a href=\"http://sportforbusiness.com/sport-for-business-leadership-series-brian-kavanagh/?utm_source=Sport+for+Business+Daily+Digest+Guest+Edition+April+2020&amp;utm_campaign=d6867aa73e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_03_29_02_03_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5dd42c3ae0-d6867aa73e-137763345\">interview with the website Sport For Business</a>, which also focused on Irish racing\u2019s response to the crisis, Brian Kavanagh was asked whether he thought that Cheltenham should have \u201cpulled the shutters down\u201d in the middle of its four-day Festival meeting, which ran from 10 to 13 March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">Experts call for inquiry into local death toll after Cheltenham Festival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting, that was the very week where the whole thing ramped up with coronavirus,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cI went there for the first two days and it was remarkable that I came back to a different country on Wednesday night to the one I left on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cI think on Tuesday, the images from Italy started to come through in great detail and by the end of that week, we were racing behind closed doors in Ireland. I think with hindsight, people would recognise that Cheltenham would have been much better if it went behind closed doors, not a decision that we have any control over, it\u2019s entirely a matter for the British authorities and the British government.</p> <p>\u201cSocial distancing as we know it now was not really that well known at that time. The irony is that while Cheltenham was going ahead and people were at the races, the pubs back in Ireland were packed with people watching Cheltenham, but it certainly couldn\u2019t have come at a worse week, it was unfortunate because it was the last major sporting event to take place. Should it have taken place? With hindsight, probably no but everyone\u2019s wise after the event.\u201d</p> <p>Kavanagh adds that he has \u201csome sympathy for the Cheltenham authorities\u201d as \u201cthe idea of saying in the middle of their Festival, we\u2019re aborting after two days or we\u2019re going behind closed doors when your government is telling you not to, the government is saying that we\u2019re happy for you not to and when you\u2019ve got so many people in situ, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days, figures showing that Gloucestershire hospitals NHS trust, which covers Cheltenham, has recorded more deaths from coronavirus than a number of neighbouring trusts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">led to calls</a> for an inquiry into whether allowing the Festival to go ahead was to blame. However, the raw data did not account for the relative sizes of the trusts, the social or age profiles of their catchment areas or their population densities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/revealed-three-uk-sporting-events-may-have-led-coronavirus-death/\">Figures published </a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/revealed-three-uk-sporting-events-may-have-led-coronavirus-death/\">this week by Edge Health</a>, a private firm which supplies data analysis for healthcare providers, also claimed to show that the Cheltenham Festival, the Champions League match between Liverpool and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on 11 March and the Manchester derby on 8 March had all resulted in an increase of between 2.5 and 3.5 daily deaths in local hospitals \u201c20 to 35 days later\u201d.</p> <p>Between 60,000 and 68,000 spectators attended each day of the Festival seven weeks ago, including an estimated 10,000 who travelled from Ireland for one or more days of the meeting. By 2 April, three weeks after the final day, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/racing/cheltenham-faces-criticism-after-racegoers-suffer-covid-19-symptoms-1.4219458\">only one spectator from Ireland</a> was known to have tested positive for Covid-19, and it was unknown when or where he had been infected.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the people who were at Cheltenham, they came back, they did the responsible thing, they self-isolated,\u201d Kavanagh said, \u201cand we moved immediately behind closed doors after the Taoiseach [Leo Varadkar] made his speech on 12 March so by Friday 13<sup>th</sup> [the day of the Cheltenham Gold Cup] we were behind closed doors for 10 days until the general lockdown. Cheltenham, it was the very week when the thing ramped up.\u201d</p>",

The judgment asserts the term \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 are not gender-bound while simultaneously forcing registration according to the transgender individual\u2019s birth gender. This is not only an unjustifiable interference in his rights to a family and private life, but even domestic legislation in the UK birth allows other individuals on birth certificates to be identified simply as \u2018parents\u2019.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If you asked Bob May, Lord May of Oxford, to explain the bewildering eclecticism of his scientific interests, he would say that he liked playing games and solving puzzles. His idea of play was anything but frivolous: to him mathematics was \u201cno more \u2013 and no less \u2013 than thinking very clearly about something\u201d. The things he chose to think about were complex systems: from modelling the survival of species in diverse ecosystems to the spread of Aids, and, later, the stability of global finance.</p> <p>An uncompromising and bluntly spoken Australian, May, who has died aged 84, reached the highest levels of the British scientific and political establishment. As chief scientific adviser to the government from 1995 to 2000, he shook up the cosy relationship between politicians and the scientific community, and made both think about the public they served. A scientific career conducted across three continents ensured that his ecological models, forensically developed and delivered with exemplary clarity, have been influential internationally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/07/letter-lord-may-of-oxford-obituary\">Letter: Lord May of Oxford obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He first came to prominence in 1973 when he challenged the conventional wisdom that simpler ecosystems, such as the monocultures developed through commercial farming, are more vulnerable to collapse than more complex ecosystems containing many different species. His book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691088617/stability-and-complexity-in-model-ecosystems\" title=\"\">Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems</a>, published that year, showed mathematically that in a system with multiple species competing for resources, the more species there were, the less stable was the system as a whole.</p> <p>This theoretical challenge provoked numerous field studies, concluding that diverse systems were generally more stable in the real world, but that stability depended critically on the nature of the relationships (such as predator and prey) within the community. Even diverse environments, such as rainforests and coral reefs, can still be highly vulnerable to changes they have not evolved to withstand.</p> <p>He next explored mathematically why the number of individuals of a particular species might vary from year to year, often quite unpredictably. He showed that relatively constant numbers, cyclic boom and bust, or wildly unpredictable fluctuations, could all be explained by the same equation, with very small variations in initial conditions such as the number of animals or the rate of reproduction. This was one of the first applications of chaos theory to biology.</p> <p>Although May enjoyed such puzzles for their own sake, he believed strongly in the responsibility of the scientist to work for the benefit of society. With the advent of the Aids crisis in the 1980s, he turned to studying the spread of infection. A model he developed with <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/roy.anderson\" title=\"\">Roy Anderson of Imperial College London</a> accurately predicted the rapid transmission of HIV in communities where encounters with multiple sexual partners were the norm.</p> <p>Even May\u2019s closest friends were flabbergasted when he was offered, and accepted, the post of government chief scientist in 1995. With his wiry frame habitually dressed for hiking, and a taste for explicit language that was unusual in a university, never mind a government department, it seemed implausible that he, his civil service colleagues or his political masters would cope. But the headhunters had done their job well.</p> <p>Despite a professed dislike of administration, May had in fact served for several years as chair of the research board at Princeton, New Jersey (effectively vice-president for research), and was on the boards of trustees of both the Natural History Museum and the Joint Nature Conservancy Council.</p> <p>He put on a shirt and tie, rolled up his sleeves, and proved \u2013 mostly \u2013 a very civil scientific adviser. As he later related to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qEboMbL_Wwc\" title=\"\">Australian broadcaster Robyn Williams</a>, the then Tory minister William Waldegrave told May that he was probably the first person to use the word \u201cbullshit\u201d in the Cabinet Office \u2013 adding that \u201che hoped he wouldn\u2019t be the last\u201d. He was then able to do what he liked best: to \u201cunderstand the points of leverage on a complex system and what you ought to be doing to make it work better\u201d.</p> <p>May was born in Sydney, Australia, the elder son of Kathleen (nee McCredie) and Henry May. Henry\u2019s Irish Protestant parents had fled to Australia after being threatened by the IRA; he qualified as a lawyer but developed a serious problem with alcohol. Henry and Kathleen divorced when Bob was seven years old, and the boys grew up in their grandparents\u2019 house. Perhaps in response to this history, Bob was a lifelong teetotaller.</p> <p>Though, by his own account, \u201csolitary\u201d as a child, he topped every subject at the academically rigorous Sydney boys\u2019 high school, while also participating in award-winning debating teams. A favourite teacher influenced his decision to study chemical engineering at the University of Sydney, but he graduated in 1956 in physics and mathematics. He went on to complete a PhD in superconductivity and continued research in theoretical physics.</p> <p>During a postdoctoral stint at Harvard in the US he met Judith Feiner, then an undergraduate at <a href=\"https://www.brandeis.edu/\" title=\"\">Brandeis University</a>. They married after his return to Australia in 1962, and he credited her with supporting his subsequent intercontinental moves. She pursued her own career in publishing.</p> <p>In the late 60s, as professor of physics, he joined a group of scientists for social responsibility who were concerned about human impacts on the environment. Reading around the subject led him to undertake his work on stability and diversity, and make the switch from physics to ecology.</p> <p>In 1973 he took up a chair in zoology at Princeton and began his collaborations with Anderson. Following a visit to the UK he had also developed strong links with Imperial College\u2019s ecological research laboratories at <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/silwood-park/\" title=\"\">Silwood Park</a> in Berkshire. When the former director of Silwood Park, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-sir-richard-southwood-325730.html\" title=\"\">Richard Southwood</a>, became professor of zoology at Oxford, he offered May the chance to join him there as Royal Society research professor. He made the move in 1988, and remained in Oxford for the rest of his life.</p> <p>As government chief scientist, he produced a series of key reports. The first compared the costs of UK research with its global impact, and revealed that British science was the most efficient in the world, undermining any claims that government spending on science was wasteful.</p> <p>Perhaps even more influential, following major failures of communication on issues such as BSE, was a 1997 report on scientific advice in policymaking, which argued that \u201cthere should be a presumption of openness in explaining the interpretation of scientific advice\u201d. He advocated engagement with opponents of GM crops or animal experimentation, rather than dismissing them as anti-rational. \u201cOur values will indicate what questions we should be asking about the natural world and humanity\u2019s impact on it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur science will ensure that the answers have a solid foundation.\u201d</p> <p>Communication remained a theme when in 2000 he moved from the Office of Science and Technology to the presidency of the Royal Society, the UK\u2019s premier scientific academy \u2013 he is the only person to have held both posts. During his presidency he addressed the under-representation of women, and the number of female fellows rose.</p> <p>By the time of the financial crisis of 2008, May had already begun to work with colleagues on the stability of the banking system. Their review, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/451893a\" title=\"\">Ecology for </a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/451893a\" title=\"\">Bankers</a>, published in the journal Nature seven months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, explained how ecological models could expose vulnerabilities in the system and suggest ways to mitigate them.</p> <p>Knighted in 1996, he was made a peer in 2001, and was active in committee work in the House of Lords on economic affairs, HIV/Aids, climate change, and science and technology. He was appointed to the Order of Merit in 2002. In 2017 he retired from the Lords.</p> <p>Whatever the game \u2013 he loved chess and bridge \u2013 May played to win. Until well into his 70s he could be seen on the towpath or in the park in Oxford running with his friend, fellow zoologist and fellow public servant John Krebs. Under a sometimes abrasive exterior, May was a man of deep humanity and unswerving integrity.</p> <p>He is survived by Judith and their daughter, Nome.</p> <p>\u2022 Robert McCredie May, Lord May of Oxford, ecologist and scientific adviser, born 8 January 1936; died 28 April 2020</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Known global death toll exceeds 217,000</strong></h2> <p>According to Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,116,680 people have been infected worldwide and at least 217,168 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates because of suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US cases account for roughly a third of the known global total, at more than 1 million.</p> <h2><strong>China\u2019s parliament to hold annual meeting starting 22 May</strong></h2> <p>China\u2019s parliament will start its annual meeting on 22 May, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday, more than two months later than planned owing to the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.<br><br>Conditions for holding the annual meeting of parliament have been met as the coronavirus situation has improved, Xinhua quoted the top decision-making body of the Chinese parliament as saying.</p> <h2><strong>Russia\u2019s coronavirus case tally nears 100,000 milestone</strong></h2> <p>Russia reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide tally to 99,399, Reuters reports.

He said the search for an effective antibody test was still under way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/uk-minister-admits-main-coronavirus-focus-was-nhs-rather-than-care-homes\">Eustice denied that the earlier introduction of wider testing at care homes</a> would have saved lives.</p> <h2><strong>Virus needs to be contained before 2021 </strong><strong>Olympics can go ahead</strong></h2> <p>It will be difficult to host the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 unless the coronavirus pandemic is contained, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Olympics were postponed until next year after the rapid spread of the coronavirus. But Abe appeared doubtful about whether that could go ahead if the coronavirus remained a global problem.

The English version, <a href=\"https://escapegoat.world/\">Escape Goat</a>, has been published in daily instalments since 13 April and is up to chapter 16.</p> <p>\u201cEach author takes a fresh approach to the themes and characters of this story, and one of the things I have found most striking is the way the daily fears and concerns of each individual filter into their texts, creating a fascinating document of life under lockdown,\u201d said Meadowcroft, who assembled the team of English translators.</p> <p>Recent chapters have featured an android called Reboredo, whose only function is to spread fear among the housebound population, while the virus has mutated to leave its victims highly sensitive to sunlight.</p> <p>Artists are also creating pieces to appear alongside the chapters. \u201cIn these dark times, it seems to me that collaborative projects like this one are a way for us to connect and come together,\u201d said Meadowcroft. \u201cThe fact that 46 translators and a handful of editors have given up their time, with no prospect of remuneration, to help bring across this inspiring project from Portugal is a shining example of this lockdown spirit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPortugal, despite having a language spoken by many millions on all continents, has a somewhat insular literature,\u201d said De Carvalho, who welcomed the translations. \u201cIt is very difficult to break the borders of the cultural confinement that surrounds us. That is why we were very happy to learn that the Anglo-Saxon world can read us, get to know us, may have, after all, a small sample of contemporary Portuguese literature and contemporary art.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The idea that the coronavirus pandemic might have some upsides that could help us live better lives seems almost distasteful in the face of the destruction and death it has caused so far. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/domestic-abuse-killings-more-than-double-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">Domestic violence</a> has surged in the UK, low-paid workers on zero-hours contracts are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/london-coronavirus-sacked-hospitality-workers-sleeping-rough\">sleeping rough</a> on the streets, and poor families in Britain are experiencing worsening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/millions-lockdown-food-parcels-coronavirus-crisis\">food insecurity</a>.</p> <p>Even for those with a stable income, managing childcare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/20/10-fun-ways-to-home-school-virtual-learning\">home schooling</a>, domestic chores and work from home can be overwhelming, with a disproportionate burden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/womens-coronavirus-domestic-burden\">falling on women</a>. And it\u2019s still early days. We have yet to see what the full extent of the fallout from this pandemic will be on our mental health, particularly for the most vulnerable people. As academic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gaif6mTwFw8\">Cynthia Enloe</a> put it, \u201cWe aren\u2019t all in this together. We\u2019re in the same rough seas, but we\u2019re in very different boats. And some of those boats are very leaky. And some of those boats were never given oars. And some of those boats have high-powered motors on them. We are not all in the same boat.\u201d</p> <p>Yet in all the darkness there have been some real hopeful shifts. For some of those fortunate enough to have a safe and secure home environment that they can work from, the lockdown has had some unexpected silver linings. Some people with mental health conditions have reported<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-is-making-a-lot-of-people-anxious-and-depressed-but-some-sufferers-actually-feel-better-now\"> feeling much better </a>since the lockdown started. Julie*, a housebound 58-year-old woman with debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder and social anxiety told me she felt as if the rhythm of the world was finally chiming with her own life. Some of her biggest anxieties around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/13/why-regular-handwashing-can-be-bad-advice-for-patients\">contamination and hand</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/13/why-regular-handwashing-can-be-bad-advice-for-patients\">washing</a> were \u201cgoing mainstream\u201d and settling as a result \u2013 though her experiences are unlikely to be typical.</p> <p>Daniel*, a 42-year-old university lecturer, was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and depression five years ago. Since the pace of life slowed due to the pandemic and he stopped commuting, he has experienced a sense of profound relief, more energy, and an improvement in his anxiety. \u201cMy usual life feels like a pinball machine. You\u2019re whacking the buttons and the paddles are flailing around, sometimes not even making contact, and it just doesn\u2019t feel like that any more.\u201d</p> <p>For some people without an underlying mental health diagnosis, the simple factors of more time to sleep \u2013 despite, perhaps, having more weird dreams \u2013 more time with pets and loved ones, home cooking, and not having to deal with the overstimulation of life in the outside world, have led to a greater sense of general wellbeing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Daisy_Fancourt?s=20\">Daisy Fancourt</a> is leading a team at University College London in an <a href=\"https://www.marchnetwork.org/research\">ongoing study</a> to look at the psychological and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic. So far, the <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/apr/stress-over-covid-19-keeping-fewer-people-night\">results of surveys</a> of over 74,000 people have shown that, despite an initial decline in happiness prior to the lockdown starting, wellbeing has risen over the last few weeks, and anxiety levels have fallen for both people with and without existing mental health disorders.</p> <p>While the trend may yet change as the lockdown continues, and absolute levels of anxiety are higher for people with mental illness than for those without, the findings are intriguing. <a href=\"https://www.national.slam.nhs.uk/about-us/our-experts/dr-blake-stobie/\">Blake Stobie</a>, joint clinical director of the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma in south London, wonders whether things could rebound once social distancing orders are lifted. \u201cSafety-seeking behaviour and avoidance are key factors in anxiety disorders, and we\u2019re looking at a situation where this is naturally being enforced on a societal level. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the anxiety itself is being addressed. So if you\u2019re socially anxious and you\u2019re in lockdown, then you might expect that your anxiety would reduce. But you haven\u2019t treated the social anxiety.\u201d</p> <p>Although this drop in anxiety might well be transient, the reasons behind it are worth exploring. Jasmine Cooray is an integrative counsellor working with people suffering from anxiety and depression. She has noted that \u201clockdown relief\u201d has been especially pronounced in people who have high levels of internal pressure. \u201cPeople who are driven by keeping up appearances, productivity, showing up to everything, achieving lots, being visible and being there for everyone have found themselves chilling out, landing in a feeling of relief at not having to perform any more. Because they have been given permission to do what they want to do \u2026 their relationship to themselves is much more authentic and organic as a result of not having an audience.\u201d</p> <p>Anxious rumination can be eclipsed by real-world, serious events that blow those thoughts out of the water and offer a sense of perspective. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/bye-bye-fomo-now-the-party-is-being-zoomed-to-my-laptop\">Fomo has lost some of its power</a> now that the scope for envy-inducing activities has shrunk. We are all acutely aware of our own soft-bellied human vulnerability at this moment. It\u2019s OK to not be OK, and to say so.</p> <p>The bitter political divisions that pitted us against one another over the last few years have receded in the face of a collective threat, at least for now. We have a precious opportunity to think about the ways in which \u201cnormal\u201d life can make people anxious and ill. If we can change the arrangement of the post-pandemic world to prioritise compassion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/half-of-frontline-care-workers-paid-less-than-living-wage\">pay people decently</a>, value <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/undervalued-heroes-coronavirus-crisis-cleaners-supermarket-workers\">essential workers</a>, and to fund our public services properly, perhaps we can hang on to this silver lining.</p> <p>* <em>Names have been changed</em></p> <p>\u2022 Farrah Jarral is a broadcaster and doctor</p>",

  "<p>Efforts by the UK government to achieve gender equality through its aid programmes need to be better managed and more transparent, according to the financial watchdog.</p> <p>The National Audit Office (NAO) said the Department for International Development\u2019s (DfID) 12-year gender equality strategy was wide-ranging, but did not have a long-term, costed, implementation plan, limiting \u201cits ability to assess progress and consider value for money\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Improving-the-lives-of-women-and-girls-overseas.pdf\">report</a> published on Wednesday, the NAO said DfID did not have \u201can accurate grasp of which of its programmes have a gender equality focus and how much it spends on them\u201d.</p> <p>In 2018, when the department launched its <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/708116/Strategic-vision-gender-equality1.pdf\">strategy</a>, it estimated that two-thirds of bilateral aid, \u00a34.2bn, was spent on programmes that targeted gender equality as a policy objective \u2013 71% more than in 2011.</p> <p>However, the watchdog said its analysis showed that 33% of this money had been incorrectly classified.</p> <p>\u201cInaccuracy in DfID\u2019s gender-marked data means that DfID does not have an accurate grasp of which of its programmes have a gender equality focus and how much it spends on them, limiting its ability to monitor progress against its 2018 strategic vision,\u201d said the report.</p> <p>The watchdog recommended DfID publish a plan for implementing its strategy setting out key milestones and planned achievements in the short, medium and long term.</p> <p>The NAO also questioned the department\u2019s efforts to address harmful social norms \u2013 the unwritten \u201crules\u201d that govern behaviour and actions. DfID has recognised that addressing social norms will have the most long-term impact on tackling gender equality, but how it works may restrict progress, said the report. \u2018\u201cProgrammes can have a relatively short-term life cycle, and there is often little scope for evaluating the impact of the programme in the years following completion,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The department\u2019s approach, which involved the use of outside contractors, meant the involvement of smaller, local organisations was limited, the report added, which \u201ccould mean that women\u2019s rights organisations and smaller non-governmental organisations, some of which DfID supports financially, are unable to receive DfID funding. In their opinion, they are often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/08/emma-watson-keira-knightley-among-stars-calling-for-better-protection-international-womens-day-letter\">best-placed to address</a> successfully harmful social norms in the community.\u201d</p> <p>Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cDfID\u2019s commitment to tackling gender inequality is ambitious and wide-ranging. Two years into the department\u2019s 12-year vision, individual interventions are already improving the lives of women and girls overseas.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, if DfID is to achieve its ambitious aims, it needs to develop a clearer long-term plan for implementing its vision and continue to take steps to improve the accuracy and transparency of its performance information.\u201d</p> <p>Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, added: \u201cDfID should be congratulated for setting an ambitious vision to tackle gender inequality by 2030.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-could-undo-30-years-of-uks-international-development-work\">Coronavirus 'could undo 30 years of UK's international development work'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHowever, good intentions are not enough.

It also said it would publish a progress report on its work every two years.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe NAO rightly recognises the department\u2019s work to promote girls\u2019 education, challenge child marriage, end female genital mutilation and tackle sexual violence around the world.</p> <p>\u201cOur evidence-based approach allows us to quickly respond to constantly changing global challenges, such as coronavirus, so we can direct our life-saving support to wherever it is needed most.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Digging the grave was slow, harrowing work. As Dr Pradeep Kumar and his two assistants shared only a single shovel between them, they took to using their hands, desperately and hurriedly grabbing fistfuls of mud, looking fearfully around every few minutes.</p> \n<p>At about six feet deep they stopped. Kumar, convulsing with sorrow, rolled the wrapped body of his colleague, Dr Simon Hercules, into the grave, then quickly covered it over with earth. Under the cover of midnight darkness, the three men ran for their lives out of the cemetery.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happened to Dr Simon made me lose my faith in humanity,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cIt should never happen to anyone ever, ever again.\u201d</p> \n<p>The events surrounding the death of Hercules, one of several doctors to die from Covid-19 in the state of Tamil Nadu in the past few weeks, are symptomatic of a plague of misinformation about the virus that is having devastating consequences across India. In particular, the fear that coronavirus can spread from a dead body has led to several doctors and patients being denied dignified burials, with their funerals the target of mob ire.</p> \n<p>Hercules had been a familiar face around Chennai\u2019s New Hope hospital. The 55-year-old neurosurgeon and hospital managing director was known as a gentle, hardworking man of few words; nothing would get between him and his patients, not even a global pandemic. But three weeks ago he developed a cough and fever, then was put on a ventilator for respiratory distress. Already vulnerable as a diabetic with high blood pressure, he died last Sunday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/asia\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet as news of his death from Covid-19 flashed up on local TV channels, the community\u2019s response was not sorrow, but anger. Hercules was a Christian so his body would be buried, not cremated as is the Hindu custom. That night a crowd of around 200 gathered at the Christian cemetery to demand officials refuse to bury the doctor there, fearing the virus would spread into the soil.</p> \n<p>Emergency arrangements were made to bury the doctor at another Christian cemetery. But, as his wife, Anandhi, and 18-year-old son, Anton, and several colleagues, including Kumar, an orthopaedic surgeon at New Hope hospital, stood by the graveside, a violent mob descended.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were screaming at us to leave and take the body before it spread the virus to everyone,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cIt was a crowd of about 60 people, pelting us with sticks and stones. We all had to run for our lives. The ambulance drivers got very badly injured as they desperately put Dr Simon\u2019s body back in the ambulance, and all the windows got smashed as they were driving away. It was terrifying, and so traumatic for his wife and son.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back at the medical centre, Kumar gathered two assistants, put on personal protective equipment and got back into the damaged ambulance, where Hercules still lay, his body bag now covered in glass and broken medical equipment. They drove back to the cemetery and there, at midnight, dug Hercules\u2019s grave, terrified the the mob would return.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was terrible, his family wasn\u2019t even there,\u201d said Kumar, his voice shaking. \u201cCoronavirus already took his life, why should it also take his dignity in death?\u201d Hercules\u2019 family told the Guardian they were too traumatised to speak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/we-are-very-afraid-scramble-contain-coronavirus-mumbai-slum-dharavi\">'We are very afraid': scramble to contain coronavirus in Mumbai slum</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Dr K Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Doctor\u2019s Association, said Hercules\u2019 case had been a wake-up call for state authorities. \u201cWhen we heard what had happened we were all shocked and saddened and were extremely angry at the government as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Tamil Nadu chief minister has promised that from now on any healthcare official who dies from Covid will be given a formal government funeral and [he will] ensure that army and police personnel will be present.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet Hercules\u2019s case is far from a one-off. Coronavirus has reached even the most remote corners of India and there are now upwards of 25,000 cases, with misinformation and attacks on both the living who have caught the virus, and the dead, becoming widespread.</p> \n<p>On 15 April, Dr John L Sailo Ryntathiang, 69, the founder and director of Bethany Hospital in Shillong, become the first doctor in the north-eastern Indian state of Meghalaya to die of Covid-19. The news was met with panic, and the family\u2019s plans to cremate his body and place his ashes in a coffin to be buried at his farmhouse were halted when hundreds of protesters descended on the crematorium. The crematorium then refused to deal with the body, while on social media the dead doctor and his family were subjected to abuse.</p> \n<p>For 36 hours, no place could be found to lay Ryntathiang to rest and, in desperation, his son-in-law Arthur Wungthingthing<strong> </strong>published an open letter. \u201cWe do not know whether his cremation is over. We were not there to weep beside his body,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cMy father-in-law literally spent his life in the treatment of his patients. This is not an acceptable way to honour his memory.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both Kumar and Ryntathiang\u2019s son, David Sailo, said they did not blame people, who were fearful and deprived of information on coronavirus, and said it was the government\u2019s responsibility to educate the community about the virus, and offer adequate protection for medical staff, both in life and in death.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a terrible ordeal for the family but we do not hold anyone responsible,\u201d Sailo said. \u201cThe fault lies with the government that proper advocacy on this issue was not given to the public. We take it as a blessing that our family has been chosen as the Covid-19 family and so many shortcomings have been exposed. The government still seems to be asleep.\u201d</p>",

Georgia\u2019s stay-at-home order expires on 30 April but Governor Brian Kemp has already allowed some businesses, including hair salons, gyms, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys to reopen. Alaska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Tennessee and some other states are also relaxing their quarantine orders or preparing to.

With 350,000 employees across 170 countries IBM has witnessed firsthand the global response to the pandemic and is taking a cautious, case-by-case approach to opening its own offices.

There is a lot of detail going into redesigning the workplace, making changes, decisions, so that the workplace is one that is safe for people to come back to.\u201d</p> <p>The company is looking at office layouts, removing desks that are too close together, visual reminders to keep your distance, rethinking bathrooms, cafeterias, reassessing cleaning. \u201cWe are entering a workplace where we will have to behave differently, move differently, we have to be more aware.\u201d</p> <p>IBM\u2019s experience tallies with the wider business community. A PriceWaterHouseCoopers survey found 77% of US chief financial officers (CFOs) are anticipating changing workplace safety measures upon returning to on-site work and 65% anticipate reconfiguring work sites to promote physical distancing.</p> <p>The very nature of work-life is being rethought: some 49% of CFOs see remote working as a permanent solution for some workers.</p> <p>A widespread reopening will have to take all these factors into account. Country by city, building by building, job by job. A federal or local order to reopen will be just one part of this incredibly complex puzzle and all these changes will take time.</p> <p>There are plenty of plans for reopening but one of the most often quoted is from the American Enterprise Institute co-authored by Scott Gottlieb, a physician and former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Trump\u2019s plan seems to be a slightly watered down version of the AEI\u2019s. The AEI roadmap offers <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/\">a three-phase plan </a>to reopening:</p> <ul> <li><p>Phase I (the phase we are currently in) focuses on using stay-at-home orders and the closure of businesses and public spaces to slow the spread of Covid-19.</p></li> <li><p>Phase II starts the reopening in a state-by-state basis, \u201cWhen they are able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate Covid-19 cases and their contacts.\u201d Much of normal life can begin to resume but we would have to maintain physical-distancing measures and more stringent public hygiene measures while protecting the vulnerable.</p></li> <li><p>Phase III and a return to \u201cnormal\u201d would come only after testing, tracing, treatment and vaccines become widely available.</p></li> </ul> <p>The current reopenings come while most of the US is still in phase I and Trump has said those decisions are down to the states.</p> <p>The pressure to get America working again is intense and growing but opening up too soon, too fast could trigger a second wave of Covid-19 infections, said Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist in Phoenix, Arizona.</p> <p>\u201cThe sentiment is everybody wants to move forward, of course, but ultimately we in public health and global health security know that it is not something that can be rolled out in one sweeping movement,\u201d Popescu said.</p> <p>The Business Roundtable, the US\u2019s most powerful business lobby, wrote to Vice-President Mike Pence and all 50 governors last week outlining its recommendations for reopening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e67e441c3610760d0a2c7decd102f85b43dab1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e67e441c3610760d0a2c7decd102f85b43dab1ee/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump attends a teleconference with governors at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington DC on 19 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump attends a teleconference with governors at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington DC on 19 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lobby group, whose members include Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, General Motors and Walmart, set out guidelines for different environments including offices, retail, construction and manufacturing. Overall the plan calls for careful control of public spaces, more monitoring and testing of staff, more personal protection equipment and consistent guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans want to feel confident returning to work and being in public spaces, and employers who operate in multiple states and want to keep their employees and customers safe need the clarity that consistent guidelines provide,\u201d said Joshua Bolten, the president of Business Roundtable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>How can we really gauge how things are going if we can\u2019t get accurate case counts?</p> <footer> <cite>Saskia Popescu, a hospital epidemiologist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem is that while some suggestions the lobby group made are in the control of businesses (such as limiting the number of people in an office) others are in control of the government \u2013especially testing and monitoring.

So far <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">just 5.4m</a><a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\"> tests</a> have been administered across the US, about 1.6% of the population.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">An analysis</a> by Harvard researchers and the health news website Stat found more than half of US states need to significantly step up testing in order to even consider starting to relax stay-at-home orders after 1 May. More worrying still, some of the states now relaxing their quarantine order, including Georgia and Florida, are still well behind the level of testing they will need in order to identify and close down new hotspots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52fe940f33e455912ee2679d05f9ac4448a7305a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52fe940f33e455912ee2679d05f9ac4448a7305a/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Waffle House Inc restaurant open for take-out only in Cartersville, Georgia.

Here we look at how the verbal stoush escalated:</p> <h2><strong>17 April</strong></h2> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s home affairs minister, Peter Dutton: </strong>\u201cThe US is saying they\u2019ve got documentation that the virus had a particular path or origin. [He said he hadn\u2019t seen it.] I think it is incumbent upon China to answer those questions and provide the information so people can have clarity about exactly what happened because we don\u2019t want it to be repeated.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>19 April</strong></h2> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne,</strong> <strong>announces a push for an investigation into the origins and spread of coronavirus while appearing on the ABC\u2019s Insiders: </strong>\u201cMy trust in China is predicated in the long-term relationship. My concern about these issues, though, is at a very high point. My concern is around transparency and ensuring that we are able to engage openly \u2026 openly and clearly in a review process so that we can get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>20 April</strong></h2> <p><strong>China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang: </strong>\u201cAustralia\u2019s foreign minister Payne\u2019s remarks are not based on facts. China is seriously concerned about and firmly opposed to this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/australia-called-gum-stuck-to-chinas-shoe-by-state-media-in-coronavirus-investigation-stoush\">Australia called 'gum stuck to China's shoe' by state media in coronavirus investigation stoush</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>A Global Times news report: </strong>\u201cSince the outbreak began, China has always acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner and taken a series of resolute, timely and forceful measures.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A Chinese embassy</strong><strong> official on Dutton: </strong>\u201cObviously he must have also received some instructions from Washington requiring him to cooperate with the US in its propaganda war against China \u2026 Some Australian politicians parroted what those US forces have said and followed them to launch political attacks on China. Their move reveals the former\u2019s ignorance and bigotry as well as a lack of independence, which is sad.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>22 April</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Labor senator Penny Wong backs an investigation: </strong>\u201cIf the PM is serious about it, he\u2019s going to have to a lot of work to get international agreement. It means not just talking to our friends, like the US, but also doing the hard yards of talking to countries that aren\u2019t always our friends.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A Chinese embassy official: </strong>\u201cIt is well known that recently some people in the US including high-level officials have been spreading anti-China \u2018information virus\u2019. Their aim is to shift blame and deflect attention by smearing China.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>26 April</strong></h2> <p><strong>China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, to the Australian Financial Review: </strong>\u201cI think in the long term ... if the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think, \u2018Why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to China?\u2019 The tourists may have second thoughts. The parents of the students would also think whether this place which they found is not so friendly, even hostile, whether this is the best place to send their kids here. It is up to the people to decide. Maybe the ordinary people will say, \u2018Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>27 April</strong></h2> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s trade and tourism minister, Simon Birmingham: </strong>\u201cAustralia is no more going to change our policy position on a major public health issue because of economic coercion or threats of coercion than we would change our policy position in matters of national security.\u201d</p> <p><strong> </strong><strong>Payne: </strong>\u201cAustralia has made a principled call for an independent review of the Covid-19 outbreak, an unprecedented global crisis with severe health, economic and social impacts. We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Geng Shuang: </strong>\u201cSome politicians are trying to make political manoeuvres over the origin to smear other countries, but their unpopular attempts will never succeed.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A Global Times editorial about a US-led \u201cblame game\u201d: </strong>\u201cWashington from now on would say nothing positive about China, but constantly condemn us. It has a few followers like Australia. But these countries can barely influence us.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Global Times editor, Hu Xijin, on Weibo: </strong>\u201cAustralia is always there, making trouble. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/australia-called-gum-stuck-to-chinas-shoe-by-state-media-in-coronavirus-investigation-stoush\">It is a bit like chewing gum stuck on the sole of China\u2019s shoes</a>. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>28 April</strong></h2> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s Labor leader, Anthony Albanese: </strong>\u201cAustralia wants a positive relationship with China but it\u2019s got to be built on a level of trust and transparency \u2013 and transparency is what is required from assessments of this virus and how it came about.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Cheng </strong><strong> releases a summary of a private phone call with the Department of Foreign Affairs secretary, Frances Adamson: </strong>\u201cSecretary Adamson tried her best to defend Australia\u2019s proposal about the independent review, saying the proposal neither has political motive nor targets China \u2026 Ambassador Cheng elaborated clearly China\u2019s relevant position, stressing that no matter what excuses the Australian side has made, the fact can not be buried that the proposal is a political maneuver.

The department will not respond by itself breaching the long standing diplomatic courtesies and professional practices to which it will continue to adhere.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A Global Times editorial: </strong>\u201cThis is an all-out crusade against China and Chinese culture, led by Australia, which has worked hard in the past to become a comprehensive strategic partner of China \u2026 Canberra is treading on a hazardous path that has no prospect for a U-turn during the Covid-19 pandemic, and likely for a long time afterward.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>29 April</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong><strong>Geng Shuang: </strong>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the so-called claim of economic coercion comes from.\u201d</p> <p><strong> </strong><strong>Hu Xijin on Twitter: </strong>\u201cLet me give a \u2018coercion\u2019 to Australia. As its attitude toward China becomes worse and worse, Chinese companies will definitely reduce economic cooperation with Australia, and the number of Chinese students &amp; visitors going to Australia will also decrease. Time will prove it all.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison: </strong>\u201cThis is a virus which has taken 200,000 lives across the world. It has shut down the global economy. It would seem entirely sensible and reasonable that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this occurred so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again. I think that is a fairly obvious and commonsense suggestion.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

Now, with unemployment skyrocketing and a deep, potentially lasting recession, many tenants are moving from the frying pan into the fire.<br></p> <p>A few surprising policies have emerged. Governments in <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2020/04/12/might-the-pandemic-be-a-lifeline-for-the-rich-worlds-homeless\">Berlin and Denmark</a> have re-purposed youth hostels; the UK boasts having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertjenrick/status/1251828247538667522?s=12\">housed 90% of rough sleepers</a>; and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493499-newsom-says-california-now-has-over-15000-hotel-rooms-for-homeless\">California</a> \u2013 the hotbed of homelessness in North America \u2013 has acquired 15,000 hotel rooms for homeless people to shelter.</p> <p>Governments in several African countries, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLuy0s2Al2k\">Kenya</a> and <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/brief/wash-water-sanitation-hygiene-and-covid-19\">Ethiopia</a>, have committed to getting water and sanitation facilities to informal settlements; and a water company has ensured shared taps are in place in a settlement in <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/04/coronavirus-inequality-cities\">Rio de Janeiro</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising of all are moratoriums on evictions as seen in <a href=\"https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/rental-housing/covid-19-eviction-bans-and-suspensions-to-support-renters\">Canada</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-market/articles/cities-and-states-that-have-paused-evictions-due-to-covid-19/\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/spain-bans-evictions-to-ease-virus-hardship/1786986\">Spain</a>, where suspension of utilities due to non-payment is also prohibited. Changes to mortgage payments through short-term <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51814481\">deferrals</a> \u2013 unthinkable six weeks ago \u2013 are part of many packages being adopted.</p> <p>These developments could be signs of a better, post-pandemic world where governments view housing as a social good and a human right. Scratch the surface, however, and what you\u2019ll find is very familiar.</p> <p>For example, the trend to criminalise homeless people continues. In a number of cities in <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/coronavirus-impact-on-homessless-population/\">France</a> and <a href=\"https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/multiple-homeless-montrealers-given-tickets-for-physical-distancing-infractions-1.4893128\">elsewhere</a>, homeless people are being ticketed for being on the streets in violation of lockdown and physical distancing rules, though they have nowhere to go. In other areas, governments continue to exhibit indifference to the wellbeing of homeless people, reinterpreting the \u201cstay home/physical distance\u201d policy to mean living in overcrowded shelters, mega-tents or convention centres.</p> <p>Critics say the approach to informal settlements in the global south has largely been \u201c<a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-12-covid-19-and-the-call-for-solidarity-challenges-for-informal-settlements/\">firefighting</a>\u201d, suggesting there is no long-term plan to address overcrowding and the lack of basic services.</p> <p>Reports are also emerging that removing tenants from property is still commonplace, with <a href=\"https://time.com/5820634/evictions-coronavirus/\">landlords in the US</a>, for example, flouting the moratorium on eviction. It has also come to light that under most mortgage deferral schemes, including in <a href=\"https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/banks-confirm-six-month-mortgage-payment-deferral-due-coronavirus-but-interest-still-accrues\">New Zealand</a>, interest will continue to accrue and is added to the principal loan to be paid back post-pandemic, which means simply a deferral of debt owed, and a likely longer-term mortgage. Meanwhile <a href=\"https://t.co/uLg5yfzklH?amp=1\">private equity firms</a> are chomping at the bit, waiting for residential real estate to come on the market so they can make money.</p> <p>Policies that ensure access to adequate housing for everyone remain a blind spot. In other words, governments are failing to do what they are obliged to, pandemic or not, under international human rights law: implement the right to housing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here\u2019s a to-do list:</p> <ul> <li><p>Ensure access to emergency and long-term housing for people who are homeless, including through securing hotel and hostel rooms and other vacant units.</p></li> <li><p>Cease all forced evictions and evictions into homelessness.</p></li> <li><p>Regularlise informal settlements and ensure they have access to water and sanitation.</p></li> <li><p>Regulate housing costs so they are commensurate with household income.</p></li> <li><p>Prohibit speculative investment in housing that contributes to unaffordability and eviction.</p></li> </ul> <p>As the world waits for a viable vaccine to eliminate the virus, now is a good time to start on housing rights for all.</p> <p>\u2022 Leilani Farha is the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing</p>",
  "<p>It has been two months since Andi Rizky last saw her uncle Jimmy, a drug offender in Cilegon Prison, Banten province, in person. Since the middle of March, the prison has banned visitors because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>In 10-minute video calls to replace the visits, the pair have discussed the Indonesian government\u2019s plan to release thousands of prisoners.</p> <p>Jimmy, 56, constantly asks Rizky to investigate the possibility that he may qualify for the Covid-19 pardon programme.

But it was a wake-up call for Democrats: the fight for the White House and Senate in November will also be a fight for the rule of law.</p> <p>The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/30/donald-trump-judges-courts-justice-system\">brought a laser-like focus</a> to nominating and winning Senate confirmation for 193 judges \u2013 two supreme court justices, 51 circuit court judges (a quarter of the total), 138 district court judges and two US court of international trade judges \u2013 at a pace unmatched since the presidency of Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never in my lifetime seen an election whose stakes were higher,\u201d said <a href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10899/Tribe\">Laurence Tribe, </a>who was born in 1941 and is a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. \u201cThe transformation of the federal judiciary into a series of puppets for a very rightwing ideology will have lasting impact for decades.\u201d</p> <p>Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, aim to guarantee a long-term conservative skew on decisions that affect millions of people, including abortion rights, environment regulations, gun control, immigration rules and access to healthcare (having failed to overturn Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act on Capitol Hill, the administration is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/us-supreme-court-aca-affordable-care-act-challenge\">trying to do so in the courts).</a></p> <p>The new wave of judges is dominated by young white men often rushed through the Senate with little regard for standard procedure. Critics say the chief criterion for selection is no longer experience or qualifications but ideology.</p> <p>Tribe commented: \u201cHe\u2019s appointed one person after another, with the cooperation of of majority leader McConnell and a very supine Senate, who would never have been accepted in the past and are not comparable to those appointed by Republicans in the past.\u201d</p> <p>The professor added: \u201cMany of them will be there for 30 or 40 years. And so the entire landscape of the federal judiciary as a guard rail against various kinds of abuse and violations of the rule of law has been dramatically weakened for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018These judges are younger, more partisan, more political and really having a big impact on the lives of Americans\u2019</h2> <p>Progressives cite <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/trump-justin-walker-appeals-court.html\">Walker as a prime example.</a> He has only served as a federal district court judge in Kentucky since October. At the time of his appointment, the American Bar Association, which issues ratings on judicial nominees, said he was not qualified to serve because of his inexperience. ,He was eventually confirmed on a 50-41 vote.</p> <p>Walker is also a former clerk to Kavanaugh, who was narrowly confirmed to the supreme court after claims of sexual misconduct from decades earlier resurfaced. Walker did 162 media interviews, including 35 on Fox News (\u201cHe is a warrior with a backbone of iron\u201d), to defend his mentor, <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/blog/wilson-and-walker-are-conservative-extremists-and-thats-why-trump-chose-them/\">according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84f766dcb7aae9b9bfdd5d052416e4bd8f5d0668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84f766dcb7aae9b9bfdd5d052416e4bd8f5d0668/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh at the White House in Washington DC on 8 October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh at the White House in Washington DC on 8 October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christopher Kang, chief counsel for Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy organisation, and who served in the Obama administration for nearly seven years, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last three years the kinds of judges that President Trump has put in throughout the judiciary, from district courts all the way to the supreme court. They\u2019re younger, more partisan, more political and really having a big impact on the lives of Americans.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Overall, with his selection of judges, he\u2019s hit it out of the park\u2019</h2> <p>But conservatives disagree with this characterisation. <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/staff/elizabeth-slattery\">Elizabeth Slattery,</a> a legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation thinktank in Washington, who went to school with Walker in Louisville, Kentucky, said: \u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s young and new to the bench, but he had a background as an academic and his research was focused on administrative law and separation of powers. It just so happens the court he\u2019s been nominated to focuses very heavily on administrative law. So I think he\u2019s a great selection because he knows these issues very well.\u201d</p> <p>Slattery contends that Trump\u2019s selections haves been based on judicial philosophy rather than political ideology. \u201cMany of them are pretty young \u2013 a lot are in their 40s \u2013 so the expectation is that they will serve on these courts for decades to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the longest-lasting legacy that any president can have but President Trump has really made this a high priority. Overall, with his selection of judges, he\u2019s hit it out of the park.\u201d</p> <p>Progressives, however, fear more Justin Walkers waiting in the wings. He is a member of <a href=\"https://fedsoc.org/\">the Federalist Society,</a> which favours an \u201coriginalist\u201d interpretation of the constitution and has created a pipeline of young conservative lawyers. Its alliance with Trump has helped him win over Christian evangelicals and other doubters on the right. Many pointed to Trump\u2019s release during the 2016 election of a shortlist of judges for the supreme court vacancy at the time as a political masterstroke that secured their vote.</p> <p>The courts barely featured in 10 Democratic primary debates. Even so, liberal supreme court justices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/05/rbg-to-mp3-ruth-bader-ginsburg-inspires-classical-music-album\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> and Stephen Breyer will be 87 and 82 respectively at the time of the elections in November.</p> <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/joe-biden-supreme-court-african-american-woman-nominee/index.html\">has already committed</a> to putting the first African American woman on the supreme court. But Kang said: \u201cHe needs to go a step further and explain literally who are some of the African American women that he\u2019s considering.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of fantastic potential candidates out there who could really help excite progressives about how he would view the courts and how he would seek to restore balance and fairness.\u201d</p> <p>But the White House alone is not enough. If Biden wins the presidency and Republicans retain control of the Senate, a long war of attrition looms. McConnell refused to sanction a vote on dozens of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees, most infamously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/16/obama-nominates-merrick-garland-supreme-court-dc-appeals-court-judge\">his supreme court pick Merrick Garland.</a></p> <p>Kang added: \u201cPeople may focus on McConnell blocking Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the supreme court, which was obviously a horrific display of anti-democracy, but what he did in the lower courts is no less appalling. On the circuit courts, over the last two years of President Obama\u2019s term, he only allowed two circuit court judges to be confirmed, which is the fewest since the 1800s.</p> <p>\u201cAnd judges overall, even if you include district court judges, was 22, which was the fewest since President Truman. That\u2019s very intentional and I think that\u2019s exactly what we could see if Republicans maintain the majority and there\u2019s a Democratic president.\u201d</p> <p>This year, 23 Republican Senate seats are up for grabs; Democrats only need to flip four to regain control. Such is the courts\u2019 power to block legislation that much of the Democratic agenda is on the line.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/importantmeagan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Meagan Hatcher-Mays,</a> director of democracy policy for the Indivisible Project, a progressive grassroots movement, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be critically important not just to throw Trump out of office this year, but to also flip the Senate so that we can actually move forward with some of our progressive priorities and that includes judges, because pretty much every single piece of progressive legislation that passes through Congress under a Democratic president is going to be challenged in court by Republicans.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/spokespeople/marge-baker/\">Marge Baker</a> is executive vice-president at People For the American Way, an activist group that has created a web page entitled <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/vote-the-courts-2020/\">Vote the Courts 2020</a> to \u201cidentify senators whose confirmation votes for unfit judges prove they don\u2019t deserve to keep their seats\u201d. Baker says: \u201cProgressives, independents, the public understands now in a way they haven\u2019t before the impact that these judges have on their daily lives.</p> <p>\u201cThey understand, frankly, because of the role that Mitch McConnell has played, how critical it is that you have not just a Democratic president, but also a Democratic Senate in order to process these nominations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey see decision after decision, the court rolling back voting rights, putting healthcare at risk, putting reproductive freedom at risk, environmental regulations, workers\u2019 rights \u2013 everything that people have come to depend on is being overturned and upended by the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Such battles are not fought in the supreme court alone. Although Chief Justice John Roberts and colleagues steal the limelight, McConnell himself has noted the importance of the lower courts. Appearing on the <a href=\"https://www.tonyperkins.com/get.cfm?i=LR20D11\">Washington Watch podcast</a> with Tony Perkins in April, the majority leader said: \u201cIt\u2019s important for your listeners to know that most litigation never makes it to the supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cMost complex litigation stops at the circuit court level. The level below that is district courts. They\u2019re also important, but their decisions are, of course, appealable to the circuit courts.\u201d \u201d</p> <p>Democrats are hoping to convince their own voters on the same point. Should the party take both the White House and Senate, it would be no surprise if two dozen judges appointed by Bill Clinton in the 1990s seek retirement or senior status to make way for younger liberals with decades of service ahead of them. This would be a sign that, after four years of the Trump-McConnell onslaught, the pendulum had begun to swing the other way.</p> <p>In a news and political cycle usually dominated by instant gratification, victory belongs to whoever can play the long game. Hatcher-Mays of Indivisible said: \u201cI would like to see Democrats be just as aggressive in getting their judicial nominees confirmed as Republicans have been, even if that means not getting Republican support, because the point is these positions are for life.\u201d</p>",

Last month, the chairman of Argentina\u2019s national oil company, YPF, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dead-cow-oil-play-set-155931929.html\">said</a> the oil price collapse \u201cputs all Argentine oil production in doubt\u201d.</p> \n<p>As elsewhere in the world, key decisions have been put on hold. But more than any other country, the IMF will play an unusually crucial role in deciding the project\u2019s fate \u2013 and this will send a strong signal about the stance of international institutions in shaping the post-pandemic world.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, the IMF made its largest ever loan of $44bn (\u00a335bn) to help Argentina through a debt crisis that continues today. A new restructuring is now being arranged by the fund, which also expects to conduct its annual \u201chealth check\u201d on the country next month. That will include a review of Vaca Muerta.</p> \n<p>Initially, the IMF promoted this project as a way for Argentina to earn foreign currency and become more energy independent. But \u2013 with growing pressure on international institutions to back away from fossil fuels \u2013 the fund insisted last year that Argentina cut subsidies for Vaca Muerta. This was potentially fatal even before the pandemic.</p> \n<p>The Argentinian government has had to lure foreign oil companies including Chevron, Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Pan American Energy (a British Petroleum subsidiary) with billions of dollars in subsidies. Without this financial crutch, projects could not stand up economically even at an oil price far higher than the current level of about $20 a barrel. The region was too remote, transport links too poor and local demand too weak. The project has also faced fierce opposition from the Mapuche indigenous community who say their territory has been stolen and contaminated for the benefit of foreigners. This made it one of the world\u2019s most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/indigenous-mapuche-argentina-fracking-communities\">expensive and controversial</a> fossil fuel projects.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7544779e8a304c792c2e9dbc3d5d90583ac92c25\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7544779e8a304c792c2e9dbc3d5d90583ac92c25/0_570_8516_5108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wrapped in a flag with oil facilities in the distance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorena Bravo, a spokesperson for members of the Mapuche indigenous community, who say their territory has been contaminated.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emiliano Lasalvia/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The lockdown is another blow. \u201cThe historical drop in oil prices is a new sign of the infeasibility of Vaca Muerta,\u201d said Fernando Cabrera of the independent watchdog Observatorio Petrolero Sur in Neuqu\u00e9n. \u201cWe have long warned there was a lack of essential export infrastructure, weak global demand and over-dependence on subsidies which Argentina cannot afford due to its debt crisis. The pandemic deepens the problems.\u201d</p> \n<p>Veteran Argentinian oil executives \u2013 known inside the industry as <em>viejos petroleros</em> or old oil tankers \u2013 are pressing the government to go ahead with Vaca Muerta, to inflate the oil price inside the country, and to pass on the costs to drivers at the pumps. \u201cIn this industry you have to do what nobody does. Don\u2019t go after the herd,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.mejorinformado.com/plus-energtico/2020/4/26/vaca-muerta-no-hay-que-ir-detras-de-la-manada-62248.html\">wrote Jos\u00e9 Luis Sureda</a>, a former government secretary of hydrocarbon resources. But without funds, the government\u2019s hands are tied.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe demand and price crash is certainly disrupting the Argentinian government\u2019s fossil fuel expansion plans in the short term,\u201d said Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at <a href=\"www.priceofoil.org\">Oil Change International</a>. He said this was part of a global trend. Dozens of planned oil and gas projects are likely to be scrapped or indefinitely postponed, including three liquid natural gas plants in Brownsville, Texas, and many US offshore oil terminals. Canadian tar sands, Brazilian offshore oil wells, and Guyana drilling projects will also struggle to break even.</p> \n<p>At a price of $35 per barrel, 4% of existing oil supply becomes uneconomical, according to a <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/feature/how-will-the-oil-price-crash-hit-the-upstream-sector/\">recent study</a> by the energy industry analysts Wood Mackenzie. If values fall below $25 \u2013 as they have in the US \u2013 this loss-making share rises to 9% \u2013 equivalent to 10m barrels per day.</p> \n<p>The situation is even tougher for new oil and gas projects. At $35 a barrel, 75% of new oil and gas projects fail to cover their financing costs.</p> \n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, the world\u2019s major oil companies have <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/feature/how-will-the-oil-price-crash-hit-the-upstream-sector/\">cut capital investment by almost $25bn</a>. This will make it difficult for companies to reach their production forecasts. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/oil-firms-barrels-markets\">the Guardian revealed</a> that the world\u2019s 50 biggest oil companies planned to pump an additional 7m barrels per day by 2030. This is now far less likely.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf prices don\u2019t rebound, the taps will inevitably be turned off,\u201d the study warned. \u201cGiven the difficulties and costs associated with restarting mature production, a proportion of this supply may never return.\u201d</p> \n<p>How much will largely depend on government leadership, said Valentina Kretzschmar, the vice-president of corporate research at Wood Mackenzie. \u201cUltimately it is about demand. If there is demand for oil, it will be produced. It won\u2019t stay in the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is what we learn from the Covid crisis. How will it change us? How will governments respond? It will really be the government response that will have a huge impact on what happens next.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/un-chief-dont-use-taxpayer-money-to-save-polluting-industries\">UN chief: don\u2019t use taxpayer cash to rescue carbon-intensive industries</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The IMF said last year it would incorporate climate risks into decision-making, which could would undermine the already-weak viability of Vaca Muerta. Mar\u00eda Marta Di Paola, the director of research at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation in Argentina, said the project was not aligned with the Paris climate agreement. \u201cIf the Vaca Muerta fracking expands as initially planned, its emissions will <a href=\"http://ggon.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GGON_OilGasClimate_English_Dec2019-1.pdf\">quadruple</a> by 2050,\u201d she wrote.</p> \n<p>Stockman urged the IMF, Argentina and other governments to move away from fossil fuels in their economic stimulus packages. More subsidies, he said, would simply set up another boom and bust in the future. \u201cRather than bailing companies out so that executives and shareholders are protected, governments should be using the stimulus to support clean energy production and demand, and help workers transition. That is not happening.\u201d</p> \n<p>While a lot of projects look uneconomic in the current situation, few are being actively scrapped when the prospects of a price spike may be only a year or so away. Once again, the absence of policies to guide and manage a transition are failing us on climate, as well as on equity, justice and preventing the next disaster.</p>",

Unlike HIV/Aids, a condom can\u2019t protect them. How does one negotiate safety in this situation?\u201d</p> <p>As part of the government\u2019s relief scheme for the poor, India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi has announced a financial package that will deposit 500 rupees (\u00a35.30) monthly into the bank accounts of 200 million people. But those working in or trafficked into the sex industry \u2013 many of whom lack government-approved documentation to access public distribution systems and relief schemes \u2013 are not included.</p> <p>Women like Bibi earn around 200-300 rupees (\u00a32) per client and see three or four clients a day. From their earnings, they pay rent, utility bills, and buy food and medicines, as well as pay for education and care for dependents. Then there is the commission for brothel keepers and pimps.</p> <p>\u201cThey have no food, they are starving. They live in tiny, windowless rooms with no fresh air. Many don\u2019t have access to running water; sometimes, the choice is between paying water bills or topping up phones,\u201d says Ruchira Gupta, founder of <a href=\"https://apneaap.org/\">Apne Aap Women Worldwide</a>, which works for the eradication of sex trafficking in India.</p> <p>In cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, brothels are located in jam-packed red light areas where social distancing is impossible. Delhi\u2019s GB Road has more than 3,000 sex workers housed in 80 small brothels. Kolkata\u2019s Sonagachi, which is referred to as Asia\u2019s largest red-light area, has between 8,000\u201310,000 sex workers.<br><br>Hygiene is a challenge, with limited access to running water and as many as 20 people sharing one bathroom. Brothels rarely have kitchens and women buy food from vendors. For these women, the lockdown has meant the loss of their entire ecosystem \u2013 rickshaw drivers, corner stores, and street carts.</p> <p>Social workers say financial distress has increased instances of domestic violence and conflict. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/26/how-priti-patkar-and-prerana-changed-the-lives-of-children-of-sex-workers\">Priti Patkar</a>, founder of <a href=\"http://preranaantitrafficking.org/\">Prerana</a>, an anti-trafficking charity in Mumbai, believes this puts children at risk. \u201cWhen adults are in strife, they pass it on to children,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As the uncertainty \u2013 and fear of the pandemic \u2013 grows, social workers anticipate a sharp spike in depression, anxiety, and perhaps, suicide.<br><br>With no government support, the onus to help the marginalised has fallen on the voluntary sector. Women working in the sex industry are now dependent on charities for their basic needs, including food and access to medication during the lockdown, especially antiretroviral therapy medications for treating HIV/Aids.</p> <p>Gupta recalls a call from a 12-year-old child, the daughter of a sex worker, who said the family hadn\u2019t eaten for 10 days. This kind of distress call is common and similar calls are coming from all areas of the country, she says. The problem is the same: women have no money, they haven\u2019t eaten for days and the police are forcing them to stay inside.</p> <p>According to Gupta, Apne Aap has distributed 140,000 relief parcels in Delhi, Bihar, and Kolkata with private donations. New Light, Basu says, has reached more than 1,500 families in Kolkata alone. The packages contain rice, flour, pulses, spices, tea, milk powder, onions and potatoes, just enough to feed a family of four for two weeks, as well as hygiene products.</p> <p>\u201cSex workers don\u2019t feature anywhere as a marginalised group. The government doesn\u2019t want to accept that there\u2019s prostitution in the country. It\u2019s the elephant in the room,\u201d says Basu.</p> <p>Social workers must contend not just with the logistics of reaching far-flung areas, but the risk of infection. </p> <p>Patkar says: \u201cSummer is setting in; there\u2019s no income and sex workers are going into debt to survive.

Vast numbers of people have been cut off from aid by the military, including 8,000 displaced people sheltering in Paletwa township in Chin.</p> <p>Internet access is also blocked in many conflict-affected areas, meaning people have little access to information about how to protect themselves against the coronavirus, and making it harder for communities to document atrocities committed by armed actors.

That voyage is the reason Australia is what it is today and it\u2019s important we take the opportunity to reflect on it.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past century Australia has used Cook\u2019s name, his ethos and \u201cspirit\u201d of adventure when commemorating everything from Australia Day and Anzac, to Remembrance Day, the centenary of the establishment of Melbourne and federation.</p> <p>There is no doubt Cook was complex, both morally and in legacy. He was the foremost British navigator and cartographer of his epoch, a man who was not born to the admiralty and made his way to the top through merit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Official commemoration will laud Cook today. But it will do so in isolation from his many complexities and flaws</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But like many at the vanguard of the Enlightenment, his views on white racial superiority (as I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/on-cook/\">written previously</a>, he viewed this country as a great place for an imperial cattle run and land grab) seriously compromised the tenor of his limited dealings with, and capacity to understand, the Indigenous people of this continent and others.</p> <p>As American writer Barry Lopez muses in his book Horizon, \u201cCook is often held out as someone who embodied all that was right about the Enlightenment \u2013 informed thinking, curiosity about the world, a commitment to the ideals of humanism. But he also ... represented the dark side of the Enlightenment, a belief that there was only one right way to govern, to organise one\u2019s economy, to worship God, and to think. All other ways were primitive (ie, unenlightened) and those practicing them were assumed to be far behind on Progress\u2019s inexorable path.\u201d</p> <p>Australia officially cherry-picks from the Cook \u201cdiscovery\u201d story (omitting his naive, arrogant violent encounters with Aboriginal people and much else) just as it does from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2019/apr/25/australias-leaders-its-media-and-some-historians-persist-in-talking-up-the-big-anzac-game\">Anzac foundation myth</a> (leaving out massacres by Australian troops, defeat and retreat at Gallipoli, cowardice and the ill-treatment and addictions of damaged veterans). That\u2019s how victors tend to talk history.</p> <p>What strikes me most when I read Cook\u2019s journals is how fortunate he was (despite his own stupidity and arrogance, and due to the restraint of the Indigenous people he mistreated on his three voyages of discovery) not to have died much earlier in the way he did in 1779 when the Hawaiian locals chopped him to bits for abusing their customs and generosity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2019/oct/03/captain-cooks-legacy-is-complex-but-whether-white-australia-likes-it-or-not-he-is-emblematic-of-violence-and-oppression\">Captain Cook's legacy is complex, but whether white Australia likes it or not he is emblematic of violence and oppression | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s amazing it didn\u2019t happen in 1770 when fixing his HM Bark Endeavour after its near-disastrous holing on the Great Barrier Reef at Wabalumbaal (he renamed it Endeavour River). That\u2019s when Cook\u2019s men filled the deck with precious, giant green turtles \u2013 a staple food for the locals. The Aboriginal men came in a delegation. They asked for just one of the turtles back. The crew refused. A fight ensued, the locals repelled. One Indigenous man was shot as the tensions over the turtles \u2013 and Cook\u2019s inability to understand the importance of them to the Aboriginal inhabitants \u2013 heightened.</p> <p>Similarly, we will probably hear little today of <a href=\"https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/6t2/tupaia\">Tupaia, the Tahitian high priest</a> who helped direct the Endeavour across the ocean from island to island, eventually to New Zealand and to the east coast of Australia. Each of Cook\u2019s three voyages took advantage of the knowledge of indigenous Pacific navigators.</p> <p>Like Bungaree, the Indigenous Australian guide on Matthew Flinders\u2019 circumnavigation (there is a monument in Sydney to Flinders\u2019 cat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2020/feb/06/flinders-and-his-cat-get-statues-so-why-not-the-aboriginal-man-who-sailed-with-them\">but not to Bungaree!</a>), Tupaia is forgotten in Australia alongside the great navigator.</p> <p>Indigenous Tahitian Tupaia died of a ship-borne virus (how snippets of history can resonate so sadly at the most unanticipated times) aboard the Endeavour while it was docked in Batavia in December 1770.</p> <p>Official commemoration will laud Cook today.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Known global death toll exceeds 217,000</strong></h2> <p>According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,116,680 people have been infected worldwide and at least 217,168 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US cases account for roughly a third of the known global total, at over 1 million.</p> <h2><strong>China\u2019s parliament will start its annual meeting on 22 May</strong></h2> <p>China\u2019s parliament is set to hold its annual meeting on 22 May, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday, more than two months later than originally planned. China\u2019s top political consultative body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, has also proposed to start its annual session on 21 May. It\u2019s not clear yet how long the meetings will last. They traditionally see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days.</p> <h2><strong>China warns relationship with Australia could be damaged \u2018beyond repair\u2019 </strong></h2> <p>The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defied China and defended the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/australia-defends-plan-to-investigate-china-over-covid-19-outbreak-as-row-deepens\">\u201centirely reasonable and sensible\u201d</a> call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, as the international political fallout over the pandemic deepened. While Australia has eschewed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\"> the more strident approach of the US</a>, which has stopped funding to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO), it has urged its allies to back an overhaul of the WHO and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/22/australian-pm-pushes-for-who-overhaul-including-power-to-send-in-investigators\">suggested recruiting independent investigators</a> akin to \u201cweapons inspectors\u201d to determine the source of major disease outbreaks.</p> <h2><strong>Three US children with coronavirus are treated for rare inflammatory syndrome</strong></h2> <p>Three US children infected with the coronavirus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain, Reuters reports. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries.</p> <h2><strong>Nearly 70 residents have died at a Massachusetts home for ageing veterans</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-massachusetts-veterans-outbreak-holyoke-soldiers-home\">Sixty-eight veteran residents</a> at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home who tested positive for the virus have died, officials said Tuesday, and it\u2019s not known whether another person who died had Covid-19. Another 82 residents and 81 employees have tested positive. While the death toll continues to climb, federal officials are investigating whether residents were denied proper medical care. The state\u2019s top prosecutor is deciding whether to bring legal action.</p> <h2><strong>Virus crisis could lead to 18,000 more cancer deaths in UK, experts warn</strong></h2> <p>Almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/extra-18000-cancer-patients-in-england-could-die-in-next-year-study\">18,000 more people with cancer in England could die</a> after the coronavirus pandemic led hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care, research has found. Cancer experts claim that an extra 6,270 people in England who have been newly diagnosed with the disease could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915.</p> <h2><strong>Fitch downgrades Italy\u2019s rating to BBB-</strong></h2> <p>Italy is the European country most affected by Covid-19 and trails only the United States in the number of deaths.The government has said it expects the country\u2019s economic output to shrink by 8% this year and has launched a host of stimulus measures.</p> <h2><strong>USS Theodore Roosevelt navy sailors will begin moving back on board</strong></h2> <p>Navy sailors who have been quarantined on Guam for weeks will begin moving back to the USS Theodore Roosevelt on Tuesday night, US officials said. A coronavirus outbreak sidelined the aircraft carrier in late March. The ship gained attention when it was forced to dock in Guam because of the virus outbreak and its commander was fired for sending an email pleading with Navy bosses to take faster action to address the virus.</p> <h2><strong>Streamed films to be eligible for Oscars</strong></h2> <p>Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/academy-awards-oscars-streaming-films-coronavirus\">because of the pandemic\u2019s disruption to the industry</a>, the organisers of the Oscars have said. The change will only apply to films released this year. Previously, a film would have required a minimum seven-day theatrical run in a Los Angeles county commercial theatre in order to be considered. Now films that had a previously planned theatrical release but are made available through on-demand service may qualify for best picture and other categories.</p>",

This could include digital shows, more select presentations for press and buyers, and so-called trunk shows, the social-distancing-friendly events where brands show their collections to a smaller guest list of high-end customers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d1b75264dfb8780ff168abb795b0318ec4f57ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d1b75264dfb8780ff168abb795b0318ec4f57ca/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Xcommons virtual fashion show in Shanghai this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Xcommons virtual fashion show in Shanghai this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Xcommons</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From sport to art, music to manufacturing, almost all industries are adapting their established annual schedules to the impact of the coronavirus crisis \u2013 and fashion is no exception. With fashion weeks cancelled and cruise shows postponed, the very existence of the fashion calendar, where press and buyers travel to different cities around the world biannually, is being called into question. The men\u2019s shows coming up in June in London are to be switched to a digital format while Moscow fashion week this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/10/fashion-meets-fortnite-rise-of-3d-clothes-digital-catwalks\">was shown online</a>. Sometimes this goes beyond simply presenting a collection and instead uses all the technology available to create an immersive experience. In Shanghai, fashion presentation <a href=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/chinas-xcommons-launches-immersive-virtual-fashion-showcase-with-icy-1203542675/\">Xcommons</a> used augmented reality to, as it put it, \u201creplicate, transform and bring the logic, process and the etiquettes behind traditional fashion shows into the digital age\u201d.</p> <p>This month, Balmain\u2019s creative director, Olivier Rousteing, Chlo\u00e9\u2019s creative director, Natacha Ramsay-Levi, and Balenciaga\u2019s CEO, Cedric Charbit, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/vogue-global-conversations-future-of-fashion-shows\">spoke to Vogue</a> about the future of the fashion show and the potential move to digital \u2013 a far more difficult prospect for an international megabrand than the small brands in Shanghai and Moscow. Ramsay-Levi argued that the fashion show \u2013 an event where about 600 invitees gather in a room \u2013 was important as \u201ca moment where you can gather the community; it\u2019s a moment where there is human sensitivity\u201d. Rousteing, a card-carrying millennial who has built his following online with close to 6 million followers on Instagram and \u201cTHIS IS MY REALITY\u201d as his bio, had a different point of view. \u201cI don\u2019t see digital as less emotional, I see digital as an experience where you can push your dreams to the next level,\u201d he said. Both agreed that a more inclusive approach was needed \u2013 with Rousteing wanting to bring the fashion show to the streets. At the moment, bringing them to screens might be the next best thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0098ae264a21c28a9651b5a3eba909cf27b18cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0098ae264a21c28a9651b5a3eba909cf27b18cd4/0_304_4834_2901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Balmain, AW20, in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Balmain, AW20, in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacopo Raule/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/15/the-view-from-the-front-row-a-history-of-the-fashion-show-photo-essay\">fashion show format</a> has existed in one version or another for about 70 years. Saint Laurent\u2019s Vaccarello and Bellettini, in the interview with WWD, stressed that their move \u2013 while prompted by the coronavirus crisis \u2013 reflects a mood that has been in fashion for some time.\u201cWe have known for years that something has to change,\u201d said Vaccarello. \u201cThe time is now. There is no good reason to follow a calendar developed years ago when everything was completely different.\u201d</p> <p>The designer suggested a slower way of working is the way to avoid burnout and keep creativity in the future of fashion. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush a collection just because there is a deadline,\u201d he said. \u201cThis season, I want to present a collection when I am ready to show it.\u201d This idea echoes the way that fashion\u2019s favourite maverick, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/azzedine-alaia\">Azzedine </a>Ala\u00efa, worked. The designer, who died in 2017, left the fashion show calendar in 1992, reverting to a practice of holding intimate presentations only when he was ready to do so. It may be that, nearly 30 years and a crisis later, the rest of fashion is coming around to his way \u2013 and, indeed, other ways \u2013 of thinking beyond the catwalk.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018I\u2019m loving the idea of being here for a sustained period of time,\u201d says Alan Cumming, speaking over Zoom from his \u201ccountry pile\u201d buried deep in New York\u2019s Catskill mountains. It is purpose-built for isolation. \u201cI realised I\u2019ve been craving it; it\u2019s a shame it took a global pandemic to make it happen.\u201d</p> <p>The 55-year-old actor has been rigorous about lockdown. He is asthmatic, so he has been out past his gate only once in five weeks. Cumming spends his days with his husband, the artist Grant Shaffer, and their dogs Lala and Jerry, mostly writing. In the evenings, he has Zoom cocktails \u2013 last night it was with his old Good Wife co-star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/julianna-margulies-the-good-wife-hot-zone-ebola-interview\">Julianna Margulies</a>.</p> <p>His home is cosy: a crowded bookshelf takes up most of the wood-panelled wall behind him; a blown-up cover image of his first children\u2019s novel, The Adventures of Honey &amp; Leon, illustrated by Shaffer, sits on the floor. He flips the camera to reveal a small outside clearing, empty apart from his trampoline, surrounded by maple trees. A porch swing is rocking; he points to a storm on the horizon coming over the Catskills.</p> <p>Cumming was in London when the world began shutting down. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/05/endgame-review-daniel-radcliffe-alan-cumming\">He was starring in Samuel Beckett\u2019s Endgame at the Old Vic</a>, alongside Daniel Radcliffe. When the theatre closed on 15 March, Endgame still had <a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2020/endgame\">two weeks left to run</a>. Cumming may be enjoying this period of isolation, but he is worried about what state the theatre industry will be in when the lockdowns lift. There was talk of bringing Endgame to New York, but he thinks pinning down any dates would be too ambitious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b797d0a9c22341f2f79b72cbd875d9c4ec60441\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b797d0a9c22341f2f79b72cbd875d9c4ec60441/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Cumming starring in Endgame at the Old Vic this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Many theatres won\u2019t survive the coronavirus\u2019 ...

The UK and US governments have always undervalued the arts, he says \u2013 a \u201crot that\u2019s set in\u201d since Margaret Thatcher (he has more than a few criticisms of Thatcher, having just watched the five-part BBC documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/17/thatcher-a-very-british-revolution-review-the-iron-ladys-downfall-in-compelling-detail\">Thatcher: A Very British Revolution</a>).</p> <p>\u201cMany theatres won\u2019t survive, because there\u2019s so much money going into unemployment and the health service,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only will these theatres not have produced anything or had any income, but there\u2019s going to be a whole range of cuts. We\u2019re all fucked.\u201d It is unclear whether he is referring to thespians or, well, everyone.</p> <p>One person he does include in his assessment is the US president. \u201cThis could be Trump\u2019s downfall. My mother-in-law is a Trump supporter and even she\u2019s said: \u2018Oh gosh, it\u2019s terrible what he\u2019s doing, using all the Covid press conferences as a rally.\u2019 It\u2019s insane and embarrassing and just disgusting.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We seem to still be in this culture where old white men seem to be allowed to do anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He will be supporting Joe Biden for president, but he has his reservations. \u201cHe\u2019s too old.

Together with his brother, he confronted his father. They didn\u2019t speak for 16 years, until his father caught wind of Cumming\u2019s intention to appear on the TV programme Who Do You Think You Are?.</p> <p>His father told Cumming (via his brother) that he was not his son; he said he was telling Cumming this to avoid him finding out on national TV. After a meticulous investigation, Cumming exposed his father\u2019s story as untrue (he and his brother took DNA tests to confirm it).</p> <p>More than five years on, he is still stunned by the feedback from readers of his memoir. Many said it helped them address their own problematic relationships. Has it allowed him to exorcise the trauma of his father\u2019s abuse?</p> <p>\u201cI thought that maybe I would put him to rest, but actually that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s much more in my life than he ever was.

London was maybe a possibility. The idea that I would be doing what I\u2019m doing now or have the opportunities that I have now, there was no one I knew who\u2019d had that trajectory \u2026 those things didn\u2019t happen to Scottish people.\u201d</p> <p>And yet his career boomed. He moved to London after a roaring Edinburgh fringe success as half of the comedy double act Victor and Barry with his friend and co-writer Forbes Masson. Their TV series, The High Life, in which they played a pair of outrageously behaved air stewards, aired on the BBC before Cumming moved to London to play Hamlet at the Donmar under Sam Mendes. He scored an Olivier award for his role as the Maniac in Accidental Death of an Anarchist, as well as a nomination for his performance as the Emcee in Cabaret; he won a Tony award when he reprised the role on Broadway in 1998.</p> <p>More recently, he has found success on the small screen with his scene-stealing performance as the spin doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/06/crush-eli-gold-good-wife-alan-cumming\">Eli Go</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/06/crush-eli-gold-good-wife-alan-cumming\">ld in The Good Wife</a>. In 2018, he landed the starring role in Instinct, the first network drama on US television <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-49419441\">to feature a gay leading character</a>.</p> <p>As something of a Hollywood veteran (his vast filmography ranges from Goldeneye and Emma to Spice World and Spy Kids), he has expressed solidarity with the victims of Harvey Weinstein. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BjPKZTnhIbN/?hl=en\">In an Instagram post</a>, underneath an image of Cumming and Weinstein together, he said that he had posed for the photograph despite knowing about Weinstein\u2019s hotel room massage meetings, his rage and his bullying nature.

That was shocking to me.\u201d</p> <p>Cumming was bullied by Weinstein, with the disgraced producer pressuring him to take roles he didn\u2019t want. \u201cI remember being at the premiere of The Hateful Eight \u2026 and I\u2019d just said no to Harvey to doing this thing. He was very persistent. I saw him coming, he was on his phone, and I hid in this doorway to avoid them, because I just didn\u2019t want to have to deal with them. He was scary and also he was just overwhelming as a personality.\u201d</p> <p> Cumming has witnessed phenomenal social change since he started his career, when homophobia was institutional and potent. \u201cI think it\u2019s great things should move fast,\u201d he says. \u201cThe constant question I used to get was: \u2018Do you think that coming out is bad for your career in Hollywood?\u2019 It\u2019s such a ridiculous question. I don\u2019t think people in Basingstoke or Idaho are not going to go and see a movie because someone in it is gay. I really don\u2019t think they care.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t miss a beat as he moves on to the latest battleground for LGBTQ+ people: gender identity. \u201cWhen people get all weird about people putting pronouns at the end of their emails, I think: \u2018Fuck you.\u2019 These people are being kind to you and doing you a favour by telling you how they want to be defined.\u201d</p> <p>As well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ equality and HIV charities, Cumming is outspoken against male circumcision<strong>.</strong></p> <p>\u201cI never thought anything about my foreskin,\u201d he says, \u201cand then I came to America and I was having sex and people would just be gasping because they\u2019d never seen a foreskin before. I was made to feel weird and freakish because I had an intact body.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s genital mutilation. And I think people say: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s hysterical.\u2019 But we do it to girls and it\u2019s called genital mutilation.\u201d As for the religious grounds for circumcision, he believes these are \u201cridiculous\u201d: \u201cWe choose to keep doing some things and we just let the weirdest things go.\u201d</p> <p>Cumming is confident that this period of isolation will result in a positive social change. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist at my very core,\u201d he says. \u201cAny time when you\u2019ve got to be away from everybody, to contemplate, meditate and be made to understand how your behaviour affects other people, I just can\u2019t help but think that must be a huge positive.\u201d</p> <p>And what about in the immediate aftermath? \u201cI think there will probably be a period of rabid shagging,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some sort of swing towards hedonism, where it\u2019s just crazy.

If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win.

There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts.</p> <p>The current crisis gives us a glimpse of how much we need to do to pull out of our disastrous trajectory. Despite the vast changes we have made in our lives, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to reduce by <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-set-to-cause-largest-ever-annual-fall-in-co2-emissions\">only about 5.5%</a> this year.

Her zebra-wood divan stood before wall panels lacquered with abstract red and white shapes.

The current exhibition expands on a show that began at the Pompidou in Paris in 2013, and Gray makes a similarly worthy subject.</p> <p>These days, Gray is most closely associated with two works: <a href=\"https://www.aram.co.uk/e1027-adjustable-table.html\">an adjustable circular side table</a> made of tubular steel and glass, and a modernist villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur.

She emerges as a creator of strange, haunting interiors, unrealised designs of housing for the homeless and the author of an animal-themed ballet, conceived as \u201ca ballet by beasts for beasts\u201d. It reveals how her sensuous, surreal and sometimes mystical work defied categorisation and convention.</p> <p>Born into an aristocratic family in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford, in 1878, the Honourable Eileen Gray (to use her full title, which she disdained) spent her formative years at two addresses: the Georgian manor of Brownswood House, complete with pillared porch and 300 acres of grounds; and the other family home in South Kensington, London, a stone\u2019s throw from the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fd768d5481657c70b786c5b94c571aa15a1a1c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fd768d5481657c70b786c5b94c571aa15a1a1c8/0_208_3746_2659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gray in 1927.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pet panther \u2026 Gray in her late 40s in 1926.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berenice Abbott/National Museum of Ireland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After studying painting at the Slade \u2013 where she met artists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/apr/17/wyndhamlewisoverlookedscour\">Wyndham Lewis</a>, Kathleen Bruce, Jessie Gavin and Jessica Dismorr \u2013 she moved to Paris with them in 1902, quickly falling into the city\u2019s bohemian circles and embracing her bisexuality. Dressed in tailor-made men\u2019s suits, with a cropped bob, Gray cut quite a figure \u2013 especially when she was driving around Paris in a convertible with one of her lovers, the nightclub singer Damia, and Damia\u2019s pet panther in the back seat.<br><br>She soon landed on the sensuous qualities of lacquer as her chosen medium. Having worked briefly in a lacquer repair shop in London, Gray befriended Seizo Sugawara, a penniless Japanese student in his 20s who had come to Paris to restore the lacquer pieces Japan had sent to the Exposition Universelle, and asked him to teach her. She mastered the technique, and set up her own lacquerware workshop in Paris in 1910, producing screens, chairs, tables, bureaux, beds and dressing tables for some of the city\u2019s richest clients.</p> <p>The style of her early work fell somewhere between art nouveau and art deco, but Gray detested both terms. \u201cPeople at that time liked festoons and all kinds of pleats,\u201d she later said, \u201cand things really horrible. I think I\u2019ve always hated deco.\u201d She dismissed Tiffany and art nouveau as \u201cthose ghastly drapes and curves\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7ce6ffe835a414de89faf6c0977b37570b3cbe66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ce6ffe835a414de89faf6c0977b37570b3cbe66/0_0_830_960/432.jpg\" alt=\"Le Corbusier at E-1027 villa.\" width=\"432\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A means to violently destroy\u2019 \u2026 Le Corbusier at E-1027 villa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Unknown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her distinctive aesthetic was unleashed in her first interior project: an apartment for society host Juliette L\u00e9vy in 1919, for which she conjured an immersive environment that revelled in theatrical lighting effects and unexpected materials. The hallway was lined with glossy black lacquered bricks, which prised away from the walls to form <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/article/3434941\">freestanding perforated screens</a>, while exotic light fittings were crafted from paper and ostrich eggs.<br><br>\u201cWhat fantasy,\u201d declared one visiting Dutch architect, \u201cin the use of white parchment with black drawings, with white or coloured glass, cassowary eggshells combined with a lacquered geometric base, or a skeletal iron grill or threaded with rope!\u201d He was particularly enamoured with the lamps: \u201cIs this lighting the most complete evocation of our time?\u201d</p> <p>Bolstered by a network of well-to-do clientele \u2013 including Ezra Pound, James Joyce and the Rothschilds \u2013 Gray opened her own gallery in 1922, under the male pseudonym Jean D\u00e9sert, where she sold her inventive furniture. She combined novel combinations of lacquer, metal, celluloid, eggs, zebra skin and pashmina, creating otherworldly objects that, as De Stijl architect Jan Wils put it, appeared to have been \u201cborn in a dream\u201d. There was a whiff of prewar decadence and a hint of black magic, perhaps influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/10/society\">Aleister Crowley</a> \u2013 the English occultist and ceremonial magician, who founded the religion of Thelema \u2013 to whom Gray was briefly engaged.<br><br>Although she never settled, the chief love of Gray\u2019s life was the Romanian architect Jean Badovici, who collaborated with her on the E-1027 villa. He had been an early advocate of her work, describing her ability to create \u201can atmosphere of boundless plasticity, where different perspectives meld, where each object is subsumed into a mysterious living unity\u201d. Badovici insisted she should build, despite having no architectural training, and stop frittering her time away on furniture. \u201cMake a door that will last!\u201d he implored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"174e5ae723b65c6e5c428f89a4eddceb3111d114\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/174e5ae723b65c6e5c428f89a4eddceb3111d114/0_145_2152_2775/775.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018What fantasy\u2019 \u2026 a lacquer lamp.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Gray\u2019s lacquer lamps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Wetzel/Virginia Museum of Fine Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She did. The resulting villa was completed in 1929 when Gray was 51. Restored in 2015 (having survived target practice by the Nazis, a stint as a den for drug-fuelled orgies, and a murder), E-1027 nestles into a rocky slope near Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. A vision of classic modernism, the villa has an open-plan interior with a nautical air: a big partition modelled on a ship\u2019s funnel, taut sailcloth stretched across the terrace\u2019s metal railings, and compact built-in furniture, each element labelled in stencilled type.</p> <p>It was equipped with Gray\u2019s \u201ccamping style\u201d furniture, made of lightweight tubular steel, including the famous side table (designed for her sister to have breakfast in bed) as well as her <a href=\"http://www.eileengray.co.uk/products/transit\">Transat deckchairs</a> (named after the ocean-liner company Transatlantique). It brims with thoughtful details. Small windows are located to allow a view when lying down, while a tea trolley is topped with cork to muffle the clatter of cups. It embodied her view, contrary to that of Le Corbusier, that \u201ca house is not a machine to live in. It is the shell of man, his extension, his release, his spiritual emanation.\u201d<br><br>Corb was clearly outraged that a woman could have made such an impressive building in a style he thought was his own. During a visit in 1938, he assaulted the house with <a href=\"https://thecharnelhouse.org/2012/07/02/le-corbusier-painting-in-the-nude-at-eileen-grays-villa-e-1027-plus-the-story-behind-his-nasty-leg-scar/\">a series of garish cubist murals, executed in the nude</a>. \u201cI admit the mural is not to enhance the wall,\u201d he later confessed, \u201cbut on the contrary, a means to violently destroy [it].\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it was from the shock of this brazen attack, or her own aversion to the spotlight, but \u2013 apart from a house for herself near Castellar, a studio apartment in Paris for Badovici and a final renovation project in St Tropez \u2013 Gray never built again. Instead, the book reveals how she spent the 1930s and 40s designing unrealised hypothetical projects, mostly public, from workers\u2019 housing to a vacation complex and a social and cultural centre, all driven by a desire to extend the privileged domain of architecture to the many.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d30117ec50a3a42c501c5107ca2158553e8dd7d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d30117ec50a3a42c501c5107ca2158553e8dd7d1/0_19_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A house is not a machine to live in.

  "<p>In Lower Wharfedale, there are new kinds of silences everywhere. Around Beacon Hill, on the Chevin, the seismic roar of aircraft booming off to Edinburgh or Alicante from the airport nearby has given way to the white noise of a sunny heath in April; a silence textured with the bee-charged buzz of a goat willow, the delicate song of a dunnock, or the soft gloops of mating frogs in a pond. Along the verdant stretch of the Wharfe near Otley Mills, where peace is usually eclipsed by the rush of traffic on the A660, birdsong glitters in the fresh green trees like sun in a stream, and a dipper alerts me to its presence with the tiniest of chirps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/home-birds-how-to-spot-20-of-the-most-common-species-from-your-window-walk-or-garden\">Name that song - it's the perfect time to learn to identify birds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, in the high pastures to the north of Otley, the Harrogate road is so empty that I could safely nap on it, and the silence up here is big and breezy, with buzzards mewing and curlew calls bubbling up from the hazy fields below.

Figures collated by his firm suggested that electronic card spending in New Zealand has halved during the strictest four weeks of lockdown measures, while the number of people claiming unemployment has already risen to just above its peak following the 2008 global financial crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6addf7e030204e0be587d8ec8433fcba9934b3c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6addf7e030204e0be587d8ec8433fcba9934b3c6/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A road sign in Ohau, New Zealand on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A road sign in Ohau, New Zealand on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Lintott/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Australia has been \u201cmore generous in terms of support\u201d such as \u201caccess to money\u201d and \u201ccash handouts\u201d to businesses and the unemployed, he said. But it was too early to know which country would fare better, and there were factors other than the strictness of lockdown measures at play.</p> <p>\u201cIt really depends on the health outcome,\u201d Eaqub said. \u201cIf there are future waves of infections, then any further shutdown is going to have a really damaging effect. Businesses might be able to survive one shutdown but I don\u2019t think they could survive two.\u201d</p> <p>Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, agreed, telling voters she did not want to see them \u201close any of the gains we have made\u201d by coming out of restrictive lockdown measures too early.</p> <p>Ardern did not face the same situation Australia\u2019s leader Scott Morrison did when deciding what level of lockdown was appropriate, said Brian Cox, an epidemiologist from the University of Otago in Dunedin. New Zealand\u2019s \u201cclusters\u201d of the virus were larger, relative to population size, and tracing contacts of those infected was, initially, taking several days longer for New Zealand\u2019s officials than those in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t compare today in Australia with today in New Zealand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe epidemic in Australia has essentially been going for another two weeks and our epidemic was taking off a lot faster than Australia\u2019s. We had to do a serious correction to get anywhere near where we\u2019ve got to now.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts say both countries, in their attempt to stave off another wave of the illness, could face the same foe.</p> <p>\u201cWinter is coming,\u201d said ANU microbiologist Peter Collignon, referring to the faster spread of the virus during the northern hemisphere\u2019s colder weather and flu season.</p> <p>\u201cWe will potentially be keeping quite significant restrictions on when we see the US and Europe relaxing them because it\u2019s summer. That\u2019s going to be an issue about convincing people to in fact keep on what we\u2019re doing now until at least September,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t think a complete lockdown is an option.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A mother\u2019s heart harbours, in equal measure, dread and love.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you take sick leave?\u201d mine suggests before realising the answer for herself.</p> <p>I have just shown her a text message from a colleague. \u201cThe Covid round is arduous, take good care.\u201d</p> <p>In the now forgotten past when we knew so little, I had agreed to join the Covid-19 roster.

The irony of how to reconcile the sage advice with the natural instinct to get in and out of a room as quickly as possible doesn\u2019t escape me.</p> <p>The night before the round, I memorise the PPE process, as if watching the video from three countries will make me thrice as safe. In the morning, I shed my wedding ring, find old clothes and head off quietly before the children wake up. No point in creating unnecessary drama.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/a-lockdown-diagnosis-i-call-a-patient-ive-never-met-and-tell-her-she-has-weeks-to-live\">A lockdown diagnosis: I call a patient I\u2019ve never met and tell her she has weeks to live | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The roads are deserted but the handover room in the hospital is bustling as the night and morning teams meticulously go through each admission. A ward of \u201csuspects\u201d await swab results. Patients, young and old, have arrived with many symptoms.</p> <p>The community rate of carriage is as yet unclear and the tests aren\u2019t perfect, which means that some patients must be retested. One only has to cast an eye on the global havoc to appreciate that Australia has been guided into a very fortunate position, but no one thinks it\u2019s time to relax. Consequently, every suspected patient must be considered positive and no clinician will let complacency trump caution.</p> <p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d everyone says to the Covid team, an acknowledgement of our increased risk. On the ward I am greeted by six doctors, three of them interns caught in this maelstrom within a month of starting their career. I feel for them.</p> <p>Why did I think the first decision of the day would be where to begin the round?</p> <p>\u201cThe consultant decides who goes in,\u201d a trainee says.</p> <p>When I was still seeing cancer patients in clinic, I was shielded by everyone who understood the importance of keeping me safe to keep my patients safe. Now, that need has abated as outpatients have moved to telehealth. Suddenly, I recall my colleague\u2019s words that had meant nothing at the time. \u201cJust to let you know, I\u2019ve been going in every time.\u201d</p> <p>(So? Isn\u2019t that how ward rounds work?)</p> <p>In the unequal world of medicine that aspires to lose its hierarchy but often comes up short, I realise that my seniority has bestowed upon me a privilege with life-and-death implications. Institutions around the world are trying to navigate the tricky balance of who is exposed to patients and how often, although in inundated places there is little choice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in,\u201d I say. \u201cI need to know the patients.\u201d</p> <p>Shoulders relax.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like someone to scribe inside the room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you mind being watched as you don and doff?\u201d</p> <p>Appreciating the care it takes to say this to one\u2019s boss, I reply: \u201cI\u2019d really appreciate that.\u201d</p> <p>The PPE feels foreign and being alone in every room is strange but once inside the pattern is the same. Take a good history, examine the patient, provide counsel. Don\u2019t interrupt unnecessarily. Say urgent things calmly. Make eye contact even if it\u2019s from behind plastic.</p> <p>A young woman is clammy and feverish. Her relief crashes when I say that her negative test doesn\u2019t yet reassure me. An elderly man bursts into tears at his negative status. He only had a few years to live, anyway, he cries as his emotional nurse celebrates the end of his isolation. Other patients don\u2019t speak English, can\u2019t hear the interpreter and can\u2019t operate a smartphone. For now, universal gestures for discomfort, breathlessness or nausea must do.</p> <p>Through the glass panel, one trainee has eyes set on me. The doffing is stressful because it\u2019s when the wearer faces the highest risk of exposure. I remind myself to slow down and banish awful stories from my head. One cannot be a calm and methodical doctor without making some sort of peace with the knowledge that one or more patients could be infectious. It would be unproductive and frankly indulgent to view every minute spent seeing patients as self-sacrifice.</p> <p>Resentful doctors can\u2019t be effective doctors. On the other hand, to be loose with words or ignore the very real consequences of sloppy hygiene or lax protection would be unconscionable. I work my way through these new learnings, pausing outside between patients to dictate notes and still trying to find teaching moments, which mostly have to do with the importance of empathy. When everyone is on edge, we really are in it together.</p> <p>Late in the afternoon I reach the final patient and the stakes truly rise because he is a confirmed patient who was not expected to live. My colleague had emphasised the emotional flux of such patients who prepared to die but find themselves alive, not sure whether to feel guilty or glad.</p> <p>He is pacing the room, looking dejected. But his numbers look so good that I feel a stirring of happiness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/i-am-a-frontline-doctor-heres-how-you-can-help-me\">I am a frontline doctor: here\u2019s how you can help me | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWould you like to go home today?\u201d</p> <p>He stops short in his track.</p> <p>No matter how little English they possess, no patient has ever been confused by \u201chome\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor real?\u201d he stammers.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He starts crying, not having dared to imagine leaving alive.</p> <p>I\u2019ve removed my gown when he reaches out to hug me.

Actually, I did nothing; your body held up.</p> <p>The rounds done, the team debriefs, remembering everyone working in far graver circumstances. I exit through a staff entrance and take in the queue of anxious visitors waiting to get in for the hour they\u2019re permitted.</p> <p>At least I am heading home, I think. At least my kids won\u2019t have to wave at me from behind glass as I drive past.

On Monday the president first cancelled his daily press briefing, in the aftermath of last week\u2019s disinfectant disaster, then announced it was on again. In the Rose Garden the president seemed a little subdued but also stuck to his usual talking points. <strong>Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s sketch is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/27/donald-trump-coronavirus-kim-jong-un?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">here</a></strong> \u2013 and true to its distinctly British journalistic form:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>His autocratic tendencies are well-known. His sudden absence from public view prompted fierce speculation and rumour. One headline suggested that he was \u201cbrain-dead\u201d.</p> \n   <p>The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown. But after a lost weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> bounced back into the spotlight on Monday determined to prove that he is not only healthy but working very, very hard.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This question, by the by \u2013 \u201cIf an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died over <strong>the entirety of the Vietnam war</strong>, does he deserve to be reelected?\u201d \u2013 produced more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriFleischer/status/1254904160744505345\">blowback for the questioner</a> than the questioned, on grounds of whether it showed the proper respect. Such are the mechanics of the White House press corps. For the record, around 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam.</p> \n  <p>Otherwise, at his White House presser Trump also:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Announced a plan to increase coronavirus testing, which public health experts say is at nowhere near the level needed if the US economy is to reopen.</li> \n   <li>Blamed China (the subject of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/27/trump-campaign-china-strategy-memo-213958\">this fascinating Politico story</a> about jittery Senate Republicans being told not to defend the president).</li> \n   <li>Refused to take responsibility for more people ingesting disinfectant in the days since his remarks on the subject.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>After the briefing, Trump made his usual attacks on the press <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1254767509460234243\">on Twitter</a>, at one point seeming to conflate them with the coronavirus, \u201cthe Invisible Enemy!\u201d</p> \n  <p>But as of this writing, on Tuesday morning, there is no White House briefing on the schedule for Tuesday, though Trump is set to deliver remarks on small business in the Rose Garden at 3pm.</p> \n  <p>Elsewhere, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced a death toll in continued decline and started to look towards reopening parts of the state, while states including Texas and Ohio outlined <strong>their own plans to reopen</strong>.</p> \n  <p>More to come.
