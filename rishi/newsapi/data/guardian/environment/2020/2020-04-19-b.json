Mosques and holy sites would be kept closed at least until 4 May, but he urged Iranians to pray at home. The holy month of Ramadan starts on 23 April.</p> \n  <p>Tehran was gridlocked with traffic on Saturday when office employees were asked to return to work. Public transport, seen as a major transmitter of the virus, is unable to cope with the passenger traffic, making government commitments to implement smart distancing largely ineffectual. Traffic into Tehran was up 70% from traffic on the same day last year, Tehran police chief Mohammad Reza Mehmandar said.</p> \n  <p>Rouhani acknowledged the dilemma, but said the solution was for councils to purchase more buses, or bring back into use those that had broken down. Crowds also gathered outside banks on Saturday to purchase a SIM card required to access a government grant of 1m Iranian toman ($23). Pictures of the crowds were emblazoned on Iranian newspapers with reporters questioning government policy. As many as 600,000 made unemployed due to the lockdown had registered for the government grant, but living standards of the middle class are also sliding. </p> \n  <p>Health ministry figures on Saturday showed the number of new deaths had fallen to a record low of 73. The number of new infections was 1,374, part of a steady downward trend. But Tehran\u2019s mayor pointed to an Iranian parliament report saying the official figures undercounted the number of deaths caused by the virus due to the lack of effective testing in hospitals. Opposition sources produce figures for deaths that are as high as 30,000, more than six times the official figures.

They arrived as expected and were distributed to hospitals over the weekend.

There was already a loss of confidence and real anxiety across the NHS and care system around PPE supply. This will have been further eroded by what has happened this weekend.

In a joint statement, they said concern about lack of PPE was so great that some doctors may decide not to take the risk of treating infected patients.</p> \n<p>They said that, given the flaws in PHE\u2019s advice, \u201cWe think clinicians should carefully evaluate the risks before taking a decision about whether to provide care, and should discuss a decision not to provide care with a colleague.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf shortages continue or worsen, our members will face increasingly difficult decisions.

  "<p>The government is facing increasingly rigorous scrutiny of its actions in several areas over its preparations for and response to coronavirus. Here are the main areas of criticism:</p> <h2>Death rates</h2> <p>The most obvious and tragic crisis of all. The UK has now recorded more than 16,000 coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals, and thousands more are believed to have occurred in care homes and elsewhere. This puts the UK on an apparent course to match the very high death rate of places like Italy. The government is, however, urging caution over direct comparisons given the different ways in which statistics are collected across nations, time lags in terms of the outbreak, and demographic differences. At Sunday\u2019s Downing Street briefing, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said a meaningful comparison might not be possible until some months after the pandemic had eased.</p> <h2>Testing</h2> <p>The UK remains very low down the international league table for the proportion of the national population tested for the virus, a measure seen as crucial to tracking its spread and thus laying the ground for a gradual end to the lockdown. The government has already missed its target of 25,000 tests a day by mid-April, and remains some way short of its end-of-April goal of 100,000 a day; 21,626 were carried out on Saturday. There is also no sign of the promised millions of simpler antibody tests, as their accuracy remains dubious, even though the government bought 3.5m of one type.</p> <h2>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-close-is-the-nhs-to-getting-the-18000-ventilators-it-needs-coronavirus\">How close is the NHS to getting the 18,000 ventilators it needs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This has proved of the most regularly difficult tasks for the government \u2013 getting enough PPE to not just hospitals, but also care homes and other settings like prisons and local authorities. On Friday, it emerged that guidance had changed to say NHS staff should use smaller, less effective aprons if, as seemed imminent, stocks of full gowns ran out \u2013 troubling news for hospital workers amid growing numbers of staff deaths.</p> <p>A consignment of gowns was due to arrive as part of a shipment of PPE from Turkey on Sunday, but has been delayed. Ministers have pointedly declined to guarantee supplies as needed, saying the situation is very challenging given the massive global demand for supplies. In the meantime, staff have to decide whether to agree to work without proper protection.</p> <h2>Ventilators</h2> <p>On the one hand, despite initial fears, there has not yet been a massive shortage of the complex machines used to help people breathe as their lungs recover from the virus, but even after the UK\u2019s target to secure 30,000 was downgraded to 18,000, that figure has still not been met. However, there has been political fallout over the apparent confusion about a plan to get private companies to design and build new models. A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f393d77-8e5b-4a85-b647-416efbc575ec\">Financial Times story</a> talked of companies being confused as to the brief, and of little progress being made. On Sunday the UK <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/response-to-ft-article-and-twitter-thread-by-peter-foster\">government published a</a> highly unusual rebuttal of these claims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Hospital capacity</h2> <p>As with ventilators, while there was initial panic at the idea of critical care beds being quickly overwhelmed, this has not been the case. The temporary acquisition of private spaces and the rapid construction of new sites has seen the number of these beds rise from about 4,100 in February to more than 5,500 now, with the occupancy rate falling from 81% to 58%. However, the overall numbers remain below what was pledged.</p> <h2>Political leadership</h2> <p>This might be the big one in terms of future focus. While Boris Johnson\u2019s long absence due to coronavirus is bad luck, the news that he missed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">five meetings of the government\u2019s emergency committee</a> while taking a break from No 10 when the virus was first emerging in the UK has prompted condemnation. His ministers insist that Johnson remained in charge.</p>",

  "<p>It\u2019s no surprise that keen readers have looked to books for historical analogues or literary insights into the coronavirus outbreak. Sales of the English translation of Albert Camus\u2019s 1947 novel La Peste (The Plague) are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/albert-camus-novel-the-plague-la-peste-pestilence-fiction-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\"> reported to have risen</a> by around 1,000% in recent weeks. Daniel Defoe\u2019s A Journal of the Plague Year, Don DeLillo\u2019s White Noise and Lucy Hughes-Hallett\u2019s Peculiar Ground have also all seen their mentions rise. So have other volumes with contagious disease or dystopian themes, presumably because readers hope they might shed some light on our unprecedented global situation.</p> <p>Of course there is more time for things like reading when we are stuck at home, unable to socialise or go to museums and concerts \u2013 or to borrow books, since libraries are shut. But it is notable that fiction sales, along with home-learning titles, experienced the greatest boost as the UK\u2019s lockdown began, because this indicates that it is not facts that people are after, but stories.</p> <p>For busy people, time to read fiction is often associated with holidays. With family get-togethers and outings disallowed, the fortnight either side of Easter was hardly that \u2013 even for children and adults with time off work. But the pandemic has forced a break in routine and presented people of all ages with many hours to fill up. Spying an opening for one of her enthusiasms, the Chinese-American writer Yiyun Li set up an <a href=\"https://apublicspace.org/news/detail/tolstoy-together\" title=\"\">online book group</a> to read one of the longest of all novels: Leo Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace.

People read and write novels in a multitude of ways. While Camus\u2019s readers are curious about how a French existentialist thought a disease outbreak might pan out, some people will be seeking entertainment or distraction.</p> <p>But there is one thing that readers of fiction have in common: the wish to be absorbed in a story that is not about themselves. It\u2019s not hard to see why such flights of imagination attract those who are physically confined. Not only because they have the power to lift us out of our domestic settings and away from the panicked scrolling of news headlines, but also because they can interest us in the lives and characters of other, made-up people.</p> <p>Except for young children, reading is usually a solitary activity. But it is the opposite of antisocial. Of course there are cruel and cynical novels, and many that are not primarily interested in human beings or relations. But plays, poetry and fiction have made a vast contribution to our knowledge and understanding of each other. As well as a private pursuit, reading is a builder of fellow feeling. That\u2019s why many people find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/10/indie-bookshops-grow-high-street-declines\" title=\"\">bookshops</a>, libraries and book groups so congenial.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/02/julian-barnes-i-was-wrong-about-em-forster\" title=\"\">EM Forster</a> once described words as \u201cthe wine of life\u201d. Clearly this is the wrong metaphor for non-drinkers. But it neatly conveys the garrulous aspect of literature: the ambition that it should bring people together. That people reach for books in such bleak times can give us hope that empathy, not misanthropy, is winning.</p>",

On the plus side, Mick Jagger\u2019s taste in floral curtains is rather chic, and John Legend\u2019s house has the desert-modernism aesthetic down pat.

Stevie Wonder\u2019s medley of Bill Withers\u2019 Lean on Me with his own Love\u2019s in Need of Love Today is a robust double-helix of solidarity. The Rolling Stones\u2019 rendition of You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want is superbly intimate, Jagger\u2019s big-hearted vocals juxtaposing perfectly with Keith Richards\u2019 Tom Waits-esque murmurs: stoicism and caution in a brotherly duet. Jennifer Lopez isn\u2019t generally thought of as a balladeer, but her performance of Barbra Streisand\u2019s People is Broadway-powerful, and its subject matter \u2013 humility in crisis \u2013 makes it perfectly chosen. Elton\u2019s performance of I\u2019m Still Standing is less good, delivered in the clipped \u201cclub style\u201d of Shooting Stars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d892b1b78c65e4b96986b63fe7884902681dd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d892b1b78c65e4b96986b63fe7884902681dd3/10_0_3750_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood performing on One World: Together at Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Getty Images for Global Citizen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the new generation, Billie Eilish is typically spellbinding. She picks out Sunny by Bobby Hebb, an infectiously joyful tune, but while the lyrics face forward into brightness and joy, the way Eilish performs it \u2013 using her sensual, high-frequency vibrato \u2013 acknowledges the pain that came before. Burna Boy\u2019s song African Giant \u2013 \u201cTell em Africa we done dying\u201d \u2013 deftly rebuts the narrative of desperate African strife that has dominated all-star benefit shows in the past, and Taylor Swift\u2019s moving performance of Soon You\u2019ll Get Better, originally written for her unwell mother, will no doubt have powerfully resonated with those whose family members are currently stricken. The line \u201cThis won\u2019t go back to normal, if it ever was\u201d, takes on a quiet political edge, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75c704cc211245ebbdbb62ffe6ba8c4b046ab18e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75c704cc211245ebbdbb62ffe6ba8c4b046ab18e/0_366_4844_2906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Student watches show on screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US student Abby Campbell works on homework via remote learning as she watches US singer Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O\u2019Connell perform</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Campbell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The BBC\u2019s package of the material slots it into a shiny-floor studio format ably presented by Clara Amfo, Claudia Winkleman and Dermot O\u2019Leary, the latter dressed to audition for a porn parody of the Steve Jobs documentary. The music takes a more soundtracking role with plenty of heartwarming montages of British health workers, bin men and more. There\u2019s also a wonderful sequence where Skip Marley plays his grandfather Bob\u2019s I Wanna Love You as a surprise first dance song for an NHS nurse who had her wedding cancelled because of the crisis \u2013 Richard E Grant plays best man, with Nadiya Hussain as cake provider.</p> <p>Paul McCartney\u2019s Lady Madonna is jazzily interpreted almost to the point of incoherence, but he and Tom Jones give evocative personal tributes to the NHS, with Jones remembering his own isolation at the hands of tuberculosis as a child. Michael Bubl\u00e9 \u2013 whose young son was treated for cancer in 2016 \u2013 delivers a rightly sentimental take on God Only Knows for health workers, but it\u2019s Little Mix who are the best of the Beeb exclusives with a perfectly harmonised version of Touch. Their melancholic take on a track that\u2019s about being ragingly horny hints at a painful side of self-isolation that only a pop song could address in this family-friendly format. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5825556af2c27d32804fbe535f130dff7249def8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5825556af2c27d32804fbe535f130dff7249def8/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift at the piano\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift performs Soon You\u2019ll Get Better.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Global Citizen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are striking moments across the six-hour preamble, too. Ellie Goulding\u2019s admission \u2013 \u201cI can get quite socially anxious, so you\u2019d think [lockdown] would be a breeze for me, but actually I\u2019m finding it really hard\u201d \u2013 is a moment of bracing candour amid the peace-and-love bromides, and the husk that develops around her voice as she pushes it into the red is one of pop\u2019s loveliest sounds. Kesha\u2019s ferocious-sounding cat sounds like it\u2019s keeping someone off camera well over two metres away; South African rapper Sho Madjozi flips her Good Over Here with lyrics castigating people breaking lockdown, and is one of the few moments of genuine fun.</p> <p>K-pop super-boyband SuperM are charming, indulging in lockdown pursuits like exercising, drawing, building a model ship and cooking some rubbish-looking bruschetta as they sing; the comment feed duly explodes into heart emojis. But it\u2019s Italian star Zucchero who steals the show, covering Everybody\u2019s Gotta Learn Sometimes on piano. The Korgis\u2019 song is about the loss of innocence at realising the sheer power of love, but in this context is charged with something even deeper: the pain of grief and the inevitability of death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32730a4e326844dd1f58b152614c90df1d1c8066\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32730a4e326844dd1f58b152614c90df1d1c8066/0_0_4000_2659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbours in Arlington, Virginia watch Eddie Vedder perform on One World: Together at Home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbours in Arlington, Virginia watch Eddie Vedder perform on One World: Together at Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although it\u2019s celebrating the work of the WHO, no one comes out to denounce Donald Trump\u2019s defunding of the organisation; Pearl Jam\u2019s Eddie Vedder edited out the government-bashing lyrics in his otherwise extremely powerful rendition of River Cross. Perhaps there is reticence to be seen to be politicising the crisis, despite it being so profoundly political. A cynical reading is that these performances are merely good PR, which of course they are; a more pointed criticism might be that for all the talk of it bringing people together, music is actually quite impotent in the face of such a devastating disease, and that awareness hardly needed to be raised about it. The situation is so grave for some that art will seem facile, even indulgent.</p> <p>But Gaga et al\u2019s intentions are ultimately noble, the performers are sincere, and their song choices channel poignancy, acknowledge tenacity and invite self-reflection. They also, meanwhile, show that the chief interior lighting choice for celebrities is the soulful application of candles.</p>",
  "<p>When Kevin Keegan became Newcastle manager in 1992 his first act was to fumigate the training ground. Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/newcastle-expect-green-light-saudi-takeover-despite-amnesty-misgivings\" title=\"\">the new consortium set to take over from Mike Ashley</a> is confronted by the demand for reform in virtually every sphere of the club. These should be their seven priorities \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Make a decision about </strong><strong>Bruce\u2019s managerial future</strong></h2> <p>Despite some sizeable bets predicting Max Allegri, the former Juventus manager, is Tyneside bound, sources close to the takeover say there will be no kneejerk decisions. It seems Steve Bruce\u2019s job is safe for now, even if he knows Rafael Ben\u00edtez remains the unmentioned pretender. Amanda Staveley\u2019s camp is close to Newcastle\u2019s former manager and although it could cost almost \u00a320m to extract the Spaniard \u2013 still adored on Tyneside \u2013 from his current posting in China, that fee will reduce with every passing month.</p> <p>Given the difficult context, Bruce has done a decent job this season and deserves respect and a chance to confound the doubters. Even so, the new owner will wonder if he possesses the necessary pulling power to fulfil their European ambitions by luring leading players to St James\u2019 Park.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/19/newcastle-takeover-this-is-a-chance-to-become-a-seriously-big-club-again\">Newcastle takeover: 'This is a chance to become a seriously big club again'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Rebuild the squad</strong></h2> <p>The flawed policy of investing significantly only in players aged under 25 deemed to possess high potential resale value has led to an imbalanced squad low on experience in vital areas, particularly attack. Scouting and recruitment needs a thorough overhaul and the impending appointment of a director of football \u2013 someone is apparently earmarked for the role \u2013 should start addressing this. Removing the entire complement of scouts from furlough \u2013 which has left them unable to study video analysis of transfer targets \u2013 would be a start.</p> <p>Bruce\u2019s squad is refreshingly committed but limited and requires infusions of quality if it is ever to be weaned off the cagey, counterattacking default mode that has virtually secured Premier League safety but hardly thrills spectators. Newcastle\u2019s healthy balance sheet should dictate that, providing player investment is shrewd, financial fair play rules should not pose insurmountable recruitment barriers. More immediately, there is the pressing matter of what to do with players whose contracts end on 30 June. These include the highly rated 20-year-old local midfielder Matty Longstaff \u2013 the subject of considerable interest in Italy and Germany \u2013 the quietly influential full-back Javier Manquillo and the injury-prone Andy Carroll. Then there is are futures of three loanees, Danny Rose, Nabil Bentaleb and Valentino Lazaro, to consider.</p> <h2><strong>Re</strong><strong>connect with fans and strengthen communication</strong></h2> <p>Thirteen years of Mike Ashley\u2019s stewardship have left supporters disconnected and disenfranchised. The need to restore and reinforce the ties that bind represents an urgent priority. Through no fault of the club\u2019s media team \u2013 they have, after all, being working for an autocratic owner \u2013 \u201cno comment\u201d has become the club\u2019s soundtrack in recent years. Little is ever truly transparent in football but in Newcastle\u2019s case increased openness is not only possible but required. Proper re-engagement with fans\u2019 groups, local politicians and businesses is also needed in a city dominated by the footballing citadel perched on Gallowgate. Sources suggest the consortium plans to help fund urban regeneration and such projects would certainly win hearts and minds. Ditto, welcoming former heroes frozen out by the Ashley regime, most notably Keegan and Alan Shearer. Chris Mort, the lawyer acting for Staveley, served briefly as Newcastle\u2019s chairman under Ashley; he can certainly advise the consortium what not to do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/exit-the-house-of-karrimor-enter-the-austere-and-unforgiving-house-of-saud\">Exit, the House of Karrimor. Enter, the austere and unforgiving House of Saud | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Boost </strong><strong>commer</strong><strong>cial </strong><strong>revenues</strong></h2> <p>When Ashley took charge in 2007, Newcastle\u2019s commercial (non-broadcasting) revenue was on a par with Tottenham\u2019s and only marginally behind Arsenal\u2019s and Liverpool\u2019s. Although the club has recorded an overall operating profit in seven of the past eight seasons, current income from commercial ventures \u2013 sponsorships, merchandising, overseas marketing \u2013 is almost identical to that commanded 13 years ago. This stasis is highlighted by the most recent set of accounts. These show Newcastle generated \u00a326.7m in this sphere, around \u00a380m a year less than Spurs. If revenue streams are to start flowing freely once more, ambition must be reignited and the commercial taps turned back on as the club\u2019s global profile is restored.</p> <h2><strong>Create a new infrastructure</strong></h2> <p>Although St James\u2019 Park requires a little updating, it remains among England\u2019s finest stadiums. Unfortunately, Newcastle\u2019s cramped and old training ground is a different story. It has slipped well below Premier League standard and in the north-east alone League One Sunderland and Championship Middlesbrough possess infinitely superior weekday HQs. Might old plans originally proposed by Sir John Hall to transform the derelict Woolsington Hall and its extensive grounds near the City\u2019s airport into a training ground/new academy/luxury hotel complex be dusted down and revived? Whatever happens, appreciable investment, and new ideas, will need to be directed towards an academy arguably punching well beneath its potential weight.</p> <p>It would help if Newcastle had a proper executive structure. At present they are in the rare position of operating without a board, with Lee Charnley, the managing director, the club\u2019s sole listed director.</p> <p>The extraordinary lack of debate and delegation characterising the Ashley era has to end but the many excellent, and dedicated, staff found in every corner of the club, and its charity foundation, must be cherished. Individuals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/20/andy-carroll-leads-newcastle-squad-whipround-assistant-kit-man-george-ramshaw-new-hip\" title=\"\">George Ramshaw, the seventysomething assistant kitman</a>, are part of a precious fabric and symbolise Newcastle\u2019s enduring heart and soul.

We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, when.</p> <p>\u201cBitter experience over the last few weeks has shown that until a consignment of gowns has landed, the boxes have been checked and the equipment tested, the NHS can\u2019t count on the gowns being available for use at the frontline.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand, for example, that a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is keen to move to a sustainable supply of gowns as soon as possible but NHS trusts need certainty. Given the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of.</p> <p>\u201cOn the current position in trusts, it is important to understand what \u2018running out of gowns\u2019 means. Usually it doesn\u2019t mean that no member of staff in that trust has access to a fluid repellent gown or higher levels of protection than a basic apron.</p> <p>\u201cTrusts tell us that they are adopting a number of different approaches to address current shortages. These include concentrating the use of fluid repellent gowns in areas of highest risk such as intensive and critical care and using fluid resistant, as opposed to fluid repellent, coveralls with an additional apron, in line with the advice issued on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cTrust leaders have asked us to publicly thank the fire and police services, vets, local councils, DIY stores, builders\u2019 merchants and others who have donated their supply of gowns and coveralls, many of them fluid repellent, over the last few days. For example one trust we spoke to this afternoon had secured 2,000 fluid repellent gowns from a local vet supply firm and another had secured 3,000 washable gowns from a local business that they were looking to adapt for NHS use.</p> <p>\u201cIn the words of one chief executive on Twitter: \u2018I cannot even begin to describe how hard NHS CEOs are working to organise, share and best use each piece of PPE we have. We are only sorry we can\u2019t do more to protect our amazing people.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:40:14.410Z\">at 5.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9c76928f080ee110447cd2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:06:13.465Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The government\u2019s daily press briefing has now concluded. </p> <p>The main points to note are the PPE equipment should be arriving in the UK tomorrow, there is no date for schools to reopen and schools will not be open over the summer holidays.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:31:47.562Z\">at 5.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9c75778f08bade1f296197\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:00:20.853Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dr Harries declined to say whether the UK had \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus. </p> <p>Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said earlier today he thought the UK was past the peak of the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the virus. </p> <p>Harries said: \u201cI would be very tempted to offer a comment on that today but I\u2019m not going to be, for a number of reasons.\u201d</p> <p>She identified that the low number of deaths recorded today was \u201cpositive\u201d but cautioned against reading too much into the figures, which are often retrospectively revised.</p> <p>Harries said: \u201cWe could jump to all sorts of positive conclusions about that, but we shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI do think it is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data that we are starting to plateau across.\u201d</p> <p>But she added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won\u2019t be past it, so this is no reason to consider that we have managed this.</p> <p>\u201cBut I do think things look to be heading in the right direction.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T16:31:26.576Z\">at 5.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9c75158f080ee110447cc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T15:58:31.797Z\">4.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On measures taken in schools in other countries such as Denmark to get them to open sooner, such as reducing class sizes, Williamson said: \u201cAre we looking at other countries and learning from them?

When PHE updated a component within its own test, the number of discordant results reduced to 15, it said. No information was given on whether these results were classed as false negatives or false positives.</p> \n<p>A PHE spokesperson added: \u201cThe UK was one of the first countries outside China to develop a testing capability for novel coronavirus.

  "<p>Many of the foreign doctors, nurses and care workers on the NHS frontline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">without adequate protection</a> are secretly struggling on another front, too. They cannot afford to pay the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff\">fees levied by the Home Office</a> to enable them to remain in the UK and continue their work. </p> <p>Often they fall into debt to pay the charges. Some of them simply leave the country once their permits are up for renewal, unable to find the money. The highest single fee they face is the immigration health surcharge, which must be paid in advance. So you have the spectacle of NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/calls-scrap-plans-nhs-fee-foreign-staff-health-surcharge\">paying to use the NHS</a>, even though they already pay tax and national insurance contributions.</p> <p>British citizens unfamiliar with the Home Office\u2019s fee framework struggle to understand this when they hear of it for the first time. They\u2019re unable to grasp that there are NHS staff who are taxed twice to use the NHS. Surely I must mean people on visitor visas who don\u2019t work in the UK, they say? Surely the NHS surcharge is directed at them, to disincentivise health tourism?</p> <p>No. I do not mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/health-tourism-claims-distraction-from-nhs-real-problems\">\u201chealth tourists\u201d</a>. I mean NHS doctors, nurses and care workers from outside the EU who spend the years between visa renewals fretting, saving and borrowing to pay for the cost of their next permit. The sums are crippling, particularly for junior doctors in training and nurses whose salaries start at about \u00a323,000 and \u00a318,000 a year respectively. The NHS surcharge at the moment is <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/what-is-the-immigration-health-surcharge/\">\u00a3400 a year</a>. There is no right of deferral, or ability to pay annually. It has to be paid in advance for the entire duration of an applicant\u2019s visa or residency permit.</p> <p>If an NHS worker has any family included on the residency permit, such as a spouse and children, the applicant has to pay the surcharge for them as well, again for the entire duration of the visa. So a family of four on a five-year work permit or limited leave to remain visa has to pay \u00a38000. The fee is to go up this October, <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/immigration-health-surcharge-rising-to-624-in-october-2020/\">from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624</a>. That same family of four will then have to pay \u00a312,480. I don\u2019t know if there are many people in the UK, let alone junior doctors, nurses and care workers, who have that kind of money lying around.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-health-surcharge\">surcharge was introduced</a>, like many of the more cynical and punitive features of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a>, by the coalition government in 2015. The sums are set arbitrarily and rise randomly, and we are assured the yield is ploughed back into the NHS, although it\u2019s hard to find evidence of what it is actually used for. The policy was intended to crack down on medical tourism to make sure the \u201cimmigration system is fairer to British citizens and legitimate migrants\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">NHS staff to be asked to treat coronavirus patients without gowns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The jargon masks the true nature of the victims of the legislation, while giving the impression that the measures target scheming <a href=\"https://keepournhspublic.com/health-tourism-fact-vs-fiction/\">illegal health tourists</a> who come to the UK to use the NHS and then disappear, costing the taxpayer millions. The surcharge is a fair one, the government claims, to be paid by all those who are \u201cnot ordinarily resident\u201d, a clever technicality that conjures up images of unemployed visitors, but in fact means the opposite. Tourists do not pay the charge, only overseas citizens<strong> </strong>working and studying in the UK do. </p> <p>\u201cNot ordinarily resident\u201d simply means \u201cwithout permanent residency\u201d. Those who fall into that category include a large number on work visas, low incomes and limited leave to remain, paying taxes, VAT and national insurance. Some, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/12/malaysia-gp-home-office-pushing-away-foreign-nhs-doctors\">Dr Siti Ibrahim</a>, a Yorkshire GP in training, have been educated in the UK and have spent decades living and working in the country. Faced with permit renewal costs of \u00a311,400, Ibrahim has been forced to consider abandoning her career. \u201cMy heart is here in the NHS,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I can only take so much.\u201d</p> <p>The unfairness of the NHS surcharge is even more pronounced against the backdrop of a pandemic during which foreign NHS staff are working extra shifts without pay, grateful for free coffee and food donations. With no exceptions, those I have heard from over the past few days, and who have been instructed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">not to speak publicly</a> to the media about work conditions or PPE, were happy to work those extra shifts.</p> <p>With no exceptions, they all said they did not know where they were going to find the money to pay for their visa renewals when the NHS surcharge rises once again in October, when it will also be expanded to those from the EU. They cannot put their names to this anxiety, but they can be heard. There are <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7783/\">153,000 non-British workers in the NHS</a>. The government needs to abolish the NHS surcharge for all of them, with immediate effect.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan\">Wuhan </a>were starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.</p> <p>As the mystery illness spread in one of China\u2019s major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\"> after a government cover-up</a>.</p> <p>One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/li-wenliang-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-profile\">Li Wenliang</a>. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.</p> <p>In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours online\u201d, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his \u201cmisdemeanour\u201d and promising not to repeat it.</p> <p>Many early cases were linked to the city\u2019s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0/0_0_4000_2774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January 11.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species \u2013 in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater \u2013 before infecting humans.</p> <p>But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.</p> <p>Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.</p> <p>The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mixed-messages-idUSKBN2102GY\">flu </a>with fairly mild symptoms.</p> <p>But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.</p> <h2>Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles</h2> <p>The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.</p> <p>Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.</p> <p>Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.</p> <p>Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. \u201cI think there was some over-confidence,\u201d admitted one very senior Tory last week.</p> <p>The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.</p> <p>While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.</p> <p>With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all \u2013 and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.</p> <p>The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February \u2013 five days after Li\u2019s death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking about the EU on 3 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking about the EU on 3 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a sign of where priorities lay \u2013 and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east \u2013 Hancock wasted no time <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1227981463192309760?lang=en\">recording a video of himself</a> grinning with delight on reshuffle day.</p> <p>He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to \u201cget cracking\u201d and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories\u2019 manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of \u201cdealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe\u201d before adding, as the grin returned: \u201cNow let\u2019s get back to work!\u201d</p> <p>It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government\u2019s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.</p> <p>Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January \u2013 a period during which <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">more than 14,000 people</a> (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 \u2013 and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight \u2013 hard questions have to be asked.</p> <p>We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government\u2019s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be \u201ca very good result\u201d for the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">Boris Johnson missed five coronavirus Cobra meetings, Michael Gove says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.</p> <p>By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany\u2019s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.</p> <p>How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?</p> <h2>The warnings grow louder</h2> <p>David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March \u2013 later than many other countries \u2013 that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cWHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019,\u201d said Nabarro.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>WHO made it very clear \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed</p> <footer> <cite>Prof David Nabarro, Imperial College, London</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.</p> <p>A WHO official warned then that it was possible that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who-idUSKBN1ZD16J\">human-to-human transmission</a> had occurred in families of victims \u2013 a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast \u2013 and, inside China, officials were quietly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP\">told to prepare for a pandemic</a>.</p> <p>There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing\u2019s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/case-of-mystery-coronavirus-found-outside-china-for-the-first-time-thailand\">rowed back from his colleague\u2019s claim</a>.</p> <p>Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.</p> <p>But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.</p> <p>Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.</p> <p>On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China\u2019s dilemma and its approach \u2013 shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control \u2013 might have to be our nightmare within weeks.</p> <p>In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">speech on Brexit</a> in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. \u201cWe are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.</p> <p>\u201cThen, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Herd immunity\u2019: UK goes it alone</h2> <p>By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.</p> <p>Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.</p> <p>Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them<em>.</em></p> <p>Many also brought in some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-is-it-risky-to-go-to-the-pub-or-gym\" title=\"\">social distancing</a> measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China\u2019s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.</p> <p>Writing in the Observer last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-goes-it-alone-over-coronavirus-we-can-only-hope-the-gamble-pays-off\">Devi Sridhar</a>, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. \u201cRather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.</p> <p>\u201cThe plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards \u2018herd immunity\u2019, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.\u201d</p> <p>It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy\u2019s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.</p> <p>European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.</p> <p>Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.</p> <p>It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf/0_0_4262_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.</p> <p>But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government\u2019s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.</p> <p>In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.</p> <h2>Shutdown: Johnson changes tack</h2> <p>The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was \u201clikely to spread a bit more\u201d suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.</p> <p>Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. \u201cI must level with you,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cMore families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d On 18 March \u2013 just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards \u2013 the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a \u201cscreeching U-turn\u201d. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.</p> <p>The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.</p> <p>The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.</p> <p>Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government\u2019s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients \u201cfor a few hours\u201d. \u201cIf we had been told that that was the case\u2026 we\u2019d have said: \u2018Don\u2019t bother, you\u2019re wasting your time. That\u2019s of no use\u2019,\u201d she told the <em>Financial Times</em>.</p> <p>Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758/0_0_3920_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be starting from this place\u201d. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.</p> <p>The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government \u201cit almost seems wrong to be critical\u201d.</p> <p>But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.</p> <p>\u201cAn early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians \u2013 in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face \u2013 from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.\u201d</p> <h2>How the scientists reacted</h2> <p>When the investigations into the UK\u2019s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.</p> <p>Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d Bill Gates predicted several years ago. \u201cAnd it will have the impact of a nuclear war,\u201d he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.</p> <p>For its part, the WHO prepared \u2013 several years ago \u2013 a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called \u201cdisease X\u201d \u2013 \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d.</p> <p>As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. \u201cBut have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don\u2019t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the appearance of Covid-19 \u2013 caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus \u2013 in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.</p> <p>\u201cThe report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,\u201d says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. \u201cIt said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.\u201d</p> <p>For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. \u201cForty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. \u201cI presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. \u201cIn fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent \u2013 around mid-January \u2013 I became very worried.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China \u2013 again released in January \u2013 showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on February 10 after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on 10 February after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,\u201d he added. \u201cI sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: \u2018This one is out of the bag properly\u2019. He sent one back agreeing with me.\u201d</p> <p>Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.</p> <p>\u201cHe had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,\u201d Nurse recalls. \u201cIt did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears \u2013 by mid-February.\u201d</p> <p>By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. \u201cIt was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.\u201d</p> <p>In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cThese were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.\u201d</p> <p>Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. \u201cThen, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,\u201d says Wingfield. \u201cI would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.\u201d</p> <p>Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. \u201cPart of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,\u201d says Ball. \u201cBut Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Jonathan Ball</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPerhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cNone of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,\u201d Nurse says. \u201cWe had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.\u201d</p> <p>He and many others say an inquiry into Britain\u2019s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.</p> <p>Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. \u201cThere is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,\u201d warns Boyd. \u201cBut when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.\u201d</p> <h2>The lessons from the rest of the world \u2026</h2> <p>Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: \u201cIf Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.\u201d</p> <p>One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.</p> <p>But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.</p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.</p> <p>Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0/0_0_2677_1785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man in Wuhan on February 10, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man in Wuhan on 10 February, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country\u2019s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.</p> <p>The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html\">the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve</a>, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.</p> <p>China\u2019s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan\u2019s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.</p> <p>The pleas for help from Wuhan\u2019s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.</p> <p>Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.</p> <h2>\u2026 and the other country that didn\u2019t listen</h2> <p>If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.</p> <p>On 17 March parts of California issued \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-state-by-state-guide-to-coronavirus-lockdowns-11584749351?mod=theme_coronavirus-ribbon\">some restrictions in place</a>. Only five states had few or no controls.</p> <p>There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258/0_0_3708_2472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is ready to lift restrictions already.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is preparing to lift restrictions already.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame \u2013 among other targets \u2013 the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.</p> <p>There have certainly been questions about the organisation\u2019s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring.

  "<p>The Portuguese government has attributed the country\u2019s low coronavirus caseload to a swift, flexible \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d response and to the early closure of schools and universities on 16 March.</p> <p>Despite the fact that around 22% of Portugal\u2019s 10.3 million people are aged 65 or over, making them particularly vulnerable to the virus, the country has so far registered just over 20,000 cases and 714 deaths \u2013 far fewer than its neighbours.</p> <p>Spain has recorded more than 195,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths, Italy 176,000 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, and France 153,000 cases and around 20,000 deaths.

The country has been preparing for the worst-case scenario.\u201d</p> <p>Sales said that the decision to close all schools and universities in mid-March \u2013 when the country had logged 112 cases and no fatalities \u2013 had proved pivotal. \u201cAnticipating the spread of the infection and community transmission, the government decided to close educational institutions in order to limit the contact of a large amount of people in a confined place,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Six days after the country\u2019s educational establishments were shut, Portugal declared a state of emergency and moved into full lockdown after recording 448 cases. Spain had gone into lockdown on 14 March after logging more than 6,000 cases.</p> <p>Sales said the government had also moved quickly to increase laboratory and invasive ventilation capacity and to plan for the provision of more intensive care unit beds. He added that Portugal\u2019s rapid reaction had been helped by five years of sustained investment to bring the national health service back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/19/portuguese-death-rate-rise-austerity-programme\">pre-austerity levels</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBetween December 2015 and December 2019, the national health workforce has increased by 13%, which means that more 15,000 healthcare workers, including 3,700 doctors and 6,600 nurses, are working,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, between 2015 and 2019, government expenditure on health has increased by 18% (\u20ac1.6bn).\u201d</p> <p>Many health workers across the border in Spain argue that its response to the pandemic has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/covid-19-workers-in-spain-you-can-feel-the-fear-in-the-air\">hampered by a lack of investment in health services</a> \u2013 especially in Madrid, the region hit hardest by the virus.</p> <p>In\u00eas Fronteira, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the institute of hygiene and tropical medicine at Lisbon\u2019s Nova University, said investment in the health system had paid off, but added that Covid-19\u2019s relatively late arrival in Portugal had bought the country more time to monitor and prepare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf1c0e7951a26f94d8dbe35d85f0b4e111cb8787\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf1c0e7951a26f94d8dbe35d85f0b4e111cb8787/0_151_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man is given a face mask at a fruit market in Caldas da Rainha, Portugal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man is given a face mask at a fruit market in Caldas da Rainha, Portugal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barroso/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe detected the first case on 2 March and then local transmission began on 12 March \u2013 much later than in France and Spain, or Italy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSo Portugal had the opportunity to watch what other countries were going through, to see what measures were being taken, and to learn from those experiences.

For this type of response, you also need to have social and political cohesion to effectively implement public health measures.\u201d</p> <p>Sales said that while it was to soon to start drawing conclusions, \u201cWe are constantly learning with our outbreak and with other countries\u2019 experiences.

  "<p>Glimpsed through half-open doors, the panelled rooms of Frank Hollmeyer\u2019s Georgian terraced house remind you of a Dutch old master painting. Light slants across wooden floors; paintings and porcelain are arranged as if in a painting by Vermeer. For Hollmeyer, an art historian by training, those 17th-century artists excelled \u201cat intimate scenes of everyday domesticity, where everything feels composed\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s an approach he\u2019s applied here. The five-storey house, set on a shady garden square in south London, is Hollmeyer\u2019s \u201ccanvas\u201d. It\u2019s where he takes a quiet pleasure in re-ordering books or piling a blue and white Delft bowl with fruit, like an artist tweaking a composition.</p> <p>As the name of his Instagram account, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slightly_worn/?hl=en\" title=\"\">slightly_worn,</a> suggests, it\u2019s also a home that feels relaxed and unpretentious. There are deep sofas and burning grates upstairs for socialising and a large, eat-in kitchen in the basement for cosy suppers. Nothing is too \u201cpristine or polished\u201d in the house, which he discovered by chance in 2012. \u201cI\u2019d been looking for a bigger place with space to hang my paintings. My last home was in north London and I didn\u2019t know this part of London at all. But I\u2019d had supper with friends nearby and decided to explore,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6368d55395be196b4482868d3ffda3a12ee9c47b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6368d55395be196b4482868d3ffda3a12ee9c47b/0_959_7718_4628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The basement kitchen for cosy suppers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Relaxed and unpretentious\u2019: the basement kitchen for cosy suppers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As he passed the house in Kennington, noting the fanlight and arched windows, a young man opened the front door, attached a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign to the railings and disappeared inside. When Hollmeyer rang up to inquire, he discovered that it was a private sale. \u201cThe family had lived there for almost 30 years. One son wanted to be an estate agent, so his father had told him to have a go at selling this house.\u201d A gentlemanly deal was struck. Three weeks later, he moved in.</p> <p>Growing up in the Netherlands in the 1980s, Hollmeyer remembers how the old masters were omnipresent. Girls with pearl earrings peered out from wine coasters and \u201cnearly every living room had a Rembrandt poster\u201d. When he was a teenager the family moved to Amsterdam, where he became fascinated by its neo-classical architecture. \u201cWilliam and Mary brought that style to England. So you could argue that Georgian architecture owes a debt to them.\u201d</p> <p>This stucco and brick-fronted house has that mix of \u201cclassicism and austerity\u201d that he has always found so appealing. But over the centuries, original 1790s details had been masked by overzealous refurbishments. During his research, Hollmeyer, who is half Dutch and half German, discovered the square was built for workers at the nearby Bethlem Royal Hospital asylum (now the Imperial War Museum).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"318eb912bacf0495dea68960361d1ec7f5968376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/318eb912bacf0495dea68960361d1ec7f5968376/0_2283_6226_3735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A ship\u2019s timber and trompe l\u2019oeil in the bedroom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wood find: a ship\u2019s timber and trompe l\u2019oeil in the bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBy the 19th century this was a slum, marked in black on the map. In the 1930s, the council bought most of the square by compulsory order. This house was one of a pair laterally converted into flats.\u201d Georgian features \u2013 shutter boxes, skirtings, architraves \u2013 were ripped out. When Hollmeyer arrived, there were pine fireplaces, textured wallpaper and carpet-smothered stairs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve restored the house in stages as everything is so expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cAt one point I ran out of money, so I stopped.\u201d When he discovered a slice of original cornice, the builders were able to create a mould and recast it. The dado rail was reinstated and floorboards sanded and washed a light grey. For authenticity, Hollmeyer turned to historic buildings expert Tim Whittaker of the <a href=\"https://www.thespitalfieldstrust.com/\" title=\"\">Spitalfields </a><a href=\"https://www.thespitalfieldstrust.com/\" title=\"\">Trust</a>. \u201cHe visited and drew up designs for the shutter boxes and architraves.\u201d On the first floor, the library at the back has new panelling and a deep cornice. It too \u201cfeels very Dutch\u201d.</p> <p>There were other discoveries. While the builders set to work to redecorate the top-floor bedroom, they uncovered the weighty beam that runs from front to back. For decades, it had been completely obscured by a false ceiling. \u201cI found out that it\u2019s a ship\u2019s timber from Chatham dockyard. Good wood was very expensive in those days. So when ships were decommissioned the timber was sold to housebuilders.\u201d He points out the grooves along its length. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that they were cut to support decking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e1ebe5e2eadb25f1560ab33ef36c416c7c82d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1ebe5e2eadb25f1560ab33ef36c416c7c82d21/0_3456_6617_3967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deep sofas and burning grates in the restful sitting room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Deep sofas and burning grates\u2019: the restful sitting room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from the neoclassical trompe l\u2019oeil wallpaper in the bedroom, he has kept the decoration simple, scattering rugs and painting walls. In the first-floor drawing room, the long-suffering decorator tried three different shades before Frank hit on the ideal green: \u201cNot too leafy, not too cooking apple.\u201d Its depth acts as a foil for the 17th-century Dutch paintings \u2013 portraits, still lifes, landscapes \u2013 which Hollmeyer has bought at auctions over the years. Working from home during lockdown, he\u2019s had plenty of time to absorb their details.</p> <p>\u201cAcquaintances have become friends,\u201d says Hollmeyer, who also learned how to restore their gessoed frames using Dutch gilding. He\u2019s grown even fonder of his brown furniture, the stately wingback armchairs or the wavy, camel back sofa with its \u201cpatina of time\u201d. He\u2019s recovered them in plain, thick linens. There are no curtains anywhere. \u201cLike the window tax in England, the Dutch imposed a tax on curtains in the 17th century, so they were a rarity. I\u2019ve stayed faithful to that look.\u201d</p> <p>In the basement, he designed the country house-style kitchen, adding a butcher\u2019s block found online. Instead of conventional flagstones, there are French tomette tiles. Their subdued, pinkish tone is, he says, \u201cvery Dutch\u201d. When a more normal social life resumes, he\u2019s looking forward to laying the table for guests. There will be tulips in vases, bright Meissen plates and his signature prop: the lemon.</p> <p>\u201cAll you need is one for a splash of colour. It\u2019s an instant Dutch still life \u2013 on a budget.\u201d</p>",

Last Thursday media minister John Whittingdale met industry figures to discuss the way forward.</p> <p>If journalism is to be saved as an essential public good a lot more needs to be done \u2013 not just by government with public money, but by the technology companies that have benefited from a disfunctional market and by the newspaper industry itself, too.</p> <p>For a start, the news industry must prove why a legacy in print media justifies any kind of special treatment: it can do so by providing the kind of news and information a democracy deserves and requires. We may all dislike different newspapers, and indeed columnists, but the journalism that makes a real difference \u2013 from the Windrush scandal to the murder of Stephen Lawrence to MPs\u2019 expenses \u2013 costs money, but in the current system dominated by global tech giants, the market is failing to support it.</p> <p>There will be a long and no doubt bitter debate about what constitutes good journalism. The industry has a code of conduct, but for too long it hasn\u2019t been properly adhered to. In the post-Covid world, when the news business needs to prove its credentials, that should no longer be the case.</p> <p>Google, Facebook, Apple and Twitter share much responsibility for the mess we\u2019re in \u2013 their executives have spent years dismissing news journalism as this era\u2019s fax machine, while pocketing large amounts of money from the content it provides. Digital newsroom initiatives and paid-for research do nothing more than put a shiny gloss on that fact.</p> <p>On Friday the NUJ launched its own <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/nuj-launches-news-recovery-plan/\">news recovery plan</a> which suggested a windfall tax of 6% on digital firms. This is a good idea but as one-off it isn\u2019t clear how it could work over the long term. At least Facebook and Google have taken steps in recent weeks to support newspapers in this time of crisis, while Apple has not. The latter continues to take a 30% cut on all new digital news subscriptions through its iOS apps \u2013 the same goes with any one-off payments. Apple could at least suspend these payments for the time being.</p> <p>The very idea of state intervention \u2013 last mooted in February 2019 by the Cairncross Review into newspapers \u2013 is likely to cause outrage among both those in the industry who see it as an attack on the fourth estate, and those who don\u2019t believe journalism deserves public funding.</p> <p>Neither major newspaper groups nor the government supported calls in the Cairncross review for a public institute for news. I spoke to Frances Cairncross, who led the report, to talk about the current crisis. \u201cThe pressures are so imminent and so powerful that there is a danger that much that is good and would otherwise have survived, will be destroyed,\u201d she says.</p> <p>There are immediate things which could be done and are likely to win support from both an industry opposed to all state intervention \u2013 and a Thatcherite such as Whittingdale. For a start, the government could use public money to pay for local advertising, not just for its own messages but to support local industries currently closed by the lockdown. Denmark, like many Nordic countries, has a history of state support for journalism more or less replacing newspaper advertising with public money this year. Bringing forward VAT tax reliefs announced in the budget and allowing newspapers to claim business rates relief, even though they must keep operating, are other possible measures.</p> <p>These are small beer compared with the sort of public funding first recommended by Cairncross and backed by the NUJ. It is surely time to at least consider longer-term support.</p> <p>The big questions are where this money comes from and what kind of journalism it will support. Using public money to support journalism which has long been diminished by greedy owners will be as bad as allowing online platforms to rip up the basic compact of news.</p> <p>The shareholder model of news ownership failed long before innovative digital platforms showed up its inefficiencies. No more can local newspaper groups, such as Johnson Press and others, asset strip news organisations to achieve 30% profit margins which are then spent on dividends and executive suites rather than newsrooms. The NUJ calls for public money to be withheld from firms using it to sack people, cut pay or block union recognition all while handing out fat bonuses \u2013 that seems entirely reasonable.</p> <p>The NUJ\u2019s windfall tax on digital groups is also a good idea but will it be sustainable? Surely an ongoing rearrangement of the way content is paid for online via licensing agreements would be better.</p> <p>Faced with historic demands on the public purse it will be true to form if the current government looks to the BBC to help out. This would be a mistake and could prove unpopular. Having delayed payments from the over-75s and stepped up its public service offering with education and more during the pandemic, the BBC faces a cash-strapped future of its own. It would be a travesty if it\u2019s now forced to help local news even more, having stumped up millions for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs\">Local </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs\">Democracy Reporting Service</a> already.</p> <p>The post-Covid world is likely to see less money for everyone, of course, with the exception of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. We will all need to work out what needs supporting with limited resources. Even discussing state support for journalism shows how far the news business has fallen. But if we accept that journalism is vital to society, and the current economic model doesn\u2019t work, then something must be done, not just by the government but by all of us.</p>",
  "<p>Just a couple of months ago we were inside the rugby bubble. The Six Nations was coming towards a conclusion and domestic competitions were in full swing all over the world. We were saturated by the sport and we were comfortable, and when that happens you can start to pick holes.</p> <p>Over the past few years, highlighting rugby\u2019s problems has become a popular thing to do. I admit I have been among the more vocal in that sense but it has become widespread. There is a temptation at the moment to just will rugby back, warts and all, because players will be desperate to play and fans desperate to see some action, but it is important to resist.</p> <p>As and when rugby does return we need to see it in its best light. This feels like a seminal moment, an opportunity to reset and reboot and we have to accept that change never happens spontaneously. You almost need a moment like this to be able to reflect, declutter and broaden your perspective as to where we\u2019re at, where we\u2019ve been and where we want to go.</p> <h2><strong>Apply the laws properly</strong></h2> <p>This is not the time to rip up the lawbook and start again but it is the time to start applying the laws properly. To name just a few issues, we should look at ruck entry, players going off their feet, box-kicking, reset scrums, players goading each other and backchat to referees. I would like to see rugby borrow from cricket where teams are fined for slow over-rates. It is in the lawbook that you need to set a scrum with 30 seconds, or a lineout within 30 seconds, or take a kick at goal within a certain amount of time. If those laws are flouted I want to see fines handed out \u2013 either financial or in terms of points. We\u2019re trying to protect our sport and make it as viewer-friendly as possible \u2013 that has to underpin every change rugby makes. We have seen that changing behaviours is possible. Sam Warburton\u2019s red card <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/15/wales-france-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">in the 2011 World Cup semi-final</a> is a good example and I believe Jared Payne\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/09/ulster-jared-payne-ban-saracens-alex-goode-heineken\" title=\"\">2014 sending-off against Saracens</a> in Europe is another. There are a few easy quick fixes that would make the game quicker, slicker and more attractive to viewers.</p> <h2><strong>Usher in a global calendar</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/my-favourite-game-france-v-new-zealand-1999-rugby-union-world-cup\">My favourite game: France v New Zealand, 1999 Rugby World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A uniform global calendar that works for both hemispheres makes all the more sense in the current climate. Try explaining to someone who does not follow rugby just why we have a block of Premiership matches at the start of the season, then a couple of European fixtures and then a November series. I love watching the autumn internationals but at times like this you can take a step back, look at things with more perspective and ask why they exist. You have southern-hemisphere players at the end of their seasons and the north near the start of theirs \u2013 everyone is in a different mental and physical state. I\u2019d like to see a block of international matches grouped together where club competitions go on hold and I\u2019d like those Tests to be meaningful. At club level, let\u2019s introduce the Club World Championship. At a World Cup you have to play seven games if you want to win it and what better way to prepare players for that level of intensity than doing so with their clubs? The clubs would get better value out of knowing they have their players for an extended period of time. A Club World Championship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\" title=\"\">has been</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\" title=\"\">mentioned</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\" title=\"\">before</a> but the reaction was lukewarm at best. </p> <h2><strong>Co</strong><strong>operate and compromise</strong></h2> <p>In order to achieve that, however, there must be greater cooperation and compromise among the unions, the league and all stakeholders. Put simply, we cannot afford not to. Every union is undergoing financial hardship to varying levels but the Rugby Football Union is the richest in the world and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/world-rugby-sends-80m-coronavirus-relief-fund-to-national-unions-rugby-union\" title=\"\">expecting losses of \u00a350m</a>. All unions have to listen to one another, they have to hold hands \u2013 it almost feels like marriage counselling. The past 25 years, since professionalism was introduced, have been amazing, but we have to learn lessons to make the sport more economically sustainable. Let\u2019s look at the tier-two nations, who have always been in this situation. We\u2019re starting to understand their struggles. Fiji, Samoa or Tonga come up to Twickenham and get only \u00a350,000 for a game. Eyebrows are always raised but it then gets accepted and happens again. </p> <h2><strong>Work to keep clubs healthy</strong></h2> <p>The very first thing that must be addressed is the salary cap \u2013 that has to be reduced. The Premiership clubs made a collective loss of nearly \u00a350m last year and you cannot keep throwing money at debt. Moderating the salary cap would ensure the health of our clubs and a way to do that would be getting rid of the marquee players rule. If you have one player earning, say, \u00a3500,000 and he\u2019s a marquee but another player of similar ability who is not, that creates tension and drives up wages. I\u2019m sure players will read this and say: \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a player.\u201d I want every single player to be paid as much as they can in a sport which is absolutely brutal but the harsh reality is that I also want this sport to survive. Players are taking 25% wage cuts and the truth is that may well become the new norm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Time for central </strong><strong>contracts?</strong></h2> <p>Taking things a step further, this may finally be the time to introduce central contracts. I wouldn\u2019t say they are inevitable but I think a serious conversation about the issue is. It is a simple fact that in the current climate there will be major investors in our game who can help to bail out clubs and that comes with a cost. If the RFU provides financial help to the clubs they will want more control and a larger say and I think we are moving in the direction of central contracts. At the moment, clubs simply cannot afford to keep hold of their prized assets and I\u2019m not sure it is worth them doing so given the limited amount of time they have them for. The compensation that they get for producing world-class players through their academies is not enough. The owners would not like central contracts but their businesses will have been hit by the lockdown. Any reasonable way that the pressure can be relieved would be welcome.</p> <h2><strong>Put player welfare first</strong></h2> <p>None of the above can happen without the players and the most important aspect of rugby\u2019s return is their welfare. There are a huge number of games to be played and the cold, hard truth is that the players cannot be expected to fulfil all of the fixture backlog. The key is finding the middle ground where a return doesn\u2019t put a stress on the NHS, so it is inevitable that in the short-term rugby will be played behind closed doors. Ultimately, however, economics will play a big part in the return date because otherwise clubs will fold.</p>",

  "<p>Crammed into work camps, stood down from their jobs, facing high rates of infection and with no way home, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers are bearing the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in the Middle East, migrant advocates and diplomats say.</p> \n<p>Such workers\u2019 risk of exposure to Covid-19 is so high, rights groups say, that host countries need to offer the same protections granted to their citizens or face the threat of a rampant outbreak that proves ever more difficult to contain.</p> \n<p>Concern is focused on the wealthy Gulf states, where migrant labour makes up half or more of the population. Gas- and oil-fuelled economies have lured millions of low-skilled workers from south and south-east Asia and Africa over recent decades.</p> \n<p>Construction workers are now mostly confined to dormitories, far from the skylines and stadiums they had been building, and stripped of their incomes.

In Kuwait, the UAE and Bahrain, official figures suggest nearly all cases have been among foreigners, many of whom live in labour camps.</p> \n<p>A report released by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre this month noted that migrant workers in the Gulf \u201clive in tightly packed labour camps, often in unsanitary conditions, some without access to running water.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese conditions provide the perfect conditions for the spread of Covid-19.

The traders are understood to be storing the excess crude in the hope it can be sold at a profit when demand for transport fuels returns later this year.</p> <p>The slump in demand has created an oversupply of 9m barrels a day in the global market which threatens to swamp the world\u2019s traditional oil storage within weeks, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics.</p> <p>The analysts expect a \u201cmassive\u201d increase in oil storage of between 500m to 1bn barrels of oil compared with stock levels at the end of February, which could fill global storage facilities to the brim by May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This could trigger an oil market collapse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/oil-price-may-fall-to-10-a-barrel-as-world-runs-out-of-storage-space\">to an average price of between $10 to $20 a barrel in the second quarter of the year</a> \u2013 from about $65 a barrel at the start of the year \u2013 and force oil producers to shut their wells.</p> <p>S&amp;P Global expects an oil market recovery to be \u201clargely delayed\u201d until next year even after the world\u2019s largest oil producers struck the most ambitious supply deal in history to cut up to 20% of world\u2019s output from next month to ease the global glut.</p> <p>\u201cThis may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/13/historic-oil-production-cuts-slump-demand-goldman-sachs-coronavirus\">too little and too late</a>,\u201d S&amp;P Global said.</p>",

It starts by stopping the fighting everywhere. Now. That is what our human family needs, now more than ever,\u201d he said.<br><br>Guterres\u2019s call was <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/6747501/coronavirus-pope-francis-ceasefire/\">endorsed earlier this month</a> by charities, religious organisations and human rights groups. Pope Francis threw his weight behind it in an Easter Sunday address.<br><br>On Friday, Henrietta Fore, head of the UN children\u2019s fund, Unicef, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061962\">warned that 250 million children</a> living in the \u201cwaking nightmare\u201d of conflict desperately needed warring parties to stop fighting as the pandemic spread.<br><br>More than 50 governments have also backed Guterres\u2019s initiative, including several Nato allies. In a joint letter, which the US and Russia declined to sign, they expressed concern that the UN security council had yet to take action.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs the global Covid-19 pandemic spreads, we are concerned about the plight of women, children, and all civilians caught in armed conflicts \u2026 these populations are already impacted disproportionately by armed conflict.</p> \n<p>\u201cAn immediate global ceasefire would markedly reduce these impacts, allow for much-needed humanitarian assistance and protection, and hopefully diminish the spread of Covid-19,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.government.is/diplomatic-missions/embassy-article/2020/03/30/Statement-on-behalf-of-53-countries-Call-for-an-immediate-global-ceasefire/\">the letter said</a>.<br><br>Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary and acting prime minister, has pledged Britain\u2019s backing. Coronavirus was \u201cthe fight of our lives and we must unite against it\u201d, he said.</p> \n<p>But the US continues to prevaricate, while negotiations continue. Kelly Craft, US ambassador to the UN, expressed support for a global truce earlier this week and said she hoped the French resolution could be agreed soon, possibly this week.</p> \n<p>But a State Department spokesman was more circumspect. \u201cThe United States supports the secretary-general\u2019s call for a global ceasefire, but have noted that we will continue to fulfil our legitimate counter-terrorism mission,\u201d the spokesman told Foreign Policy.</p> \n<p>Agreement on a ceasefire has been further delayed by US demands, now reportedly dropped, that the resolution refer to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, a description that would have drawn a Chinese veto. The US also objected to language supportive of the World Health Organization, which Trump has attacked and defunded.</p> \n<p>Macron nevertheless expressed optimism on Wednesday that the draft resolution would be agreed. He said he had spoken personally to Trump, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/macron-trump-uk-china-putin-un-truce-call-edb78ed5-b890-449a-b801-0ea66534823c.html\">all had offered their backing</a>.<br><br>Macron said he was hopeful Putin would also come onboard, and that a video summit of the five permanent members of the security council would be held to announce their agreement.</p> \n<p>While such an outcome may enhance the prestige of the council, which has been sharply criticised for inaction during the Covid-19 crisis, it may disappoint those demanding an unconditional truce and an effective, joined-up international response.</p> \n<p>If the big powers can choose to ignore a UN-mandated global ceasefire when it suits them, analysts warn, then non-state actors and terrorist groups may decide to do likewise.</p> \n<p>Since Guterres made his call last month, sporadic progress has been reported in several conflict zones. The Saudi-led coalition announced a ceasefire in Yemen, and there have <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/global-ceasefire-call-deserves-un-security-councils-full-support\">been positive responses</a> in Colombia and the Philippines. In all, the UN has cited 12 countries in which at least one party to a conflict has acknowledged the ceasefire appeal in order to battle the pandemic.</p> \n<p>But in Afghanistan, one of the world\u2019s longest-running conflicts, there are signs that the growing impact of Covid-19 may be undermining tentative peace efforts, while Isis has called on its followers to attack the \u201ccrusader nations\u201d while they are distracted by the disease.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a> was eerily quiet this week. Normally, the IMF\u2019s two buildings in Washington DC would have been full of finance ministers and central bank governors gathered together to discuss the state of the global economy. This year, the meeting was a virtual yet still an important one: the most significant since the financial crisis.</p> <p>Piecing together the story of the spring meetings of the IMF is a bit like peeling the skin off an onion, with the health emergency caused by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> pandemic the outer layer. Since it was created at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, the IMF has seen many crises, but nothing like this one. Never before has it needed advice from epidemiologists to do the predictions for its flagship publication: the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020\">World Economic Outlook.</a></p> <p>One layer down from the health emergency was an economic emergency. Dealing with Covid-19 has involved extreme measures that have meant businesses have been shut and workers left idle. The WEO forecast that the global economy will shrink by 3% this year \u2013 an assessment not based on the latest data and so likely to prove optimistic.</p> <p>Country-specific data provides a better picture. Britain\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility says that if the lockdown goes on for the whole of the second quarter, gross domestic product <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">will shrink by 35%</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-economy-shrinks-record-wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-rises-50-percent\">China reported its fastest rate of economic decline</a> in more than half a century, while the unemployment numbers from the US were a horror show. In four weeks, the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economic-toll-jobless\">jobless claims has reached 22m</a> \u2013 erasing all the employment gains in the 11 years since the global financial crisis.</p> <p>The biggest falls in activity will be seen this year in the countries with the highest number of virus infections: the rich, developed part of the world in the main. But the impact has also been severe on emerging market and low-income countries, which are intrinsically more vulnerable. In the past few weeks, the IMF has received calls for help from 102 countries, more than half its membership.</p> <p>So the third layer of the onion was the policy response: the IMF gave its approval to the decision by central banks to turn on the money taps and to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/spend-what-you-can-to-fight-covid-19-imf-tells-member-states\">$8tn (\u00a36.4tn) of stimulus </a>provided by finance ministries. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said she had $1tn of financial firepower at her disposal and was prepared to use it. She also successfully rattled the tin for some emergency programmes, with the UK among those countries that responded. Creditor countries agreed to suspend debt payments from more than 70 of the world\u2019s poorest countries for six months.</p> <p>Even so, the multilateral response was less impressive than it might have been. Calls for the IMF to sell some of its gold reserves \u2013 which have soared in value in recent weeks \u2013 to pay for a more generous package went unheeded. Nor did Georgieva press the case she made last month for the go-ahead to issue a new tranche of special drawing rights (SDRs) \u2013 reserve assets that the IMF can create and distribute to its members.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/will-coronavirus-shock-the-global-economy-into-long-term-thinking-\">Will coronavirus shock the global economy into long-term thinking?| Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not 2009, when the international community came together with a coordinated response to the financial crisis. In retrospect, the London G20 summit in April of that year was a high point for multilateralism: since then it has been downhill all the way. Donald Trump has neutered the World Trade Organisation and last week threatened to cut off US funding to the World Health Organization. The reason Georgieva went quiet about SDRs was because the idea ran into opposition from the US, which can veto any proposal coming out of the IMF that it doesn\u2019t like. Removing another layer of skin exposes a much weaker form of internationalism. What last week\u2019s meeting needed was a progressive narrative around which countries could rally and a willingness of the US to fulfil the leadership role it has had since 1945.</p> <p>Neither was much in evidence, because America has a different agenda. Covid-19 has highlighted and accelerated a struggle for global hegemony between the US and China: the final layer of the onion.</p> <p>For the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2013 and probably longer than that \u2013 the US faces a rival that Washington knows is a real threat. The Soviet Union never managed to provide its citizens with the living standards found in the west; China, courtesy of decades of rapid growth, has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2018/02/04/why-tens-of-millions-remain-poor-in-china-despite-fast-growing-wealth/\">virtually eradicated extreme poverty</a> and made consumer goods available to millions.</p> <p>A new cold war is raging. Trump\u2019s objection to the IMF\u2019s SDR plan was that some of the reserves would find their way into the hands of regimes he didn\u2019t like: those in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank-sdrs/u-s-opposition-seen-stalling-major-imf-liquidity-boost-idUSKCN21X0L8\">Teh</a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank-sdrs/u-s-opposition-seen-stalling-major-imf-liquidity-boost-idUSKCN21X0L8\">ran and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 Beijing</a>. The WHO\u2019s mistake was to take at face value the lies told in the initial stages of Covid-19 by the Chinese government, when the spread of the pandemic outside China could have been prevented.</p> <p>The Chinese seem to be up for the fight. Beijing says, wrongly, that the virus was imported from the US, and will exploit to the full the propaganda value of its economy starting its recovery before that of its geopolitical rival. China is developing a new digital currency in the hope that the hegemony of the US dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency will be challenged and views itself being at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence as a means of cementing authoritarian control.</p> <p>The US is right to be worried. It is, though, too glib to say that the 21st century will be China\u2019s just as the 20th was America\u2019s. The US has been written off many times and always found a way to reinvent itself. The struggle will be long and hard.</p>",

More than 400 newsrooms from around the world \u2013 with a combined audience nearing 2 billion people \u2013 have signed on.</p> <p>In the coming days, the Covering Climate Now partners will collectively publish hundreds of stories on climate solutions to create a groundswell of hope at a moment when the world feels bleak. Throughout the week, we\u2019ll be sharing Guardian content with CCN partners for republishing, so that even outlets without dedicated environmental reporters can inform their audiences of the dangers of the climate crisis and opportunities for change. Covering Climate Now has provided financial support for some of our climate reporting this week.</p> <p>The Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media, from wire services like Reuters and AFP to newspapers like the Times of India and the Christian Science Monitor, and dozens of local and special-interest outlets, across all mediums, from across the US and world.</p> <p>The Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. This year, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/29/guardian-to-ban-advertising-from-fossil-fuel-firms-climate-crisis\">announced</a> it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organization to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels. Last year, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/17/why-the-guardian-is-changing-the-language-it-uses-about-the-environment\">updated its style guide</a> to introduce new terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world.

Kyle Pope, CCN co-founder and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, writes that in 2018, \u201cbroadcast news outlets gave more airtime to the royal baby than to the warming earth\u201d.</p> <p>In 2019, that started to change. \u201cThe climate story seemed to be moving from slow to fast, as the effects of the crisis were becoming impossible for even the most stubborn newsrooms to ignore,\u201d Pope writes. \u201cFloods in Venice and droughts in India were ready-made for the evening news. Devastating fires in California and Australia led news broadcasts around the world. Mass protests and their student leaders adorned magazine covers.\u201d</p> <p>While the project began in the US, Covering Climate Now has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

  "<p>In early April, a young grizzly bear swam through the chilly waters off the western coast of Canada in search of food.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/boo-grizzly-bear-hibernation-video-nicole-gangnon\">Groggy grizzly bear caught emerging from hibernation in viral video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He came ashore on Hanson Island, one of more than 200 rocky outcrops in British Columbia\u2019s Broughton archipelago, and quickly started eating garbage from a cabin.</p> <p>It was a dangerous move: bears that get too comfortable eating food waste and start to lose their fear of humans are quickly shot.</p> <p>But this bear\u2019s death was averted through an unlikely partnership between local Indigenous groups and conservation officers, raising hopes of a more holistic approach to wildlife management with greater Indigenous input.</p> <p>In recent years, the presence of bears along the scattering of islands has become a cause of concern for locals and conservation officers.</p> <p>Typically, after months of hibernation, grizzlies in the region will hunt for clams and mussels. But this bear smelled something better and easier: garbage.</p> <p>Locals named it Mali, in honour of the Mamalilikulla First Nation whose traditional territory encompasses the collection of islands.</p> <p>And as Mali continued to forage for food scraps, conservation officials took notice.</p> <p>The province has a long and often fraught relationship with grizzly bears. Until 2017, trophy hunting was permitted in the province \u2013 a deeply divisive practice that had lost public support in previous years. As many as 250 bears, from a population of 15,000, were killed annually.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/the-value-of-a-bear/\">practice has also divided First Nations</a>: many had provided guiding services for hunters and benefited from the hunt, but other Indigenous communities have grown frustrated with the speed with which conservation officers shoot problem bears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f03beb39f9385a96866876768a1e59d81685fdd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f03beb39f9385a96866876768a1e59d81685fdd3/102_163_1255_1569/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mali is airlifted to an undisclosed location on the province\u2019s mainland.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mali is airlifted to an undisclosed location on the province\u2019s mainland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzie Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January, a male grizzly named Gatu appeared in a neighbouring community on the northern tip of Vancouver Island. He became too comfortable around humans. First Nations pleaded with conservation officers to come up with a proactive approach.</p> <p>But their request \u201cjust fell on deaf ears\u201d and <a href=\"https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/grizzly-bear-death-prompts-call-for-changes-to-wildlife-act-1.4764126\">the bear was shot and killed</a>, said Mike Willie, a wildlife guide and hereditary chief of the Kwikwasut\u2019inuxw Nation.</p> <p>As elsewhere, conservation officers in British Columbia have long taken the view that a habituated bear \u2013 one that has lost its fear of humans and is comfortable rummaging for food in urban areas \u2013 is effectively a dead bear walking.</p> <p>But when a local guide showed him footage of the new grizzly, Willie hoped this time might be different. Working together and with the non-profit Grizzly Bear Foundation, local First Nations hatched a plan to trap the bear and transport him by helicopter.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want our bears killed any more. We have the right to govern within our own traditional territories and we have inherent rights and we have title,\u201d said Willie.</p> <p>Conservation officers were initially set on killing the bear, leading to a brief standoff between the two groups. Soon, the province\u2019s environment minister was weighing in, asking all involved to consider a different, non-lethal approach.</p> <p>\u201cOnce everything settled down, the conservation officers switched from a kill plan to a relocation plan. And it was amazing really to see them in action,\u201d said Nicholas Scapillati, head of the foundation. \u201cThey became very caring about how they could trap this bear and relocate him safely.\u201d</p> <p>On 13 April, Mali was successfully captured alive and moved to an undisclosed location on the province\u2019s mainland.</p> <p>\u201cWithin minutes of waking up, he wasn\u2019t eating garbage. Now he\u2019s in a remote, beautiful estuary, eating sage grass, which is what he should have been doing,\u201d said Scapillati.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/canada-mourns-takaya-the-lone-sea-wolf-whose-spirit-captured-the-world-aoe\">Canada mourns Takaya \u2013 the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The province\u2019s minister of environment, George Heyman, praised the result, saying the \u201cdesire for reconciliation\u201d with Indigenous peoples helped guide the process.</p> <p>While the bear\u2019s life was saved, locals worry that diminishing food sources, including a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/12/canada-disappearing-killer-whales-ecosystem-crisis-chinook-salmon\">decline in salmon</a>, could prompt more bears to make the journey.</p> <p>But for Willie, the success with Mali marks a critical first step in changing what he sees as outdated views of conservation.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels that this could be a blueprint to move forward \u2013 for us and for other First Nations on the coast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a really good ending.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked \u2013 and we\u2019ve asked ourselves \u2013 why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-thursday\">Covid-19</a> seems to be impacting Princess so heavily.\u201d Thus spoke Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC1jVkY9hqE\">video posted</a> on social media in mid-March. She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: \u201cWe don\u2019t really know.\u201d Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the \u201cdiverse mix of people onboard our ships\u201d and is \u201cbeing magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world\u201d. She implores her \u201cguests\u201d with a \u201csimple request\u201d: \u201cWe ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination \u2026 as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that divide us.\u201d </p> <p>Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their <a href=\"https://www.ship-technology.com/news/covid-19-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-eighth-death/\">Diamond Princess</a>, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell\">Grand Princess</a> was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March. Something similar happened to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coral-princess-cruise-ship-docks-florida-coronavirus-pandemic\">Coral Princess</a> in early April, off the coast of Florida. And this to say nothing of the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article240761311.html\">Caribbean Princess</a>, which has twice this year had to end cruises early, due to hundreds falling ill from a quite different infection, the vomiting bug norovirus.</p> <p>But not everyone is yet convinced that all of Princess\u2019s misadventures are purely bad luck. New South Wales police have launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, to see whether its owners were \u201ctransparent in contextualising the true patient and crew health conditions relevant to Covid-19\u201d. They are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">suspected of lying</a>, in other words, about conditions on the ship. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-cruiseship-law/passengers-sue-over-coronavirus-hit-grand-princess-cruise-ship-idUSKBN20W30T\">Legal actions</a> have sprung up from unhappy \u201cguests\u201d of the Grand Princess, their trips-of-a-lifetime wrecked by allegedly inadequate screening procedures. Professor Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese expert on infectious diseases who went on to the Diamond Princess, described the onboard response to the virus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/scientist-decries-completely-chaotic-conditions-cruise-ship-japan-quarantined-after#\">completely chaotic</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53e45a0502b247b90ec7290a5fd7ec3f7cf45e8/220_0_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Princess Cruises president, Jan Swartz, greets passengers from the Diamond Princess as they disembark after their quarantine on 20 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Princess Cruises/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Princess is not alone in its troubles. It is one of several lines owned by Carnival Corporation, a giant and aggressive company, which as long ago as 1996 was reported by David Foster Wallace, in an <a href=\"https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf\">epic article</a> on the cruise experience, to be nicknamed \u201cCarnivore\u201d. Carnival\u2019s roughly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cruise_lines\">40% share of the market</a> also includes the Holland America line, which owns the Zaandam, which had to travel up the west coast of South America with sick and dying passengers on board, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/07/zaandam-onboard-the-coronavirus-hit-cruise-ship\">Chile closed its ports</a>. Other ships, both owned by Carnival and not, have had outbreaks of disease or been denied permission to enter ports. All new cruises have now been suspended, with some provisionally scheduled to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/cruise-lines-suspending-operations-over-coronavirus/\">restart in May</a>.</p> <p>A rather obvious question is whether Covid-19 is simply an act of God, or whether its impact on their passengers, crew and host ports has been magnified by the practices of cruise companies. They vigorously push back against this suggestion: a spokesman for Carnival tells me that \u201cthe cruise industry took action before most other industries on land took actions\u201d, that \u201ccruise ships are social gathering places, but no less risky than any other social gathering venue\u201d, and asks \u201cwhen was the last time you were asked to fill out a health record before being allowed to enter a concert?\u201d In the case of the Diamond Princess, say Princess Cruises, they were following instructions from the Japanese health authorities.</p> <p>Trust on this question, on the other hand, is not improved by reports that some cruise-line salespeople (not Carnival), in mid-March, were being instructed to talk punters out of their concerns about Covid-19, for example claiming that the coronavirus could not survive in tropical climates and that therefore it was a good time to visit the Caribbean. Trust is further weakened by the cruise industry\u2019s long history of environmental and safety lapses, and their special skill at minimising the consequences to themselves.</p> <p>A bigger question is whether the virus will dent, deflect or alter what has been a phenomenon of our times, the many-times multiplication of ship sizes, of passenger numbers and of profits, generated by an industry that manufactures its own version of reality, then shapes the places that its ships visit in the image of that reality. Cruises, as Wallace put it, serve that \u201cpart of me that craves pampering and passive pleasure: the dissatisfied-infant part of me, the part that always and indiscriminately <em>wants</em>\u201d. Cruises are founded on fantasy, which means the removal from view of anything irksome or demanding of difficult choices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b9a1dd891f550306dbe490afdfde8ca614f95a5/0_46_1407_844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medics transport a body from the MS Zaandam, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 2 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SMG/Zuma Press/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruise companies have been growing at least since the 1980s, with a 7.2% compounded <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#46c597465fa2\">rate of revenue growth</a> from 2010 to 2019. Their ships, which were generally under 50,000 tons until the mid-90s, have become beasts of 220,000 tons and more. Alongside the growth in quantity has gone an ever-advancing science of customer experience, of investment in ice rinks, climbing walls, spas and casinos, in decking out ships like Vegas resorts, a process that reached some kind of apogee with the 5.260-passenger <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/venice-themed-cruise-ship-with-its-own-st-marks-square-built-for-chinese/\">Costa Venezia</a>. Aimed at the Asian market, this Venice-themed ship comes<strong> </strong>complete with gondola rides and a version of the Piazza San Marco. For cruising is above all an entertainment and hospitality industry, albeit grafted on to the serious engineering needed to keep large ships afloat.</p> <p>All of which might be good, clean fun, if the growth of cruises weren\u2019t accompanied by reports of pollution spills, outbreaks of disease, accidents, mistreatment of workers and sexual assaults and other crimes. If these reports don\u2019t change much over the decades it is because the cruise lines don\u2019t change much, either. They can spend lavishly on lobbying and campaign contributions to friendly politicians, and hire lawyers to see off the lawsuits when things go wrong. Their business being offshore, cruise lines are free to choose the countries where they register their ships and incorporate their business, which means places like Panama, the Bahamas or Bermuda, where they can <a href=\"https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-cruise-ships/\">pay low taxes and get an easy ride</a> on labour rights, and on health, safety and environmental regulations.</p> <p>\u201cThey only change when they have to,\u201d says Ross Klein, a sociology professor at Memorial University in Newfoundland, whose website <a href=\"http://cruisejunkie.com/\">cruisejunkie.com</a> chronicles the mishaps of the cruise business. And nobody much makes them change. There is<strong> </strong>a trade body, the <a href=\"https://cruising.org/\">Cruise Lines International Association</a> (CLIA), which promotes the business and in theory upholds standards. \u201cThey will tell you that they have mandatory regulations and that they meet or exceed international regulations,\u201d says Klein. \u201cWell, we asked CLIA\u2019s senior vice-president what happens when a company violates these regulations: nothing. Perhaps a stern talking-to, but otherwise nothing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's not just the filth and damage that ships emit, but the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cruise companies\u2019 aversion to responsibility can be seen in a legendary court filing following the \u201c<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/travel/carnival-cruise-triumph-problems/index.html\">poop cruise</a>\u201d of 2013, in which failing generators on the Carnival Triumph caused a backup of raw sewage into the passenger areas. Carnivals\u2019 lawyers, CNN reported, said that the \u201cticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.\u201d Equally striking was the legal outcome to the 2012 wreck of the Costa Concordia, when the party atmosphere of cruises mixed fatally with questions of navigation: the owner Costa Crociere (another part of the Carnival empire), with the help of a plea bargain and \u20ac1m fine, and despite <a href=\"https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL1120956/Marine-professionals-call-for-jailed-Costa-Concordia-masters-case-to-be-reviewed\">clear failings</a> on its part, was freed of any management and operational responsibility.</p> <p>Or you could take another incident that befell the ever unfortunate Princess Cruise lines, when the Caribbean Princess was found to have been dumping oily waste in the sea off southern England. In 2017 a Florida court found that the Caribbean and four more Princesses had been engaging in <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2016/12/articles/pollution/deliberate-dumping-coverup-and-lies-doj-fines-princess-cruises-40000000/\">illegal practices</a>, issued a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cruise-line-ordered-pay-40-million-illegal-dumping-oil-contaminated-waste-and-falsifying\">record fine of $40m</a> and put the company on probation for five years. President Jan Swartz performed a hand-wring to camera, as she has over Covid-19, to say that \u201cwe are very sorry for the actions of our employees\u201d and that \u201cthe marine environment is incredibly important to us\u201d.</p> <p>Princess ships then continued to pollute, for example by depositing faecal coliform in Alaskan waters. In 2019 they were <a href=\"http://www.cruisejunkie.com/envirofines.html\">fined a further $20m</a>. If a combined penalty of $60m sounds like a lot, it is as Klein points out a small portion of the $3bn or so <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-record-full-year-earnings-300769295.html\">annual profits</a> of Princess\u2019s owner, Carnival. \u201cTo them, that\u2019s just a cost of doing business,\u201d he says.</p> <p>And you have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55238-z\">Venice</a>, the actual city rather than the theme versions, where for years what are effectively multistorey hotels have been looming over its historic architecture, their mighty parps competing with church bells, their diesel<strong> </strong>smoke polluting the air, damaging the ecology of the lagoon and, say protesters, the foundations of buildings with the water they displace, and discharging thousands-strong fluxes of tourists on highly managed six-hour trinket-and-selfie binges in the city. Then, last summer, the 65,000-ton MSC Opera, its engine failing, crunched into a moored tourist boat like a boot on to a bug. There were miraculously no deaths, but the crash made the cruise industry\u2019s previous assurances of safety sound hollow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfedb9ea2f3b77a87f3c724bd0547e33d3b2229d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfedb9ea2f3b77a87f3c724bd0547e33d3b2229d/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cruise ship passing by the San Marco Square in the Giudecca canal, Venice, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cruise ship passing by the San Marco Square in the Giudecca canal, Venice, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49276730\">excited reports</a> last year that large ships would be banned from the city, nothing definite has been decided. At most, larger ships will be displaced to other ports in the Venetian lagoon, which would involve new environmental impacts. Among <a href=\"https://skift.com/2019/08/19/venices-big-money-conundrum-to-solving-its-cruise-ship-crisis/\">the complications</a> in finding a solution is the fact that Carnival, Royal Caribbean and other big cruise companies are shareholders of the company that owns Venice\u2019s maritime port.</p> <p>The issue is not just about the filth and damage that ships emit into Venetian air and water, but of the superficial interaction that cruise ships generate between passengers and their host city. Eleonora Sovrani, of the local campaign group <a href=\"https://weareherevenice.org/\">We Are Here Venice</a>, argues that the cruises\u2019 \u201cguests\u201d \u2013 on their brief visits, following itineraries proposed by the ships, visiting outlets suggested by them \u2013 never leave the cruise \u201cbubble\u201d. The city is forced \u201cto change its aspect to answer expectations of the cruise companies,\u201d she says, in what is a form of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d.</p> <p>What goes for Venice now goes for many other places in the world. In pre-virus Sydney, successive ships would be moored near the considerably smaller Opera House, almost permanently blocking certain views, while others would be waiting their turn out in the bay. Cruises have shown increasing enthusiasm for invading the Arctic and Antarctic, their paths eased by the melting of globally warmed ice, with many thousands of gawpers descending on tiny Inuit settlements. In New Zealand, Princess Cruises \u2013 hello, my old friend \u2013 were obliged to apologise for their crassness, after some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/02/cruise-company-apologises-after-staff-pose-as-maori-for-traditional-welcome\">non-Maori men</a> with DIY skirts and scribbles on their face were hired to perform an am-dram version of a traditional Maori welcome to passengers on the Golden Princess.</p> <p>To all these points<strong> </strong>the cruise industry naturally has its responses. <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">They make claims</a> about health, safety and the environment, which for the reasons given by Ross Klein should be treated sceptically. They say, for example, that <a href=\"https://cruising.org/about-the-industry/policy-priorities/public-health-and-medical/nororvirus-on-cruise-ships\">norovirus is rare</a> on cruise ships, using data from the US <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The CDC, however, is only able to obtain information on ships that visit US ports, so can\u2019t give global statistics, which limits the usefulness of any conclusions that might be drawn.</p> <p>Cruise companies argue that they create employment, which they do, for everyone from officers to crew to waiters to beauticians and standup comedians. They say that they bring revenue to their host cities, which they also do, though Klein and others <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517717302418\">dispute the level of benefits</a> claimed by the companies</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadfe9b58d82b8aef0dc2f894c71122cf32b0a28/0_65_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bar and dancefloor of the Costa Fortuna, owned by the Carnival corporation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since cruise passengers sleep on their ships and also tend to eat and drink on them, their benefit to local hotels, restaurants and bars is limited. Those shore-based traders to whom the ships direct their passengers generally have to pay a handsome cut for the privilege. Cruise lines also acquire interests in terminals and retail outlets, such that even more income is whisked away from their host ports. Just supposing that the tourist dollar were not so relentlessly hoovered up by cruises, might it not be generating other, maybe more rewarding jobs in businesses that don\u2019t have the same breaks on taxes and regulations?</p> <p>The cruise companies\u2019 strongest argument is that their customers love their product. Which, mostly, they do. Even some who endured the Covid-cursed cruises say they will go back to the ships when they can. And to sail the seas and see the world is, indeed, a great thing. But perhaps cruise passengers would have an even better time if there weren\u2019t a nagging feeling that the management might not be totally on top of novel or familiar viruses on their ship, or that the excretions and eructations of their big white ships are trashing the beauties they are paying to see.</p> <p>And claims of passenger satisfaction and revenue-generation should not invalidate the wishes of host cities for basic respect or the argument that the quality of interaction between tourists and locals is as important as the quantity. As Sovrani puts it, cruises should adapt to cities, not the other way round. Again, cruise passengers might have a better time if they were not thrust into the cogs of an engine of exploitation.</p> <p>Much, of course, depends on what happens in the world to come after the virus, which not so long ago was barely a blip on the radar. <em>Forbes</em> magazine, on January 20, could see only \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/#36bb9cc065fa\">smooth sailing</a> into the 2020s\u201d. In February CNN quoted various experts saying it was <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/cruise-safety-coronavirus/index.html\">still OK to cruise</a>. The <a href=\"https://cruisedialogue2020.org/\">Cruise Dialogue conference</a> met in Cartagena, Colombia, also in February, asking its industry delegates and speakers \u201chow best to accommodate the seemingly unstoppable growth of cruise activities?\u201d Almost no one mentioned the virus.</p> <p>The Zaandam set off on its disastrous voyage on 7 March (when, as Klein points out, a number of ships had already been turned away from ports). On the previous day there was the first talk of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/06/white-house-could-seek-timely-targeted-aid-us-industries-hurt-by-coronavirus-outbreak-top-adviser-says/\">federal help</a> for the cruise industry, an idea that seemed open to doubt, given the cruise companies\u2019 exotic registrations: if they don\u2019t pay US taxes, how could they receive US subsidies? Even <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/489788-cruise-lines-excluded-from-coronavirus-stimulus-bill\">President Trump</a>, who notwithstanding those pesky Panamanian and Bahamian flags called cruises \u201ca great US business\u201d, acknowledged the problem, before saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to try and work something out\u201d. Which, not least because Carnival\u2019s chairman Micky Arison is a friend and backer of Trump, the company having been a sponsor of <em>The Apprentice</em>, you can be sure he will try very hard to do.</p> <p>\u201cThe infantile part of me,\u201d wrote David Foster Wallace, \u201cis by its very nature insatiable.\u201d However much gratification and pampering it will receive, it \u201cwill simply adjust its desires upward until it once again levels out at its homeostasis of terrible dissatisfaction.\u201d He could as well have been describing the cruise business as its customer experience. Now, though, it is time for cruises to grow up: if the industry has been based on the outsourcing of reality, reality has come back to bite it. A CLIA spokeswoman tells me that they \u201caim to do our part to protect the sanctity of the destinations we visit so that they can remain a vibrant place to live and visit for generations to come\u201d. Let\u2019s hope so: if it wants public money and public trust, the cruise business should accept the public responsibilities it has been so good at shirking.</p>",

  "<p>Have we never seen Michael Jordan like this before, or is it simply that we forgot? Anyone who lived through the Chicago Bulls\u2019 domination of the NBA during the 1990s \u2013 even, like me, as a kid \u2013 can probably still recall the broad outlines of Jordan\u2019s talent, the qualities that made him such an exceptional athlete: the elasticity; the hang time; the spectacular dunks, ludicrous switch-hands layups, and clutch buzzer-beaters; the raw power. Jordan reigned at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man\">\u201cthe end of history\u201d</a>, in that curious decade between the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11, and for all his ability with a ball in his hand he\u2019s always seemed a little remote, a little above it all. He was the perfect athlete, in a sense, for the decade that fancied itself post-political. In an era that thought it had figured it all out, Jordan was the player who actually had.</p> <p>And yet. As The Last Dance, the 10-part documentary whose first episodes <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29044827/an-all-access-michael-jordan-documentary-how-last-dance-was-made-possible\">premiere on ESPN in the US on Sunday</a> (with the worldwide releases for each on Netflix the following day), shows, he was so much more. Yes, Jordan was gloriously, unironically macho. Yes, his body worked like a Swiss army knife, limbs cutting through the air in all directions at one moment then snapping back into a streamlined cylinder the next. Yes, he was capable of outrageous things on the court. But he was also a bully, a wrecking ball, the owner of a volcanic will to win, a man of almost unbearable intensity. However much joy Jordan gave to millions throughout his career, and will surely give to millions more with the release of this banquet of a documentary, it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that being him \u2013 occupying that body, harnessing that talent, channelling that unrelenting drive to be the best \u2013 must have been incredibly hard. The Last Dance is nominally about Jordan\u2019s last season with the Bulls, but flashbacks give us the full, luxurious history of His Airness, and what we\u2019re really offered by the end of it all is a study in sympathy. The man who emerges from these 10 hours of pure 90s nostalgia is heroic, preposterous, demanding, difficult, and sometimes outright tyrannical - and somehow only even more appealing for all his flaws. He cared about one thing, and one thing only: winning. Once you understand the singularity of Jordan\u2019s focus, everything else about him makes sense.</p> <p>The Last Dance takes its title from the name of the dossier that Bulls coach Phil Jackson, in a typically canny bit of marketing, handed to every player ahead of the 1997-98 season. Jordan had progressed from a promising but coltish No 3 pick in the 1984 draft to the NBA\u2019s first authentic international superstar; his rise paralleled, or rather propelled, the global rise of the league. But by 1997, five titles to the good, it had become clear that Jordan\u2019s Bulls had only one season left in them. Longtime general manager Jerry Krause had signaled that Chicago\u2019s team of champions would be broken up at the conclusion of the season. Jackson, the man who convinced Jordan, in the late 1980s, to set his ego aside and trust in the transformational beauty of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_offense\">the triangle offense</a>, was also to be shown the door. We all know how the story ends \u2013 Jordan led the Bulls to a second three-peat, before riding off into the sunset \u2013 but what happens along the way is all the pleasure of this spectacle. A TV crew followed the Bulls around for the duration of the season, and the footage they recorded \u2013 footage that has never been aired until now \u2013 forms the backbone of The Last Dance. We see Jordan coping with Scottie Pippen\u2019s back injury \u2013 the Bulls lieutenant ended up being out of action for the first 35 games of the season \u2013 and the ongoing discord between Pippen and management. We see him trying to keep the playing group together during the periodic disappearances and brain fades of an agreeably demented Dennis Rodman. We see him bickering with Steve Kerr, of all people.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9Z9JtNcCWY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N9Z9JtNcCWY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Most of all, though, we see Michael Jordan angry. If there\u2019s one theme that emerges most emphatically from The Last Dance it\u2019s the sheer force of Jordan\u2019s personality, the rage that drove him on. Repeatedly throughout his career, Jordan used slights against his greatness as motivation to obliterate all before him. He decided to destroy the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1992 finals because he didn\u2019t like comparisons suggesting he and Clyde Drexler were on the same level. He and Pippen resolved to gang up on Toni Kukoc in the first game the Dream Team played against Croatia at the 1992 Olympics because Krause, a regular punching bag, thought Kukoc was a good player who would improve the Bulls roster. He <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_offense\">punched Kerr in the face</a> in preseason ahead of the 1995-96 campaign, ahead of his first season back after 18 months away playing baseball, because \u201cwe were shit when I got back\u201d and a point needed to be made.</p> <p>To watch Jordan reflect on these incidents now, ensconced in the armchair of his spacious, beachy home, settled into a thick middle age, cocktail tumbler by his side, chuckling fondly as the filmmakers hand him a tablet and he watches the footage, say, of Gary Payton reflecting on his efforts to stop Jordan in the 1996 finals, it can all seem a little ridiculous that he ever took things so seriously.</p> <p>But if The Last Dance proves that Jordan was not exactly popular with his teammates, it also reminds us how magnetic his personality was, how charismatic and funny he could be, of the cult that quickly grew up around him. Repeatedly we see him goofing around in practice, bantering back and forth with the press, or on the Bulls\u2019 private jet, cigar in mouth (the sheer amount of tobacco smoked during The Last Dance would be enough to give most people lung cancer), gently teasing his entourage. The respect of his rivals is unmistakable. In the summer of 1995, as he prepared for his first full season back post-retirement, Jordan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/15/space-jam-20th-anniversary-michael-jordan\">was contracted to shoot Space Jam</a>. He asked Warner Brothers to build him a facility to practice in during the shoot, and the studio duly complied by creating the Jordan Dome, a custom-built indoor full-size basketball court and training gym. From 7am to 7pm, Jordan shot the film. Then, for three hours after shooting wrapped each night, he played pick-up games with a roster of the NBA\u2019s best, all of whom traveled to LA to be close to him: Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller, Dennis Rodman. \u201cThose were the best games,\u201d Miller recalls with boyish wonder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9f5fe82ac2bd974a7be115723bebe05dd939396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9f5fe82ac2bd974a7be115723bebe05dd939396/0_0_2589_1828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Jordan celebrates his second NBA title in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jordan celebrates his second NBA title in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Swart/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The series deals sensitively with <a href=\"http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/james-jordan-murder/index.html\">the murder of Jordan\u2019s father</a> and the other, darker chapters of his career: his gambling habit and lack of engagement in popular politics. Jordan\u2019s apolitical character \u2013 \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers too,\u201d he <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2016/07/did-michael-jordan-really-say-republicans-buy-sneakers-too.html\">reportedly said</a> after refusing to endorse North Carolina Democrat Harvey Gantt in his 1990 Senate race against the notorious racist Jesse Helms \u2013 has often been cited against him in the interminable debate over whether he or LeBron James deserves the title of greatest basketballer ever. Where LeBron is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/16/lebron-james-china-hong-kong-comments-nba\">fully committed to his role as a public figure</a> and unafraid to take polarizing stances on political issues, Jordan mostly shied away from anything that would alienate segments of his enormous, bipartisan fanbase. The Last Dance does not avoid pressing Jordan on these issues, though his answers are mostly unsatisfying; he claims he could not endorse Gantt because he \u201cdidn\u2019t know the guy\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that his priorities lay elsewhere: in making money, gambling (how strange that era\u2019s moral panic over Jordan\u2019s love of a bet appears today), and above all, winning. That focus on making money and doing all the talking on the court \u2013 which, on the evidence here, his teammates evidently shared \u2013 made Jordan the archetype of the modern athlete. Jordan was not so much an individual as an industry, and he set the template for the generations of athletic gods that followed: the endorsements, the clothing lines, the cultural tie-ins and carefully managed media spots. But the curation of his image was designed, very obviously to Jordan\u2019s mind, in pursuit of a single objective: being the best. Winning was the real aim, and everything else had to serve it. If Jordan did have any politics, any consciousness of racial or economic injustice, it was sublimated into the overwhelming fury that consumed him the moment he stepped on the court.</p> <p>The most moving scenes in The Last Dance show Jordan in the moments after clinching his first and fourth titles. In 1991 we see him in the dressing room next to his dad, face pressed to the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy, crying a torrent of tears, and for a second we\u2019re there with him, living the extraordinary catharsis of that first ring. In 1996, his first title back after the 18-month hiatus in baseball, he\u2019s back in the dressing room, clutching a ball, face down on the floor, his body convulsing as the tears flow untrammeled once again. These are the only moments in the documentary where we see 90s-era Jordan in any mode other than those of the training ground shit-talker, the on-court destroyer, the cigar-chomping GOAT; the only time he\u2019s not braggadocio on legs. It\u2019s fitting that the athlete perhaps best known in popular culture today for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying_Jordan\">\u201ccrying Jordan\u201d</a> meme should be reintroduced to us in this way. Myths and misperceptions swirled around Jordan throughout his career: that he was selfish, wasn\u2019t a team player, only cared about getting rich. To see the footage of him after those 1991 and 1996 titles, that Ferrari of a body heaving with uncontrollable tears, possessed by the release of victory, is to understand who Michael Jordan really was: as pure a competitive animal as professional sport has ever seen.</p>",

Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agencies handling of the pandemic. Payne was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus during an interview with the ABC.</li> \n   <li>The federal health minister, <strong>Greg Hunt</strong>, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in PPE equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. <strong>H</strong><strong>unt also took a swipe at the WHO</strong>, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.</li> \n   <li>The New South Wales health minister, <strong>Brad Hazzard</strong>, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police.</li> \n   <li>Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.</li> \n   <li>Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will re-open from Monday.

  "<p>In the opening passages of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sitopia-9780701188719.html\">Sitopia</a></em>, Carolyn Steel talks about the \u201cGoogle Burger\u201d, a \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3218,000) prototype piece of cultured meat, grown in a laboratory from bovine stem cells, with backing from, among others, Google\u2019s co-founder Sergey Brin. This technology may, as George Monbiot has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet\">recently argued</a>, help to save the world, but Steel is sceptical. She mistrusts the urge to find a technical fix, especially one that would put tech giants in charge of the world\u2019s diets. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier, she asks, if we just ate more vegetables?</p> <p>To which the answer is both yes and no. Eating more vegetables is not difficult. The hard part is silencing all those cravings \u2013 biological, cultural, psychological \u2013 that urge people to eat a lot of meat. The still harder part, once some virtuous souls have disciplined themselves away from animal products, is to persuade billions of other people, for many of whom plentiful meat is a newlydiscovered and hard-earned luxury, to do the same.</p> <p>Rather than apply technology to problems that modern society has created, Steel argues, it is important to address the patterns of thinking that got us into this mess in the first place. The issues are philosophical as well as technical, and personal and global at once. Food is \u201cthe substance that connects us to one another and to our world\u201d. Food is also love: \u201cfor social animals like us, the sharing of food will always be central to bonding with others \u2026 Throughout our lives, the chance to show our love through food lies in every meal that we grow, cook and eat. It is the basis not just of a good life, but of being human.\u201d</p> <p>Steel is an architect by training, whom I have known since we studied the subject together at university, and her thinking reflects a lesson we both learned: that different forms of knowledge and experience \u2013 in a building or in life \u2013 should be considered not in separate categories, but together and in the round. The concept of \u201cSitopia\u201d, a term coined by Steel in her earlier book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/08/scienceandnature\">Hungry City</a></em>, is that if we can eat well (and cook well and farm well) we are on the way to living well. Where Utopia is abstract and impossible, <em>Sitopia</em> is both grounded in daily experience and achievable: \u201cworking with food is the perfect antidote to living in our virtual, dematerialised world\u201d. It should also give pleasure. Food, in Steel\u2019s world, is always to be enjoyed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c7cf2bb0d4a23545e78b79cae7b5447b0f127ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c7cf2bb0d4a23545e78b79cae7b5447b0f127ef/0_55_758_455/500.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn Steel\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn Steel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Errol Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beauty of food is that it is so many things at once: necessity and treat, nature and artifice, the subject of science, philosophy, etiquette and art. The book is accordingly multiple in its themes, an all-you-can-eat buffet of thoughts and facts about food, drawing on (for example) the philosophies of Epicurus and Aristotle, some fascinating information about microbes and foraging, and reminiscences of childhood visits to the author\u2019s cousins\u2019 old-fashioned farm in Finland.</p> <p>Steel opposes those forms of science and economics that insist on division, thereby dismembering food\u2019s ability to combine different aspects of life. Neoliberalism\u2019s view of food as just another commodity, combined with mechanistic science, has, Steel believes, brought the world to its current state: one where food production contributes to climate change, where soil is impoverished, farm animals tortured and biodiversity ravaged, all in a desperate chase to produce food that, in developed countries, is often thrown away. Or, if it is not, it contributes to crises of obesity and related health issues.</p> <p>Steel\u2019s proposal is that food should be honoured by individuals and economies. From production to consumption, it should be given time, with a long-term view of such things as the quality of soil. What this means in practice is to some extent a return to old habits: sharing meals, more local distribution, smaller-scale production and more labour-intensive farming, although Steel does allow technology \u2013 the use of drones to survey crops, for example \u2013 some role. We have, she says, become dependent on cheap food, the price of which is only achieved by ignoring environmental degradation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/12/sitopia-how-food-can-save-the-world-carolyn-steel-review\">Sitopia by Carolyn Steel review \u2013 a utopian vision that begins with food</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In all of this, a big and not entirely answered question is who, exactly, are \u201cwe\u201d? Steel makes enthusiastic use of the first-person plural, wielding a protean pronoun that at different times means \u201cwe the human race,\u201d \u201cwe inhabitants of the western world\u201d and \u201cwe the educated and relatively comfortable people who are most likely to read or write a book like this\u201d. Its slipperiness causes most trouble when she argues that \u201cwe\u201d should pay the true cost of food, which might be double current prices. This will be bad news for those of \u201cus\u201d who already struggle to get enough to eat.</p> <p>Steel spots the problem and tries to address it, by suggesting that the employment opportunities offered by Sitopian farming will generate incomes enough to pay for Sitopian food. She\u2019s a little sketchy, though, as to how this new state of affairs will come about.</p> <p>Steel is not an economist, nor an agronomist. Not very surprisingly, she doesn\u2019t have all the answers to the huge questions she asks. But her instincts are profoundly right \u2013 food is indeed more than fuel \u2013 and this is a brave and ambitious book for stating them so strongly. She speaks, for sure, mostly to the privileged, but if the privileged can\u2019t make a start in eating and living better, who can?</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sitopia </em>is published by Chatto (\u00a316.99).

That disease killed a lot of people, but it also turned out to be comparatively mild. Though there had been concern that the next big pandemic was coming, swine flu lulled a lot of the world into a false sense of security. Still, the warning signs have been there for a long time: we also had<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/30/sars.china\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/30/sars.china\">Sars [in 2002-04]</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/mar/15/coronavirus-next-global-pandemic\">Mers </a>[first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012], two other coronaviruses.\u201d</p> \n<p>Thanks to this, when he first saw the images coming out of Wuhan in January, alarm bells rang. \u201cAnd from then on, it has been non-stop: just more and more intense.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walsh, speaking from his home in Windsor, looks pale and rather drawn \u2013 though no one looks healthy on Zoom. This morning he will edit a report from a Surrey hospital. It\u2019s a laborious process: his cameraman is in Brighton, his producer is in London; they must work remotely. Later, he\u2019ll head to Broadcasting House so he can be in the BBC studio for the evening news programmes: \u201cThe days tend to be long and relentless, if I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is the coronavirus pandemic the biggest story he has ever covered? \u201cYes, by far, and I feel a huge sense of responsibility to get the tone right, the messaging right, and to show people the reality of what\u2019s going on in our hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8a656713a3269a77b2bfab81f98e869618b8fba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8a656713a3269a77b2bfab81f98e869618b8fba/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BBC television reporters Hugh Pym and Fergus Walsh at Broadcasting House in London on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BBC television reporters Hugh Pym and Fergus Walsh at Broadcasting House in London on Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Since mid-March, the BBC has seen a huge increase in numbers watching its news programmes. The audience for the BBC <em>News at One</em> has risen 85%, the <em>News at Six</em> 74%, and the <em>News at Ten</em> of by 50%. The evening news programmes, and the two on which Walsh and his colleague Hugh Pym, the BBC\u2019s health editor, appear most often, now have a combined nightly audience of around 12.8 million \u2013 and no wonder. It isn\u2019t only that audiences are hungry for information. Between them, Walsh and Pym, together with their producers and cameramen, are delivering powerful journalism: most notably their reports from inside intensive care units at, respectively, University College Hospital in London and Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d been trying to get access to an ICU for some weeks,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cA lot of the coverage was coming out of the 5pm press conference. I felt we had to get back to the reality of what the virus can do. I was trying very hard to persuade people to let me in. There were good reasons why they weren\u2019t, but in the end it came down to a question of trust. I\u2019ve been doing this job a long time, and I\u2019ve built up a level of trust. I know a lot of the team at UCH \u2013 and they felt very strongly that they wanted people to see what they were having to cope with, the better to reinforce the stay-at-home messaging.\u201d</p> \n<p>Staff at UCH have since told him that they have been contacted by hospitals from across the country expressing gratitude that the reports went out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There were moments when I was deeply troubled by what I was seeing ... I thought people just don\u2019t realise.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fergus Walsh</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>What was filming in such circumstances like? \u201cIt has left a deep impression on me. I\u2019ve reported from all over the world on some very tough medical conditions. But nothing has affected me like this. There were moments when I was deeply troubled by what I was seeing. I walked into an operating theatre that had been repurposed to house two intensive care beds. That theatre looks over the Euston Road, and being there really affected me: the stark contrast between the relative normality of life outside, and what was happening inside. I thought: <em>people just don\u2019t realise</em>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the ICU, a patient needed to be turned on their front. There were eight staff, all in full PPE, very delicately turning this patient. It took a long time, and they were so gentle. I still find that very affecting even now. It haunts me, and [this has given me a sense of] how profoundly staff have been affected. They\u2019re not able to save a lot of those patients. They don\u2019t have a drug that will make them better. But they do what they can. What I\u2019m doing is nothing \u2013 <em>nothing \u2013 </em>compared to what they\u2019re doing. They are simply amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>He and Pym (who\u2019s also talking to me via Zoom, and who have known each other since they trained together in Falmouth) are aware of the criticism journalists are getting on social media for their coverage of the crisis: a perceived lack of tenaciousness at the government\u2019s daily press conference; talk of NHS heroism that obscures the reality of government failure.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven the technology [thanks to social distancing, journalists now attend remotely] the press conferences have been tricky,\u201d says Pym. \u201cPeople say: why didn\u2019t you follow up? But until they started allowing follow-up questions, that was difficult. The government side has offered us the chance to do filming on testing or drug trials, but it\u2019s so fast-moving: the communications team, civil servants and ministers are under huge pressure.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c664152a2fa6d7c899caee4d6f0f23bedb6d96d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c664152a2fa6d7c899caee4d6f0f23bedb6d96d/70_46_1346_807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A critically ill patient in the intensive care unit at University College Hospital in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A critically ill patient in the intensive care unit at University College Hospital in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Has he been leant on? Asked to tell the story in a certain way? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there has been any leaning. We could have had more access \u2013 that\u2019s why Fergus\u2019s reports [from UCH] were so important. There is a disconnect between what officials think is good for the media, and what hospital staff and journalists want to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>In terms of tone, it\u2019s more difficult. \u201cYou know some people feel you haven\u2019t got it right,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you know yourself you don\u2019t always get it right. You can only do your best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walsh is aware that his tone has shifted over the weeks. \u201cEarly on, I tried not to alarm people: coronavirus is mild for most. I emphasised that 99 out of 100 people will survive it. But when millions of people are affected, the small minority who die becomes a huge number. The tone has had to change. When it comes to language, I agonise over every sentence I write. I have used military metaphors. I do think we are in a war against the virus; the ICUs are the frontline in that war. But I don\u2019t think fights should be assigned to people. If someone dies, they haven\u2019t lost a battle, they\u2019ve been killed by a disease.\u201d</p> \n<p>Where will the story go next? Looking ahead, what\u2019s of most concern? For Pym, it\u2019s a question of what the NHS will look like after we pass the peak. \u201cHow long will critical care beds need to be available?

He sounds more grave. \u201cNo country in the world has an exit strategy yet. I\u2019m concerned about what the next year will bring. The only real exit strategy involves a vaccine, and though we may get small doses this year, in terms of mass production there\u2019s unlikely to be anything for 18 months.</p> \n<p>\u201cAdditionally, a lot of vaccines are not completely effective in older people, whose immune system response tends to be lower \u2013 so you can\u2019t protect the people most at risk. There seem to be only bad options in terms of how we get out of this. A price will have to be paid. I don\u2019t have very optimistic things to say to you. We\u2019re in for a very difficult time.

  "<p>Many had wondered what would happen when Donald Trump, failed salesman and gameshow host, faced a real crisis. Now they know. The man who pledged to stop \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in his inaugural address now owns it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/14/trump-coronavirus-alerts-disinformation-timeline\">Covid-19 has crowned him lord of misrule</a>.<br><br>That\u2019s fitting for a man who last week claimed to exercise \u201ctotal authority\u201d. Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor who understands what leadership means, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/14/trump-coronavirus-reopen-us-cuomo\">reminded him</a> the US does not do kings. But Trump and America\u2019s last monarch, George III, share much in common, tyranny-wise.</p> <p>Trump is more instinctive dictator than democrat, in the style of his favourite potentate, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Just look at his recent <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-threatens-to-adjourn-congress-to-get-his-nominees-through/ar-BB12GJX1\">threat to shut down Congress</a>, and his enthusiasm for suppressing minority voter turnout.<br><br>It\u2019s worth recalling that old King George became mentally ill, since Trumpism is clearly dangerous for your health. It\u2019s beyond reasonable dispute that his coronavirus posturing, preening, prevarication and paranoia fatally hindered the early US response.</p> <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s denial at the beginning was deadly,\u201d Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, <a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/41420-0\">said last month</a>. \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying.\u201d She repeated the charge last week, claiming Trump was still causing \u201cunnecessary death and disaster\u201d.<br><br>The result, so far, is around 700,000 Covid cases and 35,000 US fatalities. Is it fair to blame him personally for every preventable death? No. But they all occurred on his watch. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html\">his job</a> to look out for the American people. He is ultimately responsible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s inability to show competent, rational leadership at home and abroad is decimating America\u2019s worldwide reputation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s primary motive in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">issuing \u201cguidelines\u201d</a> last week to ease the lockdown was not concern for citizens\u2019 welfare. It was about reviving the economy and getting himself re-elected, come what may. Health experts and state governors forced him to drop rasher measures.</p> <p>Likewise, Trump endangers the world the US once aspired to lead. The under-resourced, under-pressure World Health Organization has made mistakes during this pandemic. But it retains a vital role in coordinating a global response. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/trump-turns-against-who-to-mask-his-own-stark-failings-on-covid-19-crisis\">unfairly maligned it.</a><br><br>Developing countries, which could be hardest hit in humanitarian and economic terms, need all the help they can get.

This is truly dangerous. It risks turning an already badly strained relationship into a second cold war.</p> <p>Trump raised the stakes again last week, alleging that China deliberately under-reported virus deaths. He gave credence to a conspiracy theory, already debunked by the Pentagon, that a biotech weapons lab in Wuhan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/trump-wades-further-into-china-covid-19-row-as-focus-turns-to-easing-lockdowns\">caused the original outbreak</a>.<br><br>Even Trump\u2019s blinkered \u201cbase\u201d can surely see what is going on.

The WHO decision sparked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/g7-backing-for-who-leaves-trump-isolated-at-virtual-summit\">a fierce backlash</a> from G7 allies and the UN, who pointedly stressed the need for multilateral solidarity.<br><br>Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s enduring hostility is bringing out the worst in Beijing.

A more aggressive generation of official and semi-official spokespeople has been unleashed by the emperor-president, Xi Jinping. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/france-summons-chinese-envoy-after-coronavirus-slur\">so-called \u201cwolf warriors</a>\u201d are churning out propaganda and lies of their own, notably a claim that the US army planted the virus in China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/trump-world-health-organization-reforms-china\">White House demands WHO reforms but is vague on details, diplomats say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is much to suggest that China, regardless of Trump, is exploiting the crisis to further its long-term aim of establishing a technological, economic and geopolitical advantage over the west.

So, too, should Trump. His reckless blame-games and political machinations are not only killing Americans and American influence overseas. Intensifying mutual antagonism also risks killing any chance that the world\u2019s two biggest powers will cooperate sensibly to eradicate this and future pandemics \u2013 for example, by backing a necessary, independent international inquiry into what went wrong. That, in turn, bodes ill for vital bilateral collaboration on the climate crisis and other urgent global challenges such as debt relief.</p> <p>The world cannot afford another four years of the chaos and carnage personified by Trump. Voting him out in November is the best solution. But what if, fearful of losing amid continuing mayhem, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/trump-cant-cancel-the-election-but-he-will-try-to-stop-people-voting\">he tries to delay the election?</a><br><br>Experts say he lacks power to do so.

  "<p>Writer-director Tayarisha Poe has wryly described her debut feature (which played to enthusiastic responses at Sundance last year) as \u201c<em>Clueless </em>meets <em>The Godfather\u201d</em>. Set amid the five warring factions of an elite east coast US boarding school, it\u2019s a woozy, hallucinogenic drama that reimagines the landscape of high school as a a daytime-noir terrain of crime and punishment, tangentially reminiscent of the life-and-death struggles of Rian Johnson\u2019s arresting 2005 debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/14/philipfrench\">Brick</a></em>. Picked up by Amazon, which swiftly started developing a spin-off TV project, <em>Selah and the Spades</em> is an audacious calling card for Poe, marking her down as a major talent to watch.</p> <p>Lovie Simone exudes a brooding sense of purpose as Selah Summers, leader of the titular pack who run Haldwell school\u2019s thriving supply of illicit substances. It\u2019s the spring term of her senior year, and Selah, who will soon be leaving Haldwell, is looking for someone to whom she can pass the baton of power, to \u201censure her legacy\u201d. She thinks she\u2019s found the perfect candidate in upcoming shutterbug Paloma (Celeste O\u2019Connor), whom Selah imagines that she can \u201cteach\u201d, or mould in her own image (inevitable shades of Jane Austen\u2019s endlessly reinterpretable <em>Emma</em>). But tensions are rising between Selah and her right-hand man Maxxie (<em>Moonlight</em>\u2019s<em> </em>Jharrel Jerome), threatening the stability of her empire, and revealing cracks in Selah\u2019s otherwise ice-cool exterior.</p> <p>Beginning life as an online multimedia project in 2014, <em>Selah and the Spades</em> reportedly grew out of Poe\u2019s response to a period of disaffection while working in a digital tech lab. \u201cI wanted to tell a story about a girl who knew what she wanted,\u201d she told <em>Filmmaker</em> magazine in 2015, characterising her anti-heroine as \u201ca girl who runs a gang and is totally OK with doing whatever she needs to do to make that gang successful\u201d.</p> <p>Yet perfectionist Selah\u2019s confidence only extends as far as the boundaries of the insular school grounds. In a telling scene with her quietly scolding mother, we see that Selah (who has a dark secret in her past) can be just as scared as her contemporaries of what awaits her when this particular dream is over. \u201cIt will put you in your place,\u201d her mother tells her, \u201cit will keep you safe from yourself\u201d, adding curtly that \u201csomething has to\u201d. But Selah doesn\u2019t need reminding that what she has is transient, and that her queen bee, straight-A status may not be sustainable for long. All the more reason to live it to the full while it lasts\u2026</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nK6WFgdchM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-nK6WFgdchM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nK6WFgdchM\">Watch a trailer for Selah and the Spades.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/07/oreo-fran-ross-novel-marlon-james\">Fran Ross\u2019s 1974 novel </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/07/oreo-fran-ross-novel-marlon-james\">Oreo</a></em> and Geoffrey Fletcher\u2019s 2011 film <em>Violet &amp; Daisy</em><em> </em>as influences, Poe has created something that is simultaneously familiar and surprising \u2013 combining the hazy nature of teenage years with the more brutal power struggles of adult life, thrown together in a larger-than-life environment that is utterly artificial but still grounded in down-to-earth reality. At times, I was reminded of the rebellious spirit of C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/girlhood-gritty-teen-life-review-mark-kermode\">Girlhood</a> (Bande des f</em><em>illes)</em>, a vivid coming-of-age story that viewed its rites of passage through the prism of a Parisian girl gang. But this is altogether more surreal, a quality emphasised by Jomo Fray\u2019s richly saturated cinematography, which floats ethereally down confined corridors, up candlelit staircases, and through idyllic woodland retreats, drenching the screen in verdant hues that contrast sharply with the satirical bite of the action.</p> <p>There\u2019s an equally expressionist edge to the soundtrack, which jumbles hard-cut jukebox selections with almost sci-fi-inflected tonal mood-scapes, weaving in and out of the dialogue. At times, composer Aska Matsumiya\u2019s beautifully off-kilter cues reminded me of Jon Brion\u2019s disorienting work on Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,891865,00.html\">Punch-Drunk Love</a></em>, the layered sound-design lending an air of tension to even the most apparently innocuous scenes.</p> <p>As with many first features, there are some shortcomings. At times, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the contrivances of the script and the stiltedness of some of the performances are archly deliberate or accidental, a quality that can break the spell of the movie\u2019s trancey atmosphere. During these moments, it\u2019s tempting to view <em>Selah and the Spades</em> as a triumph of style over substance, richer in visual promise than thematic rewards.</p> <p>Yet there\u2019s also something thrilling about Poe\u2019s refusal to smooth the odd and potentially alienating edges off this very personal (and ultimately empowering) drama, suggesting a strength of creative purpose that will doubtless pay great dividends. She has a voice that is clearly her own, and a future that looks bright indeed.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video/b?node=2676882011\">Available on Amazon Prime Video</a></p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

Here's how to do it | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clemence Gossett, the founder and co-owner of <a href=\"https://thegourmandiseschool.com/who-we-are/instructors/clemence-gossett/\">The Gourmandise School</a> in Santa Monica, California, says she was initially surprised by the turn to bread \u2013 she initially thought that people prefer making cakes and cookies. But she surmises that people have been attracted to bread baking not just because of its practicality as a grocery staple, but because of its meditative qualities during challenging times.</p> <p>Rolling, kneading and mixing all have a calming quality, forcing you to be in the moment and not stuck mentally in the future or past. That may help bakers manage the uncertain emotions. \u201cI think that there is this desire for people to express themselves and it\u2019s really hard to do that when you can\u2019t communicate and have this back and forth with others,\u201d says Gossett. \u201cWe have lost that in a way. There\u2019s this wonderful tangibility with baking and lets you work out emotions and express yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02748698ebc33ec7983aaaa30b432e1c4595d9fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02748698ebc33ec7983aaaa30b432e1c4595d9fd/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queries about bread and yeast have surged on Google.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queries about bread and yeast have surged on Google.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some studies show that baking is connected to positive feelings. Psychologists have started exploring cooking and baking as a therapeutic tool to help people dealing with things like depression and anxiety, and a 2016 study, published in the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2016.1257049\">Journal of Positive Psychology</a>, suggests that people who frequently take a turn at small, creative projects report feeling more relaxed and happier.</p> <p>That makes sense to Gossett \u2013 her cooking school offers a class that combines <a href=\"https://thegourmandiseschool.com/pietherapy/\">therapy and pie-baking</a>. The class creates a space for people to work on anxiety, particularly perfectionism, using the simple, delicious experience of learning how to make pies.</p> <p>Ken Forkish, the owner of Ken\u2019s Artisan Bakery in Portland, Oregon, and author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X\">Flour Water Salt Yeast</a>, says that people are also looking to make their own bread at home because trips to the grocery store have become riddled with stress.<em> </em>\u201cPeople want to have fresh bread while avoiding the grocery store as much as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got time on your hands, and maybe you have wanted to learn to bake bread and now you have the time to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Time is a necessary ingredient for bread, Forkish adds, and that extra time at home has prompted bakers to attempt things they may not have before \u2013 such as sourdough, which can take days to produce. Professional bakers are turning to social media to demystify the process, and amateur bakers are posting their homemade experiments. The bakers at Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, which helped kickstart the global sourdough craze, have posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B--Ih4ghyry/\">instructional videos on making sourdough starter and their signature sourdough loaves </a>which have been viewed tens of thousands of times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-5MBczBu10/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The school also has a hotline and email address where people can reach out; she said the response has been overwhelming \u2013 running the hotline has become a full-time job, answering questions about which ingredients can be substituted or what meals to make with a random assortment of food in the fridge and pantry. Gossett is even doing FaceTime calls to coach people through their baking challenges.</p> <p>Gossett thinks the pandemic has prompted a shift in how people view baking as a part of their days.<strong> </strong>\u201cInstead of asking: how can I make this fit in my schedule, it\u2019s more about how can I make myself available to learn this new process.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 1995, the lead singer of the 1980s band A-ha and the head of the Norwegian environmental group Bellona climbed improbably into a converted electric Fiat Panda they had imported from Switzerland and set off on a road trip.</p> <p>They drove around Oslo <a href=\"https://bellona.org/news/transport/electric-vehicles/2018-01-a-small-spark-from-bellona-fuels-norways-eco-friendly-car-explosion\">refusing to pay</a> the city\u2019s sky-high road tolls, parking illegally wherever they could, and ignoring every penalty notice they were given. Eventually, the authorities impounded their car and auctioned it off to cover the fines.</p> <p>But the stunt attracted massive media attention, and the point was made. Soon after, electric vehicles were exempted from road tolls, one of a large raft of incentives that have, over the years, helped make Norway the country with the world\u2019s highest per capita electric vehicle ownership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\" data-alt=\"covering climate now series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\">covering climate now series linker</a> </figure>  <p>Last month, in an economy hit by the coronavirus crisis, fully electric cars accounted for just under 60% of Norway\u2019s new car market, and plug-in hybrids just over 15% \u2013 meaning three in four of all new cars sold were either wholly or partly electric.</p> <p>It still has some way to go, but the country looks on course to meet a government target \u2013 set in 2016, with full cross-party parliamentary support \u2013 of phasing out the sale of all new fossil-fuel based cars and light commercial vehicles by 2025.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite amazing how fast the mindset\u2019s changed,\u201d said Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Electric Vehicle Association. \u201cEven in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric.\u201d</p> <p>The story of how and why that has happened has a straightforward, if unexpected logic. First, despite being a major oil and gas producer, almost all of Norway\u2019s domestic energy comes from a single, and renewable, source: hydropower.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric</p> <footer> <cite>Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Association</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That means switching to EVs is a much greener option for Norway than for countries whose power is generated mostly by coal plants \u2013 and that if it wants to significantly reduce its emission levels, it has little choice but to green its transport sector.</p> <p>Driven by the environmental imperative, the government began offering incentives to buy and run electric cars as far back as 1990, first by introducing a temporary exemption from Norway\u2019s exorbitant vehicle purchase tax, which became permanent six years later.</p> <p>\u201cThis was an important step,\u201d Bu said. \u201cNorway was a very poor country before we discovered oil; cars were a luxury item. They\u2019ve always been taxed very highly. Cars in Norway are a lot more expensive than elsewhere. Without the purchase tax, the cost of an electric car basically fell to that of an ordinary car.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, electric car drivers have been given the right to park for free in some municipal car parks, drive in bus lanes, take ferries without a ticket and, thanks to A-ha, drive toll-free. They are not required to pay VAT on their cars, or road tax, and company electric cars are taxed at a lower rate than petrol or diesel vehicles.</p> <p>Some measures have changed over the years: to be allowed to drive in a bus lane, for example, you now need to be carrying a passenger. A so-called 50% rule was introduced in 2017, allowing local authorities to charge EV drivers up to 50% of the parking fees, road tolls and ferry rates applicable to fossil-fuel vehicles.</p> <p>But overall, said Bu, the \u201ccombination of a big one-off saving when you buy the car, plus the substantially lower costs \u2013 fuel, tolls, parking, maintenance \u2013 of actually driving it, still adds up to a very powerful financial argument. Over its lifetime, you really save a lot of money with an electric car in Norway.\u201d</p> <p>That was certainly what persuaded Wenche Charlotte Egelund, 57, who bought a VW Golf Electric with her partner two years ago when they moved out of central Oslo. \u201cThe incentives were crucial,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tax and VAT exemptions, free municipal parking, free toll roads that mean we avoid the rush-hour traffic jams.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03bfd364c439953bf4889739db966984965a7a5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03bfd364c439953bf4889739db966984965a7a5a/0_0_4000_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EV charging stations at Kongens Gate near Akershus Festning in Oslo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EV charging stations at Kongens Gate near Akershus Festning in Oslo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, Egelund said, the incentives were so significant that she almost \u201cfelt the decision was imposed on me. Financially, it was like there was no other sensible option. I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Ritman, 56, a postwoman living on the outskirts of Fredrikstad, bought her Opel Ampera two years ago and said she has not regretted her choice, even if she was \u201cnot sure we would have gone electric without the incentives\u201d. The car\u2019s range was good, she said: 250 miles (400km) in summer, 200 miles (320km) in winter and because she charges at home she does not suffer from \u201clade-angst\u201d, or the fear of running out of juice.</p> <p>Both Ritman and Egelund have a second, diesel-powered car for extra-long journeys, to country cabins or holidays. Sten Br\u00e5then, 55, a media consultant, bought his Nissan Leaf as a second car \u201cfor taking the children around and driving to work. But there were so many advantages that when we were getting a new main car last year we didn\u2019t think twice about going electric.\u201d</p> <p>Government incentives were vital in the decision to buy, Br\u00e5then said: \u201cI think we would have managed without the other incentives \u2013 free toll roads and parking \u2013 but the actual cost of buying was so much lower than ordinary cars here in Norway.\u201d He warned, though, that Norway was going to need more charging stations.</p> <p>Despite the incentives, EV sales in Norway remained low until about 2010, when a number of smaller, more affordable electric cars from makers such as Mitsubishi and Nissan came to market, and improved technology meant larger electric cars began to offer both the space and range to make them a sensible choice for families.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?</p> <footer> <cite>Wenche Charlotte Egelund, car buyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bu said the incentives were so significant that \u201cmany people say they\u2019ve bought the most expensive car they\u2019ve ever had when they buy electric \u2013 Teslas, Jaguars, that kind of model \u2013 simply because they\u2019ve calculated what kind of saving they\u2019re going to be making over the coming years, and feel it makes sense\u201d.</p> <p>That has led to accusations that Norway\u2019s encouragement of electric vehicles amounts to little more than tax cuts for the rich, or a cut-price second car. Many Norwegians on lower incomes can only dream of owning an electric car, and three out of four car purchases are on the secondhand market.</p> <p>Bu \u2013 whose organisation represents consumers rather than producers \u2013 rejected this, arguing that \u201cwe have to change the cars we drive, and the only way to do that is to change the new cars. We can\u2019t change used ones\u201d. EVs will soon make up 10% of Norway\u2019s passenger fleet, she said, and are slowly coming on to the used market.</p> <p>She said she was confident for the future of electric vehicles, even in countries without a big renewable power sector, and studies show that EVs running on power generated from fossil fuel are responsible for roughly the same level of overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as petrol cars.</p> <p>\u201cAs a society, we clearly have to do two things,\u201d she said. \u201cProduce more renewable energy and products \u2013 like cars \u2013 that can run on it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do both, as fast as possible. We can\u2019t hang around until we\u2019re producing 100% renewable energy.\u201d</p> <p>Electric cars are \u201cnever going to be truly environmentally friendly\u201d, Bu said. \u201cThe main problem is making the batteries. We need clean battery producers in Europe. But look, we need transport. We need cars and vans, particularly outside our cities. And for us, electric is the answer.\u201d</p> <p><em>This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

  "<p>When will we have a Covid-19 vaccine? Public-facing scientists such as the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and his US counterpart, Anthony Fauci, keep repeating that it won\u2019t be before 12 to 18 months. But other voices \u2013 including some of those in the race to create a vaccine themselves \u2013 have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">suggested</a> that it could be as early as June. Who is right?</p> <p>The former, probably, but it\u2019s complicated because this pandemic is forcing change at almost every step in the process by which a new vaccine arrives at a needle near us.</p> <p>\u201cIt really depends on what you mean by \u2018having a vaccine\u2019,\u201d says Marian Wentworth, president and CEO of Management Sciences for Health, a Massachusetts-based global not-for-profit organisation that seeks to build resilient health systems, and a long-time observer of vaccine development. \u201cIf you mean one that can be used in a mass vaccination campaign, allowing us all to get on with our lives, then 12 to 18 months is probably right.\u201d</p> <p>But in terms of an experimental vaccine that is deemed safe and effective enough to be rolled out in a more limited way \u2013 to high-risk groups such as health workers, say \u2013 that could be ready within weeks or months, under emergency rules developed by drug regulatory agencies and the World Health Organization in the context of the recent Ebola epidemics in Africa.</p> <p>When the University of Oxford\u2019s Adrian Hill<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\"> told the Guardian</a> that his group\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine candidate could be ready by the summer, it was this kind of readiness to which he was probably referring. The group, led by Sarah Gilbert, has since <a href=\"https://covid19vaccinetrial.co.uk/blog-how-long-will-it-take-get-oxford-vaccine-deployment\">stated</a> that a vaccine shown to be effective in phase-3 clinical trials that could be manufactured in large quantities won\u2019t be ready before the autumn even in a best-case scenario. And that scenario is \u201chighly ambitious and subject to change\u201d.</p> <p>Normally, a vaccine is developed in the lab before being tested on animals. If it proves safe and generates a promising immune response in this pre-clinical phase, it enters human or clinical trials. These are divided into three phases, each of which takes longer and involves more people than the previous one. Phase 1 establishes the vaccine\u2019s safety in a small group of healthy individuals, with the goal of ruling out debilitating side effects. Phases 2 and 3 test efficacy, and in an outbreak like the present one they are conducted in places where the disease is prevalent. In parallel with these later phases, production capacity for the candidate vaccine is gradually built up, so that factories are capable of producing it on a large scale if and when regulatory agencies judge that it should be licensed.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005630\">article</a> published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> on 30 March, representatives of the Oslo-based not-for-profit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is helping to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development, laid out an accelerated version of this process that they believe is more suited to a pandemic. This \u201cpandemic paradigm\u201d implements certain steps in parallel, such as animal and phase-1 clinical testing. It also involves scaling up production capacity before sufficient safety and efficacy data are available \u2013 a financially risky step, given that that may never materialise, and one that requires governments and not-for-profit organisations such as Cepi to share that extra financial risk with pharmaceutical companies if they want them to engage. Mass production is critical in a pandemic, when hundreds of millions if not billions of doses are needed \u2013 and many countries are now scrambling to build new vaccine production facilities.</p> <p>\u201cPeople now appreciate that the lengthy process of conventional licensing of vaccines is not going to be helpful in the context of an epidemic,\u201d says Beate Kampmann, who heads the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bringing a new vaccine to the clinic has taken 10 to 20 years in the past</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Prudently, Cepi did not attach a timeline to its accelerated paradigm, but the 12- to 18-month estimate already takes it into account. Bringing a new vaccine to the clinic has taken 10 to 20 years in the past. Nevertheless, the accelerated paradigm is being implemented now. A Boston-based biotech firm, Moderna, saw its experimental Covid-19 vaccine enter human trials on 16 March, just 10 weeks after the first genetic sequences of Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 the virus that causes the disease \u2013 were released. Others will follow <a href=\"https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_vaccine_landscape/\">soon</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting to candidates much more quickly,\u201d says Kampmann, who puts this progress down to advances made in the fight against Ebola. \u201cThe step-up in technology that we have seen in the last five years has really made a difference.\u201d</p> <p>There are many hurdles ahead, though. Most of the 70-odd Covid-19 vaccine candidates being developed and tested will not make it to the licensing stage, and those that have been fastest out of the blocks may still encounter problems later on. Moderna\u2019s innovative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">technology</a> allowed it to generate a candidate quickly, but no vaccine using this platform has been licensed to date.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9741e09a887584858d36770cabd33729c1067055\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9741e09a887584858d36770cabd33729c1067055/0_139_4182_2509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of the logo at Pasteur Institute in Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris are working on a vaccine that piggybacks on a licensed measles vaccine, speeding up the testing, licensing and production process.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Mori/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Pasteur Institute in Paris, on the other hand, a Covid-19 vaccine candidate is still in pre-clinical development, but because it piggybacks on established technology \u2013 a licensed measles vaccine \u2013 the testing and licensing processes will go faster. And this kind of vaccine can already be produced in large quantities.</p> <p>While there can be no shortcuts to establishing safety and efficacy, proposals have been put forward for how these experimental vaccines might be tested more rapidly without sacrificing scientific rigour. In February, for example, the WHO published a draft <a href=\"https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/COVID-19-vaccine-trial-synposis.pdf?ua=1\">protocol</a> for phase 2 and 3 trials that would test a number of candidates simultaneously, in multi-country trials according to standardised criteria.</p> <p>Another proposal is to conduct controlled human challenge trials, in which healthy volunteers are given a candidate vaccine and then infected with Sars-CoV-2. These are ethically questionable, especially before scientists understand why young and otherwise healthy people are ending up on ventilators. A similar approach, being implemented by the London-based clinical research group Hvivo, invites volunteers to be infected with a milder coronavirus \u2013 but how applicable its findings will be to Sars-CoV-2 is not clear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If our own body can\u2019t prevent us from getting it again, that would be one pretty damning signal</p> <footer> <cite>Marian Wentworth, health CEO</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are still many unknowns with respect to Covid-19, including for how long any vaccine will provide protection. A strong indication of this will be whether people who have recovered from the disease can catch it again. There have been anecdotal reports of re-infection, but the phenomenon is not well understood. \u201cIf our own body can\u2019t prevent us from getting it again, that would be one pretty damning signal,\u201d says Wentworth.</p> <p>Once a vaccine is licensed, there will still be political obstacles to getting it to where it\u2019s needed, because each country or public health jurisdiction has to make its own decision to roll it out. There will also be issues of prioritisation \u2013 who should get it first, if supplies are limited \u2013 which authorities are discussing now.</p> <p>A vaccine that is approved a year from now may arrive after the end of the current pandemic, but if so it won\u2019t be wasted \u2013 first because Covid-19 may recur seasonally, and second because the vaccine could itself be repurposed in the event of an outbreak of a different coronavirus. That will be no consolation to victims of this pandemic, or their relatives, but it does mean that humanity will be better protected in future. As Wentworth says: \u201cThat learning, we won\u2019t unlearn.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation as best as possible.

As supporters, what we want to see from them is the club being run in a sustainable, transparent and ambitious manner.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Michael McGowan bringing you the main stories on Sunday 19 April.</p> \n<h2>Australia records two new Covid-19 deaths</h2> \n<p>The national death toll has risen to 71, after a 94-year-old<strong> </strong>New South Wales man who was a resident at the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney, died. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. There are now 39 cases from the facility, including 13 staff. A man in his 80s from Victoria also died overnight.</p> \n<h2>Government calls for global investigation</h2> \n<p>The foreign affairs minister, <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, has called for an independent international investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the World Health Organisation should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Payne, who was interviewed on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning, was also reluctant to answer questions about whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China in terms of its response to the virus.</p> \n<h2>Elective surgery and IVF could resume within days</h2> \n<p>The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in personal protective equipment equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. Hunt also took a swipe at the World Health Organisation, saying its response to the crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t help the world\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Some Sydney eastern suburbs beaches to open</h2> \n<p>Beaches in some parts of the Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will reopen from Monday. Randwick mayor Danny Said announced that Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra beaches would reopen for exercise only. That means jogging on the sand, walking, swimming, surfing and other exercise activities will now be permitted. But ocean pools in Randwick council area will remain closed until further notice as they are subject to a public health order to close. Beaches in the neighbouring Waverley council area \u2013 Bondi, Tamarama and Bronte \u2013 remain closed for now. On Saturday Waverley mayor Paula Masselos said the area remained \u201ca hotspot for coronavirus cases and we have no intention of reopening our beaches at this time\u201d.</p> \n<h2>$5,000 fines for spitting</h2> \n<p>The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Lives saved in NSW</h2> \n<p>Brad Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.</p> \n<h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<h2>Drake\u2019s forgotten away defeat</h2> <p>You will have heard of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Armada\">Spanish Armada</a> of 1588, in which King Philip II\u2019s boys took one hell of a beating. Up to 60 ships sunk, 15,000 lives lost, a famous speech by Elizabeth I. But you may not have heard of the return fixture, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Armada\">English Armada</a>, 1589, a disastrous attack on Spain in which Francis Drake\u2019s fleet lost 40 ships and 10,000 to 15,000 lives.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t, despite an A-level in history and what I thought was a reasonable level of curiosity about the subject, until stumbling upon it down an internet wormhole \u2013 somewhere between a fascinating feature on <a href=\"https://www.spomenikdatabase.org/post/17-examples-of-the-stunning-architectural-modernism-of-yugoslav-department-stores\">1970s Yugoslav supermarkets</a> and searches into lesser known explorations of the Northwest Passage \u2013 during what passes for work in an arts journalist\u2019s lockdown.</p> <p>The point is how lopsided the apparently objective teaching of history can be and how hazardous the exceptionalism that can result. See, for example, the <em><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/03/06/firmly-calmly-uk-leading-europe-fight-against-coronavirus/\">Daily Telegraph</a></em><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/03/06/firmly-calmly-uk-leading-europe-fight-against-coronavirus/\">\u2019s claim</a> early last month that \u201cthe UK is empirically the most capable country in Europe at dealing with an epidemic\u201d. I hope for, but don\u2019t expect, some sober introspection from the conservative press when all this is over.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Science saves, superstition destroys</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b2e3e42e449ef3c1c5423364c0c2f767dbeaf8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b2e3e42e449ef3c1c5423364c0c2f767dbeaf8e/940_259_3878_2327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Notre Dame under restoration a year after the fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Notre Dame under restoration a year after the fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romuald Meigneux/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A year ago last Wednesday, back in the days when catastrophes were horrific but not global, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/apr/15/huge-fire-sweeps-through-notre-dame-cathedral-in-pictures\">cathedral of Notre Dame</a> caught fire. BBC4 has produced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hbdq\">a moving documentary</a> about its rescue in which an amazing array of new technologies and old crafts is brought to bear. Microscopic study of plankton fossils tells them from which layer of which quarry the cathedral\u2019s stones came; chopping trees by hand, medieval style, makes it possible to match the lost roof timbers. There are parallels with the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 scientists in laboratories, building workers wearing full PPE against lead dust from the old roof, the personal courage of the emergency services and professionals at the time of the disaster. Perhaps most impressive is the sight of true expertise wielded with calm commitment, which is what we have to wish for now.</p> <p>Calm expertise, of course, is not evident in the idea that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1eeedb71-d9dc-4b13-9b45-fcb7898ae9e1\">5G phone masts</a> spread the virus. This doesn\u2019t seem to be much of an advance, civilisation wise, on the stoning of dachshunds in the First World War for being too German or the strapping of live chickens to people\u2019s buboes as a cure for <a href=\"http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/publichealth/blackdeath\">the Black Death</a>. </p> <p>Perhaps what lies behind these beliefs is a desperation for agency \u2013 it is too unbearable to be powerless and ignorant in the face of disaster, so you attach yourself to a thought or action you can call your own. The very strangeness of a theory, together with the fact that others dismiss it, is proof of its unique magic.

As I write in today\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/19/is-the-cruise-industry-finally-out-of-its-depth\">New Review</a></em>, Carnival is the world\u2019s largest owner of cruise ships and has a colourful history of pollution and health issues.

  "<p>Europe\u2019s leaders are worried \u2013 and rightly so. The deadly impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a> has resulted in a full-scale health crisis. Evidence of the economic consequences of trying to keep populations safe from coronavirus is starting to emerge. The political ramifications are only starting to be assessed \u2013 but they could be profound.</p> <p>The European Union has found itself in some tight spots over the years, but always found a way of muddling through. It survived the financial crisis and will cope with Brexit. But this time things are a lot more serious.</p> <p>It is not just that Europe is going to suffer a lot of economic pain as a result of the pandemic \u2013 although the falls in output being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\" title=\"\">pencilled in for this year</a> by the International Monetary Fund would make it the deepest slump since the integration process began in the 1950s.</p> <p>Nor is it simply that the virus will hit the weakest hardest \u2013 although that is also the case. The IMF expects the Italian economy to shrink by more than <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020\" title=\"\">9% this year</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/FM/Issues/2020/04/06/fiscal-monitor-april-2020\" title=\"\">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> to rise by 20 percentage points to 156%. Those estimates look somewhat optimistic, and there is a real possibility that Italy\u2019s debt will eventually become unsustainable, even with the assistance of the European Central Bank.</p> <p>No, the problem is that the EU failed to act collectively at the moment when countries such as Italy badly needed a display of togetherness. Throughout, there has been a lack of co-ordination: countries imposed their own restrictions, imposed their own border controls, and banned the export of much-needed medical supplies. Italy received speedier help from China than from its EU partners, and, not surprisingly, that has left a sour taste. Opposition to the EU in Italy has never been higher.</p> <p>There was a way the rest of Europe could have shown Italy some love. Backed by France, Spain and seven other eurozone members, Italy proposed that the EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">issue \u201ccoronabonds\u201d</a>: debt instruments that would allow all single-currency-using nations to borrow collectively. Effectively, there would be a pooling of risk between those who enjoy strong credit ratings \u2013 such as Germany and the Netherlands \u2013 and those with poor credit ratings \u2013 such as Italy.</p> <p>Sadly, the Germans and the Dutch have consistently opposed the idea of debt mutualisation, despite the parlous state of Italy\u2019s public finances and its combustible politics. And one big difference between this and previous crises is that populist parties are now much more powerful and there is a real possibility of Matteo Salvini surfing a wave of Euroscepticism and coming to power in Italy.</p> <p>Some European politicians get it. Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d19dc7a6-c33b-4931-9a7e-4a74674da29a\" title=\"\">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a> last week that the EU had \u201cno choice\u201d but to issue common debt with a common guarantee. The alternative, the French president added, was the collapse of the EU as a political project. It is not often that Brussels apologises for anything, but Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, has sent a heartfelt apology to Italy on the EU\u2019s behalf for letting the country down.</p> <p>This is crunch time for the EU. In the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt used the federal budget to deliver help under the New Deal to the parts of the US suffering most from the Great Depression.</p> <p>The EU currently lacks the ability to act like FDR did. It has only a tiny budget, no single finance minister and no way of issuing collective debt. These are the toughest times for Europe since the 1930s. It has to decide whether it is going to press ahead with integration or revert to a loose collection of nation states.</p> <h2>After lockdown, will people want to fly again?</h2> <p>The coronavirus lockdown has underlined the fragility of aviation \u2013 and its importance. Heathrow has abandoned not just its planned third runway, but one of its existing pair \u2013 yet brings in essential medical supplies that the UK cannot provide for itself. At deserted Stansted, flights full of Romanian workers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/romanian-fruit-pickers-flown-uk-crisis-farming-sector-coronavirus\" title=\"\">arrive to harvest the fruit that Britain cannot pick for itself</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association has updated, by another string of dizzying zeroes, the amount of revenues \u2013 now \u00a3251bn \u2013 that airlines will forgo in 2020. Bankruptcies are all but inevitable for the smaller players.</p> <p>However, the big two budget European carriers, easyJet and Ryanair, still see a future ahead \u2013 albeit with contrasting conclusions. Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary, having predicted that coronavirus would be forgotten by Easter, has not proved himself quite the prophet of late. Nevertheless, he foresees the return of pre-crisis levels of air travel, with fares slashed to fuel a rush. </p> <p>His counterpart at easyJet, Johan Lundgren, is more pessimistic and talks of social distancing on half-empty planes, and a slow return to growth. Nevertheless, both are believers in there being pent-up demand for air travel.</p> <p>That may exist: although for most Britons, having had three more weeks of lockdown confirmed, even a trip to the pub or a neighbour\u2019s house would be an adventure right now. Ryanair has the cash to start a fare war and survive, but its bullishness should be tempered by the recollection that it was first of all public fear, not government restrictions, that made demand evaporate.</p> <p>Even if lockdowns are eased radically by the summer, will the airlines\u2019 customers really be financially and mentally ready to jet off for a week in the sun? Investors \u2013 never mind any ministers tempted to stake taxpayer money on eventual bailouts \u2013 should surely think twice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7564b59de7c6590aee2b0ec7007a9e6bb932fd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7564b59de7c6590aee2b0ec7007a9e6bb932fd5/0_116_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lockdown seems to have averted a nasty crunch for streaming service Netflix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lockdown seems to have averted a nasty crunch for streaming service Netflix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Pandemic changes the entertainment game for Netflix<br></h2> <p>The last decade has already spawned a new corporate world order, with the technology giants at its head.

Yet its stock price had gone into reverse even before the coronavirus crisis took hold. Amid a slump in the oil market, shares are back at levels not seen since 2004. Oil companies will hang around for a while yet (for too long, in all likelihood), but there is an air of the <em>ancien regime</em> hanging around even majors such as Exxon.</p> <p>The increase in Netflix\u2019s market cap has been truly worthy of a disruptor \u2013 from about $9bn at the start of 2013 to nearly $150bn at the start of 2020.</p> <p>Yet it too had been looking squeezed in recent months. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/01/disney-plus-coming-soon-to-uk-galaxy-netflix-challenge\" title=\"\">Disney+ and Apple TV+ entering the streaming market, along with Amazon Prime continuing to grow,</a> the battle for paying subscribers was entering a tougher phase. That left Netflix looking overextended as it tried to build up its own library of original content with $26.4bn in liabilities on its balance sheet.</p> <p>The pandemic has changed the game \u2013 and appears to have deferred a crunch, possibly forever. Lockdowns have delivered Netflix a captive audience on a global scale, boosting its share price by almost a third during 2020. As a consequence, big <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116858/adam-sandler-netflix-deal-four-movies-murder-mystery-most-viewed-2019\" title=\"\">spending on Adam Sandler films</a> suddenly seems less of a risk (although sceptics remain \u2013 3.6% of Netflix\u2019s shares are still being borrowed for short selling, in a bet on prices falling).</p> <p>The revenue boost from all those new users will be welcomed \u2013 and may even help the company eat into its debt pile. But it seems clear that investors are betting the crisis has already ushered in a new age for entertainment consumption.</p>",
  "<p>Doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients face shortages of protective full-length gowns for weeks to come, it has emerged, as anger builds over the failure to stockpile the garments.</p> <p>Critical shortages of the gowns have meant that some trusts have already had to make do with the best available alternatives as a result of the shortages, which forced a sudden change in Public Health England (PHE) guidelines on the use of gowns on Friday. Concerns are being raised within the NHS over why the gowns did not form part of the government\u2019s pandemic stockpile.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">NHS staff told 'wear aprons' as protective gowns run out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is understood shortages are already forcing some NHS workers to use the controversial new guidelines, which tell them to wear a plastic apron with coveralls should the specialist fluid-repellent gowns run out. Workers are also advised to reuse washed aprons.</p> <p>Meanwhile, surgeons are being told by senior colleagues not to put themselves at risk should they be unable to wear a protective gown. Professor Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should not risk their health if fluid-repellent gowns or coveralls could not be used. \u201cWe are deeply disturbed by this latest change to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance, which was issued without consulting expert medical bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter weeks of working with PHE and our sister medical royal colleges to get PPE guidance right, this risks confusion and variation in practice across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Health unions warned that staff could begin to refuse to work if they felt the new guidelines put them at serious risk of contracting the coronavirus. Sara Gorton, Unison\u2019s head of health, said: \u201cManagers must be truly honest with health workers and their union reps over the weekend. If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it\u2019s no longer safe for them to work.\u201d</p> <p>Last night, the British Medical Association (BMA) also warned that it would support doctors who refused to work with inadequate PPE.</p> <p>\u201cThere are limits to the level of risk staff can be expected to expose themselves and their patients to,\u201d said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair. \u201cIn the most extreme circumstances, if adequate protective measures are not in place, doctors can refuse to put themselves at risk of becoming infected, and inform their management to make alternative arrangements, and the BMA will robustly support its members who have to make this weighty decision.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4eb95035b814215728d6879bf76805c401bd59d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb95035b814215728d6879bf76805c401bd59d5/0_0_1959_1625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GMB union says trust in Matt Hancock is \u2018draining away\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents various service providers within the NHS, said: \u201cOnce the weekend is over, you still have the same problem.

  "<p>Covid-19 has changed how we interact as a society. But it is harder to know what the repercussions will be for international trade. The prospectus for Brexit was based, in part, on the trading opportunities waiting to be seized by \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. How does Covid-19 change the balance of risks and opportunities that face us?</p> <p>The impact of the pandemic on international trade is likely to outlive the health crisis. According to the World Trade Organization, world trade may fall by 32% this year. To put this into context, trade fell 40% in the first three years of the 1930s Great Depression. This time, the fall in trade is self-induced, to save lives. But the contagiousness of Covid-19 exposes vulnerabilities in the trading system.</p> <p>Economies, like societies, are complex networks of direct and indirect relationships. We may be fairly confident in the health of our immediate trading partners, but as important is the health of the partners they trade with. Covid-19 causes deep problems. Supply chains locate production across the world to maximise efficiency. Unsurprisingly, the WTO expects trade to fall more in sectors with complex value chains.</p> <p>Equally, the movement of people is fundamental to how we trade services. We have to set up a shop, attract students or locate management. Eight out of 10 UK jobs are in the services sector. Services account for about half our total trade. Yet travel restrictions now apply in 150 countries. They are likely to be lifted slowly, as some nations control the pandemic more quickly than others. Early signs are not encouraging. JP Morgan\u2019s global purchasing managers index shows the fall in services export orders much greater than for manufactured goods.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The contagiousness of Covid-19 exposes vulnerabilities in the trading system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our ability to specialise creates the gains from trade, but it has also created a vulnerability. The WTO rules permit temporary export prohibitions to relieve critical shortages. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/trade-symptoms-pandemic\">40 nations</a> have introduced export restrictions on medical equipment. Trade specialist Simon Evenett calls these <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SimonEvenett/status/1246793589050540033\">sicken-thy-neighbour</a> policies. What will this do for trust and reciprocation after the heath crisis has passed?</p> <p>The impact of the pandemic on global trade, in other words, might well be longer term. Beata Javorcik, the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has pointed out that resilience will in future be a key concern for businesses, which might imply some degree of reshoring and potentially moving away from holding near-zero inventories so as to hedge against the possibility of future disruptions to supply chains. The chief executive of Bosch has expressed concern about the future of the company\u2019s supply chain.</p> <p>In times of economic hardship, the temptation to turn inwards and play the nationalism card has proved too tempting.</p> <p>Which brings us to Brexit. The transition period agreed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/sombre-eu-leaders-sign-brexit-withdrawal-agreement\">EU withdrawal agreement</a> and passed by parliament in January provides for frictionless access to the European market and its trading partners until 31 December. This is why leaving the EU has changed relatively little on the ground. The government has until 30 June to decide whether to request and pass legislation allowing an extension of the transition period by one or two years, or leave the single market and customs union by year end, with or without a trade deal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In times of economic hardship, the temptation to turn inwards and play the nationalism card has proved too tempting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some argue that the pandemic strengthens the case to end transition, to free us to sign new free trade agreements around the world in order to revive our recuperating economy. This requires us to rediscover our competitive spirit and reach a mutually favourable agreement with the US and the other nations that will follow.</p> <p>However, these arguments are unpersuasive. Essentially, they amount to sacrificing our existing trading relationship with the EU, accounting for about half our total trade, for hypothetical and problematic future deals with the US and others in very short order. Given the uncertainty about the future of world trade, this would be a risky moment to make trade with by far our biggest trading partner more difficult, while pinning our hopes on being able to increase trade with the rest of the world.</p> <p>The disruption caused by the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/brexit-uk-plan-to-secure-trade-deal-by-december-is-fantasy-says-eu\">makes it unlikely</a> that a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and EU can be secured before the transition period ends. Surely, under such circumstances, it makes sense to take advantage of the opportunity to extend afforded us by the withdrawal agreement? This certainly seems to be the view of the British public: twice as many think the prime minister should amend his 31 December deadline than do not. Of course, there is a political rationale for the government to fulfil its promise to deliver the end of transition on time. Yet, given what the pandemic has done \u2013 and may yet do - to the global economy, there\u2019s an equally strong, if not stronger, practical one for reconsidering.</p> <p>\u2022 Anand Menon is director of <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/\">The UK in a Changing Europe</a></p> <p>\u2022 Angus Armstrong is director of the <a href=\"https://www.rebuildingmacroeconomics.ac.uk/about-us\">Rebuilding Macroeconomics</a> network, NIESR</p>",
  "<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-52309654\">Dr Peter Tun died</a> from coronavirus at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading, where he had worked for more than 20 years. His son has reported that he had complained about personal protective equipment (PPE) being reallocated from the ward on which he worked and that at least four patients on that ward later tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cThe thought that if only he had a proper protective mask, he might still have been able to enjoy his hard-earned retirement after a lifetime of service just kills me,\u201d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelTun1/status/1250676186159681536?s=20\"> his son said</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>It should haunt us all. Tun is one of at least 55 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">people working in the NHS who have lost their lives</a> to Covid-19; the true number is likely to be higher, and the number that includes care home and homecare staff even greater still. Every day, medical staff report having to work without adequate protective equipment that would minimise the risk to other patients and to themselves and their families. And on Friday night, it became apparent that Public Health England guidance that stipulates the protective equipment doctors and nurses need to wear when treating patients with Covid-19 has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">watered down</a> in the face of national shortages. Staff are now being told to wear flimsy plastic aprons in place of full-length waterproof gowns when the latter run out, a situation many NHS trusts are expected to face this weekend.</p> <p>There are global shortages of PPE, most of which is sourced from countries such as China, where production has dramatically slowed as a result of the lockdown there. This means that ensuring an adequate supply would always have required finding ways to kickstart domestic production as well as coordinating with other countries to try to expand global production, rather than simply competing for scarce supplies on the open market. There is little evidence that this has been happening behind the scenes and there are few signs that lessons have been learned from other serious errors that the government has made in responding to this pandemic, from its hapless efforts to get extra ventilators manufactured to its slow-off-the-mark attempts to expand testing capacity.</p> <h2>Missed opportunities</h2> <p>Coronavirus is without doubt the biggest logistical challenge our government has faced in decades. No government would get everything right; making some mistakes in a highly pressured and uncertain environment is perhaps inevitable. But there is growing evidence that the British government has made unforced errors that have cost lives. And that, perhaps most critically, there is not much to suggest that ministers are learning from these mistakes in real time, in order to save lives in the future.</p> <p>There is much to comment on in terms of the lack of preparedness for a pandemic that was <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/expert-advice-government-pandemics\">predicted by experts </a>and rated as a high risk by the government. In particular, 10 years of underfunding have left the NHS and care services struggling to meet normal levels of demand, let alone with any excess capacity to help them cope with an extraordinary outbreak. We are today paying the price for this disregard of very real threats to our national wellbeing and the cutting back of core public services to the bone.</p> <p>We cannot turn the clock back now, but it is absolutely right to ask whether the government is learning from the mistakes it has made so far. There have been some real successes. The herculean expansion in critical care capacity that has taken place with the new NHS Nightingale hospitals has been extraordinary. The stay-at-home messaging has encouraged people to respect social distancing and has played a part in bringing down infection rates to the extent that much of that capacity has not yet had to be used.</p> <p>But there have also been serious, and avoidable, errors. Hindsight makes the decision to ignore World Health Organization advice to test and trace all coronavirus cases, and to delay the imposition of social distancing in the absence of testing and tracing, look even more ill judged than it did at the time. The call-out to the private sector for the production of extra ventilators was only made in mid-March. It has emerged that the government prioritised the production of ventilators built to new specifications rather than existing models and that these specifications were simply inadequate for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. In the meantime, existing British companies that supply and produce ventilators reported that they got in touch with government to offer their support, only to be ignored, while the government missed opportunities to take part in an EU procurement scheme. The <em>Financial Times</em> has reported that, of the two consortiums selected to produce ventilators according to new specifications, one has ended the project and the other has paused it.</p> <p>There have also been delays around building up testing capacity. And domestic textiles companies report that they have contacted government offering to produce personal protective equipment, but that, as with ventilators, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/16/government-ignores-uk-textiles-firms-desperate-to-make-ppe\">no one has been in touch</a>. It should have been clear from the start that insufficient global supplies would have always meant that the government would have to find a way of working with the private sector here to produce this lifesaving equipment and it is far less complex a product than ventilators. Why the delay? Why did ministers and officials not learn from their mistakes rather than repeatedly asserting there were no problems with supply in recent weeks?</p> <h2>Testing, testing, testing</h2> <p>These questions cannot be reserved for a post-hoc inquiry. Answering them in real time can help save lives today. In a month, will we hear from another son or daughter sharing their anguish that they will live forever with the knowledge that a parent\u2019s life might have been saved if only they had the right protective equipment?</p> <p>Moreover, improving the effectiveness of the government\u2019s response is key to the ability to safely relax some \u2013 though not all \u2013 aspects of social distancing. Mass production of a vaccine or of effective treatments that can reduce the mortality rate of the virus are, at the very least, months away. The experiences of places such as South Korea and Hong Kong, which have been able to take a more relaxed approach to social distancing while keeping infection rates lower, suggest that there are ways to ease the burden before then, without putting lives at risk.</p> <p>If that is possible, it is imperative to do so; the longer it goes on, the worse an impact this lockdown will have on people\u2019s physical, mental and economic wellbeing. But it will be entirely dependent on a huge expansion in the capacity to test and trace contacts in order to prevent any relaxation of social distancing creating another rise in infection and, ultimately, death rates.</p> <p>The government has pledged to increase testing capacity to 100,000 a day in less than two weeks\u2019 time. But its track record to date does not inspire confidence \u2013 it has missed previous targets and is testing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-covid-19-testing-expanded-to-police-fire-service-and-judiciary\">at fewer than 20,000 a day </a>currently. It has not been clear about its assumptions about what level of testing capacity would be sufficient to relax social distancing measures in the coming weeks.</p> <p>On contact tracing, the experience of countries that have done this successfully, such as Singapore, suggest that apps are insufficient alone; they can only be used to support teams of contact tracers and effective plans to get people who are at risk of exposure to observe a strict quarantine, including from others in their household. Yet it would appear that the government has placed far too much emphasis on technology-based solutions, which are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/16/nhs-in-standoff-with-apple-and-google-over-coronavirus-tracing\">already unravelling</a>, and not enough on building up teams of contact tracers, for example, from the thousands of environmental health officers who already work for local authorities.</p> <p>The government is evading scrutiny for the plans and processes it must get in place now to enable a relaxation of social distancing later on, by claiming it would be inappropriate to talk publicly about an exit strategy in case it undermines the stay-at-home message. This comes across as obfuscation, particularly given the fact that ministers and advisers have seen fit to brief anonymously to the press that the public has been too obedient, and speculation about a relaxation of social distancing being imminent, which is far more undermining of the public health message.</p> <h2>Jeopardising the most vulnerable</h2> <p>Another serious problem with the way the government is handling this crisis is with respect to inequality. Care homes and homecare services have become the forgotten frontline; despite the fact that care workers are looking after those whose lives are most at risk from this virus, they are working with far less protection and guidance than the NHS. The situation makes a mockery of the concept of shielding the most vulnerable from the virus. In prisons, where people have long been locked up in conditions that are a risk to their basic safety, coronavirus is needlessly jeopardising lives, while a plan to release some prisoners early to try to improve conditions has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/uk-coronavirus-prison-plan-suspended-after-six-mistakenly-released\">suspended</a> after basic administrative errors. The same is true in the economy: some of the most precarious and at-risk workers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uber-driver-dies-from-covid-19-after-hiding-it-over-fear-of-eviction\">fallen through the cracks</a> of the government\u2019s schemes, dying in terrible conditions because they are scared of eviction.</p> <p>Last week, the campaign group Led by Donkeys projected on to the Palace of Westminster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByDonkeys/status/1251042037941653506\">footage of NHS workers</a> imploring the prime minister to address the shortages in personal protective equipment. \u201cThe NHS saved your life, now we need you to save ours\u201d was the heartfelt plea. No one doubts that ministers want to prevent doctors and nurses needlessly dying on their watch. But, set against a deadly virus that is claiming the lives of our loved ones, good intentions are just not enough.</p>",
