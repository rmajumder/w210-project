First, the bondholders, who are being asked to take equity in the airline instead of ever seeing their money repaid, and whose foot-dragging past deadlines on Friday suggested little appetite for playing along.</p> <p>Second, the aircraft lessors, who have in theory until Sunday night to decide whether to accept an even less alluring proposition. For these firms, who own the tangible, flying, metal-and-carbon-fibre assets instead of mere paper, the swap is not exactly tempting.

Here are some of the key issues, but this is not even close to being an exhaustive list.</p> <h2>Renewables are just as bad as fossil fuels?</h2> <p>Associate Prof Mark Diesendorf, an energy systems and sustainability expert at the University of New South Wales, tells Guardian Australia the film\u2019s commentary on renewable energy is \u201cout-of-date, superficial, simplistic, misleading and very biased\u201d.</p> <p>It criticises renewable energy \u2013 particularly solar and wind \u2013 in part because you need varying amounts of materials, energy and metals to make them.</p> <p>For anyone who has thought for more than a minute about what it takes to build <em>that</em> solar panel or <em>those </em>wind turbines, it should be no revelation that some materials and energy are needed. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.</p> <p>But the film leaves the viewer thinking there is no net gain from renewable technologies and does not, for example, look at any cradle-to-grave analysis of the technologies it criticises.</p> <p>\u201cThe myth that life-cycle energy invested [and carbon emissions] in building renewable energy technologies is comparable with the lifetime energy generation is false,\u201d says Diesendorf.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk11vI-7czE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zk11vI-7czE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Planet of the Humans </figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cSolar panels generate the energy required to build themselves in one to two years of operation, depending on the type of panel and location and their lifetime is about 20 years; large wind turbines in three to 12 months, depending on size of turbines and location, and their lifetime is 25 to 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>In the film Gibbs says: \u201cI learned that solar panels don\u2019t last forever either.\u201d You would think most people would know that.</p> <p>Early in the film, Gibbs walks with an environment group protesting a plan to put up 21 wind turbines at Lowell Mountain in Vermont, a row that played out in 2011 (another hint at the age of the film).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We wanted to ignite a discussion, and that\u2019s happened</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Moore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>An unnamed campaigner tells Gibbs the power grid needs to run idle when the wind drops and that this causes a \u201cbigger footprint\u201d than just running the grid off fossil fuels.</p> <p>Gibbs takes the speaker\u2019s word but Diesendorf says this is an old myth disproved by real world examples of power grids running with high penetrations of renewable energy \u2013 with and without storage such as batteries and hydro power.</p> <h2>Old ideas and old footage</h2> <p>The pace of change and development in the renewable energy industry is rapid so a film that wants to inform viewers should be as up-to-date as possible.</p> <p>But the film is riddled with footage, segments and issues that are a decade or so old.</p> <p>Gibbs attends the launch of the Chevy Volt, a car launched 10 years ago. He criticises it because it\u2019s recharged from a power grid in Michigan dominated by coal.</p> <p>Taking a very old example of an electric car operating in one place should not be the basis for forming a judgment about the role of electric cars in 2020, yet the film does.</p> <p>Gibbs tours a \u201cfootball field-sized\u201d solar installation called the Cedar Street solar array in Lansing, Michigan. An energy boss says to camera that the panels have an efficiency of a \u201clittle less than 8%\u201d and that the array could power only about 10 city homes a year.</p> <p>What the film doesn\u2019t say is that the array was installed as <a href=\"https://www.secondwavemedia.com/capitalgains/innovationnews/bwl0242.aspx\">a pilot project in 2008</a>.</p> <p>One energy writer to have looked closely at many of the claims in the film is Australian <a href=\"https://ketanjoshi.co/2020/04/24/planet-of-the-humans-a-reheated-mess-of-lazy-old-myths/\">Ketan Joshi</a> who says looking at a solar array from 12 years ago is \u201can absolute eternity in solar development years\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/planet-of-the-humans-review-environment-michael-moore-jeff-gibbs\">Planet of the Humans review \u2013 contrarian eco-doc from the Michael Moore stable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Diesendorf says panels with an 8% efficiency \u201cwere on the market several decades ago\u201d and now most commercial panels have an efficiency above 20%.</p> <p>What\u2019s happened to the cost of solar panels since 2008?

On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/investors-call-on-australias-largest-oil-and-gas-company-to-set-greenhouse-targets\">more than 50% of Woodside investors supported a non-binding resolution</a> from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that the company should be setting targets to not only cut its own emissions, but those that result from the gas it sells to be burned in Asia. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/almost-half-of-all-shareholders-at-santos-agm-back-stronger-emissions-target\">similar motion at Santos\u2019s annual general meeting won 43%</a>.</p> <p>Both Woodside and Santos have resisted the push, and argued that gas is a \u201cclean\u201d fuel and part of the climate solution. Like Taylor, they claim Australian gas exports are an environmental good as they reduce coal in Asia. Neither the government nor industry have provided evidence to back this up, and officials have acknowledged the competition in Japan \u2013 still Australia\u2019s biggest gas market \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/07/fuelling-the-climate-crisis-why-lng-is-no-miracle-cure-for-australias-coal-addiction\">is increasingly with zero emissions nuclear and renewable generation</a>.</p> <p>Andrew Grant, head of oil, gas and mining with London-based financial thinktank <a href=\"https://carbontracker.org/\">Carbon Tracker</a>, says the global view of gas has flipped from it being seen as a cleaner fuel than coal, to it being the second-least desirable source of electricity. He points to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/gas\">analysis by the International Energy Agency</a> that found global gas-fired power generation must begin to decline later this decade under a sustainable development scenario. \u201cBetter than coal is not exactly a ringing endorsement,\u201d Grant says.</p> <p>The Paris deal\u2019s implicit goal of zero emissions by mid-century has been acknowledged by Woodside and Santos\u2019s European counterparts, particularly BP and Dutch Royal Shell. Shell, for example, has targets to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050, and to reduce the \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions released by customers when using its products by two-thirds by moving into clean energy.</p> <p>In contrast, Woodside\u2019s chief executive, Peter Coleman, dismissed the likelihood of billion-dollar investments in renewable energy and the chairman, Richard Goyder, said the company primarily saw itself as \u201ca gas company, with some assets in oil\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a67684491bc40688831801e68a166c6e5c5e2aa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a67684491bc40688831801e68a166c6e5c5e2aa9/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison and Angus Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison and Angus Taylor believe there is \u2018no credible transition plan\u2019 for Australia that does not involve greater use of gas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arguments over the future of gas are complicated to some extent by the different ways in which the fuel is used.</p> <p>In Australia, there are three main uses \u2013 for power generation, as a feedstock and source of heat in industrial processes, and for heating and cooking by households and businesses. All have been hit by skyrocketing gas bills since an LNG export hub opened at Gladstone in Queensland mid-last decade, linking local prices to those in Asia.</p> <p>The government has been focused on lowering prices to help local users, mostly by pressuring states and territories to increase supply. New gas onshore fields were being proposed and considered when the pandemic hit, sending the global oil and gas prices tumbling.</p> <p>While the fall has offered welcome cost relief for gas users, the government has a different view to some analysts and agencies on the extent to which gas is likely to remain cost-competitive and vital to Australia\u2019s needs.</p> <p>In a written response, Taylor did not answer directly a question about the role he believes gas will play as a transition fuel, or mention emissions reduction or climate change, but emphasised the \u201cessential\u201d role the fuel plays in energy reliability.</p> <p>\u201c[It] could be even more important through a gas-fired recovery,\u201d he said, reinforcing an earlier call for new \u201cfast-start\u201d generators that run only when required.</p> <p>But there is little evidence that the Australian electricity grid will need more gas power.

It is an option, but not the only one.</p> <p>Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, senior advisor to the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, says the services needed for a secure power grid are increasingly available from sources other than gas, including <a href=\"https://arena.gov.au/assets/2019/11/ARENA-Media-Release_Hornsdale-Battery-Expansion_191119x.pdf\">government-backed large batteries</a> and potentially through <a href=\"https://arena.gov.au/assets/2018/07/neoen-hornsdale-wind-farm-fcas-trial-report.pdf\">adjustments at wind</a> or <a href=\"https://reneweconomy.com.au/huge-machine-arrives-to-support-victorias-biggest-solar-farm-18667/\">additions at solar</a> farms.</p> <p>Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, believes fast-start gas is likely to have a role in the power grid but says it should live or die on its own merits, and not be boosted by the government through its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/27/zali-steggall-calls-for-probe-of-coalition-plan-to-underwrite-gas-hydro-and-coal-power\">$1bn underwriting program for new energy projects</a> or any other support.</p> <p>He is just as dismissive of suggestions the government may support new long-distance gas pipelines, which have <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/ex-fortescue-boss-joins-strike-energy-board-with-pipeline-plea-20190925-p52uyg\">previously been touted by Nev Power</a>, the former Fortescue Metals executive now heading the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 Coordination Commission.</p> <p>It is broadly accepted gas could be replaced by cheaper electricity in heating and cooking, but is likely to have a longer role in heavy industry and manufacturing. Wood says potential replacements <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/hydrogen-power\">such as green hydrogen</a> are not affordable today, though that could change sooner than expected not long ago, possibly within the next decade.</p> <p>In all its uses, he says, the role of gas is \u201cheading in the same direction\u201d, just on different timeframes, and it should not be the role of government to boost it.</p> <p>\u201cIf Angus is right, if he was an all-seeing and all-knowing god who knows gas is part of the answer, then that would be different,\u201d Wood says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he is.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Tom Harrison, the England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive, confirmed that playing international cricket behind closed doors this summer was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/ecb-launch-the-hundred-pushed-back-2021-cricket\">probably our only option</a>\u201d when chatting to Sky this week. What will that be like? Forget all the lame jokes that a behind closed doors match will not be an issue for English cricketers since this is what happens all the time in county cricket because that is not true; this is merely what a few \u201cexperts\u201d who do not attend any county matches assume to be the case.</p> <p>Jason Roy is a better witness given that the <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8679/scorecard/1211662/lahore-qalandars-vs-quetta-gladiators-21st-match-pakistan-super-league-2019-20\">last game</a> he played in the Pakistan Super League took place behind closed doors on 7 March when the Quetta Gladiators \u2013 Roy\u2019s team \u2013 were pitched against the Lahore Qalanders. \u201cThere was no atmosphere, simple as that,\u201d recalls Roy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/west-indies-allow-players-to-opt-out-of-summer-test-series-in-england\">West Indies allow players to opt out of summer Test series in England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was very strange. As a batsman when the bowler\u2019s running in you learn to block out the crowd, but as soon as the ball is done you can hear them going absolutely berserk. But [in Lahore] there was just dead silence. You could hear your mate calling ones and twos, so you don\u2019t just have to work off each other\u2019s body language. It was hard to get up for it. But it was something we knew we had to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>This may well be the case at the tail-end of this summer. Roy says: \u201cI\u2019m more than happy to play behind closed doors. It would just be nice to get out there. I feel like a kid again.\u201d He admits to \u201cgoing a bit stir crazy\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bat and I\u2019m just shadow-batting in the mirror \u2013 I\u2019m looking pretty good.

It is that hint of arrogance that makes him so mesmerising when in full flow. He seldom suggests he is riddled with self-doubt. Yet cricket is such a precarious game, especially for batsmen, that no one, however good or headstrong, is averse to the odd moment of uncertainty about the whereabouts of the next run.</p> <p>So it is almost reassuring to hear Roy say: \u201cTo be missing this amount of cricket is quite a daunting feeling because you don\u2019t know how you are going to feel when you get back. You can watch videos to make yourself feel good and train well but until you\u2019re facing that first ball in the middle, you don\u2019t really know. You worry after three months out of the game: are you still going to be able to bat? But I try not to think about that too much.\u201d</p> <p>The next major event on the global calendar is the World T20, scheduled for October in Australia, and Roy is key for England at the top of the order. No one knows yet whether the tournament will happen. \u201cIf players aren\u2019t able to prepare in the right way and are unable to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if it goes ahead and we\u2019re told we have three weeks to prepare all the boys will be putting in the hard yards to make sure we\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>He does not foresee any conflict with his employers over safety issues before the tournament. \u201cI\u2019ve got a huge amount of trust in the ECB. I think they will look at every single avenue. And I\u2019ll probably have a chat with Morgs [the England limited-overs captain, Eoin Morgan], see where his head\u2019s at and go with that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/30/twenty20-success-no-guarantee-hundred-will-produce-the-numbers\">Twenty20's success is no guarantee the Hundred will produce the numbers | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like just about everyone in the game this enforced interruption is a pain for Roy.

Everyone wants to be a Test cricketer, but it\u2019s hard for me to sit back and be like \u2018yep, I\u2019m a Test cricketer\u2019 because I haven\u2019t quite succeeded at that. I\u2019ve been selected but I want to succeed. I\u2019ve got to fight for my spot again and who knows how long that\u2019ll take.

The Randox instructions that come with the kits state: \u201cTest kits are only valid for 48 hours after use.\u201d The 29-year-old told the Guardian:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> This means there could be hundreds of useless kits sent out to workers like myself.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After calling the help centre, she was told there had been an influx of the same complaint and the advice was to order another one.</p> \n  <p>Similarly, Lou, a 31-year-old PR manager from London, was sent a kit without a return postage label enclosed. As a label couldn\u2019t be sent to her in time, Lou had a void sample and had to order a second kit to repeat the process. </p> \n  <p>Both women expressed concern over the delay in getting tested and also over whether the first testing kits they were sent would still count towards the government\u2019s daily testing figures.</p> \n  <p>The government was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">accused on Friday of bending the truth about how it passed its target of 100,000 tests a day</a>, amid reports that tests were being counted on dispatch rather than upon return to the lab.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">Hancock says UK hit 100,000 tests amid claims tally is artificially boosted</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Jade also expressed concern that people would have trouble following the instructions to self-swab because, as she put it, testing for Covid-19 is \u201cquite invasive and very unpleasant for patients and the nurses doing it\u201d. This, she said, led her to fear many tests being sent out won\u2019t be utilised properly. </p> \n  <p>Lou said she had found the instructions \u201cexceedingly confusing\u201d and hard to follow. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I mainly worry for those with severe symptoms, this delay could be really damaging and also the confusing nature of the instructions make it difficult for those with lower literacy levels. </p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a worrying delay for many who may be experiencing worse symptoms than me, who might be struggling to complete and return these tests.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She added that she found self-swabbing \u201cpainful\u201d and thought others might struggle with it \u2013 a process she now has to go through a second time. </p> \n  <p>Their concerns mirror those of a leading GP who <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-home-testing-for-covid-19-could-be-useless-leading-gp-warns-11981898\">told Sky News that \u201ca significant portion of [home tests] will be useless\u201d</a> because many people will struggle to perform the test on themselves. </p> \n  <p>Dr Gary Marlowe, the London chair of the <strong>British Medical Association</strong>, said that to collect a sample of the virus, patients need to scrape a long swab against their tonsils and push it into their nose until it meets resistance, which is \u201creally uncomfortable and difficult\u201d to do.</p> \n  <p>He said the difficulties with self-swabbing \u201cmeans that there will be a significant amount of people in whom the test comes back as negative when they\u2019re actually carrying the virus\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T15:00:06.505Z\">at 4.00pm

It found that changing the length of a lockdown \u2013 from eight to 12 or 16 weeks \u2013 would have an impact on the date at which any second wave might arrive, but only a marginal effect on the number of cases or deaths.</p> \n  <p>Another finding in the report claimed that the later a second period of lockdown was introduced \u2013 one that lasted for eight weeks \u2013 the bigger the reduction in any cases would be, compared to taking no lockdown action at all.</p> \n  <p>Communities with a younger average age of population would also extract greater benefit from a longer period of lockdown than one with an older population, according to the study. It found that any lockdown would save more lives amongst a younger community than an older one.</p> \n  <p>Dr Konstantin Blyuss, Reader in Mathematics at the University of Sussex, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although in each case we explored, there will be a second epidemic peak after the quarantine is lifted, interestingly and quite counterintuitively, the later quarantine is introduced, the smaller this second peak will be. This reduction becomes quite substantial for quarantines introduced at a later stage.</p> \n   <p>Introducing an eight-week quarantine 10 weeks after the start of an outbreak reduces the magnitude of the peak in infected individuals by between 45% and 59% compared to no quarantine, and this reduces to only 8.5%-23.5% for a quarantine of the same duration introduced after six weeks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the report, said the expanded effects of lockdown on young people could be explained by the likelihood of their being more socially mobile. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A bigger impact of quarantine on reducing deaths in regions with younger populations can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the fact that younger people have more contacts and thus are making a bigger contribution to disease transmission, so quarantining them makes a bigger impact on reducing the overall disease burden.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:55:58.255Z\">at 12.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead568e8f082b32fdd6bfc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:16:51.070Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e92e93d92f2969669fa66982b2d0553ae1873e4/32_114_3077_1847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural in tribute to the NHS painted by artist Rachel List in Pontefract.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead55ba8f082b32fdd6bfba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidbatty\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T11:14:13.904Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jeremy-deller\">artist Jeremy Deller</a> has called on middle-aged ravers to buy a poster he has produced in recognition of the plight of victims of domestic violence and care home residents during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.pleasedonotbend.co.uk/work/bless-this-acid-house\">Sales of the print</a>, which says Bless this Acid House, will support Refuge, a charity for survivors of domestic abuse, and Pilgrims\u2019 Friend Society, which runs care homes across the UK.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ra0jOlDZu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Although a firm may be open for business, this does not mean it is business as usual.</p> \n   <p>Residential property transactions have ground to a halt. Reduction in court hearings has massively impacted on the amount of work available - while social distancing and the lack of face-to-face meetings is causing difficulty delivering in other areas, such as the execution of wills.</p> \n   <p>Elsewhere, small firms have suffered from the decline in overall activity - particularly from service industries such as retail, leisure and hospitality.</p> \n   <p>The fate of the high-street firm is thus intrinsically bound to that of other small businesses.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said firms are struggling because although the government provides some relief, they are specifically excluded from support for small businesses, and are expected to continue paying business rates while their buildings are empty. There is therefore a growing fear that \u201cmany businesses will fall through the crack\u201d, he added.</p> \n  <p>Davis also said individual solicitors are also at risk, because some are not eligible for support for the self-employed, and those who are paid via dividends are in need of a support package.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T10:21:43.194Z\">at 11.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead43238f087d47c7787fd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T09:56:13.263Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New polling shows extraordinarily high support for the SNP government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> \n  <p>According to a YouGov survey for the Times Scotland, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has the confidence of 71% of Scots when it comes to her ability to make the correct decisions in dealing with the virus, with 23% saying they do not have faith in her judgments.

  "<p>As the government considers a phased reopening of schools, let\u2019s hear it for parents who\u2019ve toughed it out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/21/pupils-begin-studying-at-home-a-challenge-for-them-parents-and-teachers\">home-schooling</a> their children. Well done, everyone, but you do realise that you\u2019re not real teachers, don\u2019t you?</p> <p>The phased reopening of schools looks set to be complicated, just as for many disadvantaged pupils home education has proved chaotic and calamitous, with long-term consequences for social injustice. Many children have accessed little, if any, online learning. It has emerged that the <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/coronavirus-majority-of-free-laptops-wont-be-delivered-until-june/\">promised 200,000 laptops</a> to help them may not even arrive until late May/June. Schools have experienced huge difficulties trying to access the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52488208\">free school meal voucher scheme</a>. I could go on, but the point seems clear enough: educators educate, but that\u2019s not all they do.</p> <p>Obviously, parents deserve praise, and lots of it. The lockdown continues to be challenging for children and carers alike \u2013 keeping on top of it is an enormous achievement. I know I\u2019m lucky to have a teenager in this situation, that it would have been totally different with a younger child requiring constant hands-on supervision. You\u2019d have to be a parenting saint not to sometimes find it stressful and difficult. Still, parents are only dealing with their child or children. Even after everything that\u2019s happened, how many of us could claim to truly comprehend what it\u2019s like to educate and care for whole classes, and entire schools, full of children?</p> <p>Whatever some of us may tell ourselves during these weeks, parents haven\u2019t been doing what teachers do. Not that they were supposed to \u2013 this has been an emergency, not some bizarre competitive parenting contest. However, had it been, it wouldn\u2019t even have been close. What has played out (if all went to plan) is more akin to a temporary parent-cum-teaching assistant, steered online by their school.</p> <p>It\u2019s not running a full class, or several of them, and doing everything else that educators do. The childcare aspect alone has hit home for parents during this period \u2013 the fact that schools enable them to do something as fundamental as go to work. Then there\u2019s the extracurricular stuff: the shocking amount of often unrecognised (and unpaid) proto-social work that goes on all over the country in Britain\u2019s poorer schools, with many teachers having to feed and clothe their most vulnerable pupils.</p> <p>So pat yourself on the back if you\u2019ve worked hard home-schooling your children, keeping them interested, happy and, of course, educated. At the same time, spare a thought for teachers who do all this, and more, but for many more children. People rightly applaud NHS staff and key workers, but perhaps our educators also deserve a lot more appreciation than they generally get. It\u2019s a tough job; sometimes the toughest parts aren\u2019t even in the official job description. During lockdown, parents may been committed, patient, resourceful and lots of other great and admirable things, but they have not been teachers.</p> <h2>Forget feminism - can we talk about my hair?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e4a7916b2023944141d90878279881b37f07284\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e4a7916b2023944141d90878279881b37f07284/0_190_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wastepaper basket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What is the Zoom etiquette for popping a wastepaper basket over your head?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Source/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is the feminist position on caring about resembling a lockdown hell-hag?

Once I could have said \u201croad maintenance\u201d and got a laugh; now I\u2019d just get sympathy and, worse, murmured agreement.</p> <p>I\u2019m being facetious, but this is a feminist mind-melt. Am I a gender traitor for pining for my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/haircuts-in-lockdown-home-hair\">hair stylist</a> or just a shallow idiot? In the past, I\u2019ve tended to be impatient with people over-fretting about the rightness/wrongness of makeup and sundry grooming rituals \u2013 my attitude is, do what you like, with the emphasis on \u201cyou\u201d. Still, even now, the core feminist questions apply. Should appearance matter so much? Who or what tells us that it should? When it comes to societal pressure, what conditioning are women also buckling under?</p> <p>All these issues are as valid as ever, but there are limits and for some of us, those limits are manifesting in our skin, nails and hair.

  "<p>Until recently, Mike Hadreas was not a particularly emotional person. That may come as a surprise to fans of Perfume Genius, the name under which he releases gorgeous, theatrical, emotionally raw music. \u201cI think for a while my main emotions were either laughing, or just sort of irritated. The two modes, for years really,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But all of that has changed. He has moved cities, grown older, and learned how to dance. \u201cEven though I feel kind of unhinged and confused, it\u2019s where I need to be right now, and it\u2019s part of me going somewhere else, somewhere better. For however long it is.\u201d His new album, <em><a href=\"https://store.matadorrecords.com/set-my-heart-on-fire-immediately\">Set My Heart on Fire Immediately</a></em>, is about this arrival of big feelings, and a hunger for human connection, but for now human connection is on hold.</p> <p>We were supposed to meet in London at the beginning of March, but, with the global crisis growing, that was scrapped and now we\u2019re talking over FaceTime. \u201cI kind of had a little mini-panic this morning,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to just go on your phone and just refresh everything to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d </p> <p>It is early morning in Los Angeles, where Hadreas now lives. He is 38, but looks younger; on the screen, he cuts a gentle wary figure, softly spoken, though he grows more wry as the conversation unfolds. </p> <p>Hadreas\u2019s last album, 2017\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/07/perfume-genius-no-shape-review\">No Shape</a></em>, turned him into one of alternative music\u2019s biggest stars. Its grand, melodramatic songs popped up on blockbuster movie trailers, while his witty, arty tweets have amassed him almost a million followers.</p> <p>Two years ago, he moved from Tacoma, Washington, a short drive from where he grew up in Seattle, to LA, with his long-term boyfriend and collaborator Alan Wyffels. (Hadreas has been with Wyffels, a classically trained musician, for 11 years; they are in each other\u2019s company \u201c24 hours a day\u201d, and they have played every Perfume Genius show together.) Then, last summer, Hadreas collaborated with the choreographer Kate Wallich and the YC Dance Company on a dance piece called <em><a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/perfume-genius-becomes-a-dancer-brings-his-universe-to-life-the-sun-still-burns-here-review/\">The Sun Still Burns Here</a></em>, which they performed in New York. It made him realise he was looking for connection, that making music did not have to be so solitary. \u201cDance blew up so much for me,\u201d he says. \u201c[I started] really craving community, and being able to be present in the real world.\u201d</p> <p>Hence the title of the record he wrote shortly after it. <em>Set My Heart on Fire Immediately</em> is a demanding, grabby statement. \u201cBecause I get greedy,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI get a little of this good feeling and I\u2019m like, well, I want to constantly be in that state.\u201d For someone who has been used to having just two feelings, this is a confusing shift. \u201cIt feels really unhinged. If I don\u2019t get it, I\u2019m pissed! I\u2019m constantly waiting and searching for and demanding a big feeling.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln4S83JeY2Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ln4S83JeY2Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&amp;v=ln4S83JeY2Y\">Watch the video for Perfume Genius\u2019s On the Floor.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When the new record was sent out to critics, it came with an essay written by the author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review\">On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</a></em>, Ocean Vuong, in which he notes that in Hadreas\u2019s most recent work, \u201cthe body (queer, healing, troubled, wounded, possible and gorgeous) sings itself into its future\u201d. Hadreas has often sung about his body, but says that now, he feels more in control of it, more inside it. \u201cI\u2019m always obsessed with this idea of leaving, and changing and shifting, and just blowing everything up and going. Before, I felt like I couldn\u2019t be in my body and do that, but I\u2019m starting to realise that I can.\u201d</p> <p>Has he always had a tendency to want to blow things up and leave? \u201cOh <em>yeah</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cI figured out when I was pretty young that drinking and going out and doing drugs and stuff will just give you a really full, 360-degree feeling. It is ultimately empty, but at least there is enough in the effect that you feel quiet and satiated for a long time. It comes with its own set of really horrible shit, too. It\u2019s kind of a death wish, in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Hadreas only started writing songs when he got clean in his mid-20s, after he dropped out of art school and eventually moved home, and has been sober ever since. Until recently, he says, he would hide from the world when he wasn\u2019t working, and nest at home with Wyffels, stop feeling so \u201cwild\u201d. \u201cI stopped looking for big \u2018feeling\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I\u2019m starting to realise that maybe there\u2019s another way. I can have more, and keep everything.\u201d Is that liberating? \u201cI feel free, but I also feel that I have no idea what\u2019s going on. Internally, externally. It doesn\u2019t help that the whole world doesn\u2019t, either. It\u2019s in the air, too.\u201d</p> <p>On the sleeve of the new album, Hadreas is topless and muscular, covered in dirt. On previous albums, he has been androgynous, feminine, in makeup and heels; in the videos released so far, he embraces an ultra-macho look. \u201cI wanted the cover [of <em>Set Fire\u2026</em>] and the video to have that same thing, where it\u2019s warm and nostalgic, but something\u2019s not quite right. It\u2019s hyper-masculine, but there\u2019s something off about it.</p> <p>\u201cMy presentation, and what I wear, there\u2019s definitely a performative element to it and I love that. But also, at the core of it, is that it\u2019s just what I feel like doing, and where I am at the moment.\u201d This matches the music, which dips in and out of 50s ballads, 80s pop and theatrical, lilting Americana. </p> <p>Hadreas has always sung about sex, and has never been one for coyness. A new song, Jason, recalls an encounter with a man who doesn\u2019t bother taking his clothes off (\u201cThat\u2019s one of the only songs that is really just a memory that I mined, and I told the story\u201d). On one of his best-known songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7OSSUwPVM4\">Queen</a>, he sings about sexuality as a menace to straight society: \u201cNo family is safe, when I sashay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[Sex] is an easy place to funnel a lot of things that I can\u2019t explain into something that\u2019s very physical,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much easier to put a beat on a song if it\u2019s about sex. Even when I dance, it all comes from a low place,\u201d he laughs, and gestures down. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the funnel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac5fe76e33db5181ef0c2f294d3e8b98774f36f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac5fe76e33db5181ef0c2f294d3e8b98774f36f3/0_87_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing live at the 2018 Coachella festival in Indio, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing live at the 2018 Coachella festival in Indio, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he was a teenager in the 1990s, Hadreas loved female musicians who sang about sex frankly. \u201cLiz Phair was just straight up saying some <em>nasty</em> shit to me, that was so empowering. When I first heard it, I was like...\u201d He puts his hand to his mouth in mock fright. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could say that.\u201d He loved Alanis Morissette, whom he considers the mainstream version of Phair. \u201cIt had a little bit of that underneath. My mom listened to it. And I was like, but mom, she\u2019s nasty! That\u2019s what I liked, this angsty nastiness.\u201d</p> <p>That angsty nastiness continued to inspire him. \u201cI think it is part of the reason I\u2019m obsessed with sex as an idea,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a queer person, [sex] is what everyone says is the disgusting part of how you\u2019re feeling. The wrong part, the dirty part. And I was 12. I hadn\u2019t had sex with anyone, but I was told there\u2019s something wrong with me, because of who I would <em>want</em> to have sex with eventually. It becomes such a loneliness and such a source of shame, and you start developing all these feelings around it before you\u2019re even allowed to find out what it truly is!</p> <p>\u201cTo hear people sing about sex, and women specifically singing about sex in an unapologetic way, where the dynamic was that they were on top, that was really revolutionary to me.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder how Hadreas feels about queerness becoming more mainstream in the entertainment world, even to the point of it becoming a commodity. \u201cI mean, I try not to be bitter,\u201d he smiles. \u201cBut if there is a gay award, I want it. If there\u2019s a gay cheque, then write it to me! That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d He says this lightly. \u201cI feel like queer voices are being heard more, because you can just speak out, and put it up online. I also feel like the gates are still closed, in a lot of ways, unless it\u2019s beneficial to everybody to channel some specific, non-threatening version of queerness. But we need that, too. It\u2019s a weird combination of things. People love queerness when it\u2019s just <em>adjacent</em> to it. When someone\u2019s playing with the idea, and not fully inhabiting it. I think it\u2019s too threatening, when people are...\u201d He reaches for a word, but only one will do. \u201cQueer.\u201d</p> <p>As Perfume Genius, Hadreas fully inhabits all of it. Is he making the music that he would have liked to have listened to, when he was a teenager? \u201cYes,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI love that. I mean, that\u2019s it, for me.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://store.matadorrecords.com/set-my-heart-on-fire-immediately\">Set My Heart on Fire Immediately is out on Matador on 15 May</a></em></p>",

  "<p>The row between cinema chains and Universal Studios over the digital-only release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/amc-us-cinema-chain-boycott-universal-studios-home-streaming\" title=\"\"><em>Trolls World Tour</em></a> is one of may crises racking the entertainment industry during the coronavirus lockdown. The challenges range from working out how to stage live performances to managing social distancing in queues for rollercoasters. Here are some of the issues they face.</p> <h2>Television</h2> <p>Television is facing two main obstacle: programme supply issues in the short term; and, in the longer run, potentially fundamental changes to how shows are produced. ITV says, despite cuts in programme frequency, it will run out of episodes of <em>Emmerdale</em> at the end of May, and of <em>Coronation Street</em> at the end of June.</p> <p>The almost total shutdown of the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound TV and film production industry could see gaps in schedules for some genres, such as high-profile dramas, of up to two years. Kevin Lygo, ITV\u2019s director of programming, has already flagged likely reruns of <em>Midsomer Murders</em> in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/30/itv-considers-filming-love-island-in-cornwall-or-cancelling-series\" title=\"\">depleted schedule</a> next year.</p> <p>How productions are made will change too. Live TV audiences may be a thing of the past for some shows. ITV and the BBC have said they will forgo them if necessary for upcoming series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/14/silly-naff-unmissable-the-masked-singer-is-a-truly-terrible-delight\" title=\"\"><em>The Masked Singer</em></a> and <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>. On-set production will also be altered by social distancing \u2013 there will be no more mass catering or crowded makeup trucks, and the previously unthinkable prospect of stars actually driving themselves to studios and filming locations may become thinkable.</p> <h2>Music</h2> <p>Artists face a number of lean years following the shutdown of the $27bn global live music industry. The streaming revolution has been a boon for music discovery and promotion, but the real money remains in live performance.</p> <p>\u201cA typical artist gets 65% to 75% of their income from live performances,\u201d says Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research. \u201cBut it will take ages for consumer confidence to recover and return in mass numbers to live music. Toilets, ticketing and cloakrooms are all cluster points. What are club venues going to do, those with capacity of 150 to 200 people? They won\u2019t be viable with two-metre social distancing.\u201d</p> <h2>Standup comedy</h2> <p>Standup is an industry built on close-knit audiences in intimate, sometimes cramped, locations. It is a social-distancing nightmare.</p> <p>\u201cStandup has always been in rooms above pubs, or basements: it\u2019s like an underground movement,\u201d says Simon Lupton, a former BBC commissioning editor for comedy and co-founder of Seven Seas Films. \u201cThese are the very venues you wouldn\u2019t want to go to with coronavirus around, but close-proximity environments are where comedy thrives.\u201d</p> <p>Comedy venues are not big moneyspinners; income from food and drink sales tends to be crucial, and decreased footfall is likely to push many to the brink.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t see venue closures, but I suspect it will be inevitable as a lot of these places run on shoestring budgets,\u201d adds Lupton. \u201cThis won\u2019t be the death of comedy: everything is evolving and finding new ways of working. It will take time, but it will survive.\u201d</p> <h2>Theatre</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"236c69411dbeb2a8936c5756d0b65c2a85dd5cd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/236c69411dbeb2a8936c5756d0b65c2a85dd5cd6/0_217_5824_3495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed theatre in London\u2019s West End, with Les Miserables posters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed theatre in London\u2019s West End: large, costly productions rely on full houses to keep going.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alistair Smith, editor of <em>The Stage</em>, worries that while <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/editors-view-the-big-question-is-not-when-theatres-will-reopen-its-how\" title=\"\">the focus has been on when theatres might open,</a> another question has not been given equal billing: how?</p> <p>\u201cLarge communal activities such as theatre are going to be among the last to reopen,\u201d he says. \u201cEven then, it will probably be with some modifications: reduced capacities, temperature-testing on entrance, maybe even smaller casts due to cramped backstage facilities. And I can\u2019t imagine too many people wanting to crush around a theatre bar in the interval.\u201d</p> <p>Reduced capacities could have a knock-on effect on expensive West End productions with high running costs \u2013 they need packed theatres to be economically viable. Lower-budget shows could afford to play to smaller houses. And restrictions might make immersive theatre impossible.</p> <p>Smith adds that social distancing raises myriad questions, such as how audiences will get to their seats, and whether measures taken in theatres will be undermined if people travel to venues on public transport.</p> <h2>Theme parks</h2> <p>Large amusement parks operate as mini-cities: packed with rides, shopping malls, cinemas and restaurants, they face multiple issues in a virus-hit world. Guidelines published last week by Florida\u2019s Orange County \u2013 home to Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld, all of which hope to reopen next month \u2013 make for lengthy reading. They include touchless hand sanitiser stations at all ticketing and entry areas and turnstiles, as well as markers six feet apart in queues. Mobile check-in will be encouraged at hotels, restaurants will have tables 6ft apart and bartenders will sanitise their hands after each order. In cinemas, people will be allowed in parties of up to four, with two seats between each group.</p> <p>But Andy Edge, a former director of Merlin Entertainments, which owns attractions including Thorpe Park and Chessington, wonders what will happen on rides. \u201cHow do you manage seat separation and social separation with families, couples and strangers? Rides rely on effective loading, and a 50% fill will have a major impact on operations. If coronavirus is here to stay, theme parks may have to think about the long-term physical design and production of rides.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became law throughout the European Union. Because it\u2019s a regulation rather than a directive, implementation is not left to the discretion of states; it became part of the legal code of every member of the EU, including the UK at the time. In essence, the GDPR is a set of rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. The drive behind the regulation was the need to bring the historical patchwork of laws and obligations around personal data, privacy and consent across Europe up to speed and make them fit for purpose in a world dominated by surveillance capitalism. On the face of it, the GDPR looks like a formidable legal instrument.</p> <p>At any rate, in the run-up to its implementation, the prospect of it seemed to scare the wits out of companies and organisations large and small. It was a gold mine for legal and data-protection consultants. Even amateurs such as me were often approached by small community groups terrified that their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/businesses-resort-to-desperate-emailing-as-gdpr-deadline-looms\">email list</a> would get them into trouble because they hadn\u2019t explicitly asked every individual on it for their approval.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have a powerful legal instrument that is not being brought to bear on the abusers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The GDPR conferred formidable powers on the data protection authorities (DPAs) of EU states, including the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenues. But so far the number of fines levied has been minuscule compared to the scale of the covert data-broking marketplaces that underpin the revenues of social media and other companies. To date, the biggest fines seem to have been handed out by the UK\u2019s DPA: \u00a3183m on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/08/ba-fine-customer-data-breach-british-airways\">British Airways</a> and \u00a399m on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/marriott-fined-over-gdpr-breach-ico\">Marriott hotel chain</a>, both for failing to keep customers\u2019 data safe from hackers. But these are exceptions that appear to prove the rule.</p> <p>So we\u2019re faced with a paradox: on the one hand, there\u2019s massive abuse of personal data by a global data-broking industry; on the other, we have a powerful legal instrument that is not being brought to bear on the abusers. How come? Is it because national DPAs are corrupt? Or indolent? Or just plain incompetent? The answer, it seems, is none of the above. They\u2019re simply overwhelmed by the scale of the task \u2013 and lamentably under-resourced for it.</p> <p>This is what emerges from an <a href=\"https://brave.com/dpa-report-2020/\">investigation</a> by the developers of an innovative browser called Brave, which has led to a formal complaint to the European commission. At the root of the problem is a shortage of critical skillsets. Investigating the shady practices of data-trackers installing cookies on your computer via the websites you visit can be a pretty technical task. DPAs therefore need not just lawyers on their payrolls, but knowledgable, forensically minded techies and such people are in high demand these days and don\u2019t come cheap.</p> <p>The Brave investigation finds that half of Europe\u2019s DPAs have only five technical experts or fewer (three \u2013 Austria, Romania and Latvia \u2013 don\u2019t seem to have any at all). Germany, with 29% of all European tech specialists, has the highest percentage, followed by Spain and France with the UK in fourth place (only 3% of the 680 staff at the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office are tech specialists). But the most worrying deficit of all is in the Irish DPA, which, according to the Brave report, has only 21 tech-enforcement roles. The fact that most of the tech giants have their European HQs in Dublin means that the Irish authority has the heaviest enforcement workload; it\u2019s currently the lead authority for 127 cases and yet its budget is being squeezed by the Irish government.</p> <p>With the exception of Germany, this seems to be par for the European course. The EU\u2019s governments pay lip service to the importance of citizens\u2019 privacy but they\u2019re evidently unwilling to pay to protect it. So we\u2019re left with a powerful but essentially unenforced regulation, which makes a mockery of the rule of law. Therefore, the big question about the GDPR comes down to this: has it turned out to be just an aspiration or is it a law? And if it\u2019s the latter, shouldn\u2019t we be enforcing it?</p> <h2>What I\u2019ve been reading</h2> <p><strong>Field work</strong><br>There\u2019s a fascinating article by PD Smith in <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/the-public-and-private-lives-of-albert-einstein-p-d-smith/\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/the-public-and-private-lives-of-albert-einstein-p-d-smith/\">TLS</a></em> about the private and public lives of Albert Einstein.

  "<p>An animated musical extravaganza about a group of pop-loving trolls may turn out to be the most important film in recent Hollywood history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/11/trolls-world-tour-review-uplifting-animated-sequel\" title=\"\"><em>Trolls World Tour</em></a><em>, </em>which has become a lockdown hit, notching up digital sales of $100m (\u00a380m) in three weeks, has become the focal point of a battle that could forever change moviegoing habits in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/as-cinemas-go-dark-the-film-industry-may-go-straight-to-netflix\" title=\"\">the Netflix era</a>.</p> <p>With cinemas closed, Hollywood studios are challenging the sacrosanct tradition that multiplexes air films first for up to three months, before their release on other platforms such as pay-TV, DVD and streaming. Instead, they are pushing new films straight to fans at home.</p> <p>Universal Pictures has been the most aggressive of the Hollywood studios with its strategy for <em>Trolls World Tour</em>. The film had been due for a global cinema release on 10 April, but instead became the most high-profile movie to be made available solely on digital services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video at \u00a315.99 ($19.99).</p> <p>Universal gets a greater cut of revenue from digital services than at the box office, which means the film has made the same amount of profit in its first three weeks as the first <em>Trolls </em>film did during its entire five-month run in US cinemas.</p> <p>Emboldened by its success, last week the company indicated that it would collapse the cinema release window by releasing films digitally at the same time. \u201cAs soon as theatres reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats,\u201d said Jeff Shell, the chief executive of parent company NBCUniversal.</p> <p>Those comments immediately prompted the world\u2019s two biggest cinema operators \u2013 AMC, which owns the Odeon chain in the UK, and Cineworld \u2013 to issue a global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/odeon-bans-all-universal-pictures-films-as-studio-skips-cinema-releases\" title=\"\">ban on screenings of all films from the maker of the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> and <em>Jurassic World </em>franchises</a> when business restarts. The operators accused Universal of \u201cbreaking the business model\u201d that has underpinned the Hollywood movie system for generations.</p> <p>\u201cUniversal has cast the first stone,\u201d said Jeff Bock, an analyst at research firm Exhibitor Relations. \u201cThis is exactly what the theatrical exhibition world had always feared \u2013 proof that bypassing theatres could be a viable model of distribution for studios. Like it or not, the floodgates have opened. This is just the beginning, and the longer it takes for theatres to open on a worldwide scale, we\u2019re going to see the PVOD [premium video on demand] schedule become more and more populated.\u201d</p> <p>That schedule is now filling up. Universal announced last week that Judd Apatow\u2019s new comedy <em>The King of Staten Island </em>would scrap its planned cinema release on 19 June and premiere on-demand instead. And Warner Bros is doing the same with <em>Scoob!</em>, the first full-length animated Scooby-Doo film, which was meant to hit cinemas on 15 May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1cb6d1aae449f31d48e773b9b0bbd312b44a4519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb6d1aae449f31d48e773b9b0bbd312b44a4519/405_0_3454_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two of the animated characters from Trolls World Tour in a plant-filled landscape\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lockdown hit Trolls World Tour has notched up sales of \u00a380m since its direct-to-digital release for Universal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo Credit: DreamWorks Animation LLC/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, when it comes to true blockbusters, Hollywood studios, including Universal, are so far choosing to keep them in cinemas and reschedule their releases. The straight-to-digital strategy is only considered to be viable for mid- and lower-budget films forecast to earn at most a few hundred million at the global box office. The first <em>Trolls</em> film made $346m worldwide.</p> <p>Disney\u2019s <em>Mulan</em> and <em>Black Widow</em>, the James Bond film <em>No Time To Die</em>, Warner Bros\u2019s <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em><em> </em>and Universal\u2019s <em>Minions</em><em> </em>sequel \u2013 all potential $1bn-plus hits \u2013 are just some of the titles that have been shifted to later this year with a cinema release still firmly in mind.</p> <p>Global box-office revenues hit an all-time record of $42bn last year, dominated by blockbusters including <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Theatrical release represents a huge slice of income that is difficult for studios to ignore. When a film\u2019s big-screen run is finished, there is a second wave of income from digital and on-demand services; this double-window revenue stream would disappear if multiplexes were taken out of the equation.</p> <p>\u201cStudios are not releasing \u2018tier one\u2019 titles on PVOD,\u201d said Richard Broughton, analyst at research firm Ampere. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that PVOD will be able to replace theatrical revenues for these titles. PVOD releases would also likely cannibalise secondary windows. If you rent a film for \u00a315.99, you\u2019re not then going to rent it again for \u00a35.99 a few months later. But you might do that if you had seen it at the cinema first.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9c74c472af428858000e9eddfb0c0b1067ea8c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9c74c472af428858000e9eddfb0c0b1067ea8c3/772_0_1335_1670/799.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of Scarlett Johannson in black superhero costume\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scarlett Johansson, star of Black Widow; big blockbusters are likely still to premiere in cinemas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also other issues making a total shift away from cinemas unlikely, for now at least. China, for example, along with many developing countries, has a tiny digital-video rental market, which would severely limit income from direct digital releases, whereas it boasts the world\u2019s second-biggest cinema box office market, at $9bn a year.</p> <p>And with PVOD releases such as <em>Trolls</em> priced at $19.99, it is unlikely that the strategy will work outside high-income markets such as the US and the UK.</p> <p>However, coronavirus has sideswiped cinema chains, which means direct-to-digital successes such as <em>Trolls</em> give studios more leverage. \u201c<em>Trolls</em> is operating under optimal conditions \u2013 lockdown, kids at home and limited competing media,\u201d says Broughton. \u201cHaving said this, the success of <em>Trolls</em> does offer studios leverage with cinema owners for a greater share of box office income for secondary titles. The option of the PVOD window improves their positioning.\u201d</p> <p>Unless Covid-19 causes longer-term closures or serious attendance issues in cinemas, the chains remain confident they will return to the top of the pecking order for film releases.</p> <p>\u201cThese circumstances will not persist and should not be taken by anyone as a sign of lasting change,\u201d said Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, the national trade body for cinema operators.</p> <p>\u201cWe are absolutely confident that when cinemas are able to reopen safely, the public will once again respond to the unsurpassable big-screen experience. After people have been required to spend weeks and sometimes months in lockdown, it seems unlikely, to say the least, that the first response of many will be \u2018let\u2019s stay in and watch a film.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But if audiences do decide to bypass cinemas and stay in, Hollywood studios will have to follow them.</p>",
  "<p>There is a famous scene in the first episode of <em>Friends</em> in which Ross says: \u201cI just want to be married again\u201d and Rachel runs into Central Perk, right at that moment, wearing a wedding dress. \u201cAnd I just want a million dollars,\u201d Chandler quips, holding out his hands.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, before the lockdown, I wrote about how I had tried to revive the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/09/the-lost-art-of-having-a-chat\">old-fashioned phone call</a>, wondering if ringing people for a chat might make a comeback. I missed the human connection of talking and when texting became our primary mode of communication, I felt the absence of a simple natter keenly.</p> <p>And I just want a million dollars. Six weeks in and here we are. We phone, we FaceTime, we Zoom, we Houseparty. I even did a Skype. In the absence of face-to-face human connection, the videocall is king. In her cover interview with <em>The Cut</em> last week, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny admitted that she had not previously been a fan of videocalling. \u201cIt\u2019s always so terribly unflattering,\u201d she said. Still, needs must and Sevigny admitted that under lockdown she now FaceTimes her friends.</p> <p>The necessary shift from the total remove of texting to seeing people during almost every communication is like popping out for one quiet drink and returning home several nights later with a buttock tattoo and a new nickname that ends in \u201cdawg\u201d. It is a sensory overload, a 0-60mph in 2.4 seconds. Before social distancing, I tended to FaceTime only children, because it is hard to pull faces at kids using just audio. Now, almost everyone expects a videocall, no matter how old. (The face pulling is less in demand.)</p> <p>It requires some adjustment, not so much because it\u2019s unflattering, but because the usual rules of communication no longer apply. How does a conversation between more than two people suddenly seem like a finals-week-of-<em>Strictly</em> manoeuvre? In real life, it just sort of flows. On screen, it\u2019s a \u201cno, after you\u201d comedy of manners. Where does one angle the camera? Up, it seems: recently, a judge in Florida had to remind lawyers to dress appropriately during virtual hearings; one man appeared topless, a woman while still in bed, under the sheets.</p> <p>More importantly, how does anyone manage to end a videocall without seeming rude? Ordinarily, I\u2019d go for a \u201csorry, reception\u2019s bad\u201d, but that\u2019s impossible to pull off when your bad acting is right there on display. Even Sevigny knows where to draw the line. \u201cI\u2019m not doing any Zoom parties,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Race Across the World: travel show was life-affirming, not torture</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b51955c4a7e4c94cf7ae0e3de9a23b40490fd96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b51955c4a7e4c94cf7ae0e3de9a23b40490fd96/413_613_3357_2014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emon and Jamiul Choudhury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winners with heart: Emon and Jamiul Choudhury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Wiseman/BBC/Studio Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the last few weeks, watching a series all about travelling prodigious distances and exploring the wonders of this planet should have seemed as appealing as squeezing lemon juice into a paper cut, but <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2020/apr/27/no-fly-zone-will-race-across-the-world-be-the-last-travel-tv-of-its-kind\">Race Across the World</a></em> has been one of the loveliest television shows in ages.</p> <p>During the first of the BBC Two series, five teams had to make their way from London to Singapore by land, without smartphones, using only the cash equivalent of the airfare.

They pulled it off by bartering MP3 players and ditching their bags before running up the final hill. But what made it the most life-affirming show I\u2019ve seen all year was that the winners were so affected by seeing children sleeping rough in the streets in Brazil\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo that they donated half of their \u00a320,000 prize fund to charity.

I already thought it was <em>Hunted</em> for nice people and then they hit us with that.</p> <p>In the chaos of our present lives, watching people become more self-sufficient than they thought possible was almost as joyful as watching how much strangers can be willing to support each other when they really need to. As a series, this was a convincing advert for fundamental human decency. I thought <em>University Challenge</em> ending would be the biggest blow but now that <em>Race Across the World</em> is gone, too, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll manage.</p> <h2>Christine Baranski: vamping it up at virtual cocktail party</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b0ac6136ce37eabcc53c8718aa4e036e21355eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b0ac6136ce37eabcc53c8718aa4e036e21355eb/5_189_1099_659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Baranski and a large glass of red\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Baranski and a large glass of red during The Ladies Who Lunch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I imagine that one day there will be a corner of the internet that caters to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, no matter how niche.

Save the Children has already warned that lockdowns \u2013 although they are being widely ignored \u2013 have put 7 million children at risk of hunger.</p> <p>Adding to Afghanistan\u2019s challenges, the country went into 2020 with a divided government facing political, military and economic crises. The government has been paralysed by a months-long political dispute over who won last year\u2019s presidential election, which prompted the US to withhold a billion dollars of funding, vital to the functioning of a country with little tax base.</p> <p>US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to sign a withdrawal deal with the Taliban, in a bid to end America\u2019s long war, has thrust the civil conflict between Afghan factions into an uncertain new phase. The militants have scaled back attacks in major cities but have rejected calls for a ceasefire to give time to fight the virus. They continue to attack government forces around the country, arguing their pact of non-aggression is only with the US.</p> <p>In northern Kunduz province, a hospital where a fifth of staff have been quarantined with suspected infections remains open to receive war wounded from the battles raging nearby because there is nowhere else to treat them, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/world/asia/afghanistan-coronavirus-hospitals.html\">it has been reported.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some Zabul residents who had been labourers in Iran brought the virus home with them</p> <footer> <cite>Hashim Tokhi, doctor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Taliban has allowed health officials in the south to travel to rural areas, including those under militant control, to provide coronavirus information and checks, doctors and officials say.

Yet cases have been rising sharply in neighbouring Kandahar , and there are also infections thought to have been imported directly to the province from Iran, by people trying to flee the epidemic there.</p> <p>\u201cSome Zabul residents who had been labourers in Iran, and came home to escape the outbreak there, brought it with them. There have been two cases confirmed in a remote district here over the last two days,\u201d said Hashim Tokhi, a doctor in Zabul.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have no access to heath equipment; they don\u2019t heed the lockdown or cooperate with public health, and there is also no information about the virus in remote areas.\u201d</p> <p>In nearby Helmand province, where British troops once fought the Taliban and nearly 400 lost their lives, the situation is even more grave, said Abdul Majid Akhundzada, a member of the provincial council. There have been 24 cases confirmed already, but hospitals were unprepared, he claimed, after funds were siphoned off by corruption.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of equipment, we have zero of that, nothing. We have no lab to test suspected people, no testing kits, no place even to isolate the patients there. There are masks and gloves in the shops that people are buying for themselves.</p> <p>\u201cCivilians and security forces continue to die in frontlines and their homes.

  "<p>Yesterday morning I spent an hour doing a jigsaw puzzle, followed by a game of Scrabble, fortified by tea and scones. For once, there was no one I had to see and nowhere I had to be. The way we live now has split us in two. For introverts, it\u2019s largely business as usual. But for my more extroverted friends, who are clamouring for Zoom calls to fill the gaping hole the pub has left in their lives, it\u2019s a deeply testing time.</p> <p>I\u2019m an introvert, which means I need time alone to recharge. This doesn\u2019t mean I hate socialising, but it may well mean I will feel stressed and fatigued if I\u2019m not left on my own for a while afterwards.</p> <p>On the flipside, extroverts are energised by time spent with other people and are often, though not always, more outgoing. In the 1960s the German psychologist Hans Eysenck suggested the reason behind this difference lies in our environmental sensitivity. Introverts need lower levels of stimulation to reach their \u201cset point\u201d of social arousal than extroverts, leading them to seek an escape into quiet solitude sooner.</p> <p>So it makes sense that we introverts are finding lockdown easier than our extroverted counterparts. They are struggling to reverse their behaviour, which I sympathise with \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine what it would feel like to suddenly have to live life the other way round, with the government forcing me to socialise relentlessly. The thought of having to meet and talk to new people day and night without the possibility of withdrawing alone to recharge my batteries makes me feel nauseous.</p> <p>Natasha Tiwari, a psychologist with a practice in London, agrees that self-isolation plays to an introvert\u2019s strengths, but notes the importance of recognising that introversion and extroversion exist on a fluid scale. It\u2019s natural to find things tough, however you identify. \u201cIntroversion and extroversion are not binary concepts,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of us flick between them depending on our mood, environment and the people surrounding us. The key is to work out how to attain the right balance in your lifestyle to support your mental health.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For once, there is no guilt about wanting to stay at home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his 2011 paper on introversion, the American psychologist Jonathan Cheek argued that there are four main types of introvert: anxious, restrained, thinking and social \u2013 though overlap is normal. Anxious introverts struggle with shyness, often avoiding other people. Restrained introverts can enjoy socialising, but will stay in their shell until they feel comfortable. Thinking introverts are happy around others but are prone to daydreaming, and social introverts enjoy meeting friends but prefer to do so in intimate groups.</p> <p>I fall mostly into the last camp and always have done. I socialise one-on-one where possible. I relish a deep and meaningful conversation, but find the small-talk element of big gatherings tedious. You\u2019ll find me on the dancefloor, but I won\u2019t be asking 20 different people, \u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d Being a social introvert means I am missing the injections of real-life connection that I carefully thread through my diary every few days. Technology isn\u2019t quite doing it for me; it feels too frenetic.</p> <p><em><strong>I\u2019m living with</strong></em> my extroverted mum who has been enjoying regular \u201cprosecco hours\u201d on Zoom, the soundtrack to which goes like this: \u201cWhere are you? Turn your camera on! Oh, there you are! Cheers darling! Oh, you\u2019ve gone again! Unmute! Unmute!\u201d</p> <p>I downloaded the Houseparty app, opened it up and immediately a friend\u2019s face popped up to say hi, entirely unannounced. The horror has stayed with me.</p> <p>Cat Archer Underwood, 36, a brand consultant from Hampshire and an introvert, is learning more about herself. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments of utter peace, watching my husband and four-year-old daughter pottering about in the garden,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have been surprised at how I am feeling about the prospect of more weeks of this. I am dreaming of hosting barbecues, having a house full of laughing children and seeing people who aren\u2019t quite friends but are more than strangers. I may be choosier about the events I force upon myself in the future, but I\u2019ve learned that this introvert needs to party sometimes, too.\u201d</p> <p>Others further along the introversion scale are finding their daily life has barely changed. English teacher Ellie Grout, 29, from Bristol, is one of them. \u201cSelf-isolation is similar to my normal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difference is that, for once, there is no pressure to arrange social events and no guilt about cancelling plans when I realise I want to stay at home.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Introverts like to have their own space to process their ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hardcore introvert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-pan\" title=\"\">Jessica Pan</a>, 34, spent a year living like an extrovert while writing her 2019 book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sorry-Late-Didnt-Want-Come/dp/0857526154\" title=\"\">Sorry I\u2019m Late, I Didn\u2019t Want to Come</a></em>.

Both are working from home and appreciating the slower pace of lockdown life. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any introvert actively enjoys being locked in their home at this time of anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am finding pleasure in the small things, such as reading more, cooking slowly and doing pilates. I\u2019m trying to embrace this new normal and live in the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma Broadstock, 24, a virtual assistant from Derbyshire, is hopeful this lockdown will reveal the often overlooked strengths of introverts and help erode what Susan Cain, author of the 2012 bestseller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/22/quiet-power-introverts-susan-cain-review\" title=\"\">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u2019t Stop Talking</a></em>, dubs \u201cthe extroverted ideal\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness is thriving for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea of networking events has always felt overwhelming, but now people are holding them online and I\u2019ve been finding new clients. When everything goes back to normal, I hope employers will offer more remote-working opportunities, as I feel much more confident in my own space. I am able to make valuable input when I would normally stay quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Cain, a former Wall Street lawyer, went some way in challenging misconceptions that introverts are always shy, serious and aloof with nothing much to offer. In her book she extols \u201cthe man of contemplation\u201d in a society that has \u201calways favoured the man of action\u201d. Yet nearly a decade after its publication, extroversion is still considered a model of success, especially in the workplace where what Cain describes as \u201cthe omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in the spotlight\u201d prevails.</p> <p>Working in an open-plan office, taking part in daily meetings, public speaking and networking are all activities that are geared towards the extrovert\u2019s need for stimulation, while introverts struggle to make themselves seen and maintain their energy reserves.</p> <p><em><strong>Our response to</strong></em> the coronavirus pandemic means that society has changed overnight, reshaped to suit a more introverted way of being \u2013 one that is rarely permitted \u2013 of thriving in a quiet setting, having time to think and be creative, and having control over how much socialising you do. No social experiment could have gone this far in modelling a way of living designed almost exclusively for introverts. It may just show employers that, as Cain says in her 2012 Ted talk, \u201cwhen it comes to creativity and leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I mean zero. We could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.\u201d</p> <p>Tiwari hopes that this episode of upheaval will cause a long-term shift in working culture that could not come soon enough for introverts. \u201cIntroverts often enjoy having their own space to process ideas and work undistracted,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lockdown is proving that working from home and being in one\u2019s own space is not to the detriment of wider business interests and can, in fact, lead to a boost in productivity and wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>Tiwari believes that extroverts and introverts can cope with this strange time together, so long as they respect their differences. \u201cBeing one or the other doesn\u2019t preclude you from sharing interests and being cosy together,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just means that you may need to be extra conscious of each other\u2019s needs. Extroverts may be surprised at how much they enjoy this quieter time, while introverts may find themselves craving the company of others. Don\u2019t overthink how you label yourself. Follow your intuitive sense for what you need right now.\u201d</p>",

After weeks of silence, the presumptive Democratic nominee categorically denied the accusation in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">Medium post</a> and in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.</p> <p>\u201cThis never happened, and when she first made the claim, we made it clear that it never happened, and it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the former vice-president said on Morning Joe.</p> <p>But, of course, it isn\u2019t as simple as that. While it\u2019s commendable that Biden finally addressed Reade\u2019s allegations directly, instead of having his campaign issue more denials, he needs to go further. Biden must authorize a search of his Senate papers, which are held at the University of Delaware, to identify any evidence of the complaint that Reade says she made about him at the time.</p> <p>Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked Biden if he would authorize such a search; his answer was \u201cno.\u201d Biden said that he would ask the National Archives to make public any record of a complaint filed by Reade, but would not allow his Senate papers to be unsealed as they \u201cdo not contain personnel files\u201d and could become political \u201cfodder\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s not good enough. Surely Biden can order an independent investigation of his Senate papers for mentions of Reade without compromising other sensitive information? If he\u2019s not capable of doing that then I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of being the president of the United States.</p> <p>But what about the current president? What about the pussy-grabber in chief? What about the dozens of sexual harassment allegations against him? Why should Biden be held to a higher standard than Donald Trump?</p> <p>There has been a huge amount of whataboutism by liberals when it comes to the allegations against Biden. I can understand the frustration fueling this: the fact that Trump supporters are suddenly concerned about sexual consent is jaw-droppingly hypocritical.</p> <p>The White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, for example, seems to have suddenly become a massive #MeToo advocate. \u201c\u2018Believe all women\u2019 means <em>all</em> women,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-joe-biden-accuser-believe-women\">told Fox News on Friday</a>. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend Joe Biden doesn\u2019t have a history of, without permission, and without restraint, planting his face in the back of women\u2019s heads, sniffing their hair, fondling their necks and creeping them out,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CillizzaCNN/status/1256245211392606208?s=20\">further noted</a>. Hang on, does this woman know who she works for? Does she have any shame at all?</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just Trump supporters who are being hypocritical. Conservatives have rightly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">pointed out</a> the difference in the way Democrats and the mainstream media treated the sexual assault allegations against supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh versus the allegations against Biden. There is arguably a lot more evidence supporting the allegations against Biden than there ever was against Kavanaugh, but there\u2019s a hell of a lot less liberal outrage. When confronted with a question about those double standards on Thursday, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">Nancy Pelosi responded</a> by saying that she didn\u2019t need a \u201clecture or a speech\u201d and \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden\u201d. An extremely persuasive retort.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure that the allegations against Biden will end up doing any serious damage to his campaign. However, the way in which the Democratic party and liberals have rallied behind him is going to do a huge amount of damage to #MeToo. Alyssa Milano, the woman who helped mainstream #MeToo, choosing to believe Biden over Reade will be brought up every single time someone says \u201cbelieve women\u201d. The way in which liberals downplayed allegations against Biden will be used as ammunition every single time someone on the right is accused of sexual assault.</p> <p>Indeed, Trump is already using the Democrats\u2019 defense of Biden to discredit his own accusers. When asked about the Reade allegations by reporters on Thursday he mused that Biden that might have been <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/495563-trump-biden-allegations-could-be-false-but-he-should-respond\">falsely accused</a>. \u201cIt could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times, and there is such a thing.\u201d Trump then went on to speak about Kavanaugh, saying: \u201cHe was falsely charged. What happened with him was an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s an absolute disgrace to America: the fact that, in November, women will be forced to choose between two men credibly accused of sexual assault for president.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand safety net helps sex workers in lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0028/latest/DLM197815.html\">New Zealand Prostitution Reform Act</a>, developed with the input of sex workers, decriminalized sex work in 2003.

Step forward Sarina Wiegman and a solution to Nexit potentially as dazzling as the sea of orange that greeted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/06/womens-euro-2017-holland-denmark-match-report\">Netherlands\u2019 Euro 2017 triumph</a>.</p> <p>In leading the <em>Oranje</em> to European Championship success on home soil and then the final of last summer\u2019s World Cup in France, Wiegman has transformed the topography of the women\u2019s game in the Netherlands beyond recognition. Perhaps more important, the 50-year-old\u2019s career evolution \u2013 including a formative stint working in the men\u2019s game \u2013 represents a template for female coach development in England.</p> <p>Wiegman\u2019s contract with the Dutch FA ends in 2021 and she has seemed receptive to a new challenge. Admittedly, with two teenage daughters and a husband coaching in men\u2019s football, the timing and logistics could be wrong but surely the FA should be making an approach to a female coach who ticks multiple boxes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1ff5f7f380069ab3828a562869bae739d1183ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ff5f7f380069ab3828a562869bae739d1183ac/0_258_4282_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarina Wiegman puts Ashleigh Weerden through a drill during Netherlands training\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarina Wiegman steers Ashleigh Weerden through a drill during Netherlands training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wiegman would arrive not only fluent in English but with fresh eyes and a healthy emotional detachment from a Lionesses squad that has fallen at the semi-final stage in the last three major tournaments.</p> <p>If scouting trips to watch the raft of Netherlands players plying their trade in the WSL will have offered her sufficient insight to hit the ground running, so too should Wiegman\u2019s tactical flexibility and streak of stylistic pragmatism.</p> <p>Neville, set to remain in situ until next summer, was derailed by his failure to compromise his possession-heavy vision, based on building from the back. Wiegman\u2019s subtle refinement of the Netherlands\u2019 counterattacks and transitions between attack and defence shows greater adaptability.</p> <p>Granted England need to retain the ball better but their progress under Mark Sampson was based on a hybrid, flexible and counterattacking style that kept opponents guessing and camouflaged individual flaws. They do not need another coach stubbornly in thrall to Neville\u2019s principles, which failed to maximise the Lionesses\u2019 strengths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/23/phil-neville-england-women-reign-costly-mistake-football\">Phil Neville's England reign a costly mistake and it may get more messy | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wiegman has been making the best of things in an imperfect context since. As a six-year-old, she demanded her hair be cut short in order to defy a ban on mixed football and join her twin brother in a boys\u2019 team in The Hague. In 2001 she became the first female Dutch international to earn 100 caps, while 2016 marked her pro licence coaching qualification, then held by only two other women in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Wiegman went on to spend a season playing in North Carolina under Anson Dorrance, who had coached the USA to victory in the 1991 World Cup. \u201cI always thought I was different from other girls,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople said: \u2018You\u2019re too fanatical about football.\u2019 When I went to Carolina I was normal; it was paradise.\u201d</p> <p>She returned home on a mission to transplant American passion and nous for women\u2019s football into her Dutch compatriots. \u201cWe needed proper facilities, good programmes and good coaches,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter 20 years we got that system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the interim she worked as a PE teacher, becoming a full-time women\u2019s coach at Den Haag in 2007. By the time the pro licence was secured Wiegman was on the national coaching staff and an innovative fast-track that involved the culture shock of a year\u2019s internship at Sparta Rotterdam, deployed as an assistant men\u2019s first-team coach.</p> <p>If teaching had honed Wiegman\u2019s communication skills and organisational abilities, she gained a streetwise edge and increased emotional intelligence. \u201cIt was a new environment and I had to figure things out,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it improved me, gave me confidence and taught me about different behaviours.\u201d</p> <p>Sparta Rotterdam offered her the right framework in which to properly develop a talent swiftly reapplied when she became national women\u2019s manager. If the FA could do worse than encourage emerging English female coaches to follow a similar <em>Oranje</em>-tinted route map and take routine internships in men\u2019s football, poaching Wiegman also would make eminent sense.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Will Woodward, head of sport</strong></h2> <p>Sport\u2019s unravelling happened haphazardly \u2013 and then suddenly. With Champions League and Europa League games behind played behind closed doors or postponed, and plenty of debate about whether other sports should continue, the turning point was Arsenal\u2019s head coach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mikel-arteta-tests-positive-coronavirus-arsenal-head-coach-premier-league\">Mikel Arteta\u2019s diagnosis with coronavirus</a>, which popped up on Thursday 12 March, a few hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\">Boris Johnson had warned that many families would lose their loved ones</a>.

After a spell in which the ground shifted beneath our feet almost daily, we\u2019ve settled into some kind of routine. Inevitably we\u2019re covering a lot about postponements, cancellations and hopes for restarts. Our reporter David Conn was quickly on to fears that the virus had spread <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\">after the Liverpool-Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</a> game, and the Guardian has looked hard at evidence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">linking the virus to Cheltenham</a>. Otherwise we\u2019ve had time to wallow \u2013 not too much, but enough \u2013 in some of the great moments of the past, not least in our retro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/apr/18/chile-v-italy-1962-world-cup-live\">minute-by-minute series</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/my-favourite-game\">My Favourite Game series</a>.

Sport isn\u2019t even close to the most important thing right now. But do we miss it? Like crazy.<br></p> <h2>Jonathan Liew, sports writer</h2> <p>It\u2019s like a metaphysical conundrum: how do you write about sport that doesn\u2019t exist? In a way, it\u2019s analogous to describing the silence that follows a piece of music: yes, technically you\u2019re trying to define the shape of something that isn\u2019t there. But if you listen closely enough, you can feel in the absence the weight of what was once present. And perhaps it\u2019s only in the void that sport leaves that you can truly appreciate its worth.<br><br>How do you fill the void? Archive features and retrospectives are perhaps an inevitable upshot of the shutdown, a chance to reconsider the past with a fresh eye and the benefit of time. But our readers don\u2019t simply want to wallow in nostalgia; they want to know when sport will return, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/with-sport-frozen-in-time-we-need-to-find-joy-in-the-journey-not-the-destination\">what it will feel and taste like when it does</a>. That\u2019s the balance I\u2019ve tried to strike, and in a way it\u2019s the balance we\u2019re all striving for: equal parts realism and escapism, the same bewitching brew that drew us all to sport in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5b407f12788bfd01ced6ea8ccd8f816fda4d393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5b407f12788bfd01ced6ea8ccd8f816fda4d393/0_46_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cardboard cutouts replace supporters at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s stadium in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardboard cutouts replace supporters at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s stadium in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sascha Steinbach/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>Claire Tolley, sports features editor</h2> <p>Sports journalism\u2019s rhythm is defined by the diary. But that diary is empty, at least in the immediate future, despite ongoing meetings to provide a roadmap of how and when live sport can return. Global championships, events and league seasons have been cancelled or postponed, falling like a row of dominoes in the past couple of months. And so the first part of lockdown has been shaped by a news agenda chasing what will no longer be happening this spring and summer and the repercussions of those cancellations or delays. That has now been replaced by talk of when live sport might get up and running again, and the ethics of such a return.</p> <p>There has been a glaring hole left in the absence of any live sport to cover. Interviews and features, too, are usually pegged to the news agenda or forthcoming events. Beyond those related to the pandemic itself, we have recast interviews or features to reflect the new reality of lockdown. We have also looked for different ways of engaging with our readers. Our hugely popular live minute-by-minutes have had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/apr/11/the-masters-1996-greg-norman-final-round-live\">retro makeover</a>, some pegged to anniversaries or events that had been in the diary; we have brought in regular columnists such as the England cricketer Moeen Ali <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/ask-moeen-the-england-all-rounder-answers-guardian-readers-questions\">to answer readers\u2019 questions</a> and commissioned follow-up features off the back of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/missing-live-sport-here-are-12-great-documentaries-to-watch-instead\">readers\u2019 responses to articles</a>.</p> <p>As the lockdown continues, and the news ebbs rather than flows, we are embracing opportunities to turn back the clock, source interviews that we could never quite find the right time to publish, and investigate wider issues.<br></p> <h2>Barry Glendenning, sports writer and broadcaster</h2> <p>Before all this, the problems we were most accustomed to dealing with on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly\">Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast</a> involved how best to cram in all the big weekend talking points on a Monday morning. All four divisions of the English league had to be discussed, along with the latest news from Scotland and the major continental leagues, as well as any other business. That\u2019s a \u201chella lotta\u201d football chat.</p> <p>Presenter Max Rushden and I immediately promised our audience that, health permitting, we would continue recording twice a week until somebody higher up told us to stop. We hoped it would go some way towards maintaining our own sanity as well as that of the hundreds of thousands of listeners for whom Football Weekly seems to provide a reassuring sense of normality and routine. Our listening figures suggest that if anything, football has been holding us back for years.</p> <p>With no action to discuss, Max and I have had to come up with other ways to fill time. The most difficult part? Finding the right balance between discussions about particularly grim virus-related issues and more frivolous topics of discussion, such as the conspicuous absence of bookshelves full of intellectually weighty tomes in the background of each other\u2019s \u201chome studios\u201d, and general chit-chat about how we\u2019ve been coping in a world where pub-going is not an option. It should go without saying that our guests and listeners have been a source of welcome inspiration, their contributions and correspondence regularly sending us off on strange, often hilarious and always welcome tangents.</p> <p>While Max and I don\u2019t like to talk about the selfless manner in which we are putting our lives on the line each week in the interests of boosting public morale like a pair of modern-day Vera Lynns, we recently received an email from a nurse named David from the United States who could identify with the stress and hardship we are currently not enduring.</p> <p>\u201cYour voices cheerfully ring through the darkness of semi-rural Connecticut during my long drives into my night shift and balance out my thoughts of how many Covid patients my hospital now has, or how many of my co-workers have either tested positive or are now under quarantine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am sure there are thousands and thousands of people like me around the world that deeply appreciate what you do.

A largely Saudi Arabian-funded consortium was buying the city\u2019s football club for \u00a3300m.

It\u2019s an ethical quagmire. Sophisticated sports-washing or Saudi modernisation?</p> <p>Match reporting is infinitely more straightforward \u2013 and adrenaline-rich. Perhaps the biggest thing I crave is the adrenaline: reports invariably have to be filed against tight deadlines, either on the final whistle or, at night games, as \u201crunners\u201d, with chunks of copy delivered at half-time. They always involve a mild sense of panic.

Boris Johnson was there too. Five days later he was on TV telling us that we were in the midst of the \u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. And then, all of a sudden, someone pulled the rug out from under the summer. The rest of the rugby season was postponed, then the beginning of the cricket season too, and the Masters, the Open, Wimbledon and the Olympics, all events I was supposed to cover.</p> <p>Instead, I\u2019m a sportswriter with no sport to write, apart from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/01/cabin-fever-agenda-for-housebound-olympics\">marble racing videos and back garden marathons</a>. I\u2019ve been craving some escape from it all. Sport\u2019s a glorious triviality, after all.

  "<p>When Drew Layton dropped out of college in 2006 to play online poker full-time, it was a hard sell to his parents: \u201cThey were not thrilled,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But 14 years later, as coronavirus and the subsequent shelter-in-place orders have shut businesses around the globe and forced people to stay inside, some jobs have proven more stable than others. For Layton, online poker seems to be a good bet.</p> <p>Layton said he had seen a marked increase in traffic to websites where he plays and thus a rise in his income. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m thriving because of the pandemic, but one area of my life has gotten a little better,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, being self-employed is a huge benefit.\u201d</p> <p>The four US states with legal online poker sites \u2013 New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, and Pennsylvania \u2013 reported record revenues in March. Operators in New Jersey, for example, took in a combined $3,629,112 that month \u2013 an increase of 90.9% year over year, according to numbers reported by the <a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">New Jersey </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">division of </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">gaming </a><a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/pennsylvania-new-jersey-online-poker-revenues-set-records-2236300\">enforcement</a>, and more than double February\u2019s online poker revenue. </p> <p>With more time being spent at home, the number of people turning to online poker is increasing, said Donnie Peters, managing editor of online poker news site and forum <a href=\"https://www.pocketfives.com/\">PocketFives.com</a>. Meanwhile, in states like New Jersey and Nevada where gambling is big business, many avid poker players unable to go to casinos may be migrating online. According to the American Gaming Association, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/ncaabasketball/coronavirus-sports-betting.html\">trade group</a>, 987 of the US\u2019s 989 casinos were closed by early April to stop the spread of the coronavirus. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-betting-firms-to-stop-advertising-on-tv-and-radio-during-lockdown\">UK betting firms to stop advertising on TV and radio during lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Veteran players are making more money for two reasons, according to Peters. The influx of online players are generally newer to poker and more inexperienced, making it easier for professionals to win. And when the number of players increases, so does the pot \u2013 the money players wager.</p> <p>On Sunday, the online poker tournament GGPoker <a href=\"https://www.pocketfives.com/articles/sunday-majors-alex-foxen-wins-powerfest-big-game-for-239k-630553/\">beat its</a> $500,000 guarantee pot for the first time after 3,662 players joined. The recent WSOP.com Super Circuit Series, which was launched to replace a live event in Las Vegas, increased its prize money from $1.24m to $4m after a higher-than-expected turnout of players.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this means is that not only are those who make their income from poker able to do so more efficiently because they\u2019re playing against a larger population of weaker competition, but the money that can be won from online poker tournaments has grown,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIn short, professionals are able to win more money more often.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs unfortunate as a situation as this has been for so many, online poker is an industry that is flourishing right now,\u201d Peters said.</p> <p>But the rise in online gambling has also sparked concern. Those who already gambled online are doing so more often, a survey published in the UK on Friday found. Since the beginning of the Covid outbreak, 25% of gamblers said they were continuing to bet at least once a week while 28% had increased their activity,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/growth-in-problem-gambling-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\"> the survey showed</a>. This has worried anti-gambling advocates in the UK, who are calling for legislation to protect people from gambling their money away while on lockdown. UK betting firms have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-betting-firms-to-stop-advertising-on-tv-and-radio-during-lockdown\">stopped advertising</a> on TV and radio.</p> <p>No similar research has been published yet in the US, but advocates there too are calling on states to take measures. The anti-gambling group Stop Predatory Gambling on 20 April <a href=\"https://www.casino.org/news/anti-gambling-group-calls-on-state-lotteries-to-suspend-operations/\">called</a> on states to halt to state lotteries.</p> <p>Although there is no federal law banning online poker, regulations bar it most states and many online poker sites block users based on their computer location. So-called \u201csocial poker sites\u201d do not allow betting and thus are legal across the country. Instead of betting on each hand, users participate in sweepstakes and get cash prizes. One such site, National League of Poker, saw a 30%-50% increase in new players in March alone and a 131% increase in revenue, a spokesman said.</p> <p>Some worry that the restrictions on online poker sites may cause novice online gamblers to turn to unregulated and dangerous offshore poker sites. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has magnified this issue,\u201d said Jed Hoffman, who has been playing online poker for 12 years but does not play full-time. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t need right now, as individuals or as communities, is any more risk, especially at the precipice of a serious recession.\u201d</p> <p>Hoffman said he has noticed about four times as much activity in the past month on his go-to poker site, which is legal and based in Nevada. On Monday, he took home $4,259 in a tournament on Monday he only paid $75 to join.</p> <p>\u201cI do hope people stuck in lockdown don\u2019t injure themselves economically by playing too much or too high,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat is bad for society, and bad for the viability of long term growth in the online poker community.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>In the US, the <a href=\"https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/national-helpline-1-800-522-4700/\">National Problem Gambling Helpline</a> can be reached at 1-800-522-4700.

  "<p>\u201cWhen a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>Never can John Wyndham\u2019s opening lines from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/02/johnwyndham\">The Day of the Triffids</a> have been quite so apt. My friends in London tell me that the heart of the city, like other great conurbations all around the world, is eerily quiet. It is almost as if a neutron bomb has struck, removing in an instant all signs of human life, while leaving buildings, roads and other man-made artefacts perfectly intact.</p> \n<p>Yet the world\u2019s city centres are not completely silent. Rising like a tide of hope, from gardens, parks and open spaces, is a surge of sound: the individual songs of millions of birds coming together to create a very timely and welcome chorus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"51ff943f-e72a-405b-8587-54ef351d6bc2\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.</p>\n    <p>Around 55% of the world\u2019s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to&nbsp;68% by 2050. Nature\u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss,&nbsp;many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.<br></p>\n    <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.<br></p>\n    <p>In this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nothing quite marks the coming of spring more clearly than birdsong. From the start of the new year, as inch-by-inch, minute-by-minute, and hour-by-hour, the days get lighter and the promise of life\u2019s annual renewal becomes ever more a reality, so the volume, intensity and variety of birdsong increases. Now \u2013 at the end of April and beginning of May \u2013 it is reaching its peak.</p> \n<p>Yet for the eight out of 10 Britons who spend their lives in towns and cities, this annual crescendo can often pass them by. During my late twenties and early thirties, I lived in north London, during which time my few interactions with the natural world occurred when I got in my car and drove out to the Kent or Essex coast.</p> \n<p>If I neglected my birding fix for a few weeks, I might only realise that spring had arrived when \u2013 usually on a fine, sunny morning during the first week of May \u2013 a familiar sound would reach my ears. It was the screaming of swifts: those dark, scythe-shaped creatures that tear across the city skyline in noisy squadrons as if, I once noted, \u201cthey intended to pierce through the firmament to reach the heavens beyond\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ted Hughes also wrote of the swifts\u2019 annual return, which he greeted with the poetic equivalent of a sigh of relief:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>They\u2019ve made it again,<br>Which means the globe\u2019s still working, the Creation\u2019s<br>Still waking refreshed, our summer\u2019s<br>Still all to come \u2013</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This spring, for those living in cities in coronavirus-enforced lockdown right the way across the northern hemisphere, things are very different. Social media, newspapers and TV and radio programmes are alive with another kind of tweeting: the realisation that there is a parallel world out there. As if to mock us \u2013 but also very reassuringly \u2013 birds are simply getting on with what they always do at this time of year: finding a mate, defending a territory and beginning the long and risky process of raising a family.</p> \n<p>Finally, as if a veil has been lifted, people are noticing that \u2013 even in the heart of the so-called urban jungle \u2013 nature has found a place to live. We shouldn\u2019t really be surprised, as cities deliver everything that any wild creature needs: plenty of food (either deliberately or accidentally provided by us), water to drink and bathe, places to roost and breed, earlier springs caused by the \u201curban heat island effect\u201d and, most importantly of all, a huge variety of habitats squeezed into a small area, from woods to grasslands and rivers to ponds.</p> \n<p>Because of this, unlike more specialised biomes such as mountains and moors, heaths and ancient woodlands, our cities in the UK are home to a very diverse range of plants and animals. There are bats and badgers, foxes and fallow deer, orchids and otters; kittiwakes (an ocean-going seabird) nest on the Tyne Bridge in the centre of Newcastle; porpoises, dolphins and even the occasional whale swim up London\u2019s River Thames.</p> \n<p>Globally, city wildlife is doing rather well too. Red-tailed hawks \u2013 the North American equivalent of our buzzard \u2013 nest on the ledges of high-rise skyscrapers in New York; magnificent frigatebirds drift over the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, their outstretched wings mirroring his own pose; lesser kestrels \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s rarest birds of prey \u2013 gather above Seville\u2019s vast cathedral; and pied kingfishers hover like giant black-and-white butterflies over the River Nile in Cairo. All have found a niche where they can thrive in the heart of our cities.</p> \n<p>This is happening at a time when, in North America and western Europe \u2013 including Britain \u2013 what we think of as \u201cthe countryside\u201d is so intensively farmed that large swathes have become more or less wildlife-free zones. So rather than being surprised that we find wildlife in the heart of our cities, we should instead perhaps wonder why more of our wild creatures haven\u2019t moved in to take advantage of what\u2019s on offer.</p> \n<p>As well as the variety of species, another huge advantage of watching wildlife in a city is that it is almost always much tamer than in rural areas. I still recall, when I first moved down to Somerset from London, that I came across a fox taking a nap at the end of my garden. When it awoke, and noticed me, I expected it to behave like the streetwise city creatures I was used to, and simply go back to sleep. Instead, it stared back, its eyes full of fear, before leaping up and fleeing into the undergrowth.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/an-opportunity-to-experts-urge-us-to-take-a-closer-look-at-nature-aoe\">Look up, look down: experts urge us to take a closer look at the concrete jungle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Birds also behave very differently in cities. Normally shy waterbirds such as herons and kingfishers are so used to the constant stream of joggers, dog-walkers and commuters along canal and river towpaths that they usually stay put, so if you are patient you can often get great views.</p> \n<p>But until recently, many city-dwellers have always been in so much of a hurry that they have hardly given wildlife a second thought. Only now, when despite government restrictions most people are still able to escape the confines of their home for a short while each day, are they starting to notice what has been around them all along.</p> \n<p>So, how can you take advantage of being confined to your home and its immediate surroundings? For a start, you can follow the sage advice of my old friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/urban-birder-birdspotting-cities-david-lindo\">David Lindo \u2013 aka the Urban Birder</a> \u2013 and simply \u201clook up\u201d. You\u2019ll be amazed what birds fly over: from peregrines, which are now breeding on cathedrals and church towers in virtually every British city, to swifts (which should be arriving back right now), house martins \u2013 compact little bluish-black and white birds that look like miniature killer whales \u2013 and, in the capital at least, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/06/the-great-green-expansion-how-ring-necked-parakeets-took-over-london\">now-ubiquitous ring-necked parakeets</a>.</p> \n<p>Last year one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/white-tailed-eagles-southern-britain\">white-tailed eagles newly released on the Isle of Wight</a> went \u201cflyabout\u201d, and according to data from its radio transmitter passed all the way over London, without a single person noticing it. That\u2019s quite an achievement when, with a 2.5-metre (more than 8ft) wingspan, these birds look like flying barn doors.</p> \n<p>As part of your daily exercise regime, try seeking out hidden corners of natural habitat: places we built for ourselves with no thought for nature, but where wildlife has moved in. These sites range from disused railway lines to roadside verges, and gravel pits to churchyards. Even some official nature reserves \u2013 including many of those run by the London Wildlife Trust \u2013 are still accessible, because they are designated as public open spaces.</p> \n<p>As well as the advantage of less hustle, bustle and extraneous noise from traffic and aircraft, the skies are clearer too, because air pollution has fallen dramatically. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/20/nature-is-taking-back-venice-wildlife-returns-to-tourist-free-city\">Venice, the canals are clear and blue for the first time in decades</a>, allowing fish and birds to thrive. The next step might be to cut light pollution at night: leaving lights blazing in empty offices and other commercial buildings is not only wasteful, but helps drive the climate crisis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/22/light-pollution-insect-apocalypse\">It also seriously impacts wildlife</a>, especially moths, bats and migrating birds, which can get disoriented by artificial light sources as they travel by night.</p> \n<p>Although many wild creatures have found a home in our cities, some have had to make compromises in order to do so. A 2009 study by scientists at Aberystwyth University revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/03/great-tit-city-bird-song\">urban great tits now sing at a higher pitch</a> than their country cousins, in order to make themselves heard above the traffic.</p> \n<p>But wouldn\u2019t it be better if they did not have to adapt and compromise? Terrible and frightening though it is, at least the current crisis has allowed us to glimpse \u2013 for a few weeks at least \u2013 just how different our cities could be in a carbon-neutral world.</p> \n<p>My fear is that once the horror is all over, and things return to some kind of normal, we will simply ignore the lessons we learned during these atypical few weeks and months. Or might we remember how wonderful it was to wake up to an urban dawn chorus, uncluttered by extraneous noise? If so, are we prepared to make the dramatic changes to our lifestyles, and to the structure and workings of our cities, which urban wildlife needs if it is to thrive?</p> \n<p>And if, as a result of these changes, every day of the week sounds like a Sunday, will we not all benefit?</p> \n<p><em>Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author born and raised in London, but now living in rural Somerset.

  "<p>If any company can weather coronavirus well, it should be Deliveroo. The early days of lockdown saw demand surge for the service delivering food from restaurants and takeaways. The decision by several major restaurant and fast-food chains to shut for weeks during the early stages of lockdown might have dented demand, but as they begin to reopen for delivery \u2013 with most other activities still curtailed \u2013 prospects would seem bright for the tech company.</p> <p>The reality looks quite different. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/28/deliveroo-let-go-300-staff/\">Deliveroo was reported</a> to be cutting 367 jobs (and furloughing 50 more) from its workforce of 2,500. Others seem to be in similarly bleak positions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/uber-discusses-plan-to-lay-off-about-20-of-employees?utm_content=textcta&amp;utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;utm_content=1002071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1000266\">Uber is said</a> to be discussing plans to let go around 20% of its workforce, some 5,400 roles. The broader UK start-up scene has asked for \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d8b56d5-afe3-4341-9484-97c455e5433f\">and secured</a> \u2013 government bailout funds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What pushes this beyond a tale that many of us might be happy to write down to karma, though, is the effects it has well beyond the rest of the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why Deliveroo is struggling during a crisis that should benefit its business model tells us about much more than just one start-up. The company\u2019s nominal reasoning for needing cuts is that coronavirus will be followed by an economic downturn, which could hit orders. That\u2019s plausible, but far from a given.</p> <p>The financial crash of 2008 \u2013 which led to the most severe recession since the Great Depression \u2013 saw \u201ccheap luxuries\u201d perform quite well. People would swap a restaurant meal for, say, a \u00a310 Marks &amp; Spencer meal deal. Deliveroo is far cheaper than a restaurant meal for many people \u2013 there\u2019s no need to pay for a childminder, or travel, and there\u2019s no need to purchase alcohol at restaurant prices. Why would Deliveroo be so certain a downturn would be bad news?</p> <p>The answer lies in the fact that Deliveroo\u2019s real business model has almost nothing to do with making money from delivering food. Like pretty much every other start-up of its sort, once you take all of the costs into account, Deliveroo loses money on every single delivery it makes, even after taking a big cut from the restaurant and a delivery fee from the customer. Uber, now more than a decade old, still loses money for every ride its service offers and every meal its couriers deliver.</p> <p>When every customer loses you money, it\u2019s not good news for your business if customer numbers stay solid or even increase, unless there\u2019s someone else who believes that\u2019s a good thing. What these companies rely on is telling a story \u2013 largely to people who will invest in them. Their narrative is they\u2019re \u201cdisrupting\u201d existing industries, will build huge market share and customer bases, and thus can\u2019t help but eventually become hugely profitable \u2013 just not yet.</p> <p>This is the entire venture capital model \u2013 the financial model for Silicon Valley and the whole technology sector beyond it. Don\u2019t worry about growing slowly and sustainably, don\u2019t worry about profit, don\u2019t worry about consequences. Just go flat out, hell for leather, and get as big as you can as fast as you can. It doesn\u2019t matter that most companies will try and fail, provided a few succeed. Valuations will soar, the company will become publicly listed (a procedure known as an IPO) and then the company will either actually work out how to make profit \u2013 in which case, great \u2013 or by the time it\u2019s clear it won\u2019t, the venture capital funds have sold most of their stake at vast profits, and left regular investors holding the stock when the music stops.</p> <p>This is a whole business model based on optimism. Without that optimism, and the accompanying free-flowing money to power through astronomical losses, the entire system breaks down. That\u2019s the real struggle facing this type of company. It\u2019s also why the very idea of bailing out this sector should be a joke: venture capital chases returns of at 10 times their investment, on the basis that it\u2019s high risk and high reward. If we take out the element of \u201crisk\u201d, we\u2019re basically just funnelling public money to make ultra-rich investors richer.</p> <p>What pushes this beyond a tale that many of us might be happy to write down to karma, though, is the effects it has well beyond the rest of the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/deliveroo-driver-coronavirus-help-contract-government-hardship-fund\">I'm a delivery rider with suspected coronavirus.

They offer a new, subsidised alternative, that makes customers believe a service can be delivered much more cheaply, or that lets them cherry-pick from the restaurant experience \u2013 many restaurants relied on those alcohol sales with a meal to cover their margins, for example.</p> <p>These start-ups come in to existing sectors essentially offering customers free money: \u00a310 worth of stuff for a fiver. It turns out that\u2019s easy to sell. But in the process, they rip the core out of existing businesses and reshape whole sectors of the economy in their image. And now, in the face of a pandemic, they are starting to struggle just like everyone else. It\u2019s not hard to see how this sorry story ends. Having disrupted their industries to the point of leaving business after business on the verge of collapse, the start-ups could be tumbling down after them.</p> <p>\u2022 James Ball is the global editor at the <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/\">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a></p>",

F1 feels it needs to be clear that everybody in the paddock environment is testing negative.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood the sport will be paying to perform the testing and would be sourcing the required equipment privately from specific companies that are not supplying to the health service.</p> <p>Governments will require evidence of race personnel testing negative before allowing entry for the foreseeable future. Austria already has such a stipulation and that tests should be not be more than four days old.</p> <p>The scale of testing will be extensive. F1 teams are still expected to take around 80 staff each, meaning 800 across the grid. All others required to travel to a race will be tested, including broadcasters, F1 personnel and logistical staff, likely to add at least a further 200.</p> <p>Pringle also warned that there was no guarantee the British Grand Prix would go ahead even behind closed doors. It was, he said \u201cnot a given\u201d. The ultimate decision was still subject to national restrictions caused by the coronavirus. F1 remains in discussion with the government regarding the race. \u201cI\u2019m confident we could operate well within F1\u2019s decision-making cycle,\u201d he said of the circuit\u2019s preparations. \u201cThey are the ones who have got to make the decision.\u201d</p> <p>Pringle dismissed suggestions that Silverstone could host a race in the reverse direction for double-header meetings. Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc recently expressed his excitement at the possibility of driving Silverstone in the anticlockwise direction. However, with the runoff areas and exit access points all designed for clockwise racing, it would be impossible to adjust the track in time. \u201cIt certainly wouldn\u2019t comply to the current safety standards,\u201d said Pringle. \u201cThey would have to lower the standards which would be unlikely or we would have to do a load of work which would not be practical in the current climate.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/24/mclarens-zak-brown-accuses-ferrari-of-living-in-denial-over-f1-budget-cap\">McLaren's Zak Brown accuses Ferrari of 'living in denial' over F1 finances</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hungarian Grand Prix, scheduled for 2 August, will also take place behind closed doors.

One patient might have his or her sinuses probed by a swab at a drive-thru, while another might spit in a tube at home and another give a blood sample at a clinic.</p> <p>Each test has a different degree of reliability, with different amounts of time and labor required to complete the boomerang curve of sample collection to testing to result report.</p> <p>\u201cWe have too many [brands of] tests, and now there are a lot of people who are committed to their tests and they run their tests on their platforms,\u201d said Paul Reider, a renowned research chemist in the pharmaceuticals industry who teaches at Princeton University.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>We have too many [brands of] tests, and now there are a lot of people who are committed to their tests</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Reider, Princeton University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we had an effective administration \u2013 this is where the federal government comes in \u2013 they could essentially turn around and say, \u2018What we would like to do is, we want one test, maybe two, that are fast, that are accurate, that are scalable and transferable, .</p> <p>\u201cYou want a gold-standard test.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, regulatory and administrative hurdles are everywhere, with clinics unable to send samples to private labs that might be out of their usual networks, a lack of protocols for reporting testing data, slow regulatory approval for the use of alternative testing materials, insufficient federal funding to support lab efforts and no central leadership steering the country\u2019s massive laboratory apparatus.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a system that\u2019s ever been built for surveillance, for wide-scale population surveillance or wide-scale testing for people who aren\u2019t presenting to the hospital or the clinic,\u201d said Mina. \u201cThe demand is just so much larger than our system was built for.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump administration\u2019s response to this complicated thicket has been to declare the federal government a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/white-house-releases-state-guidelines-on-coronavirus-testing/index.html\">supplier of last resort</a>\u201d and wish the states luck. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cThey have tremendous capacity.

Early on in the crisis, Color, a private healthcare institute that does genomic testing in California, resolved to stand up a mega-lab that is now on the verge of processing 10,000 tests a day, with a goal of expanding that capacity by an order of magnitude, said Othman Laraki, CEO.</p> <p>The company has since partnered with the city of San Francisco to provide Covid-19 testing for all private-sector and nonprofit essential employees, as well as any resident with symptoms who cannot find testing elsewhere.

They can have a picnic, shop for non-essential items, and the distance they can travel has also been extended. Some national parks are also open. Meanwhile the Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, confirmed that as of midnight Sunday, extra restrictions in the north-west of the state, put in place following clusters of the virus in two hospitals, will be removed. On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/well-feel-a-bit-more-human-australians-welcome-partial-lift-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">NSW partially relaxed its restrictions so that up to two adults (and any dependent children) can visit any other household</a>.</p> \n<p>While restrictions have eased elsewhere in Australia, they remain in place in Victoria. There are only four reasons for people in the state to leave their home: food and supplies, medical care and care giving, exercise, and work or education. Two further meetings of national cabinet are scheduled next week, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/morrison-says-early-mark-of-eased-restrictions-depends-on-uptake-of-covidsafe-tracing-app\">leaders to decide on Friday how federal restrictions can be eased</a>.

  "<p>My sister is a junior doctor in a big hospital. I don\u2019t have much to say about how work has been for her during the coronavirus pandemic, because she tells me nothing about it. Or, to be more specific, she tells me things are \u201cfine\u201d. This is how things are with us. I\u2019ve always held out my problems for all to see, dumping them on friends and any poor sod who happens to sit next to me on the train, like a dog presenting its latest kill from the garden. But my sister operates in a lower key, as my parents and I discovered when she casually mentioned one night in her early 20s that she had been held up at gunpoint a year or so ago. She hadn\u2019t thought to tell any of us at the time, because she didn\u2019t want to worry people and, honestly, she was fine.</p> <p>So I don\u2019t hear much about the goings on at hospital from her, but I don\u2019t really have to: I read about them in my newspaper every morning. Even aside from the whole global plague situation, which would be a big enough portion on any doctor\u2019s plate, there are the now notoriously dwindling supplies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-ppe-shortage-doctors-face-hard-decisions-on-whether-to-treat-patients\" title=\"\">of personal protective equipment</a>, or PPE. I\u2019d previously thought PPE was merely an acronym for Politics, Philosophy and Economics, one of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain\" title=\"\">weird Oxford degrees</a> studied by people who fantasise about running Britain one day.</p> <p>And perhaps that\u2019s what the people who run Britain thought, too, because they were rather cavalier about our supplies: we don\u2019t need any more PPE \u2013 we\u2019re already chock-full of those degrees!

This is not a choice those of us who are related to healthcare workers can make for them, as much as we would like to.</p> <p>So what do we do, aside from lying awake at 3am, wide-eyed with the effort of trying not to think about worst-case scenarios? There are the rainbow paintings, of course, which my children duly made in the early days of lockdown and we hung in the front window, their aunt\u2019s name written in the sky. And there\u2019s the clapping \u2013 oh, the clapping. The first two weeks I enjoyed it, for the collective experience and the chance to check my neighbours are all OK. But as the news from hospitals has worsened, it has felt increasingly and pointlessly performative, something we all do because we don\u2019t know what the hell else to do. </p> <p>Maybe there is something more we can do, besides tweeting photos of ourselves applauding on our front steps. Wide awake at night, I often think of certain women, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/07/iraq.military\" title=\"\">Rose Gentle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/18/michael-fallon-apologises-family-dead-soldier-snatch-land-rover-delays\" title=\"\">Susan Smith</a>. You may not recognise their names, but they were a frequent presence in the media in the early years of this century. They lost sons in the Iraq war because, they said, the Ministry of Defence had failed to provide the British army with sufficient equipment. The Chilcot report later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/mod-left-uk-forces-in-iraq-ill-equipped-amid-lack-of-plan-chilcot-report-says\" title=\"\">backed them up</a>, saying that the armed forces had been put in danger due to \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d preparation, and the families successfully sued the MoD.</p> <p>Is that where all this will end? Because anyone with a brain can see that this is a scandal unfolding in real time, and that where the government neglected one public sector, it is now neglecting another. Some 179 British servicemen were killed<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10637526\" title=\"\"> in the invasion of Iraq</a>; we have already lost more than half that in the NHS \u2013 and doctors, unlike soldiers, are not called upon to risk death to do their job. Already the letters pages of newspapers are filled with messages from desperate families, terrified for relatives who went into healthcare in order to help others. And it\u2019s up to the families \u2013 us, me \u2013 to speak for them, given that NHS workers are being warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\" title=\"\">by their employers not to speak to the media</a>.</p> <p>And so we stay at home, full of anxiety, knowing that whatever fears we have are nothing compared with what our relatives are going through on their daily rounds in hospital. We read the newspapers, and in our heads we are being ever so brave, proud of the risks our closest family members are taking. But in our hearts we desperately try to shut out the truth, and momentarily kid ourselves into believing our sisters, brothers, parents, children when they tell us that, honestly, everything\u2019s fine.</p>",

The Covid-19 outbreak has opened another chapter.</p> <p>After seven weeks in the slaughterhouses of Chicago, the journalist Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, a 1906 novel which described the grim conditions inside. \u201cThere were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit,\u201d Sinclair wrote.</p> <p>The novel created a media frenzy and prompted the US government to investigate the industry. A wave of consumer protection laws followed.</p> <p>But these improvements masked the intent of Sinclair\u2019s novel: to highlight the exploitation of immigrant labor and unchecked greed. Sinclair famously declared: \u201cI aimed for the public\u2019s heart and by accident hit it in the stomach.\u201d</p> <p>Advanced industrialization and globalization after the second world war exacerbated the exploitation of workers. Instead of the Eastern European immigrants who staffed slaughterhouses at the turn of the century, by the 1970s these factories were filled with workers escaping conflict in South America and Asia. Production grew exponentially and labor unions lost power. Advances in worker safety could not keep up and today, working in a processing plant remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/05/amputations-serious-injuries-us-meat-industry-plant\">one of the most dangerous jobs in the country</a>.</p> <p>The plight of Central American migrants in the meat industry was drawn into sharp focus last year when the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement agency (Ice) carried out its largest raid in years on four poultry facilities in Mississippi. They arrested <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/us/mississippi-immigration-raids-children/index.html\">680 undocumented workers</a> but none of the companies, which included the multibillion dollar Koch Foods, faced any charges over employment practices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"224a626b5acd7fb0fb47e6856869b8b7ba3062cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/224a626b5acd7fb0fb47e6856869b8b7ba3062cf/0_276_3550_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poultry workers inside a Fieldale Farms chicken processing plant in Gainesville, Georgia, USA, 27 April 2020.

  "<p>The world was under lockdown and I was playing at being an outlaw. From the comfort of my sofa, I traversed alligator-infested swamps, skinned beavers and made a poultice from herbs. The video game was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar\">Red Dead Redemption 2</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar\">,</a> a simulation of the rural American midwest, where the player is free to roam through a fictional ecology. During the many hours I spent playing the game, it became clear to me that this wasn\u2019t just an escape from reality, but its inversion. The nature I was consuming on screen \u2013 a vibrant landscape that existed to be mastered, harvested and utilised for human gain \u2013 was the opposite to what existed outside: a landscape shuttered by a zoonotic virus that showed how exploitation of the environment, whether through profit-driven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/is-factory-farming-to-blame-for-coronavirus\">factory farming</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/halt-destruction-nature-worse-pandemics-top-scientists\">deforestation</a>, could eventually return to master us. </p> <p>A few pages into his book <em>Natural, </em>Alan Levinovitz identifies this contradiction: \u201cAgain and again, the question of our proper relationship with nature is reframed in the same way: should we obey nature, or transcend it?\u201d What Levinovitz, an associate professor of religion, calls \u201cnatural goodness\u201d is all around us, from food packaging to \u201cclean eating\u201d documented on Instagram, to the belief that natural detergents are better than their artificial equivalents, to an unthinking dichotomy between urban (artificial) and rural (natural). It\u2019s a logic often suffused with religious piety: clean, good, natural things are contrasted with the unclean and unnatural, mass-produced and industrial.

Nature \u201csounds great in theory, but in practice it\u2019s a mercenary ethic that anyone can hire to fight for their cause\u201d. Natural theologians saw in nature an order and hierarchy closely related to the existing distribution of political power and private property, transforming the cruel \u201cis\u201d of nature into the prescriptive \u201cought\u201d of politics and religion \u2013 often with dangerous effects. But the pursuit of what is deemed \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cpure\u201d is also associated with class privilege, as when middle-class parents who refuse to vaccinate their children perceive that vaccines are unnatural interventions. \u201cWe have a God-given immune system\u201d, one anti-vaxxing mother told the sociologist Jennifer Reich (this argument was notably absent in discussions of herd immunity).</p> <p>The idea of nature as a moral teacher was famously elaborated by thinkers such as William Wordsworth, Henry Thoreau and John Muir, who believed that by appreciating nature we could become better people, or make better decisions about how to live.<strong> </strong>The idea of nature-as-teacher still persists \u2013 one example of this is the popularity of \u201cnatural births\u201d among prospective parents. The value of a \u201cnatural birth\u201d has become a kind of disciplinary myth that encourages women to endure the volatile, individual, painful experience of childbirth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/04/i-asked-three-times-for-an-epidural-why-are-women-being-denied-pain-relief\">without epidurals or pain relief</a>. An array of bestselling books proffer this divine narrative of childbirth, where biology and theology are wound together in opposition to the sterilised context of the modern hospital.</p> <p>A common argument among advocates of natural birth is that having babies was less dangerous in the past \u2013 they just slipped out. The epitome of this illusion is a viral video, viewed over 79m times, of a 39-year-old Utah doula giving birth in an isolated creek in an Australian rainforest; she wanted to have her baby \u201cin the wild\u201d. As Levinovitz rightly notes, the idea of \u201cnatural\u201d childbirth contains the seed of an imagined \u201cprimitive\u201d population \u2013 where \u201cindigenous\u201d births are thought of as easier and more authentic than their medicalised alternative, their mothers more resistant to pain. Yet tales of \u201cpainless parturition\u201d were historically used as a convenient justification for colonial atrocities. In its fervour for natural births, the western birthing establishment bears the imprint of this retrograde thinking, and takes for granted the importance of medical services that not all women can access.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc1cb3ab5b6b3d711c39131805ed71c65070ab22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc1cb3ab5b6b3d711c39131805ed71c65070ab22/0_0_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The value of a \u2018natural birth\u2019 has become a kind of disciplinary myth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The value of a \u2018natural birth\u2019 has become a kind of disciplinary myth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Searching for moral teaching in nature leads one to questionable principles. But it\u2019s also futile. When Timothy Treadwell, the bear lover and activist documented in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/03/1\">Werner Herzog\u2019s documentary </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/03/1\">Grizzly Man</a>, </em>spent a decade cultivating relationships with bears in Alaska\u2019s Katmai national park, he met an unfortunate end: Treadwell was devoured by the bears, his partially eaten corpse discovered by rangers. \u201cWhat haunts me,\u201d Herzog intoned during the film, \u201cis that in all the faces of the bears that Treadwell filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy \u2026 I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature.\u201d If you stare at nature hoping for answers, nothing stares back.</p> <p>Levinovitz concedes that he is fascinated by the question of whether our \u201chunter gatherers had it better\u201d, which leads him to spend time with a Peruvian indigenous group. Confirming his suspicion that the line between nature and artifice is impossible to draw, he finds that the group<strong> </strong>exists after all in the modern<strong> </strong>world \u2013 they even use cell phones. This visit is the book\u2019s weakest point, and reads like an excerpt from an undergraduate anthropology essay. On his quest to challenge the distinction between natural and non-natural, Levinovitz himself identifies a faultline between the supposedly more \u201cnatural\u201d group and the \u201cborrowed\u201d technologies they use, including metal axes and plastic containers. He doesn\u2019t ask whether the Peruvians themselves subscribe to a division between nature and modernity.</p> <p>Levinovitz gallops through many examples of the natural-equals-goodness association, from bitcoin enthusiasts to bodybuilders. His concluding call is to embrace an idea of nature that is less steadfast and monotheistic \u2013 one founded on the admission of \u201cphilosophical confusion\u201d, where the criteria for goodness depends on context. This is a useful corrective to lazy thinking: \u201cNaturalness is a continuum, and it can be very difficult to decide where something exists on that continuum,\u201d he concludes. Yet debates about the intrinsic value of nature or what can be called \u201cnatural\u201d fail to engage effectively with the more pressing issue of the climate crisis, and feel oddly ahistorical.

The refugees on board, who were fleeing desperate conditions in camps in Bangladesh, had attempted to reach Malaysia but appear to have been turned away. Bangladesh has also said it will not allow the boats to dock.</p> <p>Mohammed, a father who has lived in the camps in Bangladesh since 2017, when more than 700,000 Rohingya fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar, believes his 13-year-old son is among those stranded. His son went missing 51 days ago, but later phoned to say that he would be taking a boat with friends to Malaysia.</p> <p>Mohammed has since seen a video, shared on Facebook, in which he recognised his son onboard a packed boat. \u201cHe looked hungry and he had become very thin,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cThere is no way to get information about the boat. Whether he is alive or not is totally unknown.\u201d</p> <p>After two and a half years living in the sprawling camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where about 1 million Rohingya refugees are sheltering, Mohammed said he believes his son had become desperate. \u201cHe cannot access education here in the camp. There are no jobs, there\u2019s no available income here for our boys,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He had not known that his son planned to make the journey, he added.</p> <p>Mohib Ullah, chairman of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights, a community group, said he was aware of at least 20 families who were missing relatives. \u201cEvery day families are coming and crying in my office,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are people of the camp, so they have a right to return to the camp.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/05/rohingya-demand-role-in-running-camps-and-tell-ngos-stop-ignoring-us-bangladesh-cox-bazar\">Stop ignoring us: Rohingya refugees demand role in running camps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among those fearing for their loved ones is Razaul, who believes his brother, his sister-in-law and their two children, aged six and eight, are also at sea.

  "<p>\u201cI have gone from five years of continuous injuries to five years with almost nothing,\u201d says Katie Rood. The change? In 2015 the New Zealand international and Lewes forward switched to a vegan diet. \u201cThe longest injury I\u2019ve had since then was three weeks out with a hamstring earlier this season,\u201d she remarks.</p> <p>\u201cIt blew me away. I thought I was going to feel depleted and sick. I used to finish a game on a Sunday and have a heat pack on my shoulder, ice packs on my ankles, I\u2019d wake up on Monday feeling like a zombie. Getting out of bed was a struggle. Fast forward to two weeks after giving up meat, dairy, eggs and I was leaping out of bed. I felt two inches taller. I realised how inflamed I was everywhere, and that inflammation was gone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/fifa-says-1bn-investment-in-womens-football-will-not-be-cut\">Fifa says planned \u00a3800m investment in women's football will not be cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The effect on her ability to recover fast had an effect on the pitch. \u201cBecause I could recover quicker I could train harder. So I started hitting the gym really hard and got so much stronger, which made me faster, which made me make better decisions on the pitch because I was fitter. It helped everything.\u201d</p> <p>It is fitting that when we first talk, pre-isolation, and discuss the merits of veganism we do so in a vegetarian and vegan restaurant where the food is so inventive that you can wholeheartedly buy into the absence of meat. The menu contrasts starkly with Rood\u2019s experience growing up, when she felt, as an aspiring athlete, trapped by a belief that meat and dairy were vital to a healthy diet.</p> <p>\u201cWe grew up surrounded by animals, and I loved every single one of them,\u201d she says. \u201cI never wanted to eat them. My mum used to cut up my meat and hide it under my vegetables and stuff. It didn\u2019t occur to them that it was healthy for me not to be [eating meat] because I wanted to be an athlete as well. It just got reiterated from such a young age that if you want to be an athlete you need to eat these animals, drink your milk, get your calcium and things like that. I struggled with it a lot.\u201d</p> <p>The film Earthlings, which explores the use of animals as pets, for science, for clothing and for food and is narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, triggered change quite brutally. \u201cIt ripped me apart to realise that I had been contributing to that. It destroyed me. From then I was like: \u2018OK, no more eating animals; it\u2019s cool, I can do that.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94c4f2718d3ce002ea1038d1887601eb9eb6883\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94c4f2718d3ce002ea1038d1887601eb9eb6883/0_111_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Rood in action for Lewes against Arsenal in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Rood in action for Lewes against Arsenal in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Ellis/TGS Photo/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as benefiting physically, Rood found the psychological effect was massive. It made her question and reassess the world, society and its constructs. \u201cIf I\u2019ve been told that I need meat and milk to be a healthy athlete and I\u2019ve found the complete opposite to be true then what else have I been lied to about? And why don\u2019t we know this?\u201d</p> <p>Rood has embraced the example she can set as one of an increasing number of vegan athletes. She determined not to be preachy but says: \u201cThat\u2019s been a journey in and of itself, learning how to communicate with people on it, because it\u2019s a sensitive subject.\u201d</p> <p>When the subject is raised of how she, as an environmentalist, justifies flying around the world for her club football or for the New Zealand national team, a slightly pained expression tells of the battle that rages within her. \u201cI try use my platform as much as possible to bring awareness and help people realise and change positively for the environment.\u201d She knows she is justifying it and she does make sacrifices \u2013 she remained in England over Christmas \u2013 but tries to think bigger picture with football. \u201cObviously the better I do with the national team the better the profile I have. It\u2019s a constant battle though. I always thought football would be a vehicle to see the world and now it\u2019s my vehicle to try and save the world.\u201d</p> <p>Constantly grappling for solutions, she wonders whether clubs could commit to creating a \u201cfootball forest\u201d by planting trees to offset their flight emissions.</p> <p>A desire to be an active participant in changing things drew her towards the Extinction Rebellion protests. \u201cIt turned out to be a life-changing experience,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was one of the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever participated in. Within minutes they had set up whole communities in the streets in London.\u201d</p> <p>She is proud of what it has achieved, the way it has changed the narrative around climate change. \u201cIt was full-on. It made a difference right? We weren\u2019t really talking about climate change beforehand. It\u2019s a start.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ad8dffd0dfc2edd6a746352c8af059d465b2d9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ad8dffd0dfc2edd6a746352c8af059d465b2d9e/0_0_7149_4767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Rood says the Extinction Rebellion protests were \u2018a life-changing experience\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Rood says the Extinction Rebellion protests were \u2018a life-changing experience\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adapting to isolation has been hard, she says, in a catch-up. Stuck in England, Rood has constructed a makeshift gym and garden pitch to try to maintain some level of training.</p> <p>The harder part, she says, with Covid-19 and Sars apparently having some connection to markets where live and dead animals are sold, is that such pandemics may have stemmed from human exploitation of animals.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring that up as a discussion point in a way that\u2019s really sensitive and understanding of the grief and trauma and stress that people are under. So mostly I\u2019ve kept quiet about that, it\u2019s not really the time or place, but I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re ever going to find a better one. It would maybe be too much of a stretch to say it doesn\u2019t happen in a world where we don\u2019t eat animals but I think the key is that this crisis was predicted and more are predicted if we continue to eat and treat animals the way that we do.</p> <p>\u201cWe create the perfect environment for diseases in the way we treat animals. It\u2019s a hard one to discuss with people but hopefully I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is has also made her reflect on possible changes to the relationship between society and nature. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be quite profound in that a lot of people are connecting with nature for the first time, or the first time in a while, and in a way in which they haven\u2019t before and that\u2019s exciting and powerful,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou see the images of people in India seeing the Himalayas for the first time from their cities because the smog has pretty much lifted. Imagine waking up one day and being able to see the greatest mountain range on earth and realising that it\u2019s because of human activity that you couldn\u2019t?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s got to be a pretty heavy shift for a lot of people. I don\u2019t think you can deny things like that. This is happening all across the globe where we\u2019re seeing air pollution disperse. I\u2019m not entirely sure how that will manifest but I hope it connects people, organisations and our day-to-day actions to the environment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Few readers will come to Emily St John Mandel\u2019s fifth novel, <em>The Glass Hotel</em>, unaware of her fourth, 2014\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel\">Station Eleven</a></em>, which imagined a world ravaged by a hyper-lethal form of swine flu. That book was always going to cast a shadow over its successor \u2013 such is the curse of a career-defining blockbuster<em>. </em>But as we face Covid-19, the strange, masochistic allure of havoc-lit has catapulted Mandel\u2019s post-pandemic tale of itinerant Shakespearean actors back into bestseller territory. How better to while away a stint in lockdown than by bending our waking terrors into the most comforting and redemptive of shapes \u2013 the narrative arc<em>.</em></p> <p>A handful of quietly placed clues suggest that <em>The Glass Hotel</em> exists in the same universe as <em>Station Eleven, </em>in a time before the outbreak. The \u201cGeorgia Flu\u201d is lurking, but we will never learn if it is days, months, or a year away. Mandel has not penned a ticking-clock prequel; rather, her new novel is a portrait of everyday obliviousness, the machinery of late neoliberalism juddering along with characteristic inequity. This is a tale of Ponzi schemes, not pestilence.</p> <p>New York financier Jonathan Alkaitis carries himself with \u201cthe tedious confidence of all people with money ... the breezy assumption that no serious harm could come to him\u201d. He\u2019s the owner of the book\u2019s titular hotel, a surreal monolith planted on the northernmost tip of Canada\u2019s Vancouver Island, accessible only by boat. It\u2019s a pocket of \u201cwilderness-adjacent\u201d extravagance for aspiring plutocrats; an \u201cimprobable palace\u201d in that borderless nation, the \u201cKingdom of Money\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b4005b67e92b3fe6e1fd5c5fdd19aaceb7957b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b4005b67e92b3fe6e1fd5c5fdd19aaceb7957b7/0_187_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily St John Mandel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily St John Mandel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike McGregor/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mixing cocktails in the hotel bar is directionless Vincent, a young woman marking time in her remote hometown, a stifling place with one road and \u201ctwo dead ends\u201d. Her best friend drives the hotel boat; her brother, Paul \u2013 aspiring composer, recovering addict \u2013 sweeps the floors. Vincent has a \u201cvery particular gift\u201d: she\u2019s a lithe social chameleon. When newly widowed Alkaitis orders a drink, Vincent is who he needs her to be. Alkaitis then requests her companionship in exchange for \u201cthe freedom to stop thinking about money\u201d. The keys to the kingdom are hers, but not for long. The time of plummeting stock prices and collapsing banks is near.</p> <p>The future is restless in <em>The Glass Hotel</em>, impatient and insistent: it interrupts the present to tether consequences to actions, ends to beginnings. Alkaitis, we learn, will die in prison; Vincent will drown. What are we to make of these future echoes? They are not warnings it seems, but hauntings. \u201cThere are so many ways to haunt a person,\u201d Mandel writes, \u201cor a life.\u201d <em>The Glass Hotel</em> is crowded with phantoms: lost mothers; wronged victims; a \u201cghost fleet\u201d of empty container ships; a beyond-the-grave curse scrawled in acid. In his medium-security cell, unrepentant Alkaitis conjures a spectral \u201ccounterlife\u201d so intoxicating the real world loses form, a luxurious dreamscape with no extradition treaty.</p> <p>It\u2019s a beguiling conceit: the global financial crisis as a ghost story. As one of Alkaitis\u2019s employees reflects of a swindled investor: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that she was about to lose everything, it was that she had already lost everything and just didn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d But Mandel\u2019s abiding literary fascination is even more elemental: isn\u2019t every moment \u2013 coiled with possibilities \u2013 its own ghost story? Isn\u2019t every life a counterlife?</p> <p>Like Joshua Ferris\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\">And Then We Came to the End</a></em>, a central section of <em>The Glass Hotel</em> is voiced by a collective workplace \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 a mea culpa chorus of Alkaitis\u2019s underlings. \u201cWe had crossed a line, that much was obvious,\u201d they tell us, \u201cbut it was difficult to say later exactly where that line had been.\u201d Mandel is not interested in righteous outrage, she\u2019s interested in that illusory line, how it is possible \u201cto both know and not know something\u201d. But there\u2019s a hallucinatory, fairy-dust sheen to <em>The Glass Hotel </em>that<em> </em>makes the real world cruelties of 2008 feel as remote and otherworldly as the transparently symbolic (and symbolically transparent) hotel. Here is a realm of kingdoms, palaces, and \u201cthe shadowlands\u201d, which is how Mandel characterises American poverty: \u201ca country located at the edge of an abyss ... a territory without comfort or room for error\u201d. The language of allegory can illuminate, but it can also be a form of camouflage. It does both in this novel.</p> <p>With its shattered narrative, the joys of <em>The Glass Hotel</em> are participatory: piecing together the connections and intersections of Mandel\u2019s human cartography, a treasure map ripped to pieces. But it is as a spectral sequel to <em>Station Eleven</em> that <em>The Glass Hotel</em> stumbles into poignance, as pre-pandemic fiction. All contemporary novels are now pre-pandemic novels \u2013 Covid-19 has scored a line across our culture \u2013 but what Mandel captures is the last blissful gasp of complacency, a knowing portrait of the end of unknowing. It\u2019s the world we inhabited mere weeks ago, and it still feels so tantalisingly close; our ache for it still too raw to be described as nostalgia. \u201cDo you find yourself sort of secretly hoping that civilisation collapses ... Just so that something will happen?\u201d a friend asks Vincent. Oh, for the freedom of that kind of reckless yearning.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Glass Hotel is published by Picador in ebook and audio on 30 April</em><em> and hardback on 6 August.</em><br><br></p>",

People are dying so fast,\u201d Warsame said.</p> <p>On the island of Bali, an entire hamlet has been locked down after rapid testing showed hundreds of residents were probably infected, <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/05/01/bali-hamlet-put-under-lockdown-after-tests-indicate-over-400-people-reactive-to-virus.html\">the Jakarta Post</a> reported. Out of 1,200 initial tests, 400 returned a reactive result; authorities will follow up with swab tests to confirm infection rates.</p> <p>Increasingly intense efforts to stop the spread of the disease have raised concerns about human rights and civil liberties. Malaysia has been criticised by the UN after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/malaysia-cites-covid-19-for-rounding-up-hundreds-of-migrants\">detaining hundreds of undocumented migrants</a>, including young children and Rohingya refugees, as part of its efforts to contain coronavirus.</p> <p>The UN said the arrests could push vulnerable groups into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment, and warned that overcrowded detention centres carried a high risk of increasing the virus\u2019s spread.</p> <p>Privacy advocates in India have also attacked a government order that all public and private sector employees should use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app, as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.</p> <p>Critics warn that it is unclear how the data will be used. They stress India lacks privacy laws to govern the app. New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.</p> <p>Worldwide there are now 3.4 million cases of coronavirus and more than 238,000 deaths, although many countries that have passed the peak of their infections are now working on relaxing their lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>Singapore\u2019s health minister said on Saturday that it will start easing some curbs after a second wave of the coronavirus concentrated in the state\u2019s crowded migrant worker dormitories appeared to subside, with some students allowed back to school later this month.</p> <p>In Spain on Saturday adults were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fear-tempers-relief-in-madrid-as-spain-begins-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdown\">allowed out to exercise</a> for the first time since March; as the country goes back to work, the government has made facemasks compulsory on buses, tubes and trains. Nearly 15 million will be handed out by authorities and charities.</p> <p>All governments, however, are moving cautiously, for fear of a second wave. In China the northeastern city of Harbin shut-dine in services at restaurants and cafes as the rest of the country was easing restrictions for the May Day holiday.</p> <p>Mainland China reported only one new case on Saturday, but Heilongjiang province is currently dealing with the country\u2019s biggest remaining coronavirus cluster, with half of 140 recent local transmissions, according to a Reuters tally.</p> <p>In the US, Australia and the UK, there has been a focus on how and why residential facilities have become deadly incubators for the disease.</p> <p>A nursing home in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> has reported a \u201chorrifying\u201d death toll of 98 people from the coronavirus, one of the worst outbreaks in the country and a shock even in hard-hit New York. An official state tally of nursing home deaths had previously listed only 13 as of Friday.</p> <p>In the UK, the coronavirus death toll increased sharply this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/uk-records-4343-care-home-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-fortnight\">after officials began counting fatalities from the country\u2019s nursing homes</a> alongside deaths in hospitals. Britain now has the third highest number of deaths in the world, 27,510, <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker,</a> behind only the US and Italy.</p> <p>In Australia, although the virus has been brought under control far more quickly, deaths also continued to mount at a care home in western Sydney. Thirteen residents account for over 10% of the total national death toll of only 93, and it is threatening to overtake the Ruby Princess cruise ship as the single biggest source of deaths in the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/new-york-nursing-homes-coronavirus-deaths\">Hundreds of recent deaths in New York nursing homes linked to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/parents-grandparents-boxers-singers-care-home-residents-who-have-died-from-covid-19-coronavirus\">Parents, grandparents, boxers, singers: care home residents who have died from Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere around the world, key developments include:</p> <ul> <li><p>The US Federal Drug Administration has given approval for the experimental drug remdesivir to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/remdesivir-emergency-use-fda-us-coronavirus\">used in an emergency on patients suffering from Covid-19</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Also in the US, the White House has barred the administration\u2019s top pandemic expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, from giving evidence at a Congressional hearing.

It is like we are in a deadly war. People are dying so fast,\u201d Warsame said.</p> <p>On 25 April, the ministry of health <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SomaliaCovid19/status/1254043830049013763\">reported two deaths</a> from Covid-19, a day after Warsame collected 12 bodies for burial from homes.</p> <p>In Somalia, as across large parts of Africa, the deceased are buried within hours, following Islamic custom. This makes autopsies or record-keeping harder.</p> <p>Medical officials admit that many deaths are simply not reported to authorities.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a limited capacity to record all deaths. We are unable to reach every home. When a patient dies, relatives hire a private ambulance or a truck and they bury the body. People are reluctant to share the information and therefore we are missing numbers,\u201d Dr Mohamed Ali, a health officer who leads the Covid-19 response team at Mogadishu\u2019s Martini hospital, said.</p> <p>There are currently <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/covid-19/\">37,000 cases confirmed in Africa and 1,600 deaths</a>, according to official statistics, suggesting a much slower spread of Covid-19 on the continent than in other global regions. This has led to hopes that hundreds of millions of the world\u2019s poorest people may escape the worst of the pandemic.</p> <p>However, just four countries \u2013 South Africa, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria \u2013 account for more than half the cases. All four have relatively well-developed health systems and the ability to test large numbers of suspected cases.</p> <p>Elsewhere many governments are struggling to implement basic measures to track the pandemic.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Dr Benjamin Djoudalbaye, head of policy and health diplomacy at the African Union\u2019s Centre for Disease Control, said the spread of Covid-19 was \u201cnot something you can hide\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou see what you can see. You go to the hospital and you will see the [people there]. As the capacity of testing increases, so we will see the real situation,\u201d Djoudalbaye told reporters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/nigerian-authorities-deny-wave-of-deaths-is-due-to-covid-19\">There are already fears of a major outbreak of Covid-19 in northern Nigeria</a>, though this has been denied by authorities, and that official statistics in Tanzania \u2013 where president John Magafuli has rejected advice to impose a lockdown \u2013 do not reflect the real situation.</p> <p>Dahir Mohamud, a funeral worker at Geed-Timir graveyard in Mogadishu, said he had dealt with more than 30 bodies in under five days, 10 times the usual number. Almost all were elderly men who died after a short illness.</p> <p>Abdullahi Mohamed Jama, a gravedigger in Mogadishu\u2019s Calamada graveyard, said his team dug 21 to 22 graves on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday last week, around four times the usual total.</p> <p>\u201cPreviously we used to dig graves on demand. These days we don\u2019t wait for calls because there are many deaths every day. All these deaths are illness-related and they are elderly people. It is very sensitive to talk about Covid-19 and relatives will only tell us it is urgent death,\u201d Abdullahi Dhere said.</p> <p>Hamdi Ahmed Diriye, a university student, said his elderly uncle and grandmother had both recently died after displaying high temperatures and respiratory problems associated with Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cWhen my uncle became sick we rushed to the hospital but the doctors refused to admit him \u2026We did not want to go to the government facility because we have heard people had died there so we took back him to home where he died,\u201d Diriye said. \u201cThen my grandmother showed similar symptoms but unfortunately she died very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Mohamed Abdi Hayir, the information minister, said the government recognised that many recent deaths were due to Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201c[Relatives] are saying someone died of malaria or hepatitis. That is not true. The Somali government recognises that all recent deaths are of Covid-19,\u201d Hayir said.</p> <p>There is no information on the possible spread of the disease in the swaths of Somalia run by al-Shabaab, an Islamist extremist group affiliated with al-Qaida.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> has warned of 10 million cases in Africa within three to six months, though experts say that the total could be lower if authorities are able to move swiftly to contain outbreaks of the disease.</p>",

Dr <strong>Anthony Fauci </strong>said earlier this week, \u201cThe data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery. ... What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d</li> <li><strong>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany held her first daily briefing. </strong>It was the first time in more than a year that a White House press secretary had held a formal briefing. McEnany promised to never lie from the White House podium, but she went on to share several false or misleading statements about sexual misconduct allegations against <strong>Trump </strong>and the FBI investigation of former national security adviser <strong>Michael Flynn, </strong>among other things.</li> <li><strong>Joe Biden denied Tara Reade\u2019s allegation of sexual assault. </strong>The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in an MSNBC interview, \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Donald Trump said he expects up to</strong><strong> 100,000 Americans will die</strong> of Covid-19. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.\u201d The president had previously said he expected 60,000 - 70,000 fatalities in the US. </li> <li><strong>New York schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year, </strong>governor <strong>Andrew Cuomo </strong>announced. The news was unsurprising considering the state reported another 1,000 new coronavirus hospitalizations yesterday, but the daily death toll has fallen slightly to 289.</li> <li><strong>Trump said Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with anti-stay-at-home protesters. </strong>The president\u2019s suggestion came one day after demonstrators, some of them carrying assault rifles, swarmed the Michigan state capitol to protest Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order. Whitmer rejected the idea of making a deal during a public health emergency, but said some outdoor work will be allowed to resume next week. </li> <li><strong>The White House blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying</strong> before a House subcommittee looking into the coronavirus response. Former CDC director <strong>Tom Frieden </strong>will testify instead. </li> <li><strong>California governor Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/california-coronavirus-protests-huntington-beach-sacramento\">promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments</a></strong> to stay-at-home orders in the coming days.

Trump\u2019s \u201cnavigable waters protection rule\u201d, which was published in January, narrows the definition of waterways to exclude ephemeral streams, wetlands, creeks and other headwaters which do not have visible water 365 days a year because they run intermittently or temporarily underground. For example, 90% of streams that connect to the Colorado river, which supplies water to seven western US states and two in northern Mexico, run only after rainfall or snowmelt.</p> <p>The rule, which has attracted widespread criticism from scientists, environmentalists, and the tourism sector, replaces an Obama era regulation that strengthened protection for about 60% of the nation\u2019s interconnected waterways. But it goes much further than just repealing Obama\u2019s 2015 rule, by allowing landowners and developers to dump directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to clean water is a fundamental right for all Americans. Trump\u2019s dirty water rule ignores the law and science and is a reckless rollback of clean water protections \u2026 which benefits industry polluters and harms countless Americans,\u201d said <strong>Letitia James</strong>, New York\u2019s attorney general, at a virtual press conference today.</p> <p>The lawsuit argues that the new rule will result in more pollution, flooding, and harm to fish and wildlife across the country \u2014 undermining decades of work to protect and enhance water resources - and will result in widespread economic losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into this fight with our three most reliable allies: the facts, science and the law,\u201d said <strong>Xavier Becerra</strong>, California\u2019s attorney general. In California, more than 40% of streams and half of all wetlands have been stripped of protection under the new definition, said Becerra. \u201cEven during the coronavirus pandemic, the administration hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d He added, \u201cThe latest actions come at a time when the nation\u2019s health and economy can least afford it.\u201d</p> <p>The lawsuit, co-led by New York and Califnronia, was filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Also suing are the attorneys generals of Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia and the City of New York.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/water-shutoffs-us-coronavirus-utilities-economy\">'It feels like nobody cares': the Americans living without running water amid Covid-19</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eac76868f082b32fdd6bbf0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T19:39:01.134Z\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/trump-tells-biden-to-fight-tara-reade-sexual-assault-allegation.html\">passed further comment</a> on the <strong>allegation against Joe Biden</strong>, in an interview with Fox News commentator and podcast host Dan Bongino.</p> <p>\u201cI would just say to Joe Biden, \u2018Just go out and fight it,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding in typically contradictory style: \u201cHe\u2019s gonna have to make his own decision, I\u2019m not going to be telling him what to do.

It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week.</p> <p>\u201cThe concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,\u201d the head of Darpa\u2019s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection.

His campaign refuted the allegation in a statement, but this is Biden\u2019s first public comment on the accusation.</p> <p>He also calls on the National Archives to release any record of a complaint Reade said she filed. </p> <p>Here is the statement in its entirety: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief \u2013 that women should be heard \u2013 was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country \u2013 but how far we still have to go.</p> <p>When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture. <br><br>So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women \u2013 and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation \u2013 and passed the law.<br><br>In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.<br><br>As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence \u2013 and against the law. <br><br>We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too \u2013 they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them \u2013 they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity. <br><br>In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet.<br><br>It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.<br><br>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened.</p> <p>While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny. <br><br>Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways. <br><br>But this much bears emphasizing.<br><br>She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They \u2013 both men and a woman \u2013 have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have.<br><br>There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills. <br><br>There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be \u2013 the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.<br><br>As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.<br><br>I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard.<br><br>We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence. <br><br>We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color. <br><br>We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority. <br><br>I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">here</a>: </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:03:29.178Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eac004f8f08f76ffc19f64a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T11:59:37.376Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning \u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and politics, both concerning the pandemic and tilted towards the election in November \u2013 in the US.</p> <p>The main news of the morning is that <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will appear on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to answer questions for the first time about <strong>an allegation of sexual assault against him</strong>. </p> <p>In advance of the interview, Biden issued a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished.
