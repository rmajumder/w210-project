But European diplomats said the US was half-hearted in its campaign and lost the tussle with China.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, looking at the last WHA meeting for me, was a very clear sign that American influence has diminished significantly,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia. \u201cIt was embarrassing that we weren\u2019t able to wrangle international support for our policy goals in that meeting, and that China was able to really get what they needed out of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The move appeared to confirm the suspicions of many in the WHO and in western capitals that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/us-gives-g7-countries-a-list-of-reforms-it-wants-who-to-undertake\">never intended to seek reforms or open a dialogue with the WHO</a>, but left the body for political reasons.

That was all lies,\u201d the Democratic senator Chris Murphy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1266455066657148929\">said on Twitter</a>. \u201cIt was always about distraction and scapegoating.

He confirmed that the US would restrict entry to Chinese students, and cease to treat Hong Kong as autonomous, ending preferential trade relations.</p> \n<p>He also said there would be sanctions against Chinese officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe US will also take necessary steps to sanction PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] and Hong Kong officials directly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/trump-turns-against-who-to-mask-his-own-stark-failings-on-covid-19-crisis\">Trump turns against WHO to mask his own stark failings on Covid-19 crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Leaving the WHO would mean abrogating a treaty, the latest in a series of international agreements Trump has pulled out of.

  "<p>Since the Covid-19 outbreak began, many have been concerned about asymptomatic spread \u2013 that is, people who have the virus but show no symptoms, so therefore don\u2019t take measures to quarantine themselves.</p> <p>As the virus spreads throughout the world more research can be gathered, and scientists are learning more about asymptomatic spread and its prevalence. Findings <a href=\"https://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/27/thoraxjnl-2020-215091\">published in the BMJ Journal Thorax on Thursday found asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 meant the prevalence of the virus was likely to be significantly underestimated on cruise ships</a>. Australian researchers led by Prof Alvin Ing from Macquarie University in Sydney analysed tests from all 217 passengers and crew on board a ship that departed from Argentina for a 21-day cruise of the Antarctic Peninsula in mid-March, after the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. They found more than 80% of the 128 people who tested positive for Covid-19 had no symptoms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We haven\u2019t seen deaths in the population of people who were positive but\u00a0asymptomatic.</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Bruce Thompson, Swinburne University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2766237?utm_source=AusSMC+mailing+list&amp;utm_campaign=3bdc5fcc64-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_27_05_26_COPY_63&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_90d9431cd5-3bdc5fcc64-126967137\">separate study published on Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a> (JAMA), 42% of 78 close contacts of Covid-19 patients in a hospital in Wuhan, China, showed no symptoms of the disease.&nbsp;The researchers found the asymptomatic study participants had a shorter duration of viral shedding, a shorter duration of disease and were less likely to pass it on. The&nbsp;asymptomatic&nbsp;cases were more likely to be women, and to only shed the virus (shedding refers to the replication of the virus inside the body being released into the environment, such as on to surfaces or into the air) for eight days compared with 19 for those with symptoms.</p> <p>Though they display less viral shedding, asymptomatic people can still spread disease.</p> <h2>How common is asymptomatic spread then?</h2> <p>We still don\u2019t know. There have been varying studies, but some of them have been conducted in unique environments such as hospitals or aged care homes, where the demographics of the populations may be different. It is also possible that some people who were asymptomatic at the time of testing later went on to develop symptoms.</p> <p>Sanjaya Senanayake, an associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University, said about 40% of people were asymptomatic in a study from Iceland, while 30.8% of people in a study of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan were asymptomatic. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to know which is right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although we are getting closer to understanding the proportion of&nbsp;asymptomatic&nbsp;cases with Covid-19, we still don\u2019t know for sure the magnitude of the impact that they have on further transmission of cases. Do they generate lots of secondary cases or only a small proportion?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99f37f533a166e385c6daed34c46e5545c3e9f09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99f37f533a166e385c6daed34c46e5545c3e9f09/0_0_2116_1716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found the asymptomatic study participants had a shorter duration of viral shedding, a shorter duration of disease and were less likely to pass it on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Institutes of Health/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prof Ivo Mueller, an epidemiologist at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, said it was important to remember that a cruise ship was a contained, unique environment and the percentage of asymptomatic cases found on them would not necessarily translate into the same rates in the community. He said the new research was important, but was not enough to definitely state how common asymptomatic&nbsp;infections of Covid-19 are, or how much these contributed to transmission.</p> <p>\u201cThe answers to these questions are not only essential for getting a better picture of how many people have already been exposed, but will also greatly affect our predictions on how the Covid-19 pandemic may develop over the coming months, and what interventions are most important to prevent second wave of cases and deaths,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>How do asymptomatic people spread the virus?</h2> <p>Infectious disease doctor Peter Collignon said speaking, shouting and singing were all ways someone with no symptoms could spread the virus. \u201cTouching inside the nose and then touching surfaces is another way,\u201d he said. There are many diseases where people can be asymptomatic.

Less severe disease and therefore less coughing and vomiting meant there was less opportunity for it to contaminate surfaces and infect people. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen deaths in the population of people who were positive but&nbsp;asymptomatic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also didn\u2019t transmit or shed the virus for as long and finally, recovered quicker. This research highlights the importance of continuing to do more testing.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute, said studies in aged care and other outbreaks had found 50% or more of all positive cases are&nbsp;asymptomatic. \u201cHigh-risk contacts in outbreak situations, whether family contacts or in a closed setting outbreak, should be tested regardless of symptoms or cases will be missed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Maintaining good hygiene, following guidelines on social-distancing, self-isolating if you come into contact with someone who tested positive with the virus, even if they are asymptomatic, and self-isolating even if you test positive but are asymptomatic are all strong ways to prevent spread.</p>",
  "<p>The Covid-19 recession will bring fiscal stimulus on a massive scale. There are high hopes that the recovery will be green but it could be an uphill struggle. A big opportunity for Australia\u2019s governments is to keep the renewable energy revolution going.</p> <p>There will be pressure to invest in anything that quickly brings back jobs and prosperity, never mind long term, social or environmental goals. A return to the world as it was in 2019 will seem a marvellous goal for the many people whose jobs have gone or whose businesses have faltered. In order to improve the economy relative to pre-Covid, to build back better, will need governments to lead.</p> <p>The forces pushing the other way are strong. Fossil fuel interests see Covid as a chance to push their barrel, all too evident in the push under way in Australia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion\">increase gas production</a>, regardless of the fact that it would raise greenhouse gas emissions for a long time to come.

We\u2019ve seen a huge boom in solar and wind and power. Even the government\u2019s new <a href=\"https://ccep.crawford.anu.edu.au./sites/default/files/uploads/ccep_crawford_anu_edu_au/2020-05/afr_jotzo_technology_roadmap_may_2020.pdf\">discussion paper towards its technology roadmap</a> acknowledges that the future is renewables rather than coal, though it also gives a nod to gas.</p> <p>But the recession could thwart investor appetite in new electricity generation plants. In the east coast electricity market, average <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/yes-carbon-emissions-fell-during-covid-19-but-its-the-shift-away-from-coal-that-really-matters-138611\">wholesale prices are now less than half of what they were a year ago</a> \u2013 as a result of lower gas prices, more renewables on the grid, and lower electricity demand. While that is great news for consumers including energy-intensive industry, it dampens the case for new renewables investment. It also puts extra pressure on old coal-fired power plants.</p> <p>Regardless of the dynamics in the electricity market, it is a sure bet in Australia to rapidly expand solar and wind power, new transmission lines and energy storage. It is what will replace the coal power fleet, power electric cars, and provide the foundation for the energy-intensive export industries of the future.</p> <p>Governments should now step up and accelerate renewables investment. Large <a href=\"https://energy.nsw.gov.au/renewables/renewable-energy-zones\">renewable energy zones</a> have been mapped out, and New South Wales already has a plan to deliver three of them. The coming recession is the best possible reason to step up the pace.</p> <p>Renewable energy projects can be built quickly and they can be scaled up over time. Governments can fund and own renewables generators, or provide long-term fixed-price contracts to companies that build and operate them.</p> <p>And we urgently need new power lines. The usual way would be a lengthy process to plan, contract and build transmission lines and for private companies to build wind and solar projects. With the recovery stimulus imperative, governments can and should make it happen more quickly.</p> <p>In parallel, governments need to be ready to support the regions where coal-fired plants will inevitably close down. It will not do to wait until the next power plants in the Hunter and Latrobe valley announce closures on commercial grounds. Building alternative infrastructure and supporting new areas of business should start right now.</p> <p>The fundamental criteria for economic stimulus that stands the test of time are simple: projects need to be able to start soon, use a lot of local inputs, result in something useful for the long run, and be compatible with a net-zero emissions trajectory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/14/seizing-the-moment-how-australia-can-build-a-green-economy-from-the-covid-19-wreckage\">Seizing the moment: how Australia can build a green economy from the Covid-19 wreckage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Expanding renewable energy and the power grid scores high on those criteria.

The obvious way to get started on these is a large public investment program in R&amp;D and pilot plants. The government\u2019s technology roadmap can identify priority investments. This should then quickly be followed by cash.</p> <p>Governments will take out big loans to get the economy out of the Covid recession. We must be sure to spend it in a way that benefits our society in the future. That means creating better social fabric, more education and infrastructure. And it means helping build up industries that have a strong prospect in a world economy that acts on climate change.</p> <p>Today\u2019s younger people will be paying the debt back through higher taxes.

  "<p>In the end it was much ado about nothing. The fate of this year\u2019s men\u2019s T20 World Cup, among other agenda items, has been deferred until 10 June after Thursday\u2019s much-anticipated International Cricket Council board meeting was hijacked by concerns over \u201cconfidentiality\u201d, prompting an independent investigation into the matter that the ICC says will be undertaken by its own ethics officer and \u201csupported by global experts\u201d.</p> <p>As host nation of the competition, these are days Australia can seemingly ill afford to waste. But in truth everything is falling nicely into place for a domestic ruling body crying poor at every turn. Although the ICC is playing down suggestions the T20 World Cup will be postponed, there isn\u2019t a figure in the game who isn\u2019t convinced otherwise. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/28/gabba-to-host-test-in-australia-india-series\">Gabba to host Test in Australia-India series as Perth misses out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If nothing else, the next fortnight will give the ICC the time it needs to flesh out contingency plans for a global event that simply cannot happen in the present milieu. Sixteen teams and staff from around the world in bio-safe hubs? In a country that is closer than most to freeing itself from Covid-19? All for a cricket tournament that can staged at another time? Not likely.</p> <p>Far from resigned to the inevitability of the October-November event being postponed, Cricket Australia will privately welcome the decision with open arms. Publicly, however, it is counting the cost. \u201cThe likelihood of significant crowds is very slim \u2013 ordinarily that would deliver well over $50m revenue,\u201d CA chief executive Kevin Roberts said on Friday. \u201cThe T20 World Cup is a big question and that\u2019s a factor of perhaps $20m ... you would have to say there\u2019s a very high risk about the prospect of that happening.\u201d</p> <p>For CA, the temporary loss of an ICC-staged event played in front of no fans is no loss at all compared to the alternative. Lurking in the shadows is the Indian Premier League, the 2020 edition of which is still waiting to happen thanks to the global pandemic. Should the IPL season be wiped altogether, it\u2019s estimated the cost to the global cricket economy could be in the region of US$600m.</p> <p>It\u2019s here where Australia\u2019s destiny is linked to \u2013 or more bluntly, in the hands of \u2013 India. An absent T20 World Cup opens up a window for the IPL to take place, which then leads directly to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: India\u2019s summer tour of Australia and the $300m in broadcast revenue that comes with it. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, Cricket Australia will have been pushing India\u2019s barrow hard. \u201cThe Cricket Australia board will want to keep India happy,\u201d former Australia captain Mark Taylor said recently. \u201cThey may want to let the players go to India if the IPL goes ahead. Because they want India to come here this summer and play, which will be our biggest summer in terms of dollars.\u201d</p> <p>And so it has come to pass: Cricket Australia this week announced dates for an India tour that will encompass four Tests, three T20s and ODIs, and three one-dayers for the women\u2019s teams. They might be the fiercest of rivals on the field, but off it Australia and India can be the snuggest of bedfellows when it suits them. Should anyone have forgotten who possesses the whip hand in world cricket, wonder no more.</p> <p>The dollars produced by India\u2019s summer tour are dollars CA can\u2019t do without, its coffers laid apparently bare by the impact of Covid-19. CA has been frank in its assessment that the game\u2019s survival in this country, at least in the short term, is dependent on India\u2019s visit. Now that the tour has been rubber-stamped, at least while the coronavirus situation allows it, the states will be looking on with interest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/28/covid-subs-could-aid-cricket-safe-return-but-replacement-rules-should-remain-strict\">Covid subs could allow cricket safe return but replacement rules should remain strict | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association was highly critical of CA\u2019s cost-cutting, its chairman Greg Dyer saying the game had \u201cyet to experience a significant negative revenue event\u201d. He added: \u201cNow is not the time to diminish the game, but instead seize the moment and improve it.\u201d States have seen their grants reduced by 25%, while nationwide job losses at association level now number in the region of 150. </p> <p>Queensland Cricket is the latest body to confront the financial crisis, letting go almost a third of its staff. The impact on Sheffield Shield cricket and player development could be profound. When Roberts speaks of \u201cthe importance of CA generating revenue to support states and territories\u201d, its members will rightly point to the India tour, the windfall it will bring, and ask why the bloodletting is allowed to continue. CA\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-australia-s-cash-crisis-claims-to-be-put-to-the-test-20200528-p54xb6.html\">cricket revenue forecast for the 2020-21 season</a>, due any day now, can\u2019t come quick enough.</p> <p>As for the T20 World Cup, several options are on the table. The event could be delayed for anywhere from six months to two years. On Cricket Australia\u2019s list of priorities, this is some way down the list. For now, it has more pressing matters at hand. Number one is hoping and praying India get here safe and sound. Number two is convincing its members it still has its best interests at heart.</p>",

  "<p>In Ford v Ferrari \u2013 the Oscar-nominated film that tells the story of Le Mans 1966 \u2013 there\u2019s a memorable scene where driver Ken Miles looks out over a racing circuit at dusk. \u201cOut there is the perfect lap,\u201d Miles tells his young son. \u201cNo mistakes, every gear change, every corner, perfect.

I picture writers hunched over laptops, artists at easels, chefs in kitchens, all finalising the masterpieces that will enrich our worlds on their return. Meanwhile in backyards and garages, ranks of mini-Messis and Serenas and Steve Smiths clock up their 10,000 hours, while I perfect the length of my afternoon nap.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/01/thank-you-ben-stokes-for-another-headingley-miracle\">Thank you, Ben Stokes, for another Headingley miracle | Emma John</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blessed with unexpected time to fill, which could be devoted to the minute daily improvement of any skill I chose, I have found my mind more scattered and distractable than ever. I\u2019ve felt overwhelmed, and decided to pursue something more realistic, namely the rewatching of every Marvel movie in chronological order.</p> <p>We know that high achievers and sports stars are made of different stuff from the rest of us \u2013 it\u2019s why we put them on pedestals. And yet a lifetime of interviewing them has impressed on me how very normal most are, how ordinary their daily routines, how relatable their struggles. True, they are far better at self-discipline \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t always come naturally to them. Yes, they have perfection in their sights \u2013 but they have to learn how to stop it paralysing them, too.</p> <p>Whatever the marker \u2013 Federer\u2019s forehand, Tiger\u2019s tee-shot, or Simone Biles\u2019s beam dismount \u2013 the pursuit of perfection is always a paradox. The more you desire it, the more dangerous its lure. In golf, the difference between winning and losing can be a matter of millimetres. Propelling a ball hundreds of yards into a four-and-a-quarter-inch hole is a process built on biomechanical precision \u2013 and yet, in the context of gameplay, it\u2019s bested by psychology. Why else do players suffer dramatic collapses when they\u2019re top of the leaderboard?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pursuit of perfection is a paradox; the more you desire it, the more dangerous its lure</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is where sports science is making its biggest advances. In the 1990s, the quest for perfection focused on fitness training: footballers who once viewed the ice bath as somewhere to keep the beers cold were now expected to use it to deal with excess lactic acid. The new millennium brought us big data \u2013 a wave of analytics that could illuminate the tiniest of weaknesses. In 2020, sport faces its final frontier \u2013 the mind.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the one element which you\u2019ve never been able to measure,\u201d says Jeremy Snape, the former England cricketer whose company, Sporting Edge, provides psychological-based consultancy to high-performance athletes and business organisations. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t measure the fact that when I walked out to bowl to Sachin Tendulkar my belief in my ability was 32% but Darren Gough\u2019s was 98%. But these human challenges \u2013 courage, adaptability, instinctive decision-making under pressure \u2013 are fundamental.\u201d</p> <p>As professional sport becomes ever bigger business, the pressure on its participants increases exponentially. Sport follows a binary narrative \u2013 creating heroes or villains \u2013 and the result can be paralysing. \u201cOur brains are built for survival,\u201d says Snape, \u201cso often our primitive instinct is to protect our self-esteem rather than take a risk and go for glory.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, set yourself the goal of perfection and you\u2019ll worry more about the consequences of falling short. \u201cPerfectionism can be good for driving your work ethic and your attention to detail. But it can also cause stress, procrastination and even avoidance \u2013 because you\u2019re afraid of not achieving it. The really great sportspeople have the courage to throw themselves into any endeavour with 100% commitment, knowing that it\u2019s going to be imperfect.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/dec/22/roger-federer-tennis-muhammad-ali\">Faultless Roger Federer\u2019s appeal transcends tennis to become an icon | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was no better example last year than Ben Stokes. From the nerve-shredding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\">World Cup final</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/01/thank-you-ben-stokes-for-another-headingley-miracle\">greatest Test comeback of all time at Headingley</a>, Stokes snatched improbable victories not by playing perfect innings but by believing that, as long as he was at the crease, his team still stood a chance.</p> <p>Perfection can work best as the ever-elusive prize that pushes performers to peak preparedness and it\u2019s a theory supported by the research of the American psychologist Carol Dweck, whose book Mindset has become a must-read for athletes. Dweck argues that it is limiting to see talent as a fixed, innate \u201cgift\u201d, something you have or you don\u2019t, because such thinking encourages people to show competence in areas where they\u2019ve already demonstrated it.</p> <p>Instead, Dweck outlines a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d which asserts that each of us is learning incrementally every day, becoming wiser and more skilled as a result of both our successes and failures. Its exponents tend to meet uncertainty and new challenges with more courage \u2013 because they are not looking to protect their pride.</p> <p>The message resonates in all walks of life. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re pitching business sales or playing an international rugby match, you have to believe that you\u2019ve got the ability to learn quickly,\u201d says Snape. That, he says, is the new competitive advantage.</p> <p>When we emerge from lockdown, of course, all of us will be adapting to a new world. Maybe something we can learn from sport, in our new environment, is not to feel overcome by the magnitude of the challenges ahead of us but to throw ourselves into them with less fear of failure. Or maybe it\u2019s a simple reminder to stop framing sportspeople as heroes and antiheroes. After all, if I want wonder-women and super villains, I\u2019ve got Marvel.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Russia records biggest rise in deaths</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed0e7c38f084df971c8be8b#block-5ed0e7c38f084df971c8be8b\">Russia&nbsp;suffers its greatest daily increase in deaths</a>, with 232 more in 24 hours. That pushes the nationwide total to 4,374. Officials say 8,572 new infections have been confirmed, bringing the national tally to 387,623. Russia has the third highest reported total of cases in the world after the United States and Brazil.</p> <h2><strong>Iran sees highest tally of new infections since early April</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed0ef368f084df971c8bf07#block-5ed0ef368f084df971c8bf07\">Iran&nbsp;identifies more new cases in a day than at any time since early April</a>, with 2,819 more people testing positive on Friday.</p> <p>Kianoush Jahanpour, the Iranian health ministry spokesman, adds that 50 more people have died in the same period, pushing the total death toll from the outbreak to 7,677. Out of 146,668 cases detected so far, 114,931 people have recovered.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa has backlog of nearly 100,000 tests</strong></h2> <p>Health authorities in&nbsp;South Africa&nbsp;say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed104498f087122eca51d73#block-5ed104498f087122eca51d73\">the country has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed tests</a> as it and other countries on the continent face difficulties in obtaining essential supplies.</p> <p>\u201cThis challenge is caused by the limited availability of test kits globally,\u201d the health ministry says. Priority is given to processing tests from hospital patients and health workers.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea reimposes some lockdown measures</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed112678f087122eca51e3a#block-5ed112678f087122eca51e3a\">Plans to reopen more than 800 schools in South Korea are shelved</a> as the country battles a renewed outbreak. The country\u2019s easing of lockdown measures goes into reverse, with museums, parks and art galleries closed again on Friday for two weeks amid a resurgence in infections. It was originally reported only 200 of the schools due to reopen would remain closed.</p> <h2><strong>Sweden left out of Nordic border reopenings</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/29/coronavirus-covid-19-live-news-global-deaths-uk-eases-lockdown-updates?page=with:block-5ed116c48f087122eca51e92#block-5ed116c48f087122eca51e92\">A Nordic rift opens up over proposals to ease restrictions</a>, with&nbsp;Sweden&nbsp;excluded from Norwegian and Danish plans to reopen their borders to tourists from some countries next month. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, and the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, say most restrictions will end on 15 June.</p> <h2><strong>UK, France, Spain and Italy excluded from Greece border reopening</strong></h2> <p>Greece&nbsp;is to reopen its airports in Athens and Thessaloniki to arrivals from 29 countries from 15 June, the start of the tourist season.

  "<p>Equity markets have generally ignored the increasing number of natural disasters over the past 50 years and tougher rules are needed to make investors aware of the dangers posed by the climate crisis, the International Monetary Fund has said.</p> <p>Companies should be forced to disclose their exposure to climate risk because a voluntary approach does not go far enough, the IMF said in a chapter from its latest global financial stability report (GFSR).</p> <p>The Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, an initiative led by Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, outlines how companies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/banks-should-disclose-lending-to-companies-with-carbon-related-risks-says-report\">should calculate and disclose their exposure</a>&nbsp;to climate risk to investors.</p> <p>The IMF, however, said in a GFSR published on Friday that climate risk should ultimately be made part of international reporting standards.</p> <p>\u201cAn increasing number of firms have begun to voluntarily disclose climate change risk information, in line with the recommendations set out by the taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, going further by developing global mandatory disclosures on material climate change risks would be an important step to sustain financial stability. In the short term, mandatory climate change risk disclosure could be based on globally agreed principles. In the longer term, climate change risk disclosure standards could be incorporated into financial statements compliant with international financial reporting standards.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF functions as the global lender of last resort, bailing out countries in financial difficulty and issuing policy advice alongside its interventions. Its latest statement on the climate crisis expressed concerns that stock markets were ignoring the rise in global temperatures and its consequences.</p> <p>Although stock markets fell sharply in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, this followed their best year since 2009 and the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. A global index of share prices rose by 24%, and the FTSE 100 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/dec/31/global-markets-rally-shares-ftse-100-pound-oil-markets-business-live\">climbed by 12% </a>despite uncertainty over Brexit.</p> <p>Last year was also marked by a series of severe weather-related events, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/03/yazoo-backwater-mississippi-flooding-months\">flooding in the US</a> and bushfires in Australia, but the IMF said this was part of a trend for the number of disasters to increase \u201cconsiderably\u201d in the past few decades, from slightly more than 50 in the early 1980s to about 200 since 2000. It noted that Hurricane Kartrin devastated New Orleans in 2005, and Dominica suffered damage amounting to more than twice its GDP when Hurricane Maria struck in 2017.</p> <p>The IMF said global temperatures were currently 1.1C above their pre-industrial level and were on course to rise by a total of 3C unless stronger action was taken.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change induced by this level of warming is, in turn, expected to adversely impact the world\u2019s stock of natural assets, lead to a significant rise in sea level, and increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather event,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cAs the frequency and severity of climatic hazards rise, the resultant socioeconomic losses could be significantly higher than in recent history.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, according to the GFSR there had been little indication that investors had become more aware of the potential losses they could face if global temperatures continued to rise, with only a modest impact on stock markets, shares in banks and insurance companies from large disasters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhile projections of climatic variables and their economic impact are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, aggregate equity valuations as of 2019 do not appear to reflect the predicted changes in physical risk under various climate change scenarios\u201d, the IMF said. \u201cThis suggests that equity investors may not be paying sufficient attention to climate change risks.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF said that preventing global heating from causing a run on share prices was not the only reason to take action.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, strong policy actions to mitigate climate change would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and future physical risk in the first place, conferring benefits to mankind that extend well beyond the realm of financial stability.

  "<p>Government advisers have voiced unease over the decision to lift England\u2019s lockdown while thousands of people a day are still becoming infected with the coronavirus, warning that loosening restrictions could easily lead to a second wave.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot relax our guard by very much at all,\u201d said John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who attends meetings of Sage, the scientific advisory group on emergencies.</p> <p>There are still 8,000 new infections every day in England without counting those in hospitals and care homes, Edmunds said. \u201cIf you look at it internationally, it\u2019s a very high level of incidence.\u201d World Health Organization statistics suggest it is the fifth highest in the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is, clearly there\u2019s a need to try and get the economy restarted and people back to their jobs and so on, and also there\u2019s a social and a mental health need to allow people to meet with their friends and families,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that then means that we have fewer cases occurring before we relax the measures.</p> <p>\u201cI think at the moment, with relatively high incidence and relaxing the measures and also with an untested track and trace system, I think we are taking some risk here.\u201d</p> <p>Edmunds\u2019 call quickly won backing from other scientists with Jeremy Farrar, who also attends Sage and is director of the Wellcome Trust, tweeting: \u201cCovid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England. Agree with John &amp; clear science advice. TTI [test, trace and isolate] has to be in place, fully working, capable [of dealing with] any surge immediately.\u201d He said results from tests would required quickly and \u201c\u201cinfection rates have to be lower\u201d. Farrar pointedly added that the authorities\u2019 capabilities in these areas also had to be \u201ctrusted\u201d.</p> <p>The reproductive R rate is between 0.7 and 0.9, said Edmunds, who is part of several groups of mathematical modellers who combine their data to calculate the number.</p> <p>Without any sort of containment, R would be between three and four, he said, meaning that each infected person would transmit the virus to three or four others.</p> <p>The aim of the lockdown was to suppress it below one, at which point the number of new cases continues to shrink. But if R reaches one, and allowing more social mobility could easily allow it to rise, the number of people becoming infected each day remains the same.</p> <p>That could mean 8,000 cases a day, he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a 1% fatality rate, that\u2019s about 80 deaths a day. If there\u2019s a 0.5%, that\u2019s 40 deaths a day. So that\u2019s the number of deaths per day that we might expect to see going forward.\u201d</p> <p>It was for ministers to decide what to do, he said. That impact on health had to be set against the wider impact of the lockdown on society and the economy. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly a political decision. It\u2019s not a scientific decision,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the&nbsp;University of Edinburgh and also a member of the Sage modelling group, Spi-M, said there was very little chance of eradicating the virus. \u201cThat was the World Health Organization\u2019s strategy in the early stages of this pandemic. That\u2019s a strategy they only formally abandoned a few weeks ago. And given that yesterday saw the highest number of cases reported globally ever, global eradication doesn\u2019t look like happening any time soon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The relationship with Covid-19 we have had for five months \u201cmight turn out to be a lifelong relationship\u201d, he said. It is not possible to maintain physical distancing for ever and there is no vaccine yet. \u201cA second wave really is a clear and present danger,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He was not making predictions, he said, but intensive surveillance, large-scale screening, effective contact tracing, isolation of cases, quarantine for international arrivals and some residual physical distancing \u201cis a possible new normal\u201d, he said.</p>",
  "<p>Brendan Rodgers has revealed he and his wife Charlotte contracted coronavirus in March and were \u201creally knocked\u201d for three weeks before recovering.</p> <p>The Leicester manager described suffering a headache unlike any he had felt before, losing his sense of smell and taste and enduring breathing difficulties similar to the altitude problems he encountered when climbing Kilimanjaro in 2016.</p> <p>Rodgers is the second Premier League manager, after Arsenal\u2019s Mikel Arteta, to have confirmed catching the virus. The 47-year-old said he had symptoms exactly two weeks after Leicester\u2019s last Premier League match, which was at home to Aston Villa on 9 March.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t well and it was later detected I had the virus,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cA week after that, my wife had it. We spent about three weeks feeling the effects. We were nowhere near as bad as a lot of people but we lost our smell and taste for three weeks, we lost our strength, so I had a little feeling of whatever it must be like. It was tough.</p> <p>\u201cThe strangest thing was the smell and the taste. You\u2019re eating your dinner every day and you could not smell or taste anything. Then you lose your strength, you could hardly walk 10 feet and you were really blowing. I felt similar to climbing Kilimanjaro and you get to a certain altitude, you walk and you really suffer in your breathing. You\u2019re walking 10 to 20 yards and you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Goodness me.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAt the time I hadn\u2019t been tested but you know it\u2019s different. The headache felt like it isolated one side of your head. Your strength gets taken out of you.\u201d</p> <p>Rodgers and his wife decided they needed to know what they had. They were tested 21 days after feeling the first symptoms. \u201cIt\u2019s more: \u2018Christ, if I don\u2019t have it, I wonder what this is?\u2019 So that\u2019s why we got a test, just to be reassured.

He and everyone else at Leicester, as per the Premier League protocols, are being tested twice a week. He is satisfied sufficient safety measures have been put in place to allow the league to return. Leicester resumed full contact training on Thursday and Rodgers will not put pressure on any player to return to action if they do not feel safe.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had great dialogue with the players along the way. There\u2019s been a lot of communication right through the club. With any fears, worries or concerns there was an open-door policy. Naturally everyone had a concern about whether it would be safe. The measures that have been put in place by the police and the Premier League have been followed to the last letter by the club.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the players came in you could see the amount of work that has gone in to ensure this environment is safe.

  "<p>It has been called the \u201cMinnesota paradox\u201d. The Twin Cities, comprising the conjoined urban areas of Minneapolis and St Paul, regularly tops the list of places in the US with the best quality of living.</p> <p>Largely low rise and sprawling, set around the cities\u2019 lakes and the Mississippi, the area is marked by affordable and largely good quality housing with lawns, parks, museums and tree-lined streets.</p> <p>Its politics too have long reflected a strong progressive strand, represented by figures such as the late senator Paul Wellstone, once described as the most liberal member of the Senate. Employment \u2013 pre-pandemic, at least \u2013 was high, and St Paul serves as the global headquarters for 3M.</p> <p>But there is another side to living in Minnesota, often ignored. Factor in the black and ethnic minority experience, and the state is suddenly not such a good place to live.</p> <p>Despite Minneapolis celebrating itself as the city of Prince and Paisley Park, Minnesota\u2019s black education and employment outcomes by US national standards have long been dismal in comparison with those of the state\u2019s white population.</p> <p>Rated in 2018 second in terms of overall best states in which to live in the US, in the same year Minnesota ranked close to the bottom for both employment gap by race (47th) and income gap by race (38th).&nbsp;</p> <p>According to a report released last year, even before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/jobless-america-unemployment-coronavirus-in-figures\">mass unemployment triggered by the coronavirus</a> took hold, some 10% of black American residents of the Twin Cities were unemployed compared with just under 4% of white American residents. Given the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on communities of color, that already bad situation has now worsened.</p> <p>The reality of Minneapolis and St Paul is that behind the veneer of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d, behind the reputation of a socially liberal and highly tolerant metropolitan area (in contrast with the state\u2019s more conservative rural areas), there have long been glaring divisions along racial lines in a place where 20% of the population is African-American.</p> <p>Despite having a white mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/jacob-frey-donald-trump-minneapolis-mayor-tweets-riots\">Jacob Frey</a>, who has been outspoken about the problems of structural racism, and being located in the same congressional district that elected Ilhan Omar, the state\u2019s first non-white woman to be elected to Congress, race relations have foundered on chronic inequalities and a series of high-profile killings of black people involving the 800-strong police force.</p> <p>As the academic Samuel Myers, who coined the notion of the Minnesota paradox, pointed out two years ago, it is not only in employment and income gaps that the paradox exists, pointing to racial disparities in incarceration rates, in child maltreatment report rates, educational outcomes, and even racial disparities in drowning rates.</p> <p>Among all these indicators, it is education that has witnessed one of the worst disparities, despite this being acknowledged as a problem by state officials and leading to a current restructuring effort to try to address the inequalities.</p> <p>According to a report last year, while 95.9% of white adults in the Twin Cities metro area have a high school diploma, one of the highest figures in the US, just 82.2% of black adults do, a number below the national black high school attainment rate of 84.9%.</p> <p>Add to all that the dangerous accelerant of the issue of police violence against black people, including the police shootings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philand</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">o Castile</a> in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/jamar-clark-police-killing-no-charges-minneapolis-protesters\">Jamar Clark </a>in 2015, which led to protests that shut down some of the city\u2019s highways, and what occurred this week becomes more understandable.</p> <p>Finally, as one resident pointed out to the Guardian, the impact of the coronavirus \u2013 not least its devastating economic impact on the poorest and least protected communities \u2013 has fed the simmering anger that existed before George Floyd\u2019s killing.</p> <p>All of which has left a journey along Minneapolis\u2019s historic east-west thoroughfare Lake Street, location of the 3<sup>rd</sup> police precinct which was attacked after the Floyd killing, as a metaphor for many of the tensions.</p> <p>A longtime magnet for new immigrants, from Scandinavians in the 19<sup>th</sup> century through black Americans during the Great Migration and those who relocated from cities such as Chicago in the 60s and 70s, to Hispanic, Hmong and most recently Somali immigrants, this street underlines the disparities.</p> <p>Running from uptown with its wealthy homes, and bookended by the middle class neighborhoods close to the river where Black Lives Matter placards proliferated on lawns in 2016 after Castile\u2019s killing, it also traverses poorer neighborhoods with immigrant-run businesses.</p> <p>It was not always this way. While race relations in the state have largely mirrored the wider experience of the US, the Twin Cites in the 60s and 70s were seen for the African Americans who relocated there as a place with access to jobs and good schooling.</p> <p>But race in Minnesota has become foregrounded even more in the Trump era, as some local rightwing politicians in towns such as Saint Cloud, outside the metropolitan area, have fostered anti-immigrant sentiment aimed largely at Somalis and Latinos.</p> <p>All of which led Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/george-floyd-minneapolis.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">write in the New York Times</a> that what is \u201cunmistakable in the bitter protests in Minneapolis and around the country is the sense that the state is either complicit or incapable of effecting substantive change\u201d.</p>",

Kindergarten pupils, and some primary and secondary school students were due back from Wednesday, in the last phase of school reopenings.</p> <p>According to the education ministry, however, 838 schools out of 20,902 nationwide remain shut. They are located in areas hard hit by the latest wave of infections, including the capital, Seoul, and the cities of Bucheon and Gumi.</p> <p>South Korea has been praised for its deft handling of the Covid crisis. It seemed to have brought the virus under control only to record 79 new cases this week, the highest daily figure for two months. The government has responded by bringing back lockdown measures in the Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of the country\u2019s 51 million population.</p> <p>Most of these cases have been linked to a distribution centre in Bucheon. The warehouse is run by the country\u2019s biggest e-commerce firm Coupang. Health officials traced at least 82 infections to the facility, with the virus found on workers\u2019 shoes and clothes. They are now testing all employees and visitors.</p> <p>In the <strong>Philippines</strong>, meanwhile, plans were unveiled on Friday to ease strict lockdown measures despite a record spike in new cases. The country reported 539 infections on Thursday, bringing its total to 15,588, with 921 deaths.</p> <p>From Monday the capital, Manila, will allow gatherings of up to 10 people and free movement in and out of the city as long as travellers wear masks and keep their distance. Workplaces, shops and some public transport will reopen. Manila is home to 12 million people and is the centre of the nation\u2019s outbreak and efforts to battle the contagion.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d President Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised address.

We\u2019re already seeing governments pump billions into airlines and carmakers with no real green strings attached. To get back on track ahead of next year\u2019s climate summit, the EU needs to adopt a target to cut emissions by 65% by 2030, in line with the Paris agreement.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between the EU\u2019s emissions fall with the UK as a member state and the smaller decline without the UK\u2019s contribution also highlights how the EU will have to step up its efforts after Brexit.

The UK, Sweden and the Netherlands have all shown much interest in this strategy of cocooning vulnerable groups in their homes or shelters while attempting to reopen economies outside.</p> <p>To date, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/13/a-gps-verdict-on-the-shielding-list-its-been-really-complicated\">shielding has meant</a> asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus not to leave home, to avoid any face-to-face interaction, and to restrict human contact to the digital realm. What goes unsaid is that this strategy of shielding is distinctly western, and has not proven particularly effective at protecting these individuals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first vocal proponent of shielding was Boris Johnson, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">announced </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">in mid-March</a> that the UK would keep its economy open and achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d. In the meantime, those at high risk of coronavirus would need to protect themselves by shielding from the rest of society. David Halpern, the chief executive of the behavioural insights team, which is part-owned by the government, said, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcmarkeaston/status/1237694665824047111?s=21\">there\u2019s going to be a point</a>, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you\u2019ll want to cocoon, you\u2019ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don\u2019t catch the disease \u2013 and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity\u2019s been achieved in the rest of the population\u201d. </p> <p>This plan turned out to be disastrous. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">Deaths ravaged care homes</a> and households, and the UK quickly reversed tack and introduced a national lockdown on 23 March. The UK now has one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">highest death tolls in the world</a>.&nbsp;Yet shielding strategies stuck: governments in the US, UK, Sweden and other western countries still advise confinement for vulnerable populations. Most (with the exception of Sweden) recommend shielding in conjunction with a national lockdown.</p> <p>In contrast, east Asian governments have adopted policies focused almost exclusively on mass testing, tracing, and isolation of infectious individuals. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing\">South Korea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/liberal-dutch-taiwan-coronavirus-covid-19-netherlands\">Taiwan</a>, governments made two face masks a week available to citizens and registered non-citizens across the country. The core objective in these countries was to drive the virus out and prevent both young and old people catching it.</p> <p>Two key assumptions underlie shielding use in the UK. First, that if 15% of the population, say, were vulnerable to severe infection from coronavirus, this group could reasonably be isolated from the remaining 85%, who were likely to contract only a mild illness. And second, that those who have contracted coronavirus would develop protective immunity. Yet we still don\u2019t know if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/who-warns-against-coronavirus-immunity-passports\">people develop immunity</a> once they have become infected with coronavirus.</p> <p>And in practice, the first assumption falls apart. According to <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1\">one&nbsp;study&nbsp;in China</a>, 80% of coronavirus transmissions occurred at home, where multi-generational living complicates attempts at shielding. Elderly people who are shielding and living with family members under one roof are especially at risk as countries move to reopen their economies. This risk shouldn\u2019t be understated. In the US,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/05/a-record-64-million-americans-live-in-multigenerational-households/\">13 million</a>&nbsp;Americans over 65 live in multigenerational households. Some don\u2019t have the space for their own room. For members of this group who are clinically extremely vulnerable, shielding isn\u2019t really an option.</p> <p>Even elderly people who live alone need regular contact for care and services. According to the Institute on Aging in the US,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ioaging.org/aging-in-america\">65%&nbsp;of older adults</a> rely exclusively on family and friends to provide them with assistance. Another 30% receive paid assistance alongside their family support. Every point of contact in the network of care for an elderly person who is shielding increases their threat of infection.</p> <p>Beyond immediate family and friends, people who are shielding are also more likely to need regular contact to receive medical care, grocery deliveries, and transportation. The extent to which at-risk populations must rely on others for essential care and services is a huge challenge to the efficacy of any shielding strategy.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen that despite attempts to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#staying-at-home-and-shielding\">shield </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#staying-at-home-and-shielding\">people in nursing and care homes</a>, death rates in these places are consistently among the highest in national tolls. Consider Sweden, which remains lockdown-free, despite deaths ravaging its care homes and elder-care services. At least 50% of the country\u2019s coronavirus deaths occurred within nursing homes,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/28/europe/sweden-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-intl/index.html\">according to</a>&nbsp;Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist of the Swedish public health agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK, where a national shielding strategy was temporarily adopted, care homes also became hotbeds for infection. Care home deaths were found to be <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/05/care-home-death-toll-could-be-22000-more-double-official-figure-academics-say\">higher than 22,000</a> by academics at the London School of Economics. Inefficacies aside, shielding itself is harmful to the mental health of those who are vulnerable. Older adults are already at heightened risk of depression and<strong> </strong>suicidal thoughts;&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the Kaiser Family Foundation, social isolation from shielding can <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/\">exacerbate these mental health challenges</a>. It\u2019s unlikely that the mental health of members of this group who have to shield will improve from being asked to shield indefinitely.&nbsp;</p> <p>And the elderly alone don\u2019t bear the risks of coronavirus. Many younger individuals live with key risk factors that put them into vulnerable groups, and some will be deemed clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Earlier this month, the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999v1.full.pdf\">largest patient&nbsp;study</a>&nbsp;by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxford University found that key factors relating to coronavirus deaths included uncontrolled diabetes, severe asthma, obesity, poverty and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">ethnic minority status</a>.</p> <p>As western countries ease lockdown, suggestions have been made for those being shielded to stay \u201ccocooned\u201d away indefinitely until a vaccine or antiviral therapy is found or natural herd immunity is reached. What we suggest instead is a general strategy of suppression, where governments make a commitment to keeping daily new cases as low as possible through an active <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/government-unveils-covid-19-test-and-trace-strategy-for-england\">testing-and-tracing programme</a> and real-time monitoring of transmission.</p> <p>At the same time, the government should advise those in \u201cshielded groups\u201d about their individual risk, as well as provide them with data about transmission within their communities, and then leave these individuals to make an informed decision about how and when they would like to engage in society.</p> <p>For a government to pursue shielding alone, with its proven inefficacies and intrinsic harms, would be nothing but an Orwellian strategy \u2013 one that presides over the fates of those at greatest risk, against all evidence. There are serious ethical and moral questions around building a society where the healthy and young are left to circulate, and the elderly, the disabled and the vulnerable are hidden away.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh; Yasmin Rafiei is a research assistant at the University of Edinburgh</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 and 4 June 2020. It originally&nbsp;stated that shielding has meant asking the elderly, chronically ill, and others vulnerable to hospitalisation from coronavirus not to leave home; in fact shielding applies to those who are \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d. In addition, the behavioural insights team is not part of the government as an earlier version said, although it is part-owned by the Cabinet Office. And the same team did not develop the \u201cherd immunity\u201d plan, as was previously suggested.</p>",

  "<p>Back in the old days, I drank a lot of coffee. I basically ran on it. I am a terrible sleeper and regularly tackle days on three to four hours of sleep. The only way I can survive this is by drinking so much coffee that my synapses crackle and I take on the irritability levels of a bear in a trap. I thought nothing of buying a large average-quality coffee to tide me over until I got to another coffee shop where I could buy one I would actually enjoy.</p> <p>Today I look back on pre-lockdown Romesh as some sort of caffeine-fearing dweeb. There is no stopping me, now that I am never farther than a few feet away from more coffee. I switch on my pod machine, and savour every drop of black gold, ignoring the fact that I have no intention of composting the pods, which renders buying environmentally friendly ones completely pointless. My every cup is essentially a middle finger to mother nature.

I love how it smells better than it tastes; I love the frothy bit on top. I love how, for half an hour after drinking it, I feel I can achieve anything. I also love how I often drink too much of it, become intensely annoying, and then too wired to care. I have read that coffee can potentially reduce the chances of getting dementia, something that has affected a couple of people I care about, and have become intensely paranoid about getting. The other night, on a Zoom get-together with friends, I forgot a word I was looking for, and instead of explaining, just stopped mid-sentence for such a long time that one of my friends thought I had frozen. I then pretended to engage with the rest of the evening while Googling methods of preventing mental deterioration.</p> <p>It is awful when you overdo the coffee, however, and I have been overdoing it a lot. On more than one occasion, I have found myself unable to sleep at 3am, and convinced I have stumbled on an incredible comedic idea. I sit up in bed and note it down, before finally going to sleep, excited about putting the idea into action.

The truth is, I need to stop drinking coffee altogether to recalibrate, but there is no way anyone in the house could survive it. Instead, I have decided to limit myself to one cup a day. The internal debate has shifted to an argument with myself about <em>when</em> I have this single cup. I say internal, because I tried to engage my wife in the debate externally and she informed me that they would find a cure for Covid-19 before she found something she cares about less than what time I have my one coffee.

Ludicrous lobster hats and sinewy meat dresses were swapped for pink stetsons and denim cut-offs, while early producer RedOne\u2019s churning synthpop was replaced by Mark Ronson\u2019s rustic warmth. Collaborators included Florence Welch, Josh Homme and Father John Misty, while the album\u2019s stripped-back sound pushed the rockist assumption that quieter somehow equals more authentic.

In many ways, the ballad-free, dancefloor-primed Chromatica represents not only Gaga\u2019s most personal record, but her most straightforward. Obviously there\u2019s a conceptual framework \u2013 that title, despite sounding like a Mac software update, actually represents a planet anchored by equality and inhabited by \u201ckindness punks\u201d \u2013 but it feels much lighter than before.

The ludicrous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/elton-john\">Elton John</a> collaboration Sine From Above \u2013 which, with its panpipe-inflected beat and unstoppable euphoric rush, would win Eurovision on any given year \u2013 digs deeper into this simple idea that music can soothe even the most damaged soul.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoAm4om0wTs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AoAm4om0wTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Lady Gaga: Rain On Me ft Ariana Grande \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/23/lady-gagas-30-greatest-songs-ranked\">Lady Gaga's 30 greatest songs \u2013 ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That song ends with an unexpected shift into cranium-rattling drum\u2019n\u2019bass, a fleeting taste of experimentation that feels oddly missing elsewhere. While some of Gaga\u2019s best work was made quickly, often on the road in tour buses, the songs on Chromatica were passed around from producer to producer apparently to free up the process. (Strangely, this is the first album not to feature Gaga as a listed producer, with the credits naming everyone from BloodPop to EDM producer Axwell to noise merchant Skrillex, while maximalist alt-pop producer Sophie \u2013 who confirmed her involvement back in 2018 \u2013 is noticeably absent.) At times, as on the generic Eurodance double-whammy of Free Woman and Fun Tonight, it means the songs feel overworked: sometimes their often short running times deny them space to breathe (the claustrophobic Plastic Doll). Sour Candy, a collaboration with K-pop girl band Blackpink, falls disappointingly flat: aiming for the sweaty throb of deep house,&nbsp;it ends up sounding like a dashed off, cheaply produced interlude.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gaga is on much safer ground gliding around the joyous French house swirl of Replay, which has a startling lyric about burying trauma in graves and scratching at the dirt of her psyche. It\u2019s another example of how, after years of using her music to try to heal other people \u2013 be it her gay fanbase on Born This Way, or her family on Joanne, an album named after her dead aunt \u2013 Chromatica finally turns that gaze inwards without ending the party. Unsurprisingly Gaga\u2019s truest self was always going to be as loud as possible.</p>",

The premiers arrived with an 0-2 record but made a mockery of that over the 80 minutes with the returning Boyd Cordner and debutant Josh Morris demonstrating that at full strength Sydney\u2019s Easts remain a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>A six-point half-time lead felt unders for the Chooks after they defended with control and attacked with craft, in particular Luke Keary\u2019s kicking game. But the game was won in a blitz after the interval when they crossed twice before the Bunnies had mentally left the sheds. </p> <p>The Rabbitohs rallied and were the better team for large portions of the second half but this Roosters outfit has shown over a number of years that they are formidable defensively, and even with the fatigue of a first game back in ferociously fast conditions they stood firm.</p> <p>James Tedesco did James Tedesco things, scoring a beautiful solo try and gaining 295m - almost 100m more than anyone else on the field. Jake Friend led all comers for tackles and his captain\u2019s challenge late in the game was the decisive turning point, especially after he followed it up soon after with his own kick-chase try. </p> <p>That score showed up Latrell Mitchell, who had a mixed night under the spotlight against his former side. His fast hands in the line helped create his side\u2019s opening try, but he was found wanting positionally and fumbled one bomb. </p> <p>Stay tuned for more NRL action right here as sport slowly eases its way back into life following the Covid-19 shutdown.

Roosters 28-12 Rabbitohs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>77 mins:</strong> That captain\u2019s challenge has iced this game. The Bunnies make no ground from their own line and the Roosters hold it safely up their jumpers for most of a set before <strong>Jake Friend</strong> snipes off the back of a ruck and grubbers through to an unguarded in-goal to seal the deal.

JWH was penalised for losing possession at the ruck but replays indicated it was knocked from his grasp as he was staggering to his feet by the retreating Sironen. That feels like a huge momentum changer. At a stroke the Rabbitohs go from threatening attacking possession to having to find at least ten points in under five minutes from their own line.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f4e28f08f5e373010c6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:42:53.499Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>73 mins:</strong> It\u2019s a disappointing meat and potatoes set from the Bunnies and it ends with a kick gobbled up by Tedesco, scrambling to safety in a forest of legs and boots.

The balance of power has shifted in the past 10-15 minutes though with the Bunnies appearing to be coming home the fitter.

Some party tricks down the left edge resemble a Fiji rugby sevens training drill more than the NRL but it stretches the Rabbitohs\u2019 defence allowing Keary to nail his kick and earn a repeat set with a chase that ends with a tackle in-goal. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f2c78f08f5e373010c3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:33:37.845Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> Both sets of players look weary, especially the Roosters, after that long spell of defending they were forced to do.

We\u2019re underway at Bankwest Stadium around 7.55pm local time.</p> <p>As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware by now, footy\u2019s back! How are you feeling about it? Let me know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jphowcroft?lang=en\">@JPHowcroft</a> or email: <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com </a></p> <p>I thought last night\u2019s restart went as well as could be expected, once Brodie Croft chilled out prematch anyway. I am an advocate for the piped crowd noise. I thought that aspect was delivered very well indeed, and with the long passages where the camera didn\u2019t pan to empty rows of seats you could easily be forgiven for being hoodwinked into thinking it was business as usual.</p> <p>But clearly this is not business as usual, and not just in the staging of the competition. On the pitch these two heavyweights arrive with plenty of questions to be answered. The Roosters have set the standard over the past two seasons but went winless in their two fixtures before lockdown. The Rabbitohs went one from two but then found themselves at the centre of plenty of unwanted attention during the hiatus with Cody Walker suspended for two matches for an incident that resurfaced from back in December, while Latrell Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/police-investigate-nrl-stars-josh-addo-carr-and-latrell-mitchell-over-social-media-post\">reminded the world </a>rugby league players don\u2019t always make the best life choices.</p> <p>Which is a nice segue into tonight\u2019s match-up, which is of course Mitchell\u2019s first appearance for the Bunnies against the Chooks, the side he left in the offseason following a soap opera of negotiations that ended with the star landing nearby, but crucially in his preferred fullback role. He\u2019s probably the only person in the country pleased that fans are unable to attend tonight\u2019s match. </p> <p>But there\u2019s plenty more to consider when the longest rivalry in the history of Australian rugby league resumes. The Roosters should be close to full strength with skipper Boyd Cordner making his first start of the campaign, and he will line-up alongside experienced new recruit Josh Morris. They will be looking to avoid becoming the first premiers to go zip-three since 2009, and only the third in the NRL era. </p> <p>Let\u2019s get it on!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_bJf3foa5I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V_bJf3foa5I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>There\u2019ll be plenty of echos around the Bunnymen at a deserted Bankwest Stadium tonight.

Like many, he has felt the world going in \u201cthe wrong direction; from the Brexit vote and American politics to the environment, there\u2019s a multitude of things to overcome.\u201d And that\u2019s before we\u2019ve even got to the C-word. \u201cAs a young person starting out in the world,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe view isn\u2019t great.\u201d</p> <p>Your Hero Is Not Dead is \u201ca personal response\u201d to those \u201canxieties and fears\u201d, and finding a way through them. His lyrics aren\u2019t particularly prescriptive, although Big Nothing Glow, about encountering a childhood friend who lived rough on the streets, cuts more than most. The album luxuriates in mood and tone instead: it sounds both melancholy and sanguine, \u201cthe sweet point in pop music between happiness and sadness,\u201d says Westerman, \u201cwhere it seems to be both.\u201d</p> <p>The album was produced by Nathan Jenkins, AKA Bullion, who has been quietly shaping the sound of the UK\u2019s lo-fi pop underground since 2012. \u201cGood pop,\u201d Jenkins says, is about \u201csongs that devastate, not alienate\u201d. But they shouldn\u2019t be dismal. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to go to that darker place to seem like a serious artist. Hopeful music is a harder balance to strike but, when it\u2019s sincere, that can be infinitely more human.\u201d</p> <p>Westerman doesn\u2019t have any answers about the future, but his music feels gently reassuring. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t make a super-bleak record,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s happy to be releasing it now and not pushing it back. \u201cMusic for me is an incredibly helpful thing to have in difficult times, and I think this is a very difficult time. Hopefully, people can take something from it.\u201d Or at the very least, feel a warm hug.</p> <p><em>Your Hero Is Not Dead is out on Friday 5 June </em><em> </em></p>",

Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard.</strong> Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d</strong> The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Minnesota National Guard </strong><strong>sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor</strong><strong> declared a state of emergency. </strong>Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d</strong> into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:01:07.860Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0b0908f0898700351e5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:50:08.046Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets.

Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong>, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, <strong>George Floyd</strong>, in Minneapolis police custody.</p> \n  <p><strong>Louisville Metro Police</strong> confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m.</p> \n  <p>Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. </p> \n  <p>Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor <strong>Greg Fischer</strong> tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. </p> \n  <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.</p> \n  <p>Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in a Georgia neighborhood in February. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09c758f084e882655acf5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:24:53.075Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the US grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">third night of protests</a> over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">George Floyd protests: what we know so far</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09aed8f087e3ca0f65835\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:22:38.991Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972/0_182_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a/0_322_4895_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed099698f084e882655acec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:11:54.922Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Minneapolis mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents.

Thousands of students returned to school on Wednesday as the country began easing virus restrictions, but a day later, 79 new cases were recorded, the highest daily figure in two months.</p> <h2>Spain approves minimum basic income scheme</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister, the Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, , has announced that the coalition government\u2019s minimum basic income scheme has been approved by the cabinet.

  "<p><strong>Greg Daniels (showrunner): </strong>The UK version hadn\u2019t finished airing and I\u2019d never heard of it. My agent sent me a VHS tape of season one. It had a somewhat boring title so I didn\u2019t look at it. He told me he wanted to show it to someone else if I wasn\u2019t interested, so I popped it in. I watched the entire first series that evening.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Michael Schur (writer/producer): </strong>I think Seth Meyers was the first person who brought it to me. He had a friend doing improv olympics in Amsterdam and had brought back a bunch of DVDs. We watched it like it was the Superbowl. I just couldn\u2019t believe what I was looking at.</p> <p><strong>Daniels:</strong> I arranged to meet with Ricky [Gervais] and Stephen [Merchant] when they were in the US. We got along really well. They were big fans of The Simpsons, which I\u2019d worked on. I made my pitch to adapt it in a way that was very similar to the values I had doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/aug/20/your-next-box-set-king-of-the-hill\">King of the Hill</a>, which was very realistic. I was somewhat hampered by excessive respect for the original. The challenge of the pilot was \u201ccan I make something that looks and feels like the British show and has a great cast?\u201d After the show got ordered, I had another five episodes. Then the challenge was \u201clet\u2019s do all original scripts and see if we can keep that feeling of the British show but do it from an American point of view\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dfd11d83e39e5b50545ae68dc28378e578cd3bd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfd11d83e39e5b50545ae68dc28378e578cd3bd3/0_105_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Schur\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After the first season, we almost got cancelled\u2019: Michael Schur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phillip Faraone/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Schur:</strong> We added a more classic American sitcom formula and imposed a repeatable structure. The first six episodes were very true to the tone of the British show \u2013 every episode ends on a downbeat note and, that summer, we almost got cancelled. Then Steve Carell was in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, which was this unexpected hit. In our first meeting before season two, Greg said we need to take 20% of the Steve in The 40-Year-Old-Virgin and put it into Michael Scott [Carell\u2019s character]. We thought he was crazy but it was the best decision anyone ever made. \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said\u201d was a joke dorky radio DJs made and thought they were funny. I believe it was BJ [Novak, writer/Ryan Howard] who said \u201cMichael should definitely say \u2018That\u2019s what she said\u2019, but earnestly, thinking it\u2019s hilarious\u201d. It was always funny.</p> <p><strong>Mindy Kaling (</strong><strong>writer/Kelly Kapoor):</strong> I was 24. I hadn\u2019t much heard of the British Office until I went in to audition. I think the two seasons and the specials are perfect, but I also just needed a gig. I remember what was so great about the show was that you could be funny and real without having to be gorgeous. What Greg said \u2013 and I\u2019m sure Ricky and Stephen felt this way when they were doing the original \u2013 is what\u2019s real is what\u2019s beautiful, not what\u2019s beautiful. I found that very empowering.</p> <p><strong>BJ Novak (</strong><strong>writer/Ryan Howard):</strong> I was well aware that everyone considered it a bad idea. It was either too slow, quiet and offbeat to ever work on American television, or too smart, stupid and blasphemous for us to attempt \u2013 but I felt that at least we were aspiring to something great. We were imitating something we truly admired.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Kaling:</strong> He [Michael] wore his emotions a little bit more on his sleeve than David Brent. I used to look at episodes and be like, \u201cdoes he cry every episode?\u201d He was so emotional and not afraid of showing it. He thought of himself as Mel Gibson in Braveheart but he was such a sensitive and vulnerable character. I think that\u2019s something that made Michael approachable and made you root for him.&nbsp;I felt uniquely qualified in the writing staff because I was the only woman and the only minority. I felt I had this trove of times I\u2019d been offended in a workplace environment, but I think the thing The Office did really well was well-meaning people who are trying not to offend you as a minority woman, but do it anyway. I felt I could put that to use on the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b0d21ce88bc7b0062ea7959b47c5e5326cb771e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b0d21ce88bc7b0062ea7959b47c5e5326cb771e/0_105_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mindy Kaling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I hadn\u2019t heard of the British version\u2019: Mindy Kaling, standing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Novak:</strong> Steve naturally brings so much truth and emotion to everything he plays that we could write the most extreme comedy scenarios for him, such as stepping on a George Foreman grill and declaring himself disabled or falling in love with a chair model from a catalogue and asking the office to help him find her. In anyone else\u2019s hands that might sink the character, but Steve had a three dimensionality that let him dig himself out of any situation.</p> <p><strong>Daniels:</strong> There was a small part within [the episode] Diversity Day where Michael had been making horribly offensive jokes and Toby (Paul Leiberstein) made one tiny, innocent joke and Michael turned on him very self-righteously. It escalated from there. Steve would lean into that dynamic whenever he had a chance to improv.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Novak:</strong> The only thing we never wanted to reveal was why Michael hated Toby, because we thought it\u2019d take the fun out of it.</p> <p><strong>Schur:</strong> It wasn\u2019t hard to keep things grounded because we had rules. Every episode is one day \u2013 and we almost always stuck to that \u2013 and it was a documentary. Greg hired documentary camera operators and the rule was: if this isn\u2019t a realistic shot that these people could\u2019ve got, then we can\u2019t do it. At the time, the show 24 was getting big. I tried to sell Greg on an episode that\u2019d happen in real time. My pitch was Kevin would get a chicken pot pie and it\u2019d say on the instructions \u201cmicrowave for 21 minutes and 30 seconds\u201d. The episode would begin with him putting it into the microwave, setting it for 20:30 and hitting start. The story would play out over 21 minutes in real time and at the end of every act, he\u2019d go back into the kitchen and we\u2019d slowly push in on the microwave clock counting down.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Daniels:</strong> There were times where [the writers] would become enamoured with a joke and I\u2019d have to put my foot down. For instance, they really wanted Michael to kill Meredith with his car. That was an early pitch, where he runs her over in the parking lot and then comes back, gets a tyre iron and finishes the job. I was like \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Mindy:</strong> Getting to know the other performers between takes and taking that knowledge back to the writers room was so useful. That was especially true with people like Ed Helms [who played Andy Bernard]. He\u2019d be in his trailer playing the banjo and you\u2019d go \u201cOh my God, Andy has to play the banjo!\u201d That\u2019s such a specific choice.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Novak:</strong> [Writing for the ensemble cast] was an absolute joy because they were so clearly drawn in the hands of these actors. We knew them so well that any idea in your writer-brain would naturally have a home in someone. Whether it\u2019s a snarkily correct point that Oscar could make, something beyond human comprehension that Creed could say, something overly literal for Dwight or a voice or reason for Jim or Pam \u2013 there was always someone who could embody any idea.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"750b8280cc17a23e848b3e6418ba5a06ac654471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/750b8280cc17a23e848b3e6418ba5a06ac654471/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left to right: BJ Novak as Ryan, Rainn Wilson as Dwight and Steve Carell as Michael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Schur:</strong> It was pretty clear early that this show was striking a chord with people but I don\u2019t think any of us really understood the impact until the new version of television emerged which is everybody watching everything on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and whatever. I played Mos, Dwight\u2019s weird ghoulish farming cousin and I\u2019ve been recognised more in the last three years for playing Mos than I ever did when I was actually playing Mos. It\u2019s very strange.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Novak:</strong> It showed that a very subtle and realistic sense of humour could be popular and once people realised that, it opened up a path for a lot of shows to work in that style. When it aired in the US it was very against the grain \u2013 not only was there no studio audience, there wasn\u2019t even any music.</p> <p><strong>Kaling</strong>: It\u2019s such an amazing feeling to have been a part of it. Greg let us have such free rein. I wrote this episode called Diwali and I remember thinking \u201cI\u2019m so lucky that Greg is open to me doing this episode\u201d I don\u2019t know many people at that time that would\u2019ve let an entire episode be about a Hindu holiday.</p> <p><strong>Daniels:</strong> It was really lightning in a bottle to get that cast together and the writers, as well. It was a very talented crew that made it and loved it and put in the extra effort.</p> <p><em>The US Office is available on Amazon in the UK</em></p>",

Like many frontline workers, she made the difficult decision to move out of her home, where she lived with her two young children and husband. She wouldn\u2019t return for five weeks.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, that was the hardest part for me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Last week, Perron was finally able to go home and work toward a new equilibrium. Meanwhile, she said, the situation in Boston and at the shelter was slowly becoming more manageable.</p> <p>There\u2019s still a long road ahead, she said. With the economic downturn, she\u2019s worried there will be more homeless people than usual, and at a time when the shelters are hoping to keep their numbers lower to prevent outbreaks. And, amid the city lockdown, it has been hard to process housing applications.</p> <p>\u201cMy staff, they work for not that much money, they work long hours,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know you\u2019re essential when you take the job.\u201d <em><strong>Ankita Rao</strong></em></p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>We don\u2019t go into a situation thinking we\u2019re going to cure anybody\u2019</h2> <p>Dr Jane deLima Thomas\u2019 role as a doctor is focused on healing, but it\u2019s not always about treatment.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t go into a situation thinking we\u2019re going to cure anybody,\u201d she said from Boston, where she leads teams at Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.</p> <p>Palliative care physicians are tasked with making patient\u2019s lives better in the moment, even if they\u2019re not likely to recover.

Hospitals didn\u2019t allow family visits, making phone calls about end of life decisions more difficult, especially when there were language barriers.</p> <p>The tools deLima Thomas relies on were also strained. \u201cPresence, touch, compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s harder to do over video or on the phone.

Terminal 3 has been mothballed during lockdown, with all BA flights running from Terminal 5 on dramatically reduced schedules.</p> <p>BA, which has received state aid worth hundreds of millions of pounds, proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">cutting as many as 12,000 jobs last month</a> in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Among the thousands of job cuts, the proposals include plans to make at least 450 workers at Heathrow redundant before outsourcing the work they did, according to a person with knowledge of the proposals.</p> <p>BA has said job cuts are necessary because passenger numbers are expected to be significantly lower for as long as four years, meaning demand will be lower.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s Investor Service, the influential credit ratings agency, on Thursday downgraded its rating on IAG and BA debt from investment-grade to junk bond status \u2013 meaning it faces higher borrowing costs \u2013 underscoring the financial difficulties facing the airline sector with the vast majority of planes still grounded.</p> <p>However, the proposals to outsource the jobs of furloughed workers performing operations still required by the airline prompted criticism.</p> <p>Jim McMahon, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cThe government should have done more to protect these jobs. We cannot see roles which are currently paid through the job retention scheme outsourced.\u201d</p> <p>Jobs at risk in the outsourcing proposals include ticketing services, returning lost baggage to passengers and planning the balance of weight in the plane, known as centralised load control. Load control is currently carried out by teams in offices in London and Prague. The team in the Czech Republic is run by Air Dispatch, a third party supplier who would become a prime contender for some offshoring work.</p> <p>The outsourcing and potential offshoring proposals come despite IAG receiving British government support worth hundreds of millions of pounds. IAG has borrowed \u00a3300m from the Bank of England\u2019s Covid corporate finance facility. The government is paying 80% of the salaries (up to \u00a32,500 per month) of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/british-airways-expected-to-lay-off-36000-staff-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">30,000 furloughed BA workers</a>, support worth \u00a335m to the company in April alone.</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, national officer for the GMB union, which represents some BA workers, said: \u201cBA\u2019s actions so far have been deeply cynical and opportunistic. Taking taxpayer money through furlough and Covid loans and then offshoring hundreds of jobs to other countries is about as unpatriotic as you can get. This behaviour from our national flag-carrier is unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>A BA spokesman said: \u201cWe are acting now to protect as many jobs as possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to consulting openly with our unions and our people as we prepare for a new future.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>I joined the army shortly after leaving school. Initially I enjoyed the feeling of brotherhood but, seven months after joining, I was deployed to Afghanistan. In the first week, I saw someone get shot in the head, and held his arm while he died. I was 18 years old. In the six months I was there, I experienced horrific events which led me to question my purpose in life.</p> <p>I\u2019ve suffered with depression in the past, but when I returned to England, I struggled with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\" title=\"\">PTSD</a>. After being medically discharged, I searched online for ways to help out in the Amazon and came across a volunteer organisation called <a href=\"https://www.faunaforever.org/\" title=\"\">Fauna Forever</a>, in Peru. I booked a flight with the small payout I\u2019d fought for. I wanted to help animals but, ultimately, I went to Peru with the intention of ending my life.</p> <p>After a few weeks volunteering, however, I realised that, although I was in a bad place, the jungle was making me happy. I fitted in so much better. I went back and forth between England and Peru over the coming years, but it was on my fourth trip, when I was out in the Amazon for six months, that Keanu came into my life.</p> <p>I was working at an eco-lodge I\u2019d helped build on a past visit. Some members of the local community had brought a kitten to the lodge. I held him and cried. He was so tiny. His mother had been killed due to logging; he\u2019d been destined for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/07/wildlife-trafficking-rise-across-latin-america\" title=\"\">illegal wildlife trade</a> and hadn\u2019t even opened his eyes yet. I\u2019d previously attempted to rehabilitate another orphaned ocelot in the wild, but Khan was killed by a poacher\u2019s trap when he was 11 months old. This was my second chance. I named him Keanu, after the Matrix films.</p> <p>Ocelots need a lot of wild space, so we decided to build a platform two hours upriver, deep in the jungle. It was one metre above ground, had a roof and solar panels. Ocelots are nocturnal, so Keanu and I would go out for seven or eight hours a night looking for rodents for him to eat \u2013 although we would also catch birds, snakes, lizards, frogs and bats.</p> <p>A mother ocelot hunts with her offspring, so in the early days I had to help out a lot. I was so proud when, aged five months, he killed his first rodent by himself. That was a big step and it made me feel I was on the right path with him.</p> <p>I would get time to chill out when Keanu was sleeping. I used solar energy to charge my laptop to watch something, listen to music or cook. I was living both a human and an ocelot life. Every two weeks I\u2019d go by boat to the local community to get supplies for myself: rice, lentils and sometimes a live chicken. I also hunted for birds and went fishing.</p> <p>The stream near the platform was my lifeline. I didn\u2019t have running water, so I\u2019d collect buckets from the stream for washing myself, my clothes and dishes. If it rained, I\u2019d collect the rainwater to drink, as it was so much fresher.</p> <p>I was alone a lot, but not always. Some film-makers who were recording my experience in a documentary, <a href=\"https://www.raisingkhan.com/\" title=\"\">Raising Khan</a>, would visit every month. The only thing that scared me in the jungle was my mental health. There were days when I still felt depressed, but I wouldn\u2019t have changed it.</p> <p>People ask if Keanu ever harmed me. The truth is, yes. Ocelots have sharp claws and teeth, and our skin isn\u2019t as thick as theirs. He would bite, scratch and get defensive over food. I\u2019ve got scars on my arms, legs and face from when the play-fighting became too boisterous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/08/experience-i-found-a-stranger-in-my-front-room\">Experience: I found a stranger in my front room</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At first I was very protective of Keanu, but as he got older he would go off and explore, coming back to me as he wanted. He would curl up with me on the forest floor. As time went on, the gap between us grew. By 14 months, he was capable of living by himself, and at that point I had to think about my own physical and mental health. Although the jungle is beautiful, it can wear you down.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always liked to be alone and have adventures. I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019ve changed, but I learned a lot. Those two cats taught me more than anyone in my life. The last time I saw Keanu, I gave him some chicken and he went to attack me, to keep me away from his food. That was a good sign. </p> <p>\u2022 As told to Amy Sedghi.</p> <p><br><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\" title=\"\">jo@samaritans.ie</a></em><em>.

  "<p>An hour into his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8e8e5214-346d-4be8-adf7-addfc839ff6d\">hearing</a>&nbsp;in front of parliament\u2019s influential liaison committee on Wednesday, the prime minister is likely to have felt a moment of relief as the examination moved on from the scandals of recent days.</p> <p>Then, an earnest, urgent question from Stephen Timms, Labour MP for East Ham, brought Johnson\u2019s attention to the plight of a couple in Timms\u2019 constituency. The husband had lost his income during the Covid-19 crisis and the wife\u2019s income was less than their monthly rent. With \u201cNo recourse to public funds\u201d stamped on their visas, they were unable to access any support as they worked out how to make ends meet and provide for their two children (both born in the UK) and the threat of destitution hung over them.</p> <p>\u201cEr, hang on, Stephen,\u201d Johnson replied. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they, why aren\u2019t they eligible for universal credit or for employment support allowance?\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t even in the top five most reported takeaways from the hearing, but for many people, this moment (captured live on TV) was simply unbelievable. \u201cThey have no recourse to public funds,\u201d responded Timms, who then did his best to explain to the prime minister that though they paid taxes and abided by the same laws as everyone else, most people who move to Britain from elsewhere (and anyone without documented status) are explicitly prohibited for up to 10 years from seeking the protection of the social security safety net in a time of personal or national crisis.</p> <p>No recourse to public funds <a href=\"https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/asylum-migration-and-refugees/no-recourse-public-funds\">(NRPF)</a> was introduced by New Labour in 1999. In 2012,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unity-project.org.uk/suspend-nrpf\">Theresa May expanded</a> it&nbsp;to include even those who moved here to live with their British families. The policy has been debated and defended&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/Contributions?startDate=1998-05-28&amp;endDate=2020-05-28&amp;searchTerm=%22No%20Recourse%20to%20Public%20Funds%22&amp;partial=False\">more than 200 times</a>&nbsp;by both Labour and Conservative governments, and at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/search/Contributions?startDate=2019-07-24&amp;endDate=2020-05-28&amp;searchTerm=%22No%20Recourse%20to%20Public%20Funds%22&amp;partial=False\">least 80 times</a>&nbsp;since Johnson became prime minister. Timms and other MPs have repeatedly raised the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-04-28/debates/6B80ADC6-5AE0-404A-BF91-3924FAD111CE/PublicServices?highlight=%22no%20recourse%20to%20public%20funds%22#contribution-8DD0E99A-FED0-4CC0-929B-44F18E5D2B56\">risks</a>&nbsp;posed to families with NRPF, only to have their concerns brushed off by ministers. At the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, dozens of concerned organisations&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/protecting-migrants-from-covid-19\">wrote to Priti Patel, the </a><a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/protecting-migrants-from-covid-19\">home </a><a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/protecting-migrants-from-covid-19\">secretary</a>, urging her to suspend the policy. We are yet to hear back from her. And, though the public may be forgiven for having never heard them, the very words \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d are deeply, often painfully understood by&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;who has moved to the UK,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/a-lifeline-for-all-summary.pdf\">including at least 100,000 children</a>.</p> <p>When the usually verbose prime minister can\u2019t find words to defend something, you can safely conclude that there are none. But the real kick in the chest, for anyone with NRPF who has worried about making ends meet in a crisis, will have come from learning that he didn\u2019t even know that the policy (or the people it affects) existed. That ministers and advisers hadn\u2019t thought it was important enough to tell the prime minister that people were contracting and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/equality-watchdog-urged-investigate-impact-on-bame-people-london-mayor\">dying of Covid-19</a>&nbsp;because they were forced to work by NRPF conditions or that an&nbsp;eight-year old British boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/home-offices-denial-of-benefits-to-migrant-families-unlawful-court-rules\">needed to sue</a> the government&nbsp;to stop his family from starving during a pandemic. Or worse still, that perhaps they&nbsp;had&nbsp;told him and he just hadn\u2019t thought it was important enough to pay attention or remember.</p> <p>The ability to turn a blind eye, to enjoy the luxury of not knowing what your choices mean for the lives of others, is a recipe for bad government. And governments of both main parties have found it far too easy to turn the screws on migrants to satisfy the baying crowd before looking the other way. So what else does the prime minister not know about how his government treats migrants and our families?</p> <p>As the soon-to-be-married father of a newborn son, does the prime minister know that if you are a migrant married to a British national, you cannot live here with them&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/news/protecting-families-at-risk-due-to-covid-19\">until they reach an income level</a>&nbsp;that\u2019s out of reach for 40% of workers in this country?

jobs, so you KNOW things are getting back to what it considers normal.</p> \n  <p>As for the accounts, well, it\u2019s not so rosy:</p> \n  <p>The fiscal impact of our historically significant support measures is also temporary, limited to the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years and is not baking material structural burdens into the budget bottom line beyond that period.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, the April monthly financial statements reflect both the impact of the current economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on both revenue and payments as well as the fiscal impact of the additional economic support measures we have put in place since MYEFO 2019-20.</p> \n  <p><strong>Total payments to the end of April 2020 were $12bn higher than assumed in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</strong></p> \n  <p>These include payments through a range of measures including:</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 Boosting cash flow for employers</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 Economic stimulus payments \u2013 a one-off $750 stimulus payment to pensioners, social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 National Medical Stockpile \u2013 Purchase of Masks, Other Personal Protective Equipment and Pharmaceuticals; </p> \n  <p> \u00b7 National partnership agreement on a joint Covid-19 public health response; and</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 Partnership with private health sector to ensure viability and capacity during the Covid-19 response.</p> \n  <p>The impact of the pandemic on government revenue as a result of related economic parameter variations also remains significant, with receipts nearly $20bn lower than the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</p> \n  <p>This is driven by below profile collections across both income and indirect taxes.</p> \n  <p><strong>The underlying cash balance for the financial year to 30 April 2020 is a deficit of $40bn instead of a deficit to that point of $7.6bn in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p

The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong\u2019s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people\u2019s liberties and, in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous. </p> \n   <p>China\u2019s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people \u2013 including those set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. </p> \n   <p><strong>We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; </strong>the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.</p> \n   <p><strong>The world\u2019s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing\u2019s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect.</strong></p> \n   <p>As Hong Kong\u2019s stability and prosperity are jeopardised by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honour China\u2019s international obligations under the UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T22:00:08.635Z\">at 11.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed02b088f0898700351e311\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T21:23:38.239Z\">10.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Courier Mail reports <strong>Nathan Turner,</strong> who died at his Blackwater home on Tuesday, and then later tested positive for Covid-19 (he had not previously been tested) <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/australia/coronavirus-nathan-turner-held-party-days-before-dying-from-covid19/news-story/69f8e4fc9a6500f03c351e2bf548bf14\">and his partner held a party at their home four days earlier. <br></a></p> \n  <p>The 30-year-old had been showing respiratory illness symptoms for some time before his death.

  "<p>An hour before the first episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season three aired on US cable network Logo TV, Raja turned up for her gig at Micky\u2019s, a popular gay bar in West Hollywood. Months had passed since filming had finished on the series, and despite knowing she was the winner, baby, little else in her life had changed.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was January 2011, and the US reality competition was still very much in its infancy. While today (global pandemics aside) queens are booked up for a whirlwind of international tours as soon as their casting on the show is announced \u2013 global rights deals giving the cultural phenomena a vast and lucrative international audience \u2013 back then, things were more low key. She might have pocketed $75,000 in prize money, but after filming finished, Raja went back to working as a makeup artist, doing drag on the side as before.&nbsp;</p> <p>Having been booked to perform at a screening of the season premier at Micky\u2019s, she arrived unsure of what to expect by way of a reception. \u201cI came on in my entrance outfit \u2013 a black catsuit with an eyeball hat \u2013 and nobody gave a flying fuck,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It was only after her victory was announced (the news was leaked online by Perez Hilton) that the phone started ringing. The 10-stop tour of US cities that followed was like nothing she had experienced. Seeing a queue around the block waiting for her to perform in New York gave her an inkling of what was to come. A few months later she was booked up for shows and appearances for over a year in advance.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"617de413e4f8088c8a85c14826c3a185d068d15b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/617de413e4f8088c8a85c14826c3a185d068d15b/0_0_2632_1579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drag Race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">They\u2019re winners, baby (from left): Sharon Needles, Raja and Bianca Del Rio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Broadimage/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cStill,\u201d Raja says, \u201cif you see what the girls appearing on the show now are making compared to what we made at that time, it\u2019s a dramatic change. They can charge $6,000 to $10,000 for an appearance. But for us it was new ground; we were able to have fun without the same pressures.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Sasha Velour took the top spot in 2017\u2019s season 9, things had escalated. The first season to be aired on VH1, Drag Race \u2013 and the industry it helped to create \u2013 was booming. As soon as the year\u2019s cast was announced, Sasha said goodbye to selling her merchandise from the back of her minivan. Her regular show upsized to a venue with 10 times the capacity she had been working to before and she had bookings to perform around the world. \u201cThe opportunities and the audience,\u201d she says, \u201cthe sheer number of people who knew about what I was doing \u2013 changed overnight.\u201d</p> <p>Post-Perez, even the finalists were kept in the dark about who the winner would be until the last minute. Sasha watched her victory be announced live on TV from a New York hotel with the rest of the cast before being rushed to her crowning at a club round the corner.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cNot to sound like Lady Gaga,\u201d she says, \u201cbut from then it was another plane, next gig, take a bus. It was another four months before things stopped for a while and there was time to think about what might come next.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ddb6464733f58135715f486add125af0b943b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ddb6464733f58135715f486add125af0b943b3/0_296_5226_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alaska\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alaska remember her time after Drag Race as a \u2018crazy, party train wreck\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ole Jensen/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What struck Sasha as time went on was how much the skills she had honed before her time on the show prepared her for everything that came after. Winning the show came with a $100,000 prize and unrivalled exposure, but she still designed her own work; her partner \u2013 Johnny \u2013 continued as stage manager. \u201cThe smoke and mirrors of it all makes it look like a big glow up that comes with the opportunity,\u201d she says, \u201cbut actually all that shifts are the number of opportunities for you to take. There\u2019s no infrastructure there to help you.\u201d Yet, she says, </p> <p>\u201cnon-stop touring is the dream of any drag artist, getting to both perform and see drag scenes around the world in queer spaces\u201d and it broadened her understanding of drag.</p> <p>Alaska Thunderfuck remembers that time pretty well, although, if she is honest, it\u2019s all a little hazy. A runner-up on season 5, and the winner of All Stars 2 (where queens return for another shot at the crown), she describes what happened after her appearances as \u201ca crazy party train wreck\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>As soon as the cast was announced I was making more money than I ever had doing drag,\u201d she says from Los Angeles, \u201cand there\u2019s a lot that comes with that. My relationship with Sharon [Needles, winner of season 4] went to shit, suddenly everywhere you go the answer is yes: free drinks? drugs? boys? All of a sudden, every door is open, and we didn\u2019t have the tools or discipline, so we went in all those doors.\u201d</p> <p>Before winning Drag Race season 5 in 2013, Jinkx\u2019s Monsoon\u2019s career in Seattle had hit its stride: regular shows were supplemented by theatre work and a part-time janitor gig. \u201cImportantly, though, drag was always something I did with my tribe,\u201d the 32-year-old explains from Portland, Oregon. \u201cI went from being part of a community and performing with friends to being guest star in a different city every night.\u201d It quickly became a lonely experience, disconnected from the things that had made doing drag fun. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAfter winning came two years of putting an insane amount of pressure on myself every time I had to perform, which drove me crazy,\u201d says Jinkx. \u201cI felt I had to hit this high standard for myself every time. I lost touch with what I found exciting about drag in the first place and went into a depression.\u201d</p> <p>Jinkx has spoken to every previous winner about the experience of clinching the crown, and believes each has grappled with similar emotions. And, in Jinkx\u2019s eyes, those feelings are heightened if you are presented as the underdog who succeeds against the odds. You go from being supported as the relatable weirdo to queen bee.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI feel like the drag race fanbase turned on me after I won,\u201d Jinkx says. Some said winning had changed Jinkx; others that they weren\u2019t good enough to have taken the top spot in the first place. \u201cAll the attention was on me, and it felt like none of it was positive. It could well be only three people in the world were actually talking about me that way, but that\u2019s somehow what I saw.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e98af5a011bba6681a36765aa14554411d923989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e98af5a011bba6681a36765aa14554411d923989/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve always been a very political person\u2019: Bob the Drag Queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for World Of Wonder Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the status of the show has rapidly increased, so too have the opportunities available to its winners. Alaska has released three studio albums and was cast in a Sharknado film; Trinity The Tuck played Lady Gaga in Taylor Swift\u2019s 2019 music video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkk9gvTmCXY\">You Need to Calm Down</a>, an experience she describes as \u201cunbelievable\u201d.</p> <p>For Bob the Drag Queen, winner of season 8, making the most of the platform Drag Race offered felt particularly important. \u201cI always wanted to stay true to myself,\u201d she says, sat next to her crown in her New York basement. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a very political person, I didn\u2019t want to become something I didn\u2019t believe in.\u201d Alongside performing, releasing music and a 2020 HBO documentary series, <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/were-here\">We\u2019re Here</a>, Bob\u2019s weekly podcast, <a href=\"https://www.siblingrivalrypodcast.com/\">Sibling Rivalry</a>, cohosted with her best friend and fellow drag queen Mon\u00e9t X Change, has become a treasured outlet. \u201cWe talk race relations, gender politics, about what\u2019s actually happening here in America \u2026 Winning Drag Race, has allowed me to amplify that.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, this year\u2019s winner \u2013 and all the contestants \u2013 will miss out on their money-spinning, fan-securing victory laps. That\u2019s a major challenge facing the queens of season 12, say all these winners: putting on a show is what drag queens do best. And with another series of All Stars starting to air in June, they will have to find innovative ways to stay relevant in an increasingly saturated market.</p> <p>Sasha hopes this won\u2019t hurt this crop\u2019s prospects too much: she didn\u2019t release her first solo show until 18 months after winning. Her belief is the best way to build and sustain a career is to take your time, produce your own work, and build an audience outside of the fandom. \u201cNew ways of creating nightlife online are emerging for the season 12 queens to take advantage of she says, \u201cand when clubs and theatres can open again they\u2019ll be welcomed.\u201d</p> <p>Win or lose this year, Alaska reckons post-lockdown all the contestants could have successful careers ahead of them. It\u2019s foolish, she says, to go into RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race thinking it\u2019s a golden ticket for the rest of your life: the show is just a starting point, even if the departure is delayed a little.&nbsp;For the winner, she says, all the doors she opened will still be there waiting for this year\u2019s victor. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t win, whatever, at least you get to do All Stars.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Drag Race season 12 finale will be available on Netflix from 8am on 30 May</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 May 2020 to correct the name of Sasha Velour\u2019s partner from Jonny to Johnny.</p>",

  "<p>I was in Toronto for both waves of Sars in 2003. You didn\u2019t quibble with the disease. Globally, it killed one in 10 of its victims. Toronto had 44 deaths. The Toronto Sars experience was similar to, but different from, Covid. One huge difference is that in 2003, the internet and smartphones were still in semi-infancy. There was a crazy deadly virus out there and like now, people wore masks and stayed inside. But importantly, they weren\u2019t spending all their waking hours terrifying themselves with dire forecasts, quack statistical modelling, blatant misinformation and political toxic waste \u2013 and the Sars experience was clearly, distinctly, far less scary than Covid-19. There\u2019s a lesson there.</p> <p>Eight years later in Vancouver \u2013 and this will ultimately connect up \u2013 I hosted a \u201cYouTube Night\u201d at a friend\u2019s nightclub. My MacBook Pro was linked to a jumbo screen, and guests shouted out directions for where to surf next. It was a terrible idea. Going online remains an entirely solitary activity and everyone that evening left feeling unsatisfied. The nightclub had asked me to do posters advertising the event. I liked that idea, but I wanted them to have huge words so that people could read them while driving by in their cars, so I used the nightclub\u2019s house font, a bold sans serif called Knockout, which had originated on boxing posters. I created 10 slogan-like statements that made sense in 2011, but which would have been meaningless to someone 20 years ago. We then pasted them on to construction hoardings around Vancouver. The most popular slogan remains: <strong>i miss my pre-internet brain</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0504d51c66f4386497b2f591e612bb5f6c270c8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0504d51c66f4386497b2f591e612bb5f6c270c8b/0_0_4881_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"coupland slogan 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Slogans are interesting because they are like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/22/shannon-information-theory\">information theory</a>. In an almost mathematical sense, you need to compress as much information into as few words as possible, but it\u2019s not advertising; for me, it\u2019s an exercise in locating nascent collective perceptions in our culture at large. One inspiration for this came from the work of US artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/17/im-aghast-scared-and-disgusted-neon-colossus-jenny-holzer-on-america-today-tate-artist-rooms\">Jenny Holzer</a>, whom I\u2019d studied in art school in the early 1980s. Holzer created a series of works she called Truisms, which featured highly reduced compressions of master texts such as Machiavelli\u2019s <em>The Prince</em> (<strong>abuse of power comes as no surprise</strong>).</p> <p>Soon after the dismal YouTube event, I realised that there are far more than just 10 slogans about contemporary life that would make no sense to someone from 1991: there were hundreds. So the Slogan Project grew as it began to enter the museums and galleries world. I also began delving into specific themes such as robotics for the Vitra Design Museum in Basel, ecology at Montreal\u2019s Canadian Centre for Architecture, and the near future at the Shanghai Himalayas Museum. Last January, I did a series on sleep at Somerset House in London.</p> <p>And then we had a plague.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e4687c77bc43c4cd5d9c1fa4aa2b308618c72f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e4687c77bc43c4cd5d9c1fa4aa2b308618c72f1/0_0_4881_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"coupland slogan 3\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Overnight the inventory of once-esoteric slogans somehow magically came to life in a way at once menacing, unexpected, deadpan, activating and prescient. Slogans such as <strong>hoard anything you can\u2019t download</strong>, or, <strong>healthy people are bad for capitalism</strong> or <strong>the present and the future are now the same thing</strong> unexpectedly chimed with our experience of the plague: the 1%, the left, the right, the middle class, the disenfranchised, the globe, the young, the old, the you and the me. Once I saw this, I began to post my older 2013 slogans on to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/douglascoupland/\">Instagram</a>. I also dug out my older novels and essays and found a few slogans buried within them, such as,<strong> use jets while you still can </strong>from <em>Generation X</em>, 1991, which was retooled as:<strong> we used jets while we still could</strong>.<strong> </strong>A 2017 essay \u201cGrexit\u201d yielded <strong>doing nothing is different from having nothing to do</strong> and <strong>doing nothing is very hard to do</strong>. And so forth.</p> <p>Now, after months of posting slogans on my Instagram feed, my coloured squares, with their blocky all-cap texts, read as a group as a strong reflection of our relationship with Covid-19 \u2013 one that has perhaps permanently altered the way we view time, class, our bodies, our families, our jobs, our homes, the media, the internet, news, truth, boredom, paranoia and so much more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c9165e39210c66f56ba3ba5a647bd121ae44ff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c9165e39210c66f56ba3ba5a647bd121ae44ff2/0_0_4881_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"coupland slogan 4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2018/may/18/i-was-feeling-at-one-with-the-cosmos-then-the-first-plastic-bottle-washed-up\">Why I filled a 50,000 litre aquarium with plastic debris | Douglas Coupland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Seventeen years on from the Sars crisis, we see a world scaring itself to death with far too much specious information, and we also see a world without an off button, always fidgeting and looking, for better or for worse, for quick hits of anything to make some kind of sense of it all.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/douglascoupland/\">@dougcoupland</a></em></p>",

Elsewhere in the US, dozens were arrested at a large demonstration in New York City, while at a protest which broke out in Denver, Colorado, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/colorado-george-floyd-protest-shots-fired\">shots were fired near the state Capitol</a>, though no injuries were reported.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Will not throw away gains\u2019 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Boris Johnson has declared that the coronavirus peak has passed and revealed plans to ease England\u2019s lockdown from Monday, with socially distanced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">gatherings of up to six permitted</a>&nbsp;in parks and gardens, and dentistry permitted a week later. \u201cI cannot, and will not, throw away all the gains we have made together \u2013 and so the changes we have made are limited and cautious,\u201d he said.

Sacoolas was subsequently charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Interpol has issued a wanted notice and Raab has called for Sacoolas\u2019s extradition back to the UK.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump turns antisocial \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to strip social media companies of protection from liability over what their users post. It is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">retaliation after Twitter fact-checked the president</a> for tweeting falsehoods.

A historian, Jenny Hocking, has fought for years for Australia\u2019s national archive to release 211 letters between the Queen, her private secretary and Kerr leading up to the dismissal. Australia\u2019s most senior court has now ordered the archive to reconsider the request by Hocking, who says the letters are vital in understanding what role the Queen played in one of the most important episodes in Australia\u2019s history.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Butterflies back \u2013&nbsp;</strong>A type of large heath butterfly known as the \u201cManchester argus\u201d is being reintroduced to peatlands in greater Manchester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/29/large-heath-butterflies-return-to-manchester-after-150-years\">150 years after going locally extinct</a>.

The Philippines reported 539 infections on Thursday, its highest ever daily tally, to make a total of 15,588. It has recorded 921 deaths. \u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d Duterte said in a late-night televised address, citing what he described as the country\u2019s low mortality rate. His health minister, Francisco Duque, said 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 cases were \u201cmild\u201d.</p> <h2>Global cases pass 5.8 million</h2> <p>The number of people infected by Covid-19 has exceeded 5.8 million, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">data compiled by Johns Hopkins University</a>. At least 360,000 people have died from the virus.

Throughout the continent, campaign groups are warning that the burdens of the home office and home schooling together with additional household duties and extra cooking, has been unequally carried by women and that improvements made over the past decades are in danger of being rolled back by the health crisis.</p> <h2>US unemployment hits 40 million</h2> <p>The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million, with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The growth in the number of claims has slowed, but millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number to a rate not seen since the Great Depression. The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures.</p> <h2>No mask, no entry</h2> <p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks.&nbsp;He said: \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself \u2026 You don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine.

Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 have died.</p> <h2>UK and France ease lockdowns</h2> <p>Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart, the prime minister has said.

Shortly after becoming prime minister Abiy also confessed that security officials had in the past committed torture, and <a href=\"https://www.africanews.com/2018/04/15/ethiopia-pm-pledges-to-reform-security-sector-and-revisit-repressive-laws//\">promised</a> to ensure the sector was fully accountable in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the OLA has since returned to armed conflict, and accuses the government of failing to deliver its promises of more democracy and self-rule for Oromos.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fighting in western and southern parts of Oromia has involved targeted killings of local officials and community leaders and what the UN has described&nbsp;as <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-access-snapshot-guji-zone-oromia-region-28-february-2020\">\u201cserious human rights violations</a>\u201d.

It also said that on a single day in December 2018, soldiers from the federal military killed 13 people in the town of Finchawa in West Guji. One of those killed was an old woman selling milk on the street, according to an eyewitness who spoke to Amnesty.</p> <p>Security forces are estimated to have detained more than 10,000 men and women suspected of supporting or working for the OLA, among other abuses documented by the organisation.</p> <p>Many were detained for several months without being charged, in violation of both national and international human rights laws, under conditions which at times amounted to torture, the report found. Detainees were made to undergo two months of \u201ctraining\u201d in subjects such as constitutionalism, the rule of law and the history of the Oromo people\u2019s struggle.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Amhara, according to the report, regional police, militia and local vigilante groups engaged in targeted attacks on ethnic Qemant, a minority group demanding more autonomy, in inter-communal violence which resulted in at least 130 deaths last year. In January 2019, at least 58 people were reportedly killed in less than 24 hours and buried in mass graves.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nobody has yet been held accountable for the atrocity.</p> <p>Amnesty said it had sought responses to its findings from nine government offices including the defence ministry and the attorney-general\u2019s office but had only received a response from Amhara\u2019s regional security bureau, which denied that state security forces had been involved in any atrocities.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/15/suspicion-and-fear-linger-as-ethiopia-campus-wars-go-quiet\">Suspicion and fear linger as Ethiopia\u2019s campus wars go quiet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rights group called on the government to carry out full investigations into human rights violations and to order security forces to stop carrying out unlawful executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, as well as forced evictions and destruction of property belonging to people suspected of supporting opposition political parties or armed groups.</p> <p>In February last year the former head of the Ethiopian army <a href=\"https://allafrica.com/stories/201902140326.html\">said</a> it had embarked on \u201cdeep institutional reform\u201d as part of the democratic changes sweeping the nation.</p> <p>The head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, Daniel Bekele, told the Guardian: \u201cWhile the Amnesty findings and ongoing reports of killings and arrests in parts of Oromia region should be taken seriously and fully investigated, it is also important to understand the complex nature of the security operations where armed groups are seriously destabilising the affected areas.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s office said it would put the Guardian\u2019s request for official comment to the peace ministry, which did not respond in time for publication.</p>",
  "<p>Large heath butterflies are returning to peatlands in greater Manchester 150 years after they went locally extinct.</p> <p>The acidic peat bogs and mosslands around Manchester and Liverpool were home to the country\u2019s biggest colonies of large heath butterflies \u2013 known as the \u201cManchester argus\u201d \u2013 but numbers plummeted as land was drained for agricultural land and peat extraction.&nbsp;</p> <p>Conservationists from Lancashire Wildlife Trust are now looking to reverse the fortunes of this rare butterfly by restoring a 37-hectare area of peatland between Wigan and Salford where they have recreated habitats of sphagnum moss, cross-leaved heath and hare\u2019s-tail cottongrass on which the butterflies depend.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last summer, staff collected six female butterflies from a population at Winmarleigh moss near Garstang and took them to Chester zoo. The caterpillars spent winter feeding on cotton grass and 45 hand-reared pupae are now being released on to a secret site where they will be kept in protected tents while they emerge from their pupae.&nbsp;</p> <p>Conservationists are going into the tent to check them two or three times a day, releasing any butterflies as they emerge.&nbsp;</p> <p>Heather Prince, who is part of Chester zoo\u2019s invertebrate team, said: \u201cBreeding and rearing butterflies in an incredibly delicate process that requires a fine balance of conditions at each part of their life cycle.

This reintroduction part of a wider effort to get native wildlife back in the right areas \u2026 It just seemed right that if we could get Manchester\u2019s butterfly back to the mosses that\u2019s something we should do. Everyone here is absolutely over the moon about this.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Peat extraction means these boggy areas are up to 20 feet lower than they were a century ago and this reintroduction is part of a bigger project to restore greater Manchester\u2019s heavily degraded wetlands. Other species set to be reintroduced include bog bush cricket, white-faced darter dragonfly and carnivorous sundew.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2019 State of Nature report found 41% of UK butterfly species had declined with one in 10 at risk of extinction. Jo Kennedy, a project coordinator at Lancashire Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cAcross our region we have lost 98% of our lowland raised bogs, creating a huge hole in our biodiversity. To function as a healthy ecosystem, we need a tapestry of different and connected habitats each supporting a variety of plants and animals.\u201d</p> <p>There are a few isolated populations of large heath butterflies remaining in England and Wales and larger populations in Scotland.&nbsp;</p> <p>This follows the successful reintroduction of large heath butterflies to Heysham Moss in Lancashire between 2014 and 2016, and conservationists are now planning to reintroduce the butterflies to Risley Moss in Cheshire.</p>",
  "<p>When Woody Allen was 20, the writer Danny Simon taught him a few rules about comedy, the most important of which was this: always trust your own judgment, because external opinion is meaningless.</p> <p>Allen recounts this tale in his recently published memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/09/apropos-of-nothing-by-woody-allen-review-a-life-and-an-accusation\">Apropos of Nothing</a>. That this book exists at all is proof that he still adheres to that rule. These days, Allen\u2019s name is mud, a fact made clear by the critics, who wrote their reviews with one hand while holding their noses with the other. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/books/review-apropos-of-nothing-memoir-woody-allen.html\">The New York Times\u2019 critic wrote</a>: \u201cVolunteering to review [this book], in our moral climate, is akin to volunteering for the 2021 Olympic javelin-catching team.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markharrisnyc/status/1252962663044468736?lang=en\">Another publication\u2019s headline</a> was: \u201cI Read Woody Allen\u2019s Memoir So You Don\u2019t Have To.\u201d </p> <p>There are a thousand things one could discuss with Allen: his 70 years in comedy, his 55 years of making movies. But, at this point, there is really only one thing to discuss \u2013 and he knows it. \u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he tells me down the phone from his home in (of course) Manhattan. So, even though our interview is supposed to be about his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office\">A Rainy Day in New York</a>, we spend the hour talking about the scandal that has overshadowed his career for the past 25 years and, for many, obscured it. \u201cI assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator,\u201d he says in his still distinctive Brooklyn accent (\u201cpred-ah-tah\u201d).</p> <p>He also knows there is nothing he can do about it: \u201cAnything I say sounds self-serving and defensive, so it\u2019s best if I just go my way and work,\u201d he says. He is 84 and Rainy Day is his 48th film. He has already finished his 49th and, if it were not for the coronavirus, he would be making his 50th this summer.</p> <p>The broad outlines of the scandal are now better known than most of his films. In 1992, it emerged that, aged 57, he was having an affair with Soon-Yi Previn, then 21, the adopted daughter of his long-term partner, Mia Farrow. During the inevitably acrimonious breakup, Farrow accused him of sexually assaulting their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan. (Allen and Farrow also have an adopted son, Moses, then 14, and a biological son, Satchel, then four, now known as Ronan, the journalist. At this point, Farrow also had six older children of her own, including Soon-Yi.) According to contemporaneous news reports, as well as accusing Allen of molesting Dylan, <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/25/Mia-I-worried-about-Woody-being-a-homosexual/8544733035600/\">Farrow testified that she thought Allen might be gay and abuse Satchel</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61ce1b9664128582b964d22dc858ec07820864b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61ce1b9664128582b964d22dc858ec07820864b6/0_0_1500_2322/646.jpg\" alt=\"Allen with Soon-Yi Previn around the time their relationship became public.\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen with Soon-Yi Previn around the time their relationship became public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought people would see it as laughable rubbish right away and from day one I never really took it seriously,\u201d says Allen. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like being confronted with a story that I murdered six people with a machine gun.\u201d (A source close to the Farrow family now denies Farrow feared Allen was gay or would molest Satchel, adding: \u201cWe will not be responding to ad hominem attacks on Ms Farrow or her children to support Mr Allen\u2019s book sales or attempts to rewrite history.\u201d)</p> <p>Back in the 90s, it was Allen\u2019s affair with Soon-Yi that was considered the big scandal. But, in the past decade, since <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/\">Dylan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/ronan-farrow-hachette-woody-allen-memoir\">Ronan</a> have spoken out publicly against their father, and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\">Soon-Yi</a> and <a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">Moses</a> have defended him, attention has focused on the molestation charge. In 2014, <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/\">Dylan wrote in the New York Times</a>: \u201cWoody Allen is a living testament to the way society fails the survivors of sexual abuse and assault.\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">In a 2016 article in </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Ronan castigated the media for giving a free pass to Allen, just because he had never been convicted: \u201cIt is not an excuse for the press to silence victims, to never interrogate allegations.\u201d (He did not reply to a request for comment.)</p> <p>There is a much greater awareness today of the prevalence of sexual abuse than there was in 1992 and the public is increasingly fearful of being on the wrong side of history; to question any woman\u2019s story is, in the eyes of many, to be a rape apologist.</p> <p>So the old allegation against Allen has been accorded more power than it ever had, especially among a generation that was barely born in the 90s. He is now routinely named \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/sunday/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html\">by journalists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">the Farrows</a> and the public \u2013 alongside Harvey Weinstein and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/woody-allen-polanski-cosby-dangerous-cannes-ronan-farrow\">Bill Cosby</a>, both of whom are convicted of multiple offences, their crimes going back decades. I covered the Weinstein and Cosby cases, as well as many other stories about high-profile men either convicted or accused of sexual offences: Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar. All of them were accused of attacking multiple victims; their pattern of predatory behaviour spanned their lifetime.&nbsp;Allen was accused of one instance of molestation and not only was he not convicted, but he was never even charged; photos of him in court with Farrow are from their custody battle over their children, not from a criminal trial.<strong> </strong>Why doesn\u2019t he sue when the New York Times calls him a \u201cmonster\u201d alongside Epstein and Weinstein?</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay to sue. Do I really want to be tabloid fodder for two years and go to court? And do I really care?\u201d he says. Given that he lays out the allegation and ensuing drama in searing detail in his memoir, I would wager he cares quite a lot these days.</p> <p>The book is one heck of a read.<strong> </strong>With its funny remembrances of his past jostling up against his palpably furious recollections of the fallout from his breakup with Farrow, it is like watching a double bill of Radio Days and Kramer vs Kramer. He insists the allegation is just \u201ca small part of the story\u201d, but it cuts across it like an angry wound: when he describes the events of 1992, you can feel his shock; when he describes the allegation\u2019s recent resurgence, his frustration burns off the page. He writes about \u201cwell-meaning citizens, brimming with moral indignation, only too happy to nobly take a stand on an issue they had absolutely no knowledge of\u201d while other outsiders \u201crushed to outdo one another in profiles of courage. By God, they were against child molestation and were not afraid to say it.\u201d </p> <p>In March, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/ronan-farrow-hachette-woody-allen-memoir\">Ronan objected to Hachette</a> \u2013 which published his book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/20/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-review\">Catch and Kill</a> \u2013 publishing Allen\u2019s memoir, Hachette caved in. Actors who worked with Allen after the original scandal but before the change in public mood \u2013 including Mira Sorvino, Greta Gerwig, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/colin-firth-woody-allen-accusations-film\">Colin Firth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/rebecca-hall-woody-allen-dylan-farrow\">Rebecca Hall</a> \u2013 expressed their deepest remorse. Those who refuse to do so \u2013 such as Larry David, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/diane-keaton-woody-allen-dylan-farrow\">Diane Keaton</a>, Alec Baldwin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/alan-alda-its-amazing-that-most-of-us-live-as-if-were-not-gonna-die\">Alan Alda</a> and Scarlett Johansson \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-most-ridiculous-reasons-celebrities-have-had-for-actually-defending-woody-allen.html/\">are publicly shamed</a>.

The actors have no idea of the facts and they latch on to some self-serving, public, safe position. Who in the world is not against child molestation?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how actors and actresses are, and [denouncing me] became the fashionable thing to do, like everybody suddenly eating kale.\u201d External opinion is meaningless.</p> <p>That said, Allen makes sure to include in his book an amusingly pointed story about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who stars in Rainy Day: \u201cTimoth\u00e9e afterward publicly stated he regretted working with me and was giving the money to charity. But he swore to my sister he needed to do that as he was up for an Oscar for Call Me By Your Name, and he and his agent felt he had a better chance of winning if he denounced me, so he did.\u201d (Chalamet\u2019s people did not return requests for a comment.)</p> <p>\u201cYou can give people the testimony by those who worked in the house,\u201d Allen says, referring to the Farrow children\u2019s nanny, Monica Thompson, who gave<a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/02/01/Nanny-Mia-wanted-me-to-back-her-story/8228728542800/\">&nbsp;two sworn affidavits</a>&nbsp;saying Mia had tried to coax her into backing the molestation charge, then said Allen \u201cwas always the better parent and all the things Farrow is saying about him are not true\u201d.</p> <p>Allen continues: \u201cYou can give them the facts over and over. But the facts don\u2019t matter. For some reason, emotionally, it\u2019s important for them to buy into the story.\u201d</p> <p>These are the facts: after Farrow alleged that Allen \u2013 never accused of any impropriety before or since \u2013 molested Dylan in her house in Connecticut, doctors examined her and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">found no physical evidence of abuse</a>. Allen was then investigated by the Yale New Haven hospital\u2019s sexual abuse clinic and New York City\u2019s Child Welfare Administration. The former concluded: \u201cIt is our expert opinion that Dylan was not sexually molested by Mr Allen.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html\">The latter, after a 14-month</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html\"> investigation, wrote</a>: \u201cNo credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr John Leventhal, who headed the Yale New Haven report, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html\">testified that Dylan</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html\">\u2019s statements had \u201ca rehearsed quality\u201d</a> and hypothesised that \u201cshe was coached or influenced by her mother\u201d.

But, <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/02/woody-allen-and-dylan-farrow-digging-deeper-into-misleading-coverage.html\">according to reports</a>, Dylan was interviewed nine times over six months by two social workers, Jennifer Sawyer and Julia Hamilton, who were part of the team. It is possible they were given this delicate job at least partly because they, unlike Leventhal, were female and Dylan was a seven-year-old girl. For discretionary reasons, Leventhal could not comment on the case. </p> <p>Many will argue that, as a wealthy white man, Allen was protected by authorities (although Allen writes in his memoir that one doctor involved in the case believed the Connecticut police were antisemitic). But assuming guilt in a person who was never charged is a morally precarious position \u2013 and to do so about a case that has long been mired in misinformation and misunderstanding bulldozes through any concept of due process.</p> <p>It is almost 30 years since Allen was first accused of molestation; by this point, almost everything people think they know about the case is wrong. One popular belief is that Allen had been in therapy for \u201cinappropriate\u201d feelings towards Dylan since she was a baby and it has been <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts\">strongly implied that these feelings were sexual</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s a complete and total fabrication, like a space craft landing in New York,\u201d says Allen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e0aeb933518caa711bdb365ab5b58530b70523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e0aeb933518caa711bdb365ab5b58530b70523/0_0_1600_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woody Allen on the Rainy Day set with Selena Gomez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen on the set of Rainy Day with Selena Gomez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Miglio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/205403621/Allen-v-Farrow-Custody-Ruling-June-7-1993\">Transcripts from the custody trial</a> back him up. Dr Susan Coates, a child psychologist who treated Satchel and evaluated Dylan, described Allen and Dylan\u2019s relationship as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/nyregion/psychologist-testifies-about-visitation-rights-for-allen.html\">\u201cinappropriately intense\u201d</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/30/Psychiatrist-Woody-was-committed-to-being-a-good-father/1405733467600/\">denied it was in any way \u201cromantic\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI did not see it as sexual, but I saw it as inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else,\u201d Coates said. In other words, Allen was not emotionally involved with Farrow\u2019s older children, but instead focused on Dylan, who was the first child he had raised since she was a baby, because Farrow adopted her during their relationship. Dylan\u2019s therapist, Dr Nancy Schultz, also <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shocking-custody-case-court-documents-that-shed-light-on-the-dylan-farrow-woody-allen-saga\">said she believed that Allen did not sexually abuse Dylan</a>, while Allen\u2019s therapist of 21 years, Dr Kathryn Prescott, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5u0qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176&amp;lpg=PT176&amp;dq=kathryn+prescott+woody+allen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qOgojnIjwx&amp;sig=ACfU3U286_jzdS73F71KOErhe6Hry2R3IA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-kPv278bpAhVMRBUIHUygAN8Q6AEwEnoECBMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kathryn%20prescott%20woody%20allen&amp;f=false\">testified</a>: \u201cThere has never been any suggestion that Mr Allen was suffering from a sexual perversion/deviant sexual behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>The only person who described Allen\u2019s behaviour towards Dylan as \u201csexual\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">was </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">Farrow</a>, although even she said <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/25/Mia-I-worried-about-Woody-being-a-homosexual/8544733035600/\">in the custody hearing</a>: \u201cSexual is not the name I used at the time \u2026 It was relentless and overpowering.\u201d Yet just a few months before the scandal broke, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/woody-and-mia-modern-family-timeline/\">she endorsed Allen\u2019s bid to co-adopt Dylan</a>.</p> <p>The other argument often cited against Allen is that the state prosecutor Frank Maco stated he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to charge Allen for child molestation, but would not do so because it would be too traumatic for Dylan. Less well remembered is <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/suffer-children-191082\">Maco\u2019s other public comment on the case</a>: \u201cTo risk the wellbeing of a child where there is evidence which points to the existence of a reasonable doubt is nothing less than to sacrifice the child on an altar of public spectacle,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I called Maco this week to ask what he meant: \u201cI would have had to put the child on the stand and the child would have had to relate what happened, and that child could not do that in any setting \u2013 an open court, a closed court \u2013 at that point.

There is no question <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866\">the ruling is extremely personally damning about Allen</a> (\u201cWilk hated me from the moment he set eyes on me,\u201d Allen writes in his memoir). But Wilk\u2019s main criticism was not Allen\u2019s relationship with Dylan<strong> </strong>\u2013 which he described as \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d, but added: \u201cThe evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely he could be prosecuted for sexual abuse\u201d \u2013 but with Soon-Yi.</p> <p>In my many years of debating the Allen case with friends and colleagues, it is usually at this point, when the issues around the original accusation become too byzantine to follow, that people pivot to Soon-Yi. A relationship with a 21-year-old woman is not the same as molesting a seven-year-old girl, but the conflation of the two scandals is understandable: this saga around Allen assumed biblical proportions and his affair with Soon-Yi was the original sin.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are very confused about this. They think Soon-Yi was my adopted daughter, that I lived with Mia [in the same apartment as Soon-Yi], that I was married to Mia \u2013 they have all kinds of crazy thoughts,\u201d says Allen. Yet she was, undeniably, Allen\u2019s partner\u2019s daughter and he had known her since she was a child (although Wilk confirmed that Allen had almost no contact with her until 1990, when she was 20). Their affair was not a legal crime, but in the eyes of many it was \u2013 and is \u2013 a moral one. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">A</a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">s Ronan </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">pointed out on Twitter in 2012</a>, when Allen married Soon-Yi, he turned his own children into his siblings-in-law.</p> <p>At the time, Soon-Yi was treated as both the predator (\u201cSoon-Yi does not exist,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47408185\">said</a> her adoptive father, Andr\u00e9 Previn) and the victim: in Wilk\u2019s custody ruling, he says that Farrow called Allen \u201ca child molester\u201d in July 1992 \u2013 a month before the alleged incident with Dylan \u2013 with regard to his relationship with Soon-Yi, while also \u201cdefacing\u201d photos of her daughter. <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\">Soon-Yi</a><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\"> has long insisted that she was far from either</a>. She is now 49 and has been with Allen for 28 years, married for 23, and raised two daughters, Bechet, 23, and Manzie, 20. Yet the longevity of their relationship, instead of proving its validity, has acted for many as a reminder of Allen\u2019s original transgression. The same year Allen and Farrow were in court, Jerry Seinfeld, then 38, <a href=\"https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-game-of-love-vol-41-no-11/\">started </a><a href=\"https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-game-of-love-vol-41-no-11/\">seeing</a><a href=\"https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-game-of-love-vol-41-no-11/\"> a 17-year-old</a>, Shoshanna Lonstein.

(\u201cFew if anyone realised I was simply quoting Saul Bellow quoting Emily Dickinson, not actually describing a philosophy of my own,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing. And he is right: few realised that.) But, in 1992, he had more sympathy with people\u2019s criticisms: \u201cThe first days [after the accusation of molestation], I thought: this is completely justifiable. I\u2019ve turned up in an affair with another woman and that other woman is her daughter,\u201d he said in an interview with the US news programme 60 Minutes.</p> <p>Is there any part of him that thinks he brought all this on himself?</p> <p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d he replies, without hesitation. \u201cI realised [the relationship with Soon-Yi] had dramatic impact and was not usual: one could make criticisms about the rectitude of it, the appropriateness of it; I understood all of that. But these false accusations that have hurt the psychological life of Ronan and Dylan; I don\u2019t feel for one second that I brought that on myself.\u201d</p> <p>Allen can be, at best, naive and, at worst, obtuse. Reviewers of the memoir have gleefully pulled out the comments he makes about Scarlett Johansson and L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s attractiveness, while ignoring his long paeans on the talents of Diane Keaton, Dianne Wiest, Judy Davis and many more. He writes that he has \u201ca reputation as someone obsessed with young women. I have used the May-December ploy as a comic and romantic theme a few times, just as I have used psychoanalysis or murder or Jewish jokes, but only as good material for plots and laughs.\u201d</p> <p>This is true, but you will never guess which of these plots features in Rainy Day (clue: it is not psychoanalysis or murder). So I ask, given that he knows what people think about him, did he not consider ditching the plotline about the middle-aged director (Liev Schreiber) lusting after a college student (Elle Fanning), or declining to make a joke in his memoir about Johansson\u2019s pheromones?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The facts don\u2019t matter. For some reason, emotionally, it\u2019s important for them to buy into the story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo, I never think about that for a second,\u201d he says. \u201c It\u2019s hard enough to get a good joke for the situation. That\u2019s what you concern yourself with. The rest is of absolutely no importance.\u201d In other words: Allen does not think he needs to tread carefully, because he has done nothing wrong.</p> <p>In his memoir, Allen\u2019s recollections of the allegation and its fallout seethe with sadness and occasional fury. But, in conversation, he&nbsp;speaks about the effect that all this has had on his life and career&nbsp;with measured calmness.&nbsp;I remark on his lack of anger. \u201cFrom that perspective, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m angry that I was deprived of seeing my children grow up and I\u2019m angry at what\u2019s been done to Dylan and Ronan. I haven\u2019t spoken a word to the children in over 25 years and they\u2019ve been raised to think the worst of me. So sure, I was angry about that. But, professionally, I haven\u2019t suffered at all,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This is demonstrably untrue. Aside from the actors who won\u2019t work with him, Amazon Studios pulled out of a four-movie deal with him (one of those movies was Rainy Day) after Allen said in a 2018 interview: \u201cI should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one has ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all.\u201d This is true: Allen has an excellent record with female actors, always giving them equal pay. Despite being one of the most closely watched men in the business, there have never even been rumours of harassment. But Amazon claimed Allen\u2019s comment \u201csabotaged\u201d the project. Allen sued and he and Amazon settled last year, but, as a result, Rainy Day does not have a US distributor.</p> <p>\u201cThis plays into my poetic fantasies to be an artist whose work isn\u2019t seen in his own country and is forced, because of injustice, to have his public abroad. Henry Miller comes to mind. DH Lawrence. James Joyce. I see myself standing amongst them defiantly. It\u2019s about at that point my wife wakes me up and says, You\u2019re snoring,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing.</p> <p>In the past decade, he has been <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4151320/\">cut out of documentaries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/critics-notebook-why-i-will-never-watch-a-woody-allen-film-again-1063776\">boycotted by film reviewers</a>. He is considered too riddled with scandal even for the Clintons; Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign returned his and Soon-Yi\u2019s donation: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t help wondering if another fifty-four hundred would have enabled her to carry Pennsylvania, Michigan or Ohio,\u201d he writes in the book. External opinion, it turns out, does matter.</p> <p>Allen is innocent: this is according to the law and the agencies that investigated him. Dylan and Ronan believe he is guilty. It is the latter view that has led some to <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/26/uc-san-diego-academic-senate-rejects-student-led-push-cut-course-woody-allen\">lobby universities to drop him from film courses</a>, exclude his movies from film festivals and talk about him as if he were a criminal. But this attitude is immoral unless it is proved he committed a crime \u2013 and, 28 years later, no one has been able to pin so much as a parking fine on him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Omp-oI4PyY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4Omp-oI4PyY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for A Rainy Day in New York.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Many point to his movies as evidence of wrongdoing, but it is the height of intellectual laziness to conflate film plots about older men and twentysomething women with child molestation. A 21-year-old woman is not \u2013 and this, apparently, cannot be said enough with regard to Allen \u2013 a seven-year-old girl. It is extraordinary how many people argue otherwise, claiming to do so in the name of feminism. You may not like Allen\u2019s movies \u2013 or his marriage \u2013 but people can be complicated, even unlikable, without being criminal.</p> <p>There are signs that <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2020/05/25/ronan-farrows-botched-journalism-is-troubling-the-response-to-it-has-been-worse/\">some people</a> are starting to realise this, and to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/business/media/ronan-farrow.html\">question some of the narratives around him</a>. Despite the pandemic, the lack of a US release and having been disowned by its star and other cast and crew members, Rainy Day is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office\">Allen\u2019s most successful film in years</a>. Perhaps the public simply wearied of a story that has not changed in decades. Perhaps some took the time to read the facts.</p> <p>Allen says several times during our conversation that he is completely fine: he can still make movies, even if they are not shown in his own country, and Bechet and Manzie are, he says, wholly untouched by the scandal, even though they are of the generation that thinks he is Satan. \u201cThey\u2019re great, because this has always been a total non-issue in their lives. This is because none of us here make a big deal out of it and it has not impacted them in any negative way whatsoever,\u201d he says, proudly. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon\">Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us.

Although the pandemic has wiped these issues off the front page, we will still need to reckon with them one day.</p> <p>But at a time when mutual cooperation and problem-solving seems the only way forward, the world appears to be a confusing and partisan place where <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/870368/65-worst-trump-tweets-2010s\">leaders take a special delight</a> in skewering their opponents with language and conduct that would be banned on a playground.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Campaign-to-thank-Xi-Jinping-flatly-rejected-by-Wuhan-citizens\">fealty and praise</a> are valued above honesty and transparency, it\u2019s hard for optimism to flourish.</p> <p>Consequently, there is a real temptation for the average person to feel disempowered and hence disengaged from the issues facing broader society. Perhaps, if we can juggle endless Zoom meetings, avoid an argument at home and manage to cook something largely edible, it is enough. And maybe this is why I\u2019ve been reflecting on something that serves as a fitting antidote to my own inward-looking tendencies.</p> <p>Late February wasn\u2019t so long ago but now it seems like another era when the Great Hall of the Australian parliament hosted a gala event to recognise the recipients of this year\u2019s Fulbright awards.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fulbright.org.au/\">Fulbright program</a> is the flagship foreign exchange scholarship program of the United States, aimed at increasing cultural understanding, collaboration and the exchange of ideas. It was established by <a href=\"https://www.cies.org/about-us/about-senator-j-william-fulbright\">Senator William Fulbright</a> in 1946 by using credits from the sale of surplus war material to fund academic exchanges between host nations and the US. In the past 70 years, 400,000 Fulbright recipients from around the world have attended the program.</p> <p>Being the fortunate recipient of a second Fulbright award to study public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School gave me much food for thought. Each year, several doctors receive a Fulbright and it\u2019s easy to see why. After all, infections, diabetes, heart disease and cancer are ubiquitous threats to population health. Also, we need an opioid policy that limits harm while doing good and societies must ponder how artificial intelligence engages with healthcare.</p> <p>But something I increasingly realise is that the status society accords to healthcare workers, especially frontline clinicians, can trick us into thinking that only health is wealth. Time spent with the sick and needy patients makes us rightly passionate about healthcare but of course, a civil society requires far, far more: good infrastructure, sound education, affordable housing, a clean environment, human rights, and able government to name but a few.</p> <p>Consequently, my favourite part of a Fulbright event is meeting those who consider issues that I frankly know very little about. How do we defend our water assets? What will make solar energy more efficient? How do we nurture artists and musicians in a world obsessed with immediate outcomes? What minerals will help the transition to green energy? How do fish and grasshoppers affect our ecosystem? What afflicts our cotton and wheat? How do we tackle modern slavery, sports integrity and addictive gaming? How can we improve education? Why does space research matter? These are just some of the questions this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fulbright.org.au/current-scholars/\">Fulbright scholars</a> are asking on behalf of society.</p> <p>As someone whose thinking as a doctor and a global citizen has been transformed by Senator Fulbright\u2019s vision, I am often asked two questions.</p> <h2><strong>What does it take to win a Fulbright award?</strong></h2> <p>A good education, not to be confused with an elite upbringing. Most scholars neither attend prestigious institutions nor have \u201cconnected\u201d families; indeed, many hail from small towns with scarce opportunities and even less patience for the problems of the world. But the common thread is they found one person who fired their imagination and challenged them to think differently. A sound early education opens doors by prompting broad curiosity, individual persistence and interdisciplinary collaboration. Incidentally, educated parents are writ large in the lives of Fulbright scholars. It was impossible for my Indian parents to entertain such an undertaking for themselves, but their education imbued them with a deep enthusiasm for learning.</p> <p>A rising tide lifts all boats, which is why an <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/six-ways-australias-education-system-is-failing-our-kids-32958\">excellent educational system</a> is the foundation of a successful society and why we should demand early learning, pay teachers well, support higher education and applaud researchers. </p> <p>In order to flourish, we all need someone who asks why not, instead of what for.</p> <h2><strong>What are Fulbright scholars like?</strong></h2> <p>They are ordinary people from all walks of life with one important attribute \u2013 they think deeply about an idea and are unafraid to take a measured risk in pursuit of a goal. Scholars spend years crystallising their thoughts and honing their case. There is no age limit and the oldest scholars have decades over the youngest. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/tampa-refugee-taken-in-by-new-zealand-wins-fulbright-scholarship\">Tampa refugee taken in by New Zealand wins Fulbright scholarship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being bold enough to champion an idea yet humble enough to recognise one\u2019s limitations matters. Vision is important. But most important is grit and the ability to persevere in the face of rejection, something everyone eventually encounters. A society thrives not just by producing scholars but by equipping all its citizens to discover their potential. Again, this is the real power of a good education.</p> <p>The final address to this year\u2019s Fulbright scholars came from <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/austory/a-place-for-us/9169912\">Sara James</a>, an Emmy award-winning American journalist and author who barely alluded to her considerable personal accomplishments. But you could hear a pin drop when she evoked the experience of raising a child with a disability and the inevitable collision of personal ambition with parental responsibility and societal advocacy. Delivered with grace and humility, her words were an unforgettable reminder that in life, reward and responsibility are frequently intertwined and it is up to us to take some and give back substantially more. </p> <p>Senator Fulbright memorably called his namesake program not a panacea but an avenue of hope that would give us \u201cthe ability to see the world as others see it and to allow for the possibility that others may see something we have failed to see, or may see it more accurately.\u201d Never have his words sounded more prophetic.</p> <p>You may be the next Fulbright scholar, or indeed, the reason someone decides to apply. Either way, <a href=\"https://www.fulbright.org.au/applicants/\">applications</a> are now open to find another group of curious thinkers.

What they talked about over their flat whites. Not Brisbane, or god forbid, <em>Canberra</em>.</p> <p>I was so green, I could have photosynthesised and was lucky enough to be shuffled under the wing of Carolyn Tucker, veteran investigative reporter, who had found herself in the advertorial section, because when she first started no one had clicked on to who she was. That\u2019s just how small papers work. You could be Peter Harvey or Laurie Oakes but you\u2019ll never be treated with the same reverence as the editor who started at the paper as a cadet and had a contact book that read like the town\u2019s phone book.</p> <p>It was Tucker who followed a tip about then-Queensland deputy premier Gordon Nuttall having a lunch at a local fancy restaurant with some interesting characters.</p> <p>That investigation eventually led to his being referred to the state corruption watchdog, and charges for which he was convicted and jailed. The national media quickly claimed credit for the story but regional reporters are used to that.</p> <p>From her I learned how to keep investigating when things didn\u2019t sit right, even as power screamed at you at 2am. To always pick up the phone. And that accolades and acknowledgement will never matter as much as serving your audience. Inform your readers. Give them the information they need to make their daily decisions. Everything else is just icing sugar \u2013 nice, but often brushed off and forgotten about.</p> <p>Working at a regional paper like the Sunshine Coast Daily means becoming the property of your readers. Faye will have no problem marching into your office to demand to see your university degree because you called her \u201cFay\u201d in a vox pop. You\u2019ll spend the rest of your career triple checking spellings.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been called to task at school fetes and the beach, change rooms and supermarkets, and once on a ferris wheel at a country show.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been threatened by bikies and politicians, shoved and screamed at in front of police stations and courts, and had abusive letters left by my door. I\u2019ve been impersonated and, on at least one memorable occasion, had a dead rat left on my car roof. But I was also privileged enough to be welcomed into lives at their most vulnerable times, trusted with stories that would become part of family tapestries.</p> <p>Country roads and highways to a regional police reporter are scarred with the lives you know ended there, marked by memories of midnight trips to dark bends and broken trees. Treating those tragedies as just another story becomes impossible when you find yourself reaching for the same yoghurt as a mother grieving her child.</p> <p>The Daily I left is not the same as the Daily today, but the community it represents is. That it, and so many others, have lost their print voices is a national tragedy. Regional and community newsrooms are not nurseries for would-be metro reporters, although they do offer the best training in the business.</p> <p>They are thriving ecosystems, staffed by people whose children go to the same schools as their audience, who drive on the same roads they fight councils to fix, who enjoy the same environment they lobby to protect.</p> <p>They work there because they love their community and want to serve it, the best way they know how \u2013 honouring and protecting and telling its stories. That just got a lot harder.</p> <p>But they\u2019ll still be picking up phones, and still doing their darndest to get words on a page.

It would have long been taped over, perhaps, were it not for the up-and-coming young composer who penned the music and lyrics, one Stephen Joshua Sondheim. (In fact, the original colour mastertape was lost; only a black-and-white recording remains.)</p> <p>Long before Sweeney Todd and Sunday in the Park with George and Into the Woods, before he became the greatest balladeer of the English language theatre, 30-something Sondheim was still proving himself on Broadway. He\u2019d served an apprenticeship as lyricist to Leonard Bernstein (West Side Story), Jule Styne (Gypsy) and Richard Rodgers (Do I Hear a Waltz?). And ushered one moderate hit (Roman farce A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum) and one box office bomb (Anyone Can Whistle) to the stage as composer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ebb5986f59417f6480a804cb52e3e4dda50e50c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ebb5986f59417f6480a804cb52e3e4dda50e50c/0_0_1000_750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Perkins and Charmian Carr in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s 1966 made-for-TV musical about people living in a department store after hours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Perkins and Charmian Carr in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s 1966 made-for-TV musical about people living in a department store after hours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC Television Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here was a prime-time TV platform to showcase his skills, with a post-Psycho heartthrob in Anthony Perkins as leading man, opposite a coquettish Charmian Carr (eldest Von Trapp daughter Liesl in The Sound of Music, on screen a year earlier) as Ella.</p> <p>It\u2019s an important document in Sondheim\u2019s artistic legacy.
