  "<p>The US has been accused of \u201cmodern piracy\u201d after reportedly diverting a shipment of masks intended for the German police, and outbidding other countries in the increasingly fraught global market for coronavirus protective equipment.</p> \n<p>About 200,000 N95 masks were diverted to the US as they were being transferred between planes in Thailand, according to the Berlin authorities who said they had ordered the masks for the police force.</p> \n<p>Andreas Geisel, the interior minister for Berlin state, described the diversion as \u201can act of modern piracy\u201d and appealed to the German government to demand Washington conform to international trading rules. \u201cThis is no way to treat trans-Atlantic partners,\u201d Geisel said. \u201cEven in times of global crisis there should be no wild west methods.\u201d</p> \n<p>The German reports said the masks had been made by a Chinese producer for the US company 3M, but the firm issued a statement on Friday night saying: \u201c3M has no evidence to suggest 3M products have been seized. 3M has no record of any order of respirators from China for the Berlin police. We cannot speculate where this report originated.\u201d</p> \n<p>The German allegations added to a chorus of complaints about the Trump administration\u2019s practice as the US wields its clout in a marketplace for scarce medical supplies that is becoming a free-for-all, with nation competing against nation.</p> \n<p>Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, the influential president of the \u00cele-de-France region, which includes Paris, described the race to get masks as a \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI found a stock of masks that was available and Americans \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about the American government \u2013 but Americans, outbid us,\u201d P\u00e9cresse said. \u201cThey offered three times the price and they proposed to pay upfront. I can\u2019t do that.

The company said the demand raises \u201csignificant humanitarian implications\u201d from stopping shipments intended for healthcare workers, and warned it would backfire by triggering retaliation from other countries.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the US would actually decrease,\u201d <a href=\"https://news.3m.com/press-release/company-english/3m-response-defense-production-act-order\">the statement said</a>. \u201cThat is the opposite of what we and the administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek.\u201d</p> \n<p>Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the US move was a \u201cmistake\u201d, noting that the US also imports medical supplies from Canada.</p> \n<p>In the scramble for masks and other critical medical supplies, the US has a significant advantage in its fleet of large air freighters, three times the size of China\u2019s.

Robert Kraft, an American billionaire businessman, lent a Boeing 767 to the Massachusetts governor, Charlie Baker, who was trying to transport 1.2m masks he had bought in China to Massachusetts.</p> \n<p>The plane was one of two that Kraft bought for the New England Patriots NFL team, which helped organise the shipment, with the help of China\u2019s consul general in New York, Huang Ping, who kept his office open over the weekend to process the documentation, according to an account<a href=\"https://www.patriots.com/news/a-patriotic-mission-team-plane-completes-humanitarian-flight-to-china\"> on the Patriots website</a>. The plane was allowed to land as long as the crew did not disembark and it stayed on the ground in Shenzhen for less than three hours. The plane left with three minutes to spare.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Thursday in front of the plane, Baker choked up with emotion. \u201cThis gear will make an enormous difference,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foDplOHefVs\">Republican </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foDplOHefVs\">said</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that securing [personal protective equipment] has been an enormous challenge.

  "<p>Nearly two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.climateworksaustralia.org/\">ClimateWorks Australia</a> set out to test whether the implied goal agreed by world leaders at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris\">Paris climate conference</a> \u2013 cutting greenhouse gas emissions to \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050 \u2013 was still possible in Australia. They weren\u2019t certain it would be. They were pleasantly surprised by the result.</p> <p>\u201cWe found not only is it not yet out of reach in Australia, but it can be achieved using technologies that are mostly already mature and available,\u201d says Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of the not-for-profit that was established in 2009 to fill a gap between climate research and action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/nearly-one-in-five-of-australias-big-polluters-breach-government-set-emissions-limits\">Nearly one in five of Australia's big polluters breach government-set emissions limits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Net-zero emissions targets have been adopted by 121 countries responsible for a quarter of CO2, asset owners worth $4tn and an expanding list of major companies. The Morrison government is yet to join them, having promised a long-term strategy later this year, but all Australia\u2019s states and territories have net-zero goals for mid-century.</p> <p>ClimateWorks spent 18 months examining each part of the Australian economy in detail to consider what would be involved in getting there. The resulting report, <a href=\"https://www.climateworksaustralia.org/resource/decarbonisation-futures-solutions-actions-and-benchmarks-for-a-net-zero-emissions-australia/\">Decarbonisation Futures</a>, is an update of similar work in 2014. It found net-zero emissions were possible not just by mid-century but by 2035 \u2013 soon enough for Australia to play its part in an effort to limit global heating to 1.5C.</p> <p>The report lands as the coronavirus crisis has, in a best-case scenario, postponed 2020\u2019s expected focus on climate change. The year-end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">UN meeting in Glasgow</a> has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">delayed until next year</a>. It is considered the most important since Paris in 2015, with countries being exhorted to ramp up commitments as promised in the French capital. </p> <p>ClimateWorks\u2019 analysis was completed before the pandemic hit, but Skarbek says the need to recover from the economic shock once the survival stage passes will also provide an opportunity to make the sort of investment required to respond to the climate crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done. That\u2019s why it is stimulus-friendly</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Skarbek</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The former will demand a substantial stimulus program. The latter requires an \u201call-in\u201d approach from governments, business and individuals in what the report calls \u201cthe transformational decade\u201d before 2030. After that, the window for Australia to do its bit towards the Paris targets and prepare for a coming global zero emissions economy may have closed.</p> <p>Skarbek says it means a \u201cmake or break moment\u201d is coming. The good news, she says, is many transformational climate-friendly steps are stimulus-ready.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get this right, we can meet Australia\u2019s international climate change commitments, create jobs in sustainable industries, and set ourselves up for a smoother and speedier shift to a zero-emissions economy,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIf we miss the moment of the stimulus injection to also accelerate on climate, the downturn will make it even harder to do what is needed over the next decade. I do worry we might miss this chance forever if we don\u2019t seize it now.\u201d</p> <p>The report finds the progress and fall in cost of clean technology since the last analysis six years ago has been faster than expected, with renewable energy becoming cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost of batteries plunging 80% in a decade. It says much of the shift needed now could be rolled out quickly by rapid and large-scale deployment of familiar technology.</p> <p>It would include upgrading homes and commercial buildings to boost energy efficiency and run on solar power; building more large-scale clean energy plants and storage; installing electric vehicle charging stations; boosting the use of recycled goods in supply chains; and supporting more carbon forestry by planting and protecting trees to store CO2.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done,\u201d Skarbek says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is stimulus-friendly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa99678b731bec54237705a84e1614007a849573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa99678b731bec54237705a84e1614007a849573/0_9_4102_2461/1000..jpg\" alt=\"a row of electric volkswagon cars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To achieve a goal of 1.5C by 2030, three out of four cars in 2030 would have to be electric, the report says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uwe Meinhold/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The analysis found the difference between making cuts consistent with 1.5C and 2C of heating were noteworthy, but not always that great. The lower goal was likely to mean renewable energy providing 79% of power by 2030, compared with 73% for 2C and 48% if we continue on the current path without governments introducing further policies.</p> <p>On electric vehicles, a 1.5C path could require three out of every four new cars sold in 2030 being electric, compared with one out of two on a 2C path. The government has projected EVs will make up one in five new sales by then.</p> <p>Deployment of available tech to make rapid cuts in electricity, buildings and transport is easier than in heavy industry, agriculture and the land, but Amandine Denis-Ryan, ClimateWorks\u2019 head of national programs, says there are emerging solutions in those areas.</p> <p>One may be hydrogen, which governments are backing as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/time-to-consider-hydrogen-the-new-clean-energy-carrier-on-the-block\">potentially plentiful clean energy source</a> for use in transport and industry, and to export. While the report acknowledges green hydrogen is likely to have a part to play, it does not assume how big that role will be, given it is a relatively new industry and there is little data to back it up.</p> <p>But Skarbek says it is a potential answer to two big questions: what can be done in those parts of the economy, particularly in heavy industry, that cannot easily shift to running on clean electricity? And what industries can fill the gap created by Australia\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel exports?</p> <p>Denis-Ryan stresses the report reveals both what is possible and the urgency of the task. Achieving the Paris goals will require national emissions being cut in half by 2030 at the latest.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know we have enough technological capacity in the Australian economy to get there,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we need to get these technologies out the door at every opportunity.\u201d</p> <h2>Electricity</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/24/australia-carbon-emissions-fall-industrial-pollution-surges-electricity-agriculture-lng\">Australia's carbon emissions fall just 0.3% as industrial pollution surges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The analysis found electricity is key \u2013 getting to 100% clean energy will help clean up other parts of the economy. It suggests no significant increase in storage is needed to get from where we are today, <a href=\"https://opennem.org.au/energy/nem\">at about 25% clean energy</a>, to 50%. Pumped hydro and batteries are mature and available technologies for when that boost is required.</p> <p>Hydrogen may play a role, and demand-response programs, microgrids and inertia control technology are all considered at demonstration stage and could be rapidly scaled up to improve grid security. But the key factor determining the pace of the electricity transition is the speed at which coal and gas plants are closed.</p> <p>The analysis suggests over-building renewable energy to 200% capacity \u2013 double what the country needs \u2013 could be more cost-effective than building to 100%, and would spark new clean export opportunities.</p> <h2>Buildings</h2> <p>As with electricity, the technology for zero-emissions building already exists.</p> <p>It would involve improving energy efficiency through insulation and draught sealing and by installing LED lighting, solar hot water and efficient heating, cooling and appliances. It could mean the introduction of passive house design standards to conserve energy, the use of electrochromic windows that allow owners to control the amount of light and heat that passes through them, and smart systems that optimise when and how power is used. But much of it would be driven by a shift to clean energy, replacing gas-fired heating and cooking with heat pumps and induction stovetops.</p> <h2>Transport</h2> <p>Transport is not as easy to tackle as electricity and buildings, but the analysis found it could reach near zero emissions by 2050 through improving travel practices (using more electrified mass public transport and video-conferencing for business), shifting to electric vehicles and replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, and possibly renewable hydrogen and ammonia.</p> <h2>Industry</h2> <p>Industrial emissions have been rising rapidly<em> </em>in Australia, effectively cancelling out reductions in electricity generation and drought-affected agriculture before the coronavirus pandemic. They are harder to cut and would leave considerable \u201cresidual\u201d emissions by 2050 based on existing technology.</p> <p>Improved efficiency, fast-tracking a circular economy in which metals, plastics and timber are recycled and reused and 3D printing plays a bigger role, electrifying mines and steel operations where possible, and shifting to renewable fuels are (to varying degrees) available solutions that could lead to deep cuts.</p> <h2>Agriculture</h2> <p>Immediate cuts are possible through better use of energy, including onsite renewables at farms, substituting some meat products for plants and better management of waste and fertiliser. Other changes such as using vaccines to limit methane from livestock, and shifting to lab-grown meat, are emerging technologies and need greater support for rapid rollout.</p> <h2>Forestry</h2> <p>Reaching net-zero emissions in the medium-term would involve expanding use of forests to store carbon to offset the sector where, based on today\u2019s technology, the complete eradication of CO2<sub> </sub>is not yet possible. But the report warns this is a temporary solution. The country cannot reforest land forever, and trees are vulnerable to bushfires, drought and heatwaves, which are exacerbated by climate change.</p>",
  "<p>New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has called for a national enlistment program for doctors and nurses, to handle an expected surge in coronavirus cases in New York and across the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-update-live-news-usa-uk-spain-italy-china-who-middle-east-spike-world-global-cases-latest-updates\">Coronavirus live news: Italy records 766 more deaths but infection rate continues to slow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re fighting a war, let\u2019s act like we\u2019re fighting a war,\u201d he told reporters on Friday.</p> <p>De Blasio has said Sunday will be \u201cD-Day\u201d for the \u201cwar\u201d against coronavirus in his city, as confirmed cases, deaths and hospitalizations continue to soar and as projections forewarn a potentially devastating toll on human life.</p> <p>\u201cIf we have the personnel, if we have the equipment, lives are going to be saved. If we don\u2019t, people will die who did not need to die,\u201d De Blasio said earlier on CNN.</p> <p>\u201cNext week in New York City is going to be very tough. Next week in New York City and Detroit and New Orleans, and a lot of other places,\u201d he said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.</p> <p>\u201cAnd unless the military is fully mobilized and we create something we\u2019ve never had before, which is some kind of national enlistment of medical personnel moved to the most urgent needs in the country constantly \u2026 if we don\u2019t have that we\u2019re going to see hospitals simply unable to handle so many people who could be saved.\u201d</p> <p>Five thousand Covid-19 patients in New York City will probably be intubated and on ventilators by early next week \u2013 \u201ca staggering number\u201d, De Blasio said. As of now, the city only has the resources to get through Monday or Tuesday. Beyond that, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>The frustrated mayor reiterated that he had requested backup from the federal government in the form of 1,000 nurses, 150 doctors and 300 respiratory therapists more than a week ago. At a press conference on Friday afternoon, he confirmed his request was finally being acted on but said that if assistance did not come by Sunday, the city would face immediate challenges.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, it\u2019s New York City, and we see it starting in some other cities as well. But I guarantee you, all 50 states will have their own battle,\u201d De Blasio said.</p> <p>His renewed pressure on Washington marks a return to normal for the mayor after a few days of unusual optimism and gratitude toward his federal counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cThe cavalry keeps coming,\u201d he said earlier in the week, as 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs and paramedics poured in from around the country thanks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the crisis in New York City has grown worse. As of Friday morning, the city had 57,159 confirmed Covid-19 cases. More than 1,500 deaths had been reported. Before the health crisis, the city\u2019s hospitals only supported roughly 20,000 beds in total; now, more than half of the system\u2019s capacity from just a month ago has been swallowed exclusively by coronavirus patients.</p> <p>De Blasio said just to get through the coming week, New York City will need a minimum of 2,500 to 3,000 ventilators. He applauded Governor Andrew Cuomo, as well as New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, for announcing another drastic measure in an effort to drum up enough life-saving medical equipment and get through another day..</p> <p>Cuomo said he would sign an executive order that allows the national guard to take ventilators and personal protective equipment from institutions that don\u2019t need them right now, and redistribute them to those that do. He said those institutions would either have their ventilators returned to them or get reimbursements. Cuomo said there may be several hundred ventilators available because of the order.</p> <p>Right now, the state is fielding a daily need for about 300 additional ventilators, he said. Those ventilators, officials have repeatedly explained, make the difference between life and death.</p> <p>\u201cAm I willing to deploy the national guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You\u2019re damn right I am,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> <p>Cuomo also confirmed that an 2,500-bed emergency field hospital set up at the Jacob K Javits Center in midtown Manhattan will transition to treating Covid patients, after opening to accommodate non-Covid patient overflow.</p> <p>Donald Trump announced the change on Thursday amid confusion over why temporary treatment facilities meant to help overwhelmed New York City hospitals currently have few patients.</p> <p>The USNS Comfort, a navy hospital ship, only had 20 patients in its 1,000 beds as of Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.html\">the New York Times reported</a>. De Blasio said he believed the floating hospital will fill up in coming days.</p> <p>The Comfort is not intended to treat patients with Covid-19 and there are few non-coronavirus patients who need care, according to Cuomo.</p> <p>\u201cHospitals have now turned into effectively ICU hospitals for Covid patients,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cuomo also said he was concerned about an increase in Covid-19 cases on Long Island, where there are not as many resources as in New York City.</p> <p>As officials respond to the crisis, the New York economy has sputtered to a halt while residents ordered to stay home lose their jobs. <a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-the-biggest-increase-in-unemployment-due-to-coronavirus/72730/\">Unemployment insurance initial claims </a>have soared by more than 2,700% compared with this same time last year, according to a new analysis by WalletHub of US Department of Labor data.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/02/markets-us-jobless-claims-covid-19-economy-recession-coronavirus-business-live?page=with:block-5e85e03f8f0866297e9f5ab6\">Almost 10 million Americans</a> filed unemployment claims in the last two weeks of March, in light of the pandemic.</p>",

It had identified more than 160 different coronaviruses that had the potential to develop into pandemics, including a virus that is considered the closest known relative to Covid-19.</p> <p>A decision to wind down the program was made, however, in September, just three months before the first reports of people becoming infected with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China. The end of the program saw the departure of dozens of scientists and analysts working to identify potential pandemics in countries around the world, including China.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a genius, visionary program that USAid took a big risk to fund and it\u2019s a crying shame it was canceled,\u201d said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit specialist in tackling wildlife-borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program.</p> <p>Daszak said he did not know why the initiative was scrapped or if the White House played any direct role in its ending. EcoHealth Alliance has been given a temporary extension to work on the program but the role will finally come to a close in September.</p> <p>The news about Predict\u2019s demise was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-02/coronavirus-trump-pandemic-program-viruses-detection\">first reported </a>in the Los Angeles Times.</p> <p>Predict\u2019s work focused on the dangers of viruses spreading from wildlife to humans and causing possible pandemics like the Covid-19 outbreak that has resulted in much of the world grinding to a halt. It is suspected that Covid-19 made the leap to humans from a bat sold at a Wuhan market.</p> <p>Daszak said there are an estimated 1.7m mystery viruses in wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic, making the early detection of these diseases imperative for public health and economic reasons.</p> <p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve been more unsettled about this before all this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a lot of flak for spending money in other countries but just think how much even a few billion would be worth to stop this sort of pandemic. It\u2019s sad to see the project finish because it\u2019s the way of the future, in 50 years they will be bog-standard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not confident we will learn the lessons from this, though. We saw the same thing happen after Ebola and then Zika. We are always behind with pandemics, we are flying blind. We have hit the snooze button several times and now here\u2019s the big one.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether a continuation of the project would have dampened the current pandemic, although the Trump administration has faced criticism for its preparation before the outbreak. The administration reduced a team working in China on pandemics and has repeatedly attempted to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>A spokesman for USAid told the Los Angeles Times that the Predict program was \u201cjust one component of USAid\u2019s global health security efforts and accounted for less than 20% of our global health security funding\u201d. A new initiative to help prevent the spread of diseases from animals to humans is due to start later this year.</p>",

Normally Wisconsin requires people to submit a picture of their ID to get an absentee ballot, and all voters needed a witness to sign their ballot. These restrictions have been especially hard for senior citizens, as well as students and other people who move a lot, Burden said.</p> <p>Patricia Ginter, a 72-year-old real estate agent who lives alone in Wauwatosa, said in <a href=\"https://642cf75b-6e65-4c0d-82e2-11357e0523f7.filesusr.com/ugd/85cfb4_fd5031b5c752493fa160525360716d99.pdf?index=true\">a court filing</a> she has only left her house once in the last few weeks to go to the grocery store. She filled out her absentee ballot, but has no way of getting a witness because she\u2019s in isolation. Ginter is a plaintiff in one of several federal lawsuits challenging restrictions around Wisconsin absentee ballots.</p> <p>A Wisconsin elections commission <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KLQBN-KEwY1v9PGNvL8uNpzaPph7U7dP/view?usp=sharing\">memo</a> said people like Ginter could rely on delivery people to observe voters filling out their ballot through a window, or mail the witness certificate to someone who could observe over video chat. Lawyers representing Ginter and the other plaintiffs called those guidelines unworkable.</p> <p>On Thursday, however, the US district judge William Conley eased some of those rules and said Wisconsin voters could submit an absentee ballot without a witness signature if they provided a declaration they could not get one, and left local clerks with the authority to determine validity. He said cities like Milwaukee, which has already received hundreds of ballots without witness signatures, could count them with the declaration as well.</p> <p>The judge called the election \u201cill-advised\u201d but <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200402Order-1.pdf\">said he had no authority to stop it</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile Wisconsin\u2019s controversial identification rules have not been eased.

Conley <a href=\"https://twitter.com/srl/status/1246113340004450305\">also blocked</a> election officials from releasing election results until the later date.</p> <p>The change will probably allow thousands of Wisconsin voters to have their votes counted.

The motions received 43% and 46% support at Santos\u2019 annual general meeting , was held online on Friday due to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/scathing-report-into-nsw-coal-seam-gas-regulation-could-create-new-hurdles-for-santos-project\">Scathing report into NSW coal seam gas could create new hurdles for Santos Narrabri project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both resolutions were backed by several large proxy advisers and superannuation funds, but opposed by two Chinese shareholders, ENN Ecological Holdings and Hony Capital, that control about 30% of shares.</p> <p>The resolutions were not officially put to the meeting after a push to change the constitution to allow advisory resolutions was unsuccessful, but were acknowledged by Santos\u2019 chairman, Keith Spence, who read out the vote results.</p> <p>The centre\u2019s Dan Gocher said it showed there was strong support for fossil fuel companies to set targets to limit not just their own emissions, but those that result from their goods. He said many of Santos\u2019 peers, including BP, BHP and Royal Dutch Shell, had committed to scope 3 targets.</p> <p>\u201cThese results show how much of a laggard Santos is on climate change,\u201d Gocher said.</p> <p>\u201cThe onus is now on institutional investors to ensure that their vote is not ignored. Santos should immediately move to implement the review and disclosure measures recommended in the two resolutions.\u201d</p> <p>Spence told the meeting that while the resolutions had been rejected, it was clear that climate change was an important issue to our shareholders.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that is personally important to me as well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOur company is already taking industry-leading action towards emissions reduction, and we will continue to engage constructively with shareholders on climate change, and work towards our shared aspiration of net zero emissions by 2050 over the coming year.\u201d</p> <p>Santos <a href=\"https://www.santos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SAN14875-Performance-Report-Climate-Change.pdf\">has a target</a> of cutting emissions by more than 5% by 2025 and an aspirational goal of net zero emissions by 2050, but aims to lift gas production by 60% over the next five years.</p> <p>Gocher said it was untenable for Spence to maintain his opposition to setting a target for scope 3 emissions \u201cgiven the clear signal sent by his shareholders\u201d. </p> <p>Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said oil and gas companies had been told for years that investors expected them to address climate change in line with the Paris agreement.</p> <p>\u201cThe question now for Australian companies like Santos and Woodside is whether they are matching their European counterparts, who increasingly recognise that a strategy for a diversified business beyond pure fossil fuel extraction is required to reduce climate risk and provide long-term value for investors,\u201d she said.</p>",

By the end of January, Australia hit seven cases.</p> <p>Queensland was the first state to move. It declared a public health emergency on 29 January.

The dominant issue was aged care. A senior official familiar with the discussion on that day insists that only Queensland, which had already declared a health emergency, and New South Wales, had a sharp grasp of what was coming. Victoria was slow, but would come in forcefully later. \u201cThere really was no national leadership at that point,\u201d the official says.</p> <p>Morrison and the government would doubtless contest this assessment by pointing to the steady accumulation of action since 20 January. The government was also beginning to talk itself around on the likely need for fiscal stimulus. The first package of measures was in its infancy.</p> <p>But the clear impression from the states in late February, at least at the health intersection point, was Canberra hadn\u2019t yet locked on just how bad the Covid-19 health crisis would ultimately get.</p> <p>In March, the operating tempo would change.</p> <p>Two key events would drag the federation of Australia into the new normal.</p> <h2>The week that changed everything</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australia-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-explained-can-i-visit-my-partner-family-friends-walk-dog\">Australia's coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary event.

The second major pivot point played out over the following week, culminating in the weekend of 21 and 22 March.</p> <p>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, gave an inkling of what was to come on 10 March. Standing inside the Royal Melbourne hospital, he warned journalists \u201cextreme measures\u201d were coming.

If more was needed, there was always the budget in May.</p> <p>By the evening of 12 March, the premiers and chief ministers were at Kirribilli House with Morrison for a social gathering ahead of Coag the next day. Some of the leaders noticed when Andrews hung back when others left. The Victorian premier congratulated the prime minister on the stimulus, but predicted government assistance would shortly need to tick over into survival payments.

Live coverage could barely keep pace with events. But inside the cavernous football stadium, the Coag meeting started with the preordained agenda. There were briefings from the Reserve Bank of Australia and from Treasury. Murphy, the chief medical officer, also supplied a detailed briefing. The leaders then broke for a cup of tea.</p> <p>Running parallel with the leaders, health advisers from the states were also conferring by teleconference. Murphy was shuttling between the leaders meeting and the teleconference. Victoria, which had recorded the first case of community transmission that Friday, and Queensland, pushed during the discussion for stronger and more urgent action to force social distancing. People familiar with the dynamic in the meeting of medical officers insist it wasn\u2019t a boil over, but the forward-leaning states insisted more was needed. They sought a consensus to craft new, stronger, recommendations to be put to the leaders.</p> <p>Murphy conveyed that shift to the leaders meeting. That news hit the group like a thunderclap. Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye. Officials were promptly turfed out of the room and the leaders were left in a huddle, in a cavernous, empty football stadium in western Sydney, to determine what to do next.</p> <p>The table had been set for lunch. Lunch didn\u2019t happen. Tumult happened. But within the hour, entirely on the hop, nine political leaders had invented a new governance structure. No papers, no proposals, no guidance from officials. Morrison suggested they manage the crisis by convening regularly as a national cabinet. The proposal materialised in the room. The states agreed and insisted the group just be them, first ministers \u2013 no opposition leaders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government's coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group created an emergency national government of nine. Morrison later bolted in the national cabinet as a subcommittee of the regular cabinet.</p> <p>The leaders then moved to the discussion about imposing new limits on crowds, and how that would be announced to the public. There was a debate about when the proposed restriction should commence. Now, or Monday? Did people need to be given notice given it was now mid-afternoon on a Friday and events were scheduled for the weekend? There was a view some notice was required.</p> <p>Morrison war gamed in the leaders huddle about whether going to the opening game of the NRL season on Saturday night \u2013 something the prime minister had been foregrounding for days \u2013 would be a good or a bad signal. Would people be unsettled if he suddenly wasn\u2019t going? The leaders resolved the position they would telegraph, and emerged, and Morrison announced there would be a ban on non-essential gatherings of 500, effective Monday. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2020/mar/13/scott-morrison-defends-decision-to-attend-rugby-league-game-during-coronavirus-outbreak-video\">said he\u2019d be going to the football on Saturday night</a> because there was no cause for alarm, and \u201cit might be the last game I get to go to for a very long time\u201d.</p> <p>The day wasn\u2019t yet over. Shortly after the leaders scattered, there was another bombshell. The home affairs minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-peter-dutton-tests-positive-to-covid-19-after-returning-to-australia-from-us\">Peter Dutton had been infected with the virus, likely during a trip to America</a>.

Morrison has told colleagues the impact of this pandemic will be more far-reaching than the Depression. As the world wobbles, Australia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/australian-prime-minister-to-ask-global-leaders-to-fund-urgent-research-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">worried about failed states</a>, and the risk of a global sovereign debt crisis.</p> <p>The national government is responsible for economic wellbeing. This crisis has triggered a legitimate dialogue between the tiers of government about protecting lives and livelihoods; how to craft public health measures that save lives without deepening an economic crisis that would threaten wellbeing in other ways. Morrison wanted to craft measures that would enable Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/overseas-arrivals-to-australia-to-be-quarantined-in-hotels-for-two-weeks-over-coronavirus\">economy to move into a period of hibernation</a>, and he wanted to sequence the inevitable health restrictions to flatten the curve of infections with bursts of significant fiscal firepower.</p> <p>The economic response to this crisis is massive, as it was a decade ago during the global financial crisis. The Morrison government is drawing on the central bank, on the Council of Financial Regulators, on the retail banks, on big corporates, on coordination commissions. Public servants are being redeployed to frontline agencies. Sacked call centre workers are being picked up by Centrelink, and working in contact-tracing call centres in the states. Morrison and Frydenberg are talking regularly to their counterparts overseas.</p> <p>While the economy is largely Canberra\u2019s problem, the states manage health systems, and there was concern in the two most populous states that tough restrictions necessary to stop infections were not moving fast enough. Which brings us to the events of the weekend of 21 and 22 March.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was this weekend where the inevitable tension in the federation between saving jobs and preventing unmanageable numbers of ICU patients reached its peak, and manifested publicly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/as-australia-goes-off-the-coronavirus-cliff-the-question-is-how-hard-will-it-land\">sonic boom Sunday</a>.</p> <p>The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, had endured a terrible few days.

A tipping point had been reached.</p> <p>In Canberra, Morrison was hunkered down with colleagues finalising the government\u2019s second stimulus package. The plan was to unveil the $66bn worth of new measures on Sunday. Journalists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/scott-morrison-to-announce-66bn-stimulus-including-income-support-for-workers\">briefed late on Saturday</a> so stories could appear in the Sunday papers and on the political shows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/03/how-has-the-morrison-government-responded-to-the-coronavirus-crisis-australian-politics-live-podcast\">How has the Morrison government responded to the coronavirus crisis? \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in Sydney and Melbourne, Berejiklian and Andrews were alarmed. They felt public health restrictions needed to be imposed more quickly, because people were ignoring polite entreaties from politicians and chief medical officers. Canberra was not blocking action, but a dialogue about how hard to go with social distancing restrictions that would force businesses to close remained unresolved.</p> <p>Berejiklian and Andrews were in touch throughout Saturday, into Saturday night and then again Sunday morning. Berejiklian told Morrison on Saturday night that NSW and Victoria wanted to implement the first stage of restrictions pronto \u2013 the closure of places like pubs and clubs. She said the two states were prepared to move ahead of other jurisdictions if there wasn\u2019t prompt consensus through the national cabinet.</p> <p>Not all states were persuaded that it was time to force widespread lockdowns, and worried they would be dragged along in the slipstream when there wasn\u2019t a solid evidence base. Politically it would be hard for premiers to explain to their constituents why some states were moving and they were not. One official from another state says: \u201cWe [were] moving ahead of the health advice, and all the political pressure is to go further; to be out in front of this\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the ACT was fully on board with the NSW/Victoria view that stage one lockdowns had to happen, and now. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, noted there could not be one rule for Canberra and another for Queanbeyan. A leaders meeting scheduled originally for Tuesday had been brought forward to Sunday evening.</p> <p>The two premiers were not mucking around. Morrison was in his courtyard in Canberra about two-thirds of the way through unveiling stimulus round two when a reporter from the Nine Network asked the prime minister to comment on a new push by NSW and Victoria \u201cfor a total shutdown on non-essential businesses\u201d.

He responded by saying he would be guided by the health advice that was currently being prepared by the chief medical officers. If he had a view, he would be expressing it in the national cabinet, not on the hop to journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s the orderly and calm way to deal with these things, and to make decisions in a responsible manner.\u201d</p> <p>Public statements from the two states followed confirming that was in fact the position: restrictions needed to happen, and they were prepared to go in advance of others. Victoria upped the ante by signalling it would close schools from Tuesday. The national cabinet had been jolted into more urgency on the health side. The view in the states intent on pushing the envelope was this was a necessary jolt, delivered just in the nick of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863/0_0_6720_4480/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that night, after the national cabinet discussion, Morrison fronted the cameras and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/victoria-nsw-lockdowns-scott-morrison-coronavirus-national-cabinet\">confirmed pubs and clubs would close</a>. Restaurants and cafes would be restricted to takeaway only. Schools, confusingly, seemed to be both open and closed.</p> <p>Given the obvious tumult of the day, Morrison also felt compelled to affirm the national cabinet had not splintered. The self-created government of nine had mauled, inelegantly, to a point of consensus. It has weathered its first big test. \u201cAll of its members are very committed to its processes and decisions,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <h2>The new normal</h2> <p>This pandemic is close. It casts a shadow. \u201cWe are all next to it,\u201d Josh Frydenberg tells Guardian Australia while downing a late dinner in his Canberra digs one night this week. As the treasurer was working up the third economic support package in as many weeks \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/from-tight-purse-strings-to-massive-fiscal-firepower-the-coalitions-staggering-transformation\">$130bn for wages subsidies the government unfurled early this week</a> \u2013 his cousin was seriously ill in intensive care in a Melbourne hospital. Frydenberg\u2019s cousin had picked up the virus during a trip to London with his wife, and soon succumbed to a high temperature and breathing difficulties. Fortunately, he is now recovering well.</p> <p>After the watershed weekend in March, the public health restrictions have only gathered pace. Stage one was followed quickly by stages two and three. One of the recent national cabinets decreed that gatherings would go from 10 to two. Some insiders say the health advice going into the meeting was to maintain the restriction at 10, but leaders defaulted to two. Queensland pushed for one of the more recent measures \u2013 quarantining returning travellers in hotels. The state argued that particular measure would have the biggest positive impact on infection rates without inflicting more pain on the general community.</p> <p>Messaging at the beginning was confusing, and at times contradictory. But the public health messaging has become simpler, and more forceful. Stay home, unless there is a very good reason to go out. The commonwealth meanwhile keeps rolling out economic support. Wages subsidies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare</a>, at least for some.

It is disconcerting. Gathering places that once teemed with life are empty. States are walled off. The businesses still open wonder when they will have to close their doors. The federal parliament is only sitting in short sessions to pass specific measures. Liberty has been curtailed by emergency powers now in place across all the states and territories, enforced by state police. It is reasonable to wonder how long the public will consent to these arrangements. Australia is a vibrant, noisy, democracy, not a police state.</p> <p>Things feel grim, because they are grim. The suspension of ordinary existence is absolutely necessary in the service of saving lives, but we have entered a new normal that could persist not for six months, which is the timeframe invoked most regularly by political leaders, but for a year. Or two.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Tony Bartone</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The medical profession remains on the fence about whether the governments of Australia are currently getting the balance right. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, tells Guardian Australia that can only be judged with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cThe truth of the matter is governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially,\u201d Bartone says.</p> <p>\u201cWe can raise all number of reasons about why that\u2019s the case including mixed messaging, poor information and communication, and indifference by younger sections of the community who thought it was an old person\u2019s disease and they didn\u2019t have to worry. For all those reasons, governments have had to take the community on a conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Bartone also cautions against some of the optimistic commentary that has emerged over the course of the past week that Australia has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">begun to flatten the curve of new infections</a>. \u201cWe are flattening it but remember that also, we had a big spike in numbers last week and previously because half the Australian population abroad returned home before the lockdowns.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

I sent him a text the other night to say no prime minister in our lifetime has had to face down something as significant as this, and that national cabinet is working extremely well, and this was a fantastic suggestion from him and we are all very grateful to be acting as one government almost, if you like, across the country rather than nine of us doing our own thing.\u201d</p> <p>He says the federation creates a tension reflecting divided responsibilities. \u201cThere is that tension, that\u2019s perfectly healthy and appropriate. It\u2019s a big thing to close businesses and see people stood down. These are massive decisions to make and there is a very big toll that comes with that including anxiety and all sorts of other issues, often tragic issues, like increased family violence rates for instance and all sorts of other mental health considerations. It\u2019s not a bad thing that we are all grappling with that very difficult choice, trying to smash the virus and trying to preserve the economy as much as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Barr says the ad hoc government of nine is learning on its feet. \u201cWe are getting there now but we weren\u2019t quite there initially around fully appreciating how much the health curve would impact on the economic outcome. I think that gap is now being closed.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a few things that in hindsight you would like to have got there a week to 10 days earlier, but we have got there, sometimes just in time. What I would like to see in the next phase of this is we are not playing catch-up so much; that we are shaping the future a bit more rather than reacting to the past.\u201d</p> <p>Barr insists the national cabinet has brought out the best in the federation, and could, in fact, be a segue to a newer, more effective style of politics and governance. \u201cThis mechanism has forced cooperation that we haven\u2019t seen before. The level of information sharing is much improved from the case before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/australia-coronavirus-shutdown-rules-stage-3-not-lockdown-what-is-closed-open-restrictions\">Australia coronavirus shutdown: what is open, closed and banned under the current rules?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you were observing that national cabinet from outside and you knew nothing about Australian politics you wouldn\u2019t know which side of the fence people were on.

  "<p>By the time Ons Jabeur had finished her rhapsodic three-set win over the world No 3, Karolina Pliskova, in Doha at the end of February, the crowd had ascended to a state of sheer delirium. It was the best win of her career and, for the audience, a mixture of proud Tunisians and other Arab nationalities scattered around Doha, it was a rare sight of one of their own thriving in this alien sport. And so they chanted her name before, during and after points, cheering endlessly into the night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/03/lta-readies-20m-support-for-british-tennis-during-tour-suspension\">LTA readies \u00a320m support package for most 'severely affected' in tennis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d says Jabeur in a phone interview. \u201cIt was kind of tough sometimes because they didn\u2019t know the rules of tennis! They thought it was a football match, but it was amazing, seeing all the Tunisians who made the effort to come and see me with all the Tunisian flags \u2026 seeing that I had this impact on people following more tennis makes me proud. Not just football, but tennis.\u201d</p> <p>Those scenes \u2013 the sight of a player, a female player, trailblazing in real time \u2013 may turn out to be the most important moment of the tennis season. The Arab world accounts for around 423 million of the world\u2019s population, yet before Jabeur it had yielded only five top-100 players ever. Four were men. The only Arab woman to reach the top level was Jabeur\u2019s compatriot and friend Selima Sfar, who rose to 75 in the world and made the second round of a handful of grand slams during the early 2000s.</p> <p>Over the past few years, Jabeur has made it her mission to change everything. As she has travelled the WTA Tour, she has carried with her one simple phrase: the first. She was the first Arab woman to reach the third round of a slam, the first to break into the top 50 and the first to reach a WTA final.</p> <p>Still, it was not until this year, at 25 years old, that she began to unlock her potential. She has reached the quarter-finals of the two biggest tournaments this season, the Australian Open and Doha. In Melbourne she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/21/johanna-konta-bundled-out-of-australian-open-by-ons-jabeur\">beat Britain\u2019s Johanna Konta in the first round</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/24/wang-qiang-plays-match-of-her-life-to-beat-serena-williams\">ended Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s career</a>. In Dubai, she held match points before barely losing to Simona Halep in a manic tussle. Her win over Pliskova in Doha was confirmation she is capable of securing top results. She stands 11th in the 2020 rankings and at a career high of 39 overall.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When someone tells me I\u2019m inspiring them, it gives me more motivation to be an example</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jabeur takes her influence seriously and she is also aware of its unique sphere in tennis. As a Tunisian, she is an Arab woman and African, two of the least represented populations in the sport. While her successes are always reported through an Arab lens, Jabeur has always been clear in her intentions to influence both.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really, really proud of that,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes when we play Fed Cup, some African teams come and they want to take pictures, they ask me about how I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s really inspiring for me. When someone tells me that I\u2019m inspiring them, it gives me more motivation to practice and be more of an example. I hope we can see more players from Africa on the tour.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Jabeur\u2019s rise is the fact her formative years were spent at home. Between the coaching, equipment and unavoidable travel, the costs of playing the sport are vast. Without proper tennis infrastructure and high-level competition, even the most talented players face a perilous route to the top. </p> <p>As a child, Jabeur\u2019s biggest move was the 90-mile drive from her coastal hometown, Sousse, to the capital city, Tunis, where she trained in a multi-sport academy from 12 years old. She would later leave for brief stints in Europe, but she quickly learned she was most comfortable at home, where she lives permanently. She proudly calls herself a \u201c100% Tunisian product\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d767e8752559836094fe3df84a00a0e2250fffea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d767e8752559836094fe3df84a00a0e2250fffea/0_61_5193_3116/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Ons Jabeur embraces Caroline Wozniacki\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jabeur embraces Caroline Wozniacki after ending the former world No 1\u2019s career at the Australian Open in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Jabeur, remaining at home when she was younger meant constantly hearing the laughter and derision of those who would openly tell her that, like most who tried before her, she would never be good enough. \u201cYou find these people everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cThey underestimate you. I was a big mouth, I talked, I said I want to win grand slams, and people were laughing and they didn\u2019t believe in me. Some people did believe in me. <br><br>\u201cOne time I had a surgery on my wrist and the first few days when I came back after five months, I couldn\u2019t play tennis. The balls were flying everywhere, no feelings or nothing. People were watching, making fun of me and saying: \u2018Yeah, she\u2019s gotta stop tennis.\u2019 But these thoughts make me stronger.\u201d</p> <p>Jabeur was excellent from a young age. In 2011 she became the first Arab woman to win the Roland Garros juniors. It only takes a glimpse of her in action to be blinded by her talent. In an era filled with innumerable flat-hitting baseliners, Jabeur is unique. Her toolbox contains every shot and she is desperate to use them all with style. That can sometimes be a problem.</p> <p>\u201cI just started doing these crazy shots from a young age,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose to play flat or spin. I was just doing crazy shots, which maybe reflects my personality. I like fun, crazy things, I like original stuff.

Her strokes are handsome and technically sound, and on the surface they look as if they are the work of a good coach who taught her the correct basics. Her response betrays the single-minded conviction that continues to guide her on a path nobody has trodden before.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember someone telling me I should do that,\u201d she says. \u201cI always do whatever suits me. Sometimes a coach would tell me I do too many drop shots. I\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, sure!\u2019 But I never listen.

  "<p>In many ways, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourleadership\">ended this week</a> exactly as his enemies always hoped it would. Heavily defeated in a general election, dismissed since as a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-doesnt-realise-how-irrelevant-it-is-kr0tzst5s\">political irrelevance</a>, and criticised even for questioning the government\u2019s inept handling of the coronavirus crisis, Corbyn probably has a lower reputation now than at any time since he first stood for leader, to much derision, in 2015 \u2013 and perhaps even since he became an MP, in 1983. The <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-says-still-working-21787329\">recent attacks</a> on him for appearing in the House of Commons and working in his Westminster office during the crisis at the age of 70, despite official advice that older people should stay at home, have in a sense taken the years of assaults on his legitimacy to their logical conclusion. To many of his critics, Corbyn has no right to exist as a significant public figure.</p> <p>Yet this drastic shrinking of his status has also coincided, thanks to the crisis, with a huge expansion of what governments do. And expanding the state\u2019s role in society and the economy is what much of Corbyn\u2019s career has been devoted to. Corbynism was \u2013 and is \u2013 primarily a politics about addressing emergencies: the stark inadequacies of modern capitalism, the damage caused by austerity, and the accelerating effects of the climate crisis.</p> <p>Now we are in what may be an even bigger emergency than even the most fervent Corbynistas envisaged when they mobilised for his leadership campaigns. In theory, a world where the state pays people\u2019s wages, keeps businesses afloat, and \u201cis judged by [its] capacity for compassion\u201d, as the chancellor Rishi Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">puts it</a> \u2013 all situations that will continue for some time after the pandemic \u2013 ought to suit the more leftwing Labour party Corbyn is passing on to his successor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/is-keir-starmer-failing-call-out-government-coronavirus\">Is Keir Starmer failing to call out the government over coronavirus? | Katy Balls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This possibility explains some of the nervousness about the future <a href=\"https://iea.org.uk/how-should-we-pay-for-all-this-extra-government-spending/\">emanating from</a> the rightwing press and thinktanks. Before coronavirus they were luxuriating in the possibilities they thought had been created by Brexit and Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory. A parallel hope is building on the left that perhaps the future won\u2019t be as politically bleak as it has seemed ever since last December\u2019s exit poll. Corbyn himself <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52056914\">told the BBC</a> recently that coronavirus was bringing about \u201ca change in our politics\u201d in favour of a kinder state and society, which was being felt \u201cin every country in the world\u201d.</p> <p>But the hope, or fear, that the left will revive in the traumatised, anxious Britain likely to emerge from the crisis ignores the fact that during the already quite fraught 2010s Labour never managed to make its politics of emergencies sufficiently compelling. Corbyn\u2019s party had energy, innovative policies and \u2013 sometimes \u2013 a lot of moral authority. Yet, Labour didn\u2019t make enough voters realise that the country\u2019s big social, economic and environmental crises had either been caused, or effectively ignored, by a series of Conservative governments. Nor, almost as damagingly, did Labour interest enough voters in its highly promising solutions, such as the <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/a-green-industrial-revolution/\">green new deal</a>. During the Corbyn era, I left countless Labour briefings with exciting ideas and rhetoric ringing in my ears, only to discover shortly afterwards that the wider world either hadn\u2019t noticed what had been announced or didn\u2019t trust it.</p> <p>Media bias, the distraction of Brexit, a leader who was reluctant to attack the Tories and was a limited communicator: these are the wearyingly familiar reasons Labour\u2019s messages didn\u2019t cut through, despite everything that was going wrong in Britain in the 2010s. Yet all these obstacles, except the first, will probably diminish or disappear under a new leader.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives\u2019 performance over coronavirus may become so obviously disastrous, especially for the <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-2019-election\">older Britons</a> on whom the Tories rely in elections, that it destroys their credibility as a government in a way that the more hidden social catastrophe of austerity did not. Something similar happened on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\">Black Wednesday</a> in 1992. Shortly after a fourth successive Tory election victory, the spectacular and costly collapse of their policy of keeping the pound in the European exchange rate mechanism (a precursor to the euro) dissolved their reputation for economic competence overnight. It became one of the main reasons for their landslide <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/05/0505/stats.shtml\">election defeat</a> five years later.</p> <p>The Tories\u2019 mistakes over coronavirus could make Black Wednesday look like a minor mishap. Even more than sensible stewardship of the economy, the Tories trade on their supposed ability to keep out foreign threats and keep the public safe.</p> <p>Yet for Labour to replace them, it will have to become and remain an obvious government in waiting, probably for a long time before the next election, as it did from 1992 to 1997. That will mean exposing Conservative incompetence and moral failings with a precision that Labour hasn\u2019t managed since Tony Blair\u2019s opposition leadership in the mid-90s. All its leaders since \u2013 Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband and Corbyn \u2013 have lacked Blair\u2019s lawyerly touch.</p> <p>The new leader will also need a believable vision of a Labour-run Britain. The longer a party is out of power, the more abstract \u2013 and therefore less credible and appealing \u2013 the idea of it being in power can become. Corbyn had a vision: of a radically more equal and greener Britain. But it never quite came into focus for voters. As a leftwinger with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Jeremy_Corbyn\">distractingly long past</a>, he probably had an impossible job. The new leader\u2019s will be easier, but not by much.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Even in these extraordinary times, the sight of the president of the United States presenting a slide which announced as a \u201cgoal\u201d the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-painful-us-deaths\" title=\"\">up to 240,000</a> of its citizens was almost beyond belief. To hit the lowest end of the target, a staggering 100,000 American deaths, would show that his administration had done \u201ca very good job\u201d, Donald Trump claimed this week. The highest end would be more than double the US casualties in the first world war. This could only be considered a positive outcome because the alternative is so shocking: without mitigation measures, if people fail to stay at home as advised, the US could be heading for between 1.5 million and 2.2 million deaths.</p> <p>The US is now the new centre of the pandemic, with more than a fifth of the million cases reported worldwide, and more than 5,000 deaths. The vast majority of Americans \u2013 more than 300 million \u2013 are now under some form of lockdown, though the stringency of restrictions varies greatly and a few states are still holding out. Those measures have come too late to stop hospitals from being overwhelmed.</p> <p>The richest country in the world is structurally ill-equipped to cope with such a crisis. The lack of universal healthcare or basic employment rights such as statutory sick pay, and the low incomes on which so many Americans survive, are conducive to the spread of disease and to it having the most serious consequences.</p> <p>But an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\" title=\"\">utter failure of leadership</a> \u2013 the lack of will, intelligence, basic competence or even consistency on the part of the Trump administration \u2013 has turbocharged the problem. And without the work of state governors and institutions, who have pre-empted the administration and gone far beyond it in taking action, matters would be even worse. Mr Trump has at best left them to fend for themselves and at worst actively hindered the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>His culpability actually predates the virus\u2019s emergence in China. The administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-cuts-undermine-coronavirus-containment-cdc-watchdog-report\" title=\"\">got rid of most of the staff</a> who worked on identifying global health problems in China, while repeatedly attempting to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A comprehensive document on battling pandemics, drawn up under the Obama administration, was \u201cthrown on to a shelf\u201d by its successor. Only last October, an internal federal government report warned that the US was woefully underprepared and underfunded to tackle a virus without a cure.</p> <p>Even after the virus was confirmed to have reached the US, Mr Trump downplayed the crisis at every opportunity, fearing the impact on the economy. As late as 25 February he called it \u201cvery well under control\u201d. He has touted unproven remedies. Last week, he said he wanted to reopen large sections of the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\" title=\"\">by Easter</a> and to see \u201cpacked churches all over our country\u201d \u2013 though he has, thankfully, since extended the federal \u201cstay at home\u201d guidance until the end of this month. The federal government should have mobilised long ago to acquire an appropriate supply of testing kits, protective equipment and ventilators. It did not. This week, he was forced to acknowledge that the government\u2019s emergency stockpile of protective equipment is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/trump-coronavirus-stockpile-ppe-briefing\" title=\"\">almost exhausted</a>.</p> <p>The economy is reeling. An astonishing 6.6 million Americans signed on for unemployment welfare last week. The emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\" title=\"\">$2tn relief package</a>, while necessary and welcome, offers more to corporate America than those on the breadline.</p> <p>Some wonder if this could finally break his spell. So far, people are rallying around the flag: a national crisis tends to prompt people to support the leadership. Despite his dereliction of duty, Mr Trump\u2019s approval ratings have actually increased, as they have for leaders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7f5a8bc-eb0e-45e5-a080-bbfd6d317def\" title=\"\">in almost every democratic nation</a>. He may also benefit from the rock-bottom expectations people have of him. And he is already trying to rewrite the facts and pin the blame on others, attacking governors both for failing to prepare and for hoarding equipment.</p> <p>These efforts may yet succeed. But the truth is that, as he has finally acknowledged, the coming weeks will be \u201cvery, very painful\u201d \u2013 and that his inaction has made them much more so.</p>",

Jamie Potter, Partner at Bindmans, said:<br><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The social distancing measures being put in place by government are clearly important, but they cannot be used to disproportionately interfere in the rights of those with protected characteristics, particularly those with mental illness, autism or similar conditions that necessitate leaving the house more than once per day. </p> \n   <p>Such rights can clearly co-exist with the health measures being put in place and Parliament clearly did not think it necessary to impose the once per day restriction arbitrarily introduced by the government. It is essential the government needs to rethink this restrictive policy and allow appropriate flexibility where it is necessary and justified.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One of the affected families instructing Bindmans said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The government must consider the vital needs of disabled people and their families, many of whom now have considerably reduced support, while managing the coronavirus crisis, including essential social distancing. Without these considerations, the current situation risks becoming unmanageable for them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8755a38f0866297e9f6992\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T15:26:50.790Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38885a67fbb87077071c2448a9722900731196f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38885a67fbb87077071c2448a9722900731196f/0_0_2804_2944/952..jpg\" alt=\"A brightly painted \u2018thank you NHS\u2019 picture in a shop window in Penarth, Wales.\" width=\"952\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A brightly painted \u2018thank you NHS\u2019 picture in a shop window in Penarth, Wales.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8753fd8f08532a0e667886\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T15:21:31.529Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A will company is waiving fees for those working in the NHS after experiencing a 12-fold increase in the number of requests from such workers in March compared to December.<br><br><strong>Farewill</strong> is waiving its \u00a390 fee to make a will, the company\u2019s chief executive, Dan Garrett, said. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve seen demand for our services increase recently and we\u2019ve done everything we can to meet it, taking on around 20 extra staff.

  "<p>Boris Johnson and his government are on probation, watched by a public whose mood could turn rapidly and brutally. For now, and on paper, Johnson has the people with him: his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-28/coronavirus-gives-boris-johnson-s-political-immunity\">poll ratings</a> have surged north of 50%, a feat last managed by a Tory government at the height of the Falklands war nearly 40 years ago. But the wisest heads in Downing Street will not be turned by those numbers. They know that there\u2019s always a \u201crally around the flag\u201d effect at moments of extreme crisis: when citizens are frightened, they want to believe their leaders have got things under control. That\u2019s why incumbents around the world, even useless and immoral ones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/trump-narcissism-american-blood-coronavirus\">such as Donald Trump</a>, have enjoyed an initial corona bounce in their ratings, almost regardless of their actions. At the start of the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 Jimmy Carter saw his approval numbers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/survey-finds-carters-popularity-has-risen-sharply-in-iran-crisis.html\">leap from 32% to </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/survey-finds-carters-popularity-has-risen-sharply-in-iran-crisis.html\">61%</a> \u2013 only for him to crash to defeat a year later. Johnson will know that one day, and perhaps quite soon, he, too, will be judged.</p> <p>He can point to some concrete achievements. The opening today of what is a giant field hospital in east London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">Ex</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">CeL </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">centre</a>, constructed within nine days, is the prime example. Those who drooled with totalitarian envy at China\u2019s ability to throw up a hospital in Wuhan within a week were adamant that a western democracy like Britain could never match that accomplishment, and they have been proved wrong. Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise that the state will pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">80% of workers\u2019 wages</a> has won plaudits around the world, even if the chancellor has had to return repeatedly to his economic rescue package, tweaking it to catch those groups he left behind first time around. And the government has imposed a national lockdown that has been largely observed, one that might even see a flattening of the infection curve in the next week or so.</p> <p>All that, though, has to be set against a record that does not inspire confidence, but saps it. It consists of a series of decisions that, for now, the British public has been prepared to forgive, granting its leaders the benefit of the doubt, but which it may eventually find indefensible. Their combined effect can be seen in a single image, a graph with the power to terrify. It shows that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1245466456789303297?s=20\">the UK death toll is </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1245466456789303297?s=20\"> currently higher than Italy\u2019s at the same stage</a>, reinforced by another showing that by this stage of the outbreak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1245703131947827200?s=20\">Italy had begun to flatten its curve while in Britain the line keeps rising</a>, the number of deaths doubling every three days.</p> <p>Start with Johnson\u2019s initial reaction to this menace. Recall the smirking insouciance with which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/27/i-shook-hands-with-everybody-says-boris-johnson-weeks-before-coronavirus-diagnosis-video\"> boasted that he continued to shake hands</a>, even when he met people he knew to be infected with the virus. If Britain emerges from this crisis with a higher death rate than comparable countries, that is a Johnson moment that will come to haunt him.</p> <p>That complacency was formalised in the government\u2019s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity, an approach that some ministers still try to deny was ever policy but which was spelled out explicitly by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1238390547783528448?s=20\">chief scientific adviser as recently as 13 March</a>. To be sure, Johnson U-turned on that, ditching mitigation for all-out suppression when he announced the national lockdown 10 days later, prompted in part by seeing Italy engulfed by the virus. But Britons might not wait for the inevitable public inquiry to wonder at the time lost chasing what proved to be a fantasy and to ask how those precious days might have been used instead to prepare for what was coming.</p> <p>For that time could have been devoted to testing, the failing on which this government is likely to be judged most harshly. On Thursday, health secretary Matt Hancock sought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">offer an explanation</a> for why Britain so conspicuously lags behind the likes of Germany in this area: Britain does not have the diagnostic industry the Germans have built up over 70 years, he said. But that cannot excuse what has been a litany of mixed messages, crossed wires and broken promises.</p> <p>Even now, there remains confusion about whether the government accepts the centrality of <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-we-still-need-to-test-widely-for-coronavirus/\">testing to combating this threat</a>. It was not three weeks ago that the head of the World Health Organization made the case in words of one syllable. The way to fight Covid-19 was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/16/test-test-test-who-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-video\">test, test, test</a>\u201d. Yet a matter of hours before Hancock spoke, and even as the prime minister was calling testing the key that would \u201cunlock the coronavirus puzzle,\u201d the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, was on TV arguing that testing was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvpeston/status/1245456133659262979?s=20\">a bit of a side issue,</a>\u201d compared with slowing the rate of new infections via physical distancing.</p> <p>Small wonder, then, that while ministers have been on a loop promising to \u201cramp up\u201d testing, those tasked with making that happen have been tripping over their feet. Note the government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/richholmes/uk-thousands-extra-coronavirus-tests\">animal health agency, which says it could have been running </a><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/richholmes/uk-thousands-extra-coronavirus-tests\"> 40,000 human tests a week </a>and has been eager to help, but couldn\u2019t get a straight answer out of Public Health England (PHE). First in touch with PHE back in January, its capacity still remains untapped.</p> <p>That seems to fit with reports that PHE has been too controlling and centralising, standing in the way of the Dunkirk effort urged by Nobel prize-winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse, in which hundreds of the UK\u2019s smaller labs would play the role of 1940\u2019s little boats, doing their bit to test, test, test. There has been confusion \u2013 ministers say there\u2019s a shortage of key chemicals called \u201creagents\u201d, the chemical industry says there\u2019s no shortage \u2013 and there has been failure, best captured by the sight of those much-vaunted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1245737538461077504?s=20\">drive-through testing </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1245737538461077504?s=20\"> facilities, in Chessington, North Greenwich or Wembley, standing unused </a>and echoingly empty. Note too the baffling decision that only 15% of tests should be given to NHS staff, a limit that was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BethRigby/status/1245354010720206851?s=20\">lifted this week</a>.</p> <p>When the time comes, the government might try to blame the civil servants and the bureaucrats and, no doubt, there will be plenty of blame to go around. But the government has power \u2013 more of it now than at any time since the war \u2013 and its duty was to bend the bureaucracy to its will. Hancock wants to convey that he\u2019s doing that, promising 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. But even if meeting that target proves possible, and details are scant, it could come too late, given that those same ministers are warning that the tidal wave will be crashing on our shores very soon. </p> <p>Sadly, the failings on testing do not stand alone. There has been the scandalous failure to equip doctors and nurses with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/nhs-staff-protection-doctor-ppe-coronavirus\">protective kit</a> they need. When hospitals are turning to <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/28/medical-fetish-store-hospital-scrubs-nhs-coronavirus-pandemic-ppe-covid19-medfet-twitter/\">suppliers of medical fetish gear </a>for essential masks and scrubs, you know something has gone badly wrong. The same can be said of watching a Trump administration official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1245381721283059712?s=20\">mock the UK for having so few ventilators</a>, or of the evidence that our government chose to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials\">stand aside from a Europe-wide effort to source those life-saving machines</a>, apparently because to take part would smack of betraying Brexit.</p> <p>For now, the British public are being patient, but their patience will not be infinite. Hancock will have to make good on that promise of 100,000 tests by the end of this month; the curve will have to flatten. At stake over the next four weeks will be the lives of many citizens of this nation \u2013 and the life of this government.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 April 2020. The original version referred to a decision that \u201conly 15% of NHS staff could be tested\u201d for Covid-19; in fact the decision had been that only 15% of daily testing capacity for the disease could be allocated to NHS staff.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cUnlike some countries, we didn\u2019t go into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry. We have the best scientific labs in the world, but we did not have the scale,\u201d Matt Hancock said this week, facing a barrage of questions on why the UK is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">lagging behind others</a> on coronavirus testing.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s health secretary said his German counterpart could call on 100 test labs and rely on the heavy presence of Roche, one of the world\u2019s largest diagnostics companies, to achieve its current level of more than 50,000 tests a day. The UK had had to build from a lower base, he said.</p> \n<p>Industry players say this is a fair characterisation. \u201cWe have a lot of diagnostics capability in this country but what we don\u2019t have is the global diagnostics giants,\u201d said Tony Cooke of Cambridge Clinical Laboratories. \u201cEven when we have our own companies, a lot of the supplies are coming from the US or Germany.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK is not alone in struggling to meet demand. France has carried out even fewer tests than the UK, and Spain tried to bridge supply chain issues by buying millions of test kits from China that later had to be withdrawn after giving flawed results.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as Roche, which has developed a single machine that can churn out 1,000 test results a day, Germany also has Qiagen, a major supplier of genetic testing kits, which are being used to diagnose Covid-19. Both companies also produce reagents and components used in kits put together by other manufacturers. The US has called on Abbott, Thermofisher, Quest Diagnostics and Hologic.</p> \n<p>The more distributed hospital lab system in countries such as Germany and Italy has also served them well in being able to increase testing for Covid-19. The NHS has spent years centralising its testing labs, which under normal circumstances was both economical and clinically robust. It has allowed labs to be aligned to standard diagnostic criteria and to use the same test kits, reagents and equipment from the same suppliers, allowing bulk purchases from single suppliers at a competitive price.</p> \n<p>During a pandemic, however, this dependency on a handful of non-domestic suppliers, such as Roche, for kits and reagents becomes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-testing-in-uk-timeline-of-ministers-mixed-messages\">fundamental flaw</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-testing-in-uk-timeline-of-ministers-mixed-messages\">Britain\u2019s coronavirus testing scandal: a timeline of mixed messages</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Allan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, says the UK could have done a better job of surveying its diagnostic landscape and built a strategy around existing strengths, which include having a large number of research labs and smaller, but highly innovative diagnostics companies.</p> \n<p>The re-engineering of HIV testing machines into 90-minute Covid-19 tests by Diagnostics for the Real World in Cambridge, which within a week will meet the entire testing requirements of Addenbrookes hospital in the city, is an example of the type of approach that could have been encouraged nationally.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were slow to make that decision in testing and we approached it in too narrow a perspective,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it regional locally, people forming and forging partnership arrangements, looking for support from universities and commercial companies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Industry figures say that more could be done in future to nurture some of these startups and medium-sized companies into home-grown giants.</p> \n<p>There is a record to show that innovative businesses started in the UK have this potential, but that beyond a certain level of success the companies tend to migrate to the US where venture capital and buyers are in more ready supply.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Medisense, which was spun out of Oxford University in the 1990s, revolutionised the blood glucose sensing industry in the 1990s, then was acquired by the US company Abbott.

  "<p>Between 1990 and 2004, Joe Diffie was one of the most commercially successful artists in country music, notching up more than 30 singles on Billboard\u2019s country chart, including five No 1s. Diffie, who has died aged 61 after contracting Covid-19, built up a huge and loyal following with songs based around shrewd observations of everyday life, which he performed with rambunctious rowdiness and easygoing humour.</p> <p>It was in this uncomplicated spirit that he recorded hits such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6zIpW8z1w\" title=\"\">Bigger Than the Beatles</a> (No 1 in 1995), the tale of love between a waitress and a hotel lounge singer featuring a crafty nod to the Beatles\u2019 She Loves You. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AwQPW6myWo\" title=\"\">John Deere Green</a> (No 5, 1993) entwined the John Deere tractor, traditionally dear to the hearts of American farmers, with the lifelong romance of Billy Bob and Charlene. Perhaps his philosophy was best captured in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMiEFyTuuh8\" title=\"\">Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die)</a> \u2013 No 3 in 1993 \u2013 in which Diffie sang: \u201cFill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand / Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die.\u201d</p> <p>Diffie was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His mother, Flora, was a schoolteacher and also ran a flower shop. His father, Joe, held a variety of jobs including rancher, truck driver and welder, and would later become the tour bus driver for the country artist Toby Keith. Joe Sr also played the guitar and banjo, while Flora was a singer, and Joe Jr began singing while still an infant. At 14 he launched his performing career by appearing with his aunt Dawn Anita\u2019s country band. The family moved around between San Antonio, Texas, Washington State and Wisconsin before settling in Velma, Oklahoma, where Joe attended high school. </p> <p>He developed his skills as a musician and harmony singer with a variety of gospel and bluegrass groups including Higher Purpose and Special Edition. He lived for a time in Duncan, Oklahoma, where he worked in a foundry and played in local bars and dancehalls, but the foundry closed and his first marriage, to Janise Parker, broke up.</p> <p>In 1986 he moved to Nashville, determined to succeed in the music business. While working during the day with Gibson guitars, he focused on his songwriting and sang on demo recordings. He enjoyed a breakthrough in 1988, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries1\" title=\"\">Hank Thompson</a>, the \u201cking of western swing\u201d, recorded his song Love On the Rocks. \u201cThere\u2019s really no magic formula,\u201d Diffie commented, about his songwriting. \u201cI\u2019ve just always drawn on my own experience, whether it\u2019s falling in love or hanging out in a bar. I feel like if I can relate to it, other people will too.\u201d</p> <p>A deal with Epic Records followed, and Diffie\u2019s debut album, A Thousand Winding Roads, appeared in 1990. This gave him his first country No 1 hit with his debut single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6y7Aa9aSkM\" title=\"\">Home</a>, a showcase for his smooth and supple voice and the beginning of a streak of six consecutive Top 5 singles including another chart-topper, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdutns1wWXg\" title=\"\">If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)</a>.</p> <p>He was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993, a year when he also released the platinum-selling album Honky Tonk Attitude. The following year brought his most successful long-player, Third Rock from the Sun, which reached 6 on the US country chart. This contained one of his biggest hits, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I51JXpcLwk\" title=\"\">Pickup Man</a>, which played on the double entendre of sexual attraction and pickup trucks \u2013 \u201cI met all my wives in traffic jams / There\u2019s just something women like about a pickup man\u201d.</p> <p>In 1998 he won a Grammy for his appearance on a star-studded recording of Same Old Train with Emmylou Harris, Marty Stuart, Merle Haggard and others. His songs were frequently covered by other artists, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A5LqcqiqEw\" title=\"\">Memory Lane by Tim McGraw</a>, and Jo Dee Messina\u2019s take on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o40fwZgSFPI\" title=\"\">My Give a Damn\u2019s Busted</a>.

  "<p>Warehouse workers for the fast fashion brands Pretty Little Thing and Boo Hoo are begging consumers to stop ordering non-essential items such as \u00a36 boob tubes and \u00a38 false eyelashes after orders at one depot more than tripled in a week.</p> \n<p>Morale is said to be \u201crock bottom\u201d at Pretty Little Thing\u2019s fulfilment centre in Tinsley, Sheffield, where workers doing 12-hour shifts said they were processing orders for 400,000 items this week, up from 120,000 in a \u201cnormal\u201d week.</p> \n<p>They also complain it is \u201cpractically impossible\u201d for hundreds of staff on each shift to keep two metres apart and still meet their hourly targets of picking 80 items. They also clock on using an unhygienic fingerprint scanner, though Pretty Little Thing (PLT) says a staff member thoroughly wipes the equipment after every use.</p> \n<p>Clive Betts, the local Labour MP, says he has received 32 complaints from PLT warehouse workers, more than for any other company during the government lockdown. He has written to the Health and Safety Executive to ask it and officers from Sheffield council to make an unannounced inspection to the site, near the Meadowhall shopping centre.</p> \n<p>PLT and Boo Hoo \u2013 set up by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/03/a-fairytale-brand-prettylittlething-joins-fashion-a-list-umar-kamani\">Manchester-based Kamani family</a>, who the Sunday Times Rich List estimates as being worth \u00a31.2bn \u2013 have both had 70%-off sales this week, a move described by workers as \u201ctotally irresponsible\u2019\u2019.</p> \n<p>Umar Kamani, PLT\u2019s founder, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-KE57aBSto/\">announced last week</a> that he would be donating a month\u2019s salary to small businesses in need. But warehouse workers in his own supply chain say he should think of them first, claiming they are risking their health and that of their families in order to fulfil a national addiction to fast fashion.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would say to [Umar Kamani], you do acts through altruism all through the world, paying people\u2019s mortgages and what not, but you are sending people to work in Sheffield and putting their lives at risk,\u201d said one worker, who like everyone interviewed asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job. \u201cIt\u2019s just clothes. People can\u2019t go out to pubs and clubs so why are they still ordering it and why are they selling it?\u201d </p> \n<p>Their partner, who works for the NHS, said: \u201cWhy are people buying boob tubes and glittery skirts during a global health crisis?

We are very confident in the extensive social distancing and hygiene measures that we have in place to protect our team. We are keeping these under constant review and will not hesitate to make changes to continually improve safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>But another worker said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we are practically being forced to work when clothing retail is not exactly an essential service and it seems the company care more about profit than staff. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/next-stops-online-shopping-amid-uk-coronavirus-restrictions\">should take example from Next</a> and River Island that have already closed their warehouses.\u201d</p> \n<p>One worker said huge sales had fuelled demand: \u201cWe\u2019ve had 400,000 orders built up over the last week. Normally there are 120,000 at any one time, at most. Even at Christmas and New Year we wouldn\u2019t have anything like that much.\u201d</p> \n<p>Each order contains on average 2.5 items, meaning workers have to rush around the 1.2m sq ft warehouse picking them for each consignment, sometimes clocking up 20 miles during a shift. Workers say the aisles are 4ft (1.2 metres) wide, meaning it is inevitable that they pass each other closely.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe bosses tell us to keep two metres apart but they aren\u2019t actually instructing anybody in how they are supposed to do that,\u201d said one worker. \u201cThen they have a go at people because they aren\u2019t meeting their KPIs [key performance indicators]. Each picker is expected to pick 80 items an hour, but obviously if someone else is in the aisle they need and they wait until they come out, the KPIs go down.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a joint statement, PLT and Clipper Logistics, which runs the warehouse on behalf of the fashion firm, denied that any staff had been disciplined for failing to meet their targets and said they had rearranged the warehouse to make social distancing possible. \u201cThe extra measures we have put in place to keep our teams safe do have an impact on the speed that our teams can work and we recognise that this will be the case until things return to normal,\u201d they said. They claimed a maximum of 275 people worked in the warehouse on any one shift, though the Guardian\u2019s sources said that in busy periods that could increase to 400.</p> \n<p>In addition, the lowest paid workers were told this week that instead of a planned pay rise of 35p an hour, which would have increased their hourly pay to \u00a39, they would get just 15p extra. \u201cMorale was already at rock bottom,\u201d said one worker. Staff said it was \u201ca joke\u201d that they were being considered key workers.</p> \n<p>Clipper Logistics has other warehouses for food companies and was this week contracted to build a new supply chain for NHS personal protective equipment (PPE) products. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to furlough us. They could move us to another warehouse where we would actually be doing essential work,\u201d said one staff member.</p> \n<p>Boo Hoo, set up by Umar\u2019s father, Mahmud, has a distribution centre in Burnley, Lancashire, which is also busier than ever, according to workers.</p> \n<p>A warehouse operative said despite managers repeating distancing guidelines during morning briefings, the number of orders coming in meant workers could not adhere to them.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand the amount of stock we\u2019re dealing with. We\u2019re getting thousands of cartons coming in every day,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>This was denied by Boo Hoo, who said: \u201cThe Burnley site is around 2m sq ft and actually, with a maximum of around 450 working at any one time over two sites and significant automation on site, [it makes it] very easy to practise social distancing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boo Hoo and PLT defended their current 70%-off sales, saying: \u201cDiscounting and promotional offers are a normal part of our marketing strategy and we react and respond to the needs of our customers. We will continue to operate in accordance with government guidelines, whilst we can keep our colleagues safe and we are permitted to do so, in doing so we are able to protect jobs and contribute to the economy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When the lockdown is lifted, will the virus return? Of course it will. Matt Hancock has said we will do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-matt-hancock-sets-goal-of-100000-tests-per-day-by-end-of-april-video\">100,000 tests each day</a> by the end of April, but Britain still doesn\u2019t have a way to control the virus that goes beyond lockdown. Without a proper programme of community surveillance and contact tracing, we won\u2019t stop the spread of coronavirus. As patients pour into hospitals again, a series of national lockdowns will follow. It\u2019s a pattern that could go on for years \u2013 until we have a vaccine.</p> <p>The problem with Hancock\u2019s plan is that testing alone won\u2019t break the chain of community transmission. To stop the spread of a virus, tests must be linked to community surveillance and contact tracing. This ensures that people who have the virus, and people they have come into contact with, can be identified quickly and quarantined at home to prevent the virus spreading. The government\u2019s tests will measure how many people have had the virus, and will show whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/hancock-orders-all-spare-coronavirus-tests-used-nhs-staff\">health workers are immune</a> \u2013 but without community surveillance, tests alone won\u2019t prevent its spread.</p> <p>On 12 March, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced that the UK had moved from containing the virus to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">delaying its spread</a>. Their plan was to flatten the curve of the epidemic that would sweep through our population. They reassured us that herd immunity would kick in once 60% of the population had been infected. Social distancing and washing our hands would ease the pressure on health services, they said. Crucially, community testing and contract tracing would stop immediately. At that point, we were still four weeks behind Italy. The media felt safe, reassured by two eminent physicians.</p> <p>The trouble is, those scientists were wrong. The maths wasn\u2019t difficult: working off their figures, about 40 million people in the UK would be infected by coronavirus, and between 200,000 and 400,000 would eventually die. When the government\u2019s mathematicians modelled figures from Italy and showed that 30% of people admitted to hospital ended up in intensive care, they warned the government that the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-hospitalisation-rates-revealed-80-per-cent-infected/\">NHS would be overwhelmed</a>. The government backtracked within three days, and shifted to suppressing rather than mitigating the virus.</p> <p>In reality, little changed. The government\u2019s beliefs were founded on the assumption that coronavirus behaves like flu. It doesn\u2019t. Its mortality rate is higher, there is little evidence that it is seasonal, and it poses a far greater threat to the NHS. Without a programme of community surveillance and contact tracing, the virus will continue to spread. Britain will be subject to routine flare-ups and repeated lockdowns.</p> <p>I spoke to a senior international epidemic expert, who wished to remain anonymous. They described the UK\u2019s response as too weak. \u201cFinding these viruses is like guerrilla warfare. If you don\u2019t know where the virus is hiding you cannot control it. We must use a bundle of measures to chase it. We must organise teams of friendly community workers to find people with symptoms, test for the virus, isolate and treat them, and trace their contacts. Workers must check on them in their homes every one or two days,\u201d they said.</p> <p>I asked them whether social distancing alone could beat the virus. \u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d they told me. \u201cYou can stop contact tracing in the hotspots, but when you lift the lockdown, everywhere at the same time, you\u2019ll face a problem: the virus will come back. New hotspots will form.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a community programme for case detection and contact tracing, you won\u2019t find the virus until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>In China, Xi Jinping initially prevaricated, suppressing the findings of a fact-finding mission on 4 January that investigated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/coronavirus-asymptomatic-wuhan-woman-shows-why-outbreak-will-be-hard-to-stop\">outbreak in Wuhan</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/26/china-bans-long-distance-buses-from-entering-three-cities-to-contain-coronavirus-spread\">by 26 January</a>, China had placed more than 50 million people under quarantine; 40 provinces reported a total of 2,744 cases and 80 deaths. The Chinese communist party mobilised thousands of community workers to scale up a national testing effort, while mapping infections using case definitions based on symptoms.</p> <p>Almost 40,000 health workers were flown in from across China<strong> </strong>to help with this huge community surveillance effort. The government enforced regional lockdowns, closed down shops, bars, universities and schools, and policed the supermarkets and pharmacies. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">developed apps</a> to monitor peoples\u2019 symptoms and their compliance with quarantine, and set up 24-hour TV channels in every province to update people on data, progress and prevention. With this comprehensive response, China managed to suppress the transmission of the virus in less than two months.</p> <p>By contrast, the UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/the-uk-governments-woeful-response-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">slow to act</a>, and timid when it did. The government mistakenly based its coronavirus response on social distancing alone. The UK\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group of Experts (Sage) didn\u2019t even ask their mathematical advisers to model a community testing programme. Neil Ferguson reportedly said community testing and contact tracing wasn\u2019t included as a possible strategy in the original modelling because <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238578-uk-has-enough-intensive-care-units-for-coronavirus-expert-predicts/#ixzz6IS5s4KYQ\">not enough tests were available</a>. But we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">eight weeks\u2019 notice</a>.</p> <p>We still don\u2019t have a coordinated mobilisation of general practices and public health outbreak management teams. None are linked with digital apps or laboratory testing. In one of the best research cultures in the world, we failed to create the community surveillance and testing effort needed to stop the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The government and its advisers are now committed to their strategy of delaying the spread of coronavirus, which they hope will eventually lead to herd immunity. Our present predicament is a symptom of past decisions: the decision not to roll out testing sooner put the government on the back foot, scrambling to catch up with the virus.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t too late. To prevent the spread of coronavirus, we need a change of direction. Local authorities must take control of their public-health outbreak management teams. We need a centralised app and database to allow citizens to report their symptoms, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/nhs-developing-app-to-trace-close-contacts-of-coronavirus-carriers\">NHSX app</a> that researchers have been working on since January.</p> <p>GP networks, working with teams of trained volunteers and retired health workers equipped with personal protective equipment, could visit everyone reporting suspicious symptoms at home every one to two days. If there is testing, all the better. But symptom-based reporting will do. With a proper community protection scheme in place, local authorities could shield their population from the threat of the virus, which has taken hold in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/london-hospitals-facing-tsunami-of-coronavirus-patients-overwhelmed\">hotspots like London</a> and the cities of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/west-midlands-emerges-as-a-hotspot-for-coronavirus-deaths\">Midlands</a> and north west.</p> <p>The lockdown will flatten the curve, but we have a month or more before it lifts.

  "<p>Eleven countries locked in long-term conflicts have responded to a UN call for a worldwide ceasefire, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said as he promised to pursue the drive in the weeks ahead.</p> \n<p>The United Nations is deeply concerned that in countries with already fragile health systems, the backdrop of war will make it near impossible to contain a coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>Speaking in New York, Guterres said his call, made on 23 March, had been endorsed by \u201can ever-growing number of member states, some 70 so far, regional partners, non-state actors, civil society networks and organisations, and all UN \u2019messengers of peace\u2019\u201d. </p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/global_ceasefire_loc/\">online petition organised by Avaz</a> gained more than 1m signatures. Guterres said \u201cto silence the guns, we must raise the voices for peace\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UN insists its call is not just a desperate effort to show its relevance at a time when the security council is so divided.</p> \n<p>Guterres admitted that despite nominal support in some countries for his global ceasefire, \u201cthere was still a distance between declarations and deeds in many countries\u201d. He said he had asked his special envoys across the globe to redouble their efforts to persuade combatants to lower their guns to allow humanitarian workers to combat the coronavirus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe Covid-19 storm is now coming to all these theatres of conflict,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe virus has shown how swiftly it can move across borders, devastate countries and upend lives. The worst is yet to come.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are enormous difficulties to implementation as conflicts have festered for years, distrust is deep, with many spoilers and many suspicions. We know that any initial gains are fragile and easily reversible.\u201d</p> \n<p>He claimed in countries as far apart as Yemen, Libya, Cameroon, Colombia, Syria and Ukraine, actors had agreed to heed the ceasefire call. In Syria, for instance, the numbers of deaths in March \u2013 103 by one estimate \u2013 was the lowest for the whole of the nine-year civil war, and the UN envoy expressed hope that a ceasefire negotiated by Turkey and Russia was holding.</p> \n<p>In Yemen, the UN special envoy, Martin Griffiths, is trying to bring the sides together despite a rise in violence to discuss how they could work together if coronavirus hit the country. Saudi Arabia has said more openly than before that it is holding direct talks with the Houthis on a possible political settlement.</p> \n<p>In Libya, where the fighting has escalated since the ceasefire call, and the first death blamed on the coronavirus has occurred, Guterres urged both sides to join forces to address the Covid-19 threat, ensure unhindered access to humanitarian aid and realise the ceasefire they have long been discussing under the auspices of the United Nations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c288333639a2f8ae1f1e7003e62741cda2f864f2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c288333639a2f8ae1f1e7003e62741cda2f864f2/8_623_4035_2421/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Fighters of UN-backed Government of National Accord during clashes with Libyan National Army in Tripoli, Libya, this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fighters of the UN-backed Government of National Accord during clashes with Libyan National Army in Tripoli, Libya, this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The EU has launched an air and sea effort this week to enforce a pre-existing UN arms embargo, but the fighting between the forces of the UN-recognised government in Tripoli and those dominant in the east has got worse.</p> \n<p>Guterres pointed to the example of Afghanistan, saying that although fighting had intensified, \u201con 26 March it was announced that a 21-member team, which includes five women, was formed for direct negotiations with the Taliban. The government and the Taliban have also established technical contacts for an initial prisoner release programme.\u201d</p> \n<p>Leaders in Ukraine, the Philippines and Sudan have also backed the UN call.</p> \n<p>At the UN itself, a Russian resolution to back a global ceasefire and an end to trade wars and sanctions was rejected by a western alliance in favour of a more general resolution calling for ceasefires.</p> \n<p>The Russian declaration was co-sponsored by 28 UN member states, Russia\u2019s UN mission said. The general assembly instead passed a different resolution calling for \u201cinternational cooperation\u201d and \u201cmultilateralism\u201d to combat the coronavirus.</p>",

These are PCR (polymerase chain reaction) swab tests, sometimes erroneously called antigen tests, which need to be processed with specialised kits in a lab.</p> \n<p>Testing for Covid-19 has increased and exceeded a previous target of 10,000 per day, though later than the government initially promised.</p> \n<p>Hancock\u2019s bigger goal of carrying out 100,000 tests in England by the end of the month includes antibody tests \u2013 the fingerprick blood test that could be done at home.

And everybody can see there are challenges around the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Allan Wilson, the IBMS president, said he did not understand the strategy. \u201cMixing antibody and antigen tests doesn\u2019t add up to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an antibody test that is any use at this stage so how can you include that in the 100,000 and not say what the mix within that 100,000 is of antibody and antigen tests? It\u2019s just a bit of a muddle still.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wilson, the lead biomedical scientist in cellular pathology at his NHS trust, says they could deliver 100,000 tests for the virus every day \u2013 but only if they got the supplies that are currently either available only in tiny quantities or non-existent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

However, he said his team were experiencing difficulties in obtaining test kits and even getting space on planes to have them delivered.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have some tests. We haven\u2019t got enough yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope to secure our supply chain. We just need to get that in the institute building and then we will be happier.

So we\u2019re having to solve all these problems. It\u2019s like marshalling a small army. It\u2019s been very tough.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe other big problem is that we are competing, not just nationally but internationally for access to these reagents \u2013 and competing is a horrible term because we are all trying to help the same people. We\u2019ve got to be very conscious of that in the UK, that we\u2019re not depriving other hubs and other laboratories. But we hope to be able to share what we can.\u201d</p> \n<p>A handful of big companies, mostly based in the US, supply test kits for the virus with emergency approval from regulators in the US or EU. They include the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, which has been in discussions with Public Health England (PHE).</p> \n<p>Roche, credited with enabling up to 500,000 tests a week in Germany, has already opened three labs for PCR swab testing in Manchester, London and Gateshead, it emerged on Friday.

Ain\u2019t No Sunshine is regarded as one of the all-time great breakup tracks, while Lean on Me, an ode to the supportive power of friendship, was performed at the inaugurations of presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Heavily influenced by the church hymns and gospel music of his childhood, it was his first and only No 1 single on the US Billboard pop charts, in 1972.</p> \n<p>It has also become an anthem during the coronavirus outbreak, sung by schoolchildren and in impromptu balcony renditions to show support for one another. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1246088896938676225\">wrote on Twitter</a>: \u201cThere is no more appropriate time to reflect on his words than now as we lean on each other.\u201d</p> \n<p>Just the Two of Us, another song of solidarity, was successfully covered by Will Smith and sampled by Eminem (as well as being spoofed by Bill Cosby and Mike Myers).</p> \n<p>The joyous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeaS6fuUoA\">Lovely Day</a>, with its signature 18-second-long held note, was his only UK Top 10 hit, reaching No 7 in 1977 and No 4 in 1988. Withers also won three Grammy awards from nine nominations and entered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/apr/20/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-joan-jett-ringo-starr-bill-withers-in-pictures\">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015</a>.</p> \n<p>Born William Harrison Withers Jr in 1938, he faced a difficult childhood in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_Fork,_West_Virginia\">Slab Fork, West Virginia</a>. A stutter held him back from making friends, and, after his father died when Bill was 13, his grandmother helped to raise him. Withers would write a tribute to her with the song Grandma\u2019s Hands from his 1971 debut album Just As I Am: \u201cGrandma\u2019s hands / Used to issue out a warning / She\u2019d say, \u2018Billy don\u2019t you run so fast / Might fall on a piece of glass / Might be snakes there in that grass.\u2019\u201d The intro was memorably sampled by Blackstreet for their 1996 R&amp;B classic, No Diggity.</p> \n<p>Withers spent nine years in the US Navy before pursuing a career in music. After moving to Los Angeles in 1967, he found a job making toilet seats and recorded demos through the night. Possessed of a smooth and soulful baritone, he signed to Sussex Records and enlisted Booker T Jones to produce Just As I Am. That album spawned the hit Ain\u2019t No Sunshine, which won Withers his first Grammy for best R&amp;B song.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a94adf180867bd23c7ddbe51f85f781f716287a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a94adf180867bd23c7ddbe51f85f781f716287a/0_0_3307_4132/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Withers in 1971.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fulfilled musician and human being ...

Withers continued having hit records with Columbia, including the laid-back and optimistic Lovely Day. After three albums in three years, Withers claimed Columbia\u2019s head of A&amp;R, Mickey Eichner, prevented him from going into the studio, leaving a gap of seven years between \u2019Bout Love (1978) and Watching You Watching Me (1985).</p> \n<p>After the latter failed to chart, Withers went into early retirement. The 2009 documentary, Still Bill, explored his reasons for quitting the music industry and painted the picture of a fulfilled musician and human being. Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, film critic Roger Ebert said: \u201c[Withers] still lives and survives as a happy man. Still Bill is about a man who topped the charts, walked away from it all in 1985 and is pleased that he did.\u201d</p>",

The reasoning may not be entirely altruistic (maintaining a national network of functioning kitchens that could be requisitioned if the crisis deepens seems like sensible emergency planning), but, nonetheless, it has led to a swathe of, particularly smaller, independent restaurants launching no-contact collection and delivery services for the first time.</p> <p>Indeed, something unexpected appears to be happening, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c296d9e-e654-486a-9e40-f8f39ea191e0\">according to the Financial Times</a>.

The Covid-19 advice on cash is as for anything you could touch in public: wash your hands and keep them away from your face. Nonetheless, that slight risk of transmission does make tipping delivery riders problematic at a time when tips are potentially financially crucial for delivery staff and their families.</p> <p>One plus for Uber Eats is that it allows you to tip electronically <a href=\"https://help.uber.com/ubereats/article/how-to-add-a-tip?nodeId=5867f9dd-7ca5-4484-af59-6c222d9a8355\">after delivery</a>. But if your faith in human nature is robust, where it exists as an option, pre-tip as you order. Otherwise, let your deliverer know you have left money on the doorstep. You could even reassure them you have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/04/new-five-pound-note-plastic-fiver\">washed your coins or a polymer notes </a>with soapy water first.</p> <h2><strong>Ordering</strong></h2> <p>In the realm of takeaway, there are two resolute buzzkills. The first is the \u201cfakeaway\u201d enthusiast who says: \u201cHey, guys, we could cook a healthier version right here.\u201d (As if that were the aim.) These people are oblivious to just how crucial a tandoor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/05/how-do-you-make-chinese-takeaway-style-fried-rice\">proper wok burner</a> or wood-fired oven is to Indian, Chinese or Italian food. You cannot replicate that action in a domestic oven.</p> <p>The second is that person in your household who, too busy for the frivolous business of eating, yells down the stairs: \u201cWhatever, just order for me,\u201d and then proceeds to moan about<em> everything</em>. The ordering of takeaway, at a macro- (Italian, Mexican, Vietnamese, Thai?) and micro-level (peshwari or keema naan?) is a debate that in serious households can rival the Yalta conference in terms of length, horse-trading and bitter resentment. If you are not willing to engage, you cannot sulk because there are no salt\u2019n\u2019pepper ribs.</p> <h2><strong>Starters</strong></h2> <p>The only people who want starters with a takeaway are people who have never eaten takeaway. Why do want to leave your main to go cold? Yes, you could turn the oven on to keep it warm. Yes, you could resort to the microwave. But let\u2019s not turn this into a logistical palaver. The point of takeaway is it should be less hassle than cooking.</p> <p>Sides are fine and, HTE sees no reason for pedantry, these may involve repurposed starters that can perch on the side of your plate as a complement to your main: seekh kebabs, tandoor-licked lamb chops, spring rolls etc. The important point is everything must be served contemporaneously and immediately, while it is still warm.</p> <h2><strong>Groundwork</strong></h2> <p>Fail to prepare, prepare to fail \u2026 is not a phrase HTE finds itself using. But takeaway is a meal that requires you to channel David Brent. As described above, in order to eat warm food in its peak condition, the moments just after a takeaway enters your home are crucial. Plates must be warmed, drinks poured, cutlery and kitchen roll distributed and Netflix primed, so that, in a matter of seconds, the food can slot seamlessly into its new habit. If, as a family or cohabitants, you are not whirring with the balletic grace and energy of Manchester City\u2019s midfield in the minutes before your takeaway arrives, then you are doing something wrong.</p> <p>This is another reason against any form of supplementary cooking taking place to augment the takeaway \u2013 what the comedian Kevin Bridges memorably dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/kevin-bridges-renames-his-company-hoose-rice-after-his-favourite-joke/\">hoose rice</a>\u201d. Beyond buttering your own bread for fish and chips (an act so personal you will always execute it in a superior way to the chip shop), your work should be no more complex than opening bags and boxes with the minimum of delay.</p> <p>Note: if charged with transferring poppadoms or prawn crackers to another room for sharing, it is morally repugnant to then sit down and eat half of them before everyone else is settled. HTE blames Thatcher.</p> <h2><strong>Serving</strong></h2> <p>Historically, to plate or not to plate has been seen as a telling sociopolitical faultline. To plate a takeaway is seen as ridiculously posh, but HTE has always preferred to view this issue pragmatically \u2013 that is, <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2020/3/16/21182509/is-it-safe-to-order-delivery-takeout-during-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19\">until Covid-19 came along</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccbef217c0e107798a0083e1a9f0b6bc91719176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccbef217c0e107798a0083e1a9f0b6bc91719176/0_138_4288_2572/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Who eats pizza off a plate?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who eats pizza off a plate?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl Tapales/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before March 2020, certain takeaway foods were always better eaten as is. Fish and chips die a death decanted on to porcelain, pizza invariably tastes better from the box and only a barbarian would disrobe a burrito and plonk it on to a plate. This is partly a matter of psychology, but mainly a practical issue. If you unwrap them, all the above go cold too quickly. Conversely, despite the advances in cardboard boxes and other cartons, most Asian food is at its best transferred to plates and bowls. Eating a curry and rice from the plastic boxes it arrives is unnecessarily hard work. You would have to have a militant dislike of doing the dishes to persevere with it.</p> <p>But coronavirus has rendered this argument null and void with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6lFj2XIotI\">wise scientific counsel</a> urging us to, while the risk is small,<a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a31930301/is-food-delivery-takeout-safe-coronavirus/\"> remove all the packaging</a> from any takeaway food that comes into the house and \u2013 you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 wash our hands after plating it.</p> <p>One upside of this is that, for the foreseeable, it makes the takeaway buffet less likely. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just order a load of stuff and everyone can help themselves?\u201d is, perhaps, the most frightening sentence in food; one that always results in everyone sitting around too little food, tolerating meagre helpings of the dishes they really wanted and grudgingly nibbling at others they do not like. Moreover, with all those trays and cartons on the table, this serving method means you spend as much time playing pass-the-parcel as eating. It is fundamentally annoying.</p> <p>It may work with pizza (the exception that proves the rule), but the notion that the bulk of a takeaway should be shared by all is flawed. It is dictatorial. You do not want your plate to end up looking like a jumble sale, an unholy tangle of jarring dishes. Instead, taking an Indian meal as the easiest example, everyone should be allowed to choose their main and then dip in and out of the supplementaries as they see fit (rice, dal, breads, aforementioned sides-not-starters).</p> <h2><strong>When</strong></h2> <p>Who is to say? Traditionally, Friday or Saturday night at the end of the working week, maybe a hungover Sunday. But that was back when time had meaning and you knew which day it was.</p> <p>So, takeaway, how do you eat yours?</p>",

  "<p>Unemployment in Britain and the US could surpass the levels reached during the 1930s Great Depression within months as the coronavirus crisis crushes the global economy, a former Bank of England official has warned.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">In a stark forecast as job losses mount around the world</a>, David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US and a member of the Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crisis, said unemployment was rising at the fastest rate in living memory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">Forget 'recession': this is a depression | David Blanchflower and David Bell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Writing in the Guardian, the economist said UK unemployment could rapidly rise to more than 6 million people, around 21% of the entire workforce, based on analysis of US job market figures that suggest unemployment across the Atlantic could reach 52.8 million, around 32% of the workforce.</p> <p>\u201cThere has never been such a concentrated business collapse. The government has tried to respond but it has no idea of the scale of the problem it is going to have to deal with. We make some back-of-the-envelope calculations and they are scary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Making the assessment alongside David Bell, an economist at the University of Stirling, the former Threadneedle Street policymaker said the collapse in activity amid Covid-19 and the accompanying rise in unemployment looked to be at least 10 times faster than in the recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The economists said that while government support in Britain for companies to furlough workers could help to cushion the blow, unemployment would still soar. While joblessness would rapidly rise, they cautioned it was uncertain how long the impact would last and how quickly unemployment would come down. During the Great Depression, records show unemployment hit 24.9% in the US and 15.4% in the UK over several years.</p> <p>The warning shot for the two economies comes as business activity in Britain and the eurozone plunges to the lowest levels since the start of closely watched surveys more than two decades ago and as unemployment in the US begins to rise.</p> <p>According to the latest snapshots from the purchasing managers indices (PMI), which are based on surveys of business activity, the private sector economy in the UK and the eurozone collapsed in March at the fastest pace since records began in the late 1990s.</p> <p>The US economy also shed 701,000 jobs, according to March data, far more than the 100,000 fall expected on average by economists. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, up from 3.5% in February. Initial unemployment insurance figures, which come in advance of official figures, have suggested joblessness is already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/us-jobs-report-march-unemployment-coronavirus\">on track to reach more than 10 million</a>.</p> <p>Stock markets sold off on Friday as the prospect of lasting economic damage becomes increasingly clear.

Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cWhile our stores remain closed in line with government guidance, and the majority of our store-facing colleagues have been furloughed, our website continues to trade and we are accepting customer orders, gift cards and returns.\u201d</p> <p>It is understood that the potential insolvency measure would be intended to protect the business so it could continue to trade.</p> <p>Debenhams was taken over last year by a group of its financial backers, including the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree, after falling into administration. It then used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable sites and cut rents.</p> <p>The group has closed 22 stores, 19 of which shut in January, resulting in more than 700 job losses. A further 28 of its remaining 141 stores had been lined up for permanent closure next year.</p> <p>Since the coronavirus lockdown Debenhams, which has more than \u00a3600m of debt, has written to landlords asking for a five-month rent holiday and reportedly asked suppliers for a 31-day delay to some payments as it seeks to conserve cash.</p> <p>One insider told Sky News, which first reported the retailer\u2019s plan, that there was a realistic prospect that Debenhams\u2019 clothing suppliers would take legal action against the company for deferring invoice payments during the lockdown.</p> <p>Any collapse into administration could pave the way for Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, to revive its interest in Debenhams.</p> <p>The department store\u2019s CVA plan was subject to a legal challenge amid pressure from Ashley, whose retail group\u2019s investment of \u00a3150m was wiped out when Debenhams went into administration. He was keen to combine the department store firm with his House of Fraser chain.</p> <p>Debenhams is one of many retailers in financial difficulties because of the coronavirus shutdown. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, said it was likely to be the first of many fashion chains in trouble because of an oversupply in the market, as well as the knock to sales from Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThere will definitely be more [in difficulty] and quite a lot more,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cBut the shakeout may be delayed and you can\u2019t really liquidate assets in this environment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even before the pandemic, British department stores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/08/does-john-lewis-warning-mean-department-stores-doomed\">had been in difficulty</a>, with shoppers shifting to buying online or spending on experiences such as holidays, digital services and takeaways, and firms struggling with rising costs, including business rates and staff pay.</p> <p>The department chain Beales closed its 23 stores after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/20/beales-administration-full-list-stores-jobs\">falling into administration</a> in January, while House of Fraser had shut at least seven of its 59 branches before the government shutdown was announced.</p> <p>John Lewis has also said it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/john-lewis-staff-bonus-hits-lowest-level-for-67-years-waitrose\">considering permanently closing outlets</a> after profits at its department stores plunged by 65% to \u00a340m.</p>",

  "<p>The clearing of ancient woods for HS2 is to proceed this month after the high court refused an emergency injunction and judicial review of the government\u2019s decision to proceed with the high-speed railway.</p> <p>HS2\u2019s felling of woodlands in spring when birds are nesting has been widely condemned by wildlife charities but the conservationist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/03/hs2-legal-challenge-launched-by-chris-packham\">Chris Packham\u2019s attempt</a> to halt \u201cenabling\u201d works was rejected after the court decided there was \u201cno real prospect of success\u201d for a judicial review.</p> <p>Two high court judges made the ruling after a one-day hearing held over video link, as bailiffs sought to evict <a href=\"https://hs2rebellion.org/\">protesters occupying treehouses</a> in Crackley Wood, Warwickshire.</p> <p>The hearing heard that it would cost \u00a320m\u2013\u00a325m to \u201cpress the pause button\u201d on HS2 while a full judicial review of the government\u2019s backing for the \u00a3106bn high-speed project could be considered.</p> <p>Timothy Mould QC, for the secretary of state for transport, said that cost would \u201ccome from the public purse. The court will not be seduced into treating that as an insignificant consideration.\u201d</p> <p>He argued that Packham and others had already had plenty of opportunity to make arguments about HS2\u2019s environmental impact while the railway was scrutinised by both chambers of parliament, which passed the act enabling HS2 in 2017.</p> <p>Packham, who crowdfunded \u00a3100,000 for the challenge, said: \u201cI\u2019m immensely disappointed on behalf of all the wildlife that will now be destroyed in the next few weeks and the irreversible damage to the woodlands. These trees are going to come crashing to the ground and all the birds nesting in them and bats roosting in them are going to die and nobody is going to know anything about it.</p> <p>\u201cOur nation will be robbed of some of our greatest national natural treasures over the next few days for an entirely fallacious vanity project.\u201d</p> <p>During the hearing, David Wolf QC, for Packham, argued that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was not given all the information required to make an informed decision on HS2 by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oakervee-review-of-hs2\">Oakervee </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oakervee-review-of-hs2\">review</a>, which was led by the former HS2 chair Doug Oakervee.</p> <p>He told the courts the works would cause \u201cirretrievable and irreversible\u201d harm to ancient woodlands. HS2 Ltd contractors are clearing trees and soil from five ancient woodlands in Warwickshire during April, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/01/betrayal-of-trust-hs2-criticised-over-removal-woodland-soils\">the Woodland Trust condemning the timing</a> and the RSPB warning that bird nests would almost certainly be destroyed.</p> <p>HS2 has said temporary exclusion zones are being put around all nests discovered by its ecologists until the chicks are fledged, and contractors were \u201ckeenly aware of the law around nesting birds\u201d.</p> <p>Wolf told the court that Oakervee\u2019s review failed to properly consider HS2\u2019s environmental impact or the railway being a net contributor to carbon emissions during construction. Wolf said the emissions produced by all the concrete required during construction would cause emissions of 8-14m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which would contravene Britain\u2019s legal obligations to reduce its emissions under the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p>He argued that hearing the review would not unduly delay HS2 because if it was to abide by the law its contractors would not be able to continue with the clearance of ancient woodland. \u201cThis woodland will now already be full of nesting birds and it is a criminal offence to interfere with those nesting birds. Their ability to proceed in this [nesting season] period is already heavily compromised,\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>Dr Darren Moorcroft, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, which provided an expert witness statement criticising HS2\u2019s \u201ctranslocation\u201d of ancient woodland soils during April, said: \u201cTo say we are disappointed by this outcome is an understatement. This decision is catastrophic for these irreplaceable ancient woodlands and the hundreds of species that call them home. Instead if bursting into life they will now be destroyed. </p> <p>\u201cThe flawed and invariably unsuccessful process of translocation will be carried out at completely the wrong time of year, flying in the face of professional standards and HS2\u2019s original assurance that they\u2019d do it when they should \u2013 when everything is dormant. Nature and the environment are the big losers today.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cWe are pleased with today\u2019s verdict. While our current priority is combating the spread of coronavirus, we must continue our work to level up the country. HS2 will be crucial to that ambition, boosting capacity and connectivity across our rail network.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tasked HS2 Ltd with delivering one of the UK\u2019s most environmentally responsible infrastructure projects.\u201d</p> <p>Packham and his lawyers, Leigh Day, will be able to consider the grounds for an appeal when the judges publish their written reasons for the verdict on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>Things were looking up for Blake Volkan. The 33-year-old Turkish Russian immigrant had been delivering food on a bicycle in New York for five years, earning as little as $3.90 a trip on platforms like Caviar and Grubhub. Last year, he got married, quit delivery, and earned a handyman\u2019s certification before landing a subcontracting job doing repairs for a hotel. The pay was much better, and he noticed the difference in how people would treat him. \u201cDoing delivery, people treat me like a dog. But as a handyman? \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 smiling, \u2018How are you,\u2019 and everything.\u201d</p> <p>Then the coronavirus hit, and the hotel told Volkan not to<strong> </strong>come in any more. His wife was furloughed from her job. Volkan realized he needed to get back on the bike and fire up the old apps. \u201cI like my job, but at the moment I have to survive,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Like Volkan, I am among tens of thousands of couriers in New York City, suddenly thrust to the frontlines of a deadly global pandemic. It was already a dangerous job \u2013 our injury rates run up to <a href=\"https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3854&amp;context=gc_etds\">44 times </a><a href=\"https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3854&amp;context=gc_etds\">those of the average American job</a>; <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/2019-was-extremely-deadly-year-nyc-cyclists-here-are-their-stories\">seven of us were killed in New York in 2019</a> alone \u2013 and it has become far more dangerous now. We are called \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1243594515677622274\">heroes</a>\u201d and finally being acknowledged as \u201c<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/de-blasio-pauses-crackdown-e-bikes-covid-19\">essential</a>\u201d, but the truth is this job was never the first choice for many of us.</p> <p>For me, this job is a supplement to freelance writing; I decided to stop doing deliveries when the first few coronavirus cases were confirmed in New York. But others don\u2019t have that option. While writing this piece I spoke to workers aged 18 to 58, many of whom are pressing on in spite of unsafe conditions. There are many first-time delivery workers, laid off from other jobs, learning how to use the apps. No one is making a ton of money, and everyone is nervous.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve been doing this work for a day or a half decade: platforms like Grubhub, Uber Eats, Postmates and DoorDash (which recently purchased Caviar from Square) consider us \u201cindependent contractors\u201d and we are therefore not entitled to health insurance, worker\u2019s compensation, much less basic support from a human being. When the outbreak began, the apps simply sent out emails that sounded copy-and-pasted from the CDC (\u201cStay home and wash your hands!\u201d).</p> <p>Now, apparently worried about losing market share, the apps have temporarily waived <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-lockdowns-prompt-smaller-restaurants-to-rethink-delivery-11585743246\">commission fees</a> for restaurants and cut customers\u2019 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/uber-eats-waives-delivery-fees-for-independent-restaurants-during-covid-19-pandemic/\">delivery fees</a> to zero. Yet they have offered no bonuses or hazard pay for workers \u2013 the assumption is that we are disposable. The farthest they have gone is to promise up to<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/03/17/coronavirus-doordash-postmates-couriers-keep-regular-rates/5060297002/\">two weeks\u2019 pay</a> if a worker presents proof of a Covid-19 diagnosis, something that is difficult to obtain even with obvious symptoms. Workers who have tried requesting payments say the process is <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/features/gig-workers-with-covid-19-symptoms-say-its-hard-to-get-sick-leave-from-uber-lyft-instacart/\">a nightmare</a>.</p> <p>In practice, our best hope is to be careful and pray. Volkan considers himself well prepared, thanks to an ample supply of face masks and gloves from his handyman work. But he is getting scared as he notices more and more couriers coughing and looking sick. Many don\u2019t have masks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/instacart-workers-risk-their-health-to-do-their-job\">Why is Instacart making its contract workers risk their health to do their job? | Sarah Polito</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even with protective gear, delivering food to a locked-down city has become total chaos. Demand is surging from the millions of New Yorkers suddenly forced to stay home, yet restaurants are severely short-staffed. Recently, Volkan was assigned to pick up food from a trendy West Village eatery that had begun offering delivery during the lockdown. Upon arrival he saw <a href=\"https://ny.eater.com/2020/3/23/21190803/carbone-crowds-nyc-delivery-takeout-coronavirus\">dozens of couriers crowded together</a> on the sidewalk, and inside, what appeared to be a single cook, struggling to handle hundreds of orders. Volkan waited an hour for the order before police came and ordered everyone to disperse. The restaurant canceled all the orders and Volkan was not paid. He just moved on.</p> <p>The apps have hyped up a new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a31469056/coronavirus-food-delivery-non-contact-policies/\">no-contact</a>\u201d delivery option, which allows couriers to leave food in a building\u2019s lobby to encourage physical distancing. But not all customers abide by it, or appreciate it. After completing one no-contact delivery recently, Volkan said he received a call from the customer, cursing at him. \u201cHe screamed, \u2018You son of a bitch, do your job properly!\u2019 It was my first time getting that in five years.\u201d</p> <p>Usually, high demand means more orders, which for couriers means more earnings. But since the outbreak, Volkan has accepted multiple orders only to discover upon arriving that the requested restaurant was shuttered. With no way to cancel in-progress deliveries using his Caviar app, he has had to message a support agent to request the cancellation \u2013 a process which usually takes minutes, but during the pandemic has taken as long as four hours, preventing new orders from being sent in the meantime. Once, out of desperation, he rode his bike empty-handed to the customer\u2019s address and marked the order \u201cdelivered\u201d just so he could continue working. \u201cI called the customer; I\u2019m like, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re not going to get your order. Please contact Caviar.\u201d</p> <p>Most worryingly, hygiene has proven surprisingly difficult. Despite the pandemic, restaurants have been refusing to allow couriers to wash their hands in the sink. To make do, Volkan traded some of his face masks with another delivery worker for some hand sanitizer the other worker had ordered through DoorDash. DoorDash charged the worker $5 for shipping (<a href=\"https://payup.wtf/blog/doordash-hand-sanitizer\">other workers have been charged $10-$40</a>). \u201cThe bottles were so small,\u201d Volkan said. \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap\u2026 but they want the five dollars. They got to make a profit off of everyone.\u201d I contacted Grubhub, Postmates, Square, and Doordash for comment but did not receive a response before publication. A spokesperson for Uber Eats acknowledged the virus was \u201cespecially concerning for people who drive and deliver with Uber. In these difficult times, their well-being is at the top of our minds, and we have a dedicated team working around the clock to support them the very best we can.\u201d</p> <p>According to some estimates, on-demand food is set to be a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/\">$385b</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/\">n industry</a> by the end of this decade. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-food-delivery-stocks-roll-145502384.html\">Grubhub\u2019s stock</a> has jumped nearly 33% since the announcement of New York City\u2019s lockdown; DoorDash has recently <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doordash-13b-demand-food-delivery-145852606.html\">filed for an IPO</a>, with a pre-pandemic valuation of $13bn. In a call with shareholders on 19 March \u2013 when two hundred people in the United States had died from the virus \u2013 Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dana Khosrowshahi, said the company\u2019s Eats business was growing and revealed Uber had a $10bn pile of unrestricted cash. \u201cIn any crisis, liquidity is key,\u201d he said. The day after the call, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/uber-stock-pops-after-saying-worst-of-coronavirus-fallout-is-behind-it.html\">Uber\u2019s stock </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/uber-stock-pops-after-saying-worst-of-coronavirus-fallout-is-behind-it.html\">jumped 40%</a>.</p> <p>That financial firepower has not been deployed for us. Instead, we are fed hazy rhetoric. According to Doordash, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoorDash/status/1241120122120450049\">We\u2019re all in this together</a>\u201d (until you want benefits; then you\u2019re an independent contractor). In a self-congratulatory blogpost last week, Uber announced \u201c<a href=\"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/increasing-earning-opportunities-with-uber-eats/\">increasing earning opportunities for Uber Eats</a>\u201d \u2013 rather than a pay increase, this turned out to simply be a new feature allowing Uber rideshare drivers to <em>also</em> deliver food. This isn\u2019t helpful. As the pandemic continues to worsen, it is a matter of certainty that delivery workers will get sick \u2013 and it\u2019s more than likely that some of us will die. At what point does it become too much?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/25/uber-lyft-gig-economy-coronavirus\">Uber drivers are being forced to choose between risking Covid-19 or starvation | Veena Dubal and Meredith Whittaker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The companies bet that our individual precarity will motivate us to keep delivering until we land in the hospital; that we are not organized enough to stand up to them.

The apps are fighting these efforts tooth-and-nail to protect their outsized profits. They should think about protecting their workers for a change.</p> <p>Until then, we\u2019ll have to make it on our own. Recently, to try and pad his income, Volkan told me he had started buying a few shares of gig-work companies\u2019 stocks.

The rest of the time, it\u2019s just me and my husband. If I were isolating alone, I know I could deal with it, even enjoy it, having lived on my own for 20 years, on and off. But these are trying times and recently I\u2019ve taken up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/meditation\">meditation</a>, because I was struggling to maintain my positive mental attitude, giving in to fear instead of fighting it.</p> <p>My other strategy is to write positive affirmations: relationships, writing projects, fitness, finances, career ambitions \u2013 you name it, I have stacks of old affirmation cards going back to the 90s. They focus my desires and help me to expect the best, not the worst. If the best doesn\u2019t materialise, I\u2019ll write another affirmation to help me bounce back.</p> <p>An affirmation is quite different to merely hoping a situation improves. A relevant example might go like this: \u201cI feel utterly joyful that the virus has passed and that our lives are back to normal. All is well.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that the virus has not yet passed. Imagining that it will makes me feel motivated and buoyant.</p> <p>I look forward to the day when we all re-emerge from our homes with a renewed appreciation for what we have, and a stronger sense of community.</p> <h2><em>\u2018When I get bored, I want a 70s mix or a Cary Grant movie\u2019</em></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/28/anne-enright-bad-things-happen-to-women-in-books\">Anne Enright</a></h2> <p>Honestly, there is a lot to be said for tooling about all day, looking up recipes and not making them, not bothering to paint the living room and failing to write a novel. In the middle of the messy non-event called your mid-afternoon, you might get something \u2013 a thought to jot down, a good paragraph, a piece of gossip to text a pal. Boredom is a productive state so long as you don\u2019t let it go sour on you. Try not to confuse the urge to get something done with the idea that you are useless. Try not to confuse the urge to contact someone with the thought that you are unloved. Do the thing or don\u2019t do it. Either is fine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6edb70a929071d4e43b04c01d19a3dbf00a91bad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6edb70a929071d4e43b04c01d19a3dbf00a91bad/95_1192_5074_3045/1000..jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 Cary Grant in North by Northwest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For when I\u2019m bored with big thoughts\u2019 \u2026 Cary Grant in North by Northwest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I find big music helps at fateful times. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/sep/23/london-philharmonic-orchestra-rachmaninov-third-symphony\">Rachmaninov</a> is good when the news is bad, Mahler also works.

But I also get bored with big thoughts and that point of boredom is the moment I am looking for \u2013 when I want my teenager\u2019s mellow 70s Spotify mix, or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jul/08/cary-grant-festival-bristol-hollywood-film\">Cary Grant</a> film.</p> <p>In the first days of locking down, I felt as you do after trauma: language was no use to me. It has come back slowly, because it always does. I know this and I trust it. Meanwhile, I do not try to push a broken machine. I wait for boredom to kick in because boredom, for me, is a very good sign. It is the beginning of pleasure.</p> <h2><em>\u2018My 31-DVD Ingmar Bergman box set is cheering me up\u2019</em></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/julianbarnes\">Julian Barnes</a></h2> <p>My first (cultural) reaction to the lockdown wasn\u2019t to reach for Defoe or Camus but to send off for a 31-DVD box set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ingmarbergman\">Ingmar Bergman</a> movies. Which, after all, does contain that greatest of plague movies, The Seventh Seal<em>. </em>The idea of following the career of the 20th century\u2019s pre-eminent European film-maker through its 60-year span was compelling. Moreover, I hadn\u2019t even heard of, let alone seen, the first seven of them.</p> <p>It will probably come as no surprise that Bergman didn\u2019t have a larky, frivolous early period before he found his central tone and concerns. The first film in the box is called Torment; the second, Crisis<em>. </em>But it\u2019s also true that Bergman\u2019s sardonic sense of humour is often overlooked. So, one a day is the rule \u2013 and yes, it is making me cheerful.</p> <p>My local bookseller (before he closed) told me that trade was surprisingly good, and that people were buying those long books they felt guilty about never having read. War and Peace<em> </em>was doing well, so was Ulysses<em>. </em>I wish them luck. I suspect that pandemic anxiety is not an aid to sustained concentration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9baeb42aa192ed6f3e865f00153b41104e54d341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9baeb42aa192ed6f3e865f00153b41104e54d341/0_321_4959_2977/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The chess match with Death in The Seventh Seal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Bergman sardonic humour is often overlooked\u2019 \u2026 the chess match with Death in The Seventh Seal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunset Boulevard#CorNonExED/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am finding that a quick three-hour, start-to-finish immersion is more what is needed. For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgessimenon\">Simenon</a>\u2019s Maigret and Monsieur Charles<em>, </em>the last of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/04/the-enduring-depth-and-genius-of-inspector-maigret-by-graeme-macrae-burnett\">75-novel cycle</a> (and also the last to appear in Penguin\u2019s admirable retranslation of them all). Next I tried one of Simenon\u2019s supposed successors, Pascal Garnier, but found his How\u2019s the Pain<em> </em>too jocose, too grand guignol. It emphasises how quiet Simenon is in tone, even in a police procedural. I\u2019ve just started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/craig-brown-its-difficult-to-spoof-boring-people\">Craig Brown</a>\u2019s somewhat longer Beatles book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/road-trips-yoga-and-lsd-with-the-dentist-what-the-beatles-did-next\">One Two Three Four</a>,<em> </em>which seems the perfect antidote to these times.</p> <p>Music: a friend recently tipped me off about the Icelandic pianist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/30/pianist-vikingur-olafsson-interview-bach\">V\u00edkingur \u00d3lafsson</a>, so I have ordered his Debussy-Rameau disc, plus his Bach: Works and Reworks, thanking Amazon while cursing it at the same time. And they don\u2019t seem to be offering a plague discount.</p> <h2><em>\u2018All the internet you can eat is not the answer\u2019</em></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeanettewinterson\">Jeanette Winterson</a></h2> <p>I was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/20/jeanette-winterson-made-in-accrington\">brought up in End Time</a>. Mrs Winterson would have loved a plague that stopped the world. We did drills for it \u2013 hiding under the stairs with tinned food and a flashlight. As a writer I have also been self-isolating for most of my life. I live backing on to a wood outside of a village. I am used to quiet and I like it.</p> <p>I know, though, that the Revenge of the Introverts isn\u2019t easy for most people. Imagine yourself as a big store room. What\u2019s in there that you haven\u2019t used for years? Did you love drawing as a kid? Were you great at inventing games? Can you make things? Do you have a good memory? If so memorising silly poems \u2013 like The Jumblies or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/02/owl-and-the-pussycat-edward-lear-voted-favourite-childrens-poem\">The Owl and the Pussycat</a> \u2013 is fun for you and pleasurable for others when you recite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50681a6336e550164b012bad24f343fddf82a7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50681a6336e550164b012bad24f343fddf82a7e/3_0_3235_1941/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Fun to recite \u2026 The Owl and the Pussycat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fun to recite \u2026 The Owl and the Pussycat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Granger Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone in a family choosing and memorising something, whatever it is, gives a bit of purpose and curiosity to the day, even competition. I think it\u2019s good for kids, who outsource everything, to learn to use their memory. And right now, all the internet you can eat isn\u2019t the answer. Looking inside ourselves, rather than outside, gives a different perspective.</p> <p>Reading is still the best inside/outside activity I know. Many people have been saying for years: \u201cI don\u2019t have time to read.\u201d Well, you do now, and this is such an opportunity to instil the habit in kids. A family reading hour is fun, especially if everyone shares their experience afterwards.</p> <p>I am going along my bookshelves and pulling out things I haven\u2019t read for years or didn\u2019t read properly at the time. As usual, I am reading a poem a day to keep me sane. I read the poem out loud \u2013 usually twice \u2013 to get the sense and meaning, and to hear my own voice. If you are living alone, speaking out loud makes a huge difference. Also, if you are anxious or struggling with random thoughts or lack of concentration, the poem read out loud will anchor and calm you. Try it.</p> <h2><em>\u2018Heimat is 60 hours of ultimate highbrow soap\u2019</em></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/24/eimear-mcbride-women-are-really-angry\">Eimear McBride</a></h2> <p>Coming in at around 60 hours, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/25/heimat-your-next-box-set\">Edgar Reitz\u2019s epic series of Heimat</a> films, which chart the events of 20th-century German history through the eyes of the inhabitants of the village of Shabbach, is surely the perfect entertainment for our time. Set in the German writer and film-maker\u2019s own home region of Hunsr\u00fcck, the first film spans the end of the first world war to the early 1980s and focuses on the Simon family and the evolving life of their rural community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8db1ab647f127d91f8b0bd163444dfd19be1eac8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8db1ab647f127d91f8b0bd163444dfd19be1eac8/241_0_3934_2362/1000..jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s long and slow, but where are you going?\u2019 \u2026 Heimat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s long and slow, but where are you going?\u2019 \u2026 Heimat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second film goes back to the 1960s and follows Hermann, the son of the family, as he heads to music school in Munich. Here he attempts to free himself from the constraints and judgments of the inward-looking village and experience directly, or indirectly, the social movements and political upheaval of the era. The third film again focuses on Hermann as he returns to the village in the period from the fall of the Berlin Wall up to the new millennium.</p> <p>Reitz manages to make the films both meandering and gripping. Nuanced characters and relationships provide the immediate human interest while the heavy tides of history buffet from all sides. Each film is shot in black and white but flowers into colour at significant moments in a seeming underlining of the vagaries of national memory and national forgetfulness.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a fan of delicately nuanced intergenerational sagas set against historical backgrounds, this one\u2019s for you. Yes, it\u2019s long and sometimes slow, but where are you going? And if its description in the New York Times as \u201cthe ultimate highbrow soap opera for couch potatoes\u201d doesn\u2019t tempt you, I don\u2019t know what will.</p> <h2><em>\u2018The courage of the Tesco van-driver seems to show the way\u2019</em></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/sebastian-barry-family-stories-mean-a-while-dofferent-thing-when-you-are-60\">Sebastian Barry</a></h2> <p>Here in the Wicklow hills, we have been hunkered down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">since 13 March</a>.

She and the other characters are real and nuanced in a way TV characters rarely are, even on good shows. They seem like they could be people I know who are having conversations, making mistakes, realising new things about themselves.</p> <p>The depiction of journalism is also unusually realistic. One of my favourite episodes \u2013 titled WAHAM after the name of a magnificently depicted women\u2019s conference \u2013 features Annie talking through how to improve an article with her editor. He\u2019s smart and also kind of a jerk. She\u2019s turned in a boring first draft and their conversation highlights to Annie the value of conveying her sincere and complex opinion of the conference, which nicely encapsulates what\u2019s wonderful about Shrill itself.</p> <h2><em>\u2018I\u2019m making a dress while listening to Middlemarch\u2019</em></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/diana-evans\">Diana Evans</a></h2> <p>My blood ran cold at the prospect of months of home-schooling and 24/7 company.

I must admit I have found it hard to get creative inspiration or to focus on cultural things, beyond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-southern-queerness\">Tiger King </a>on Netflix. Reading history is always my comfort in tough times, and it holds true in a pandemic. So I am reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/highereducation.biography1\">Claire Tomalin\u2019s biography of Pepys</a>, and have even dipped into Daniel Defoe\u2019s pretty fictional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/01/plague-fiction-writers-infectious-disease\">Diary of a Plague Year</a>.</p> <p>History always teaches us that however bad things are, there have always been worse times \u2013 and people to live through them and record them. That is a kind of therapy in itself.</p>",
  "<p>Dr William Frankland, a pioneering British immunologist who transformed the world\u2019s understanding of allergies, has died aged 108.</p> <p>Frankland improved the lives of millions of hay fever sufferers by developing the idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/01/where-is-the-worlds-most-hayfever-prone-city\">pollen count</a>. Until his death the oldest survivor of the Japanese prisoner of war camps, he published a scientific paper in September 2017 aged 105.</p> <p>Known as \u201cthe grandfather of allergy\u201d, Frankland\u2019s medical career spanned 70 years. He was a British army doctor in the second world war and spent three and a half years as a POW, later crediting his survival to his ability to treat Japanese troops.</p> <p>The historian Dan Snow called Frankland \u201cone of the greatest Britons\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehistoryguy/status/1245636362524479488\">tweeting</a> that he would never forget their meeting. Prof Adam Fox, the president of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, said Frankland was \u201can enormous inspiration to many\u201d, adding that he would be \u201csorely missed but very fondly remembered\u201d.</p> <p>Frankland, known as Bill, gave an interview to mark his 108th birthday, on 19 March, and put his longevity down to good luck. \u201cI\u2019ve come close to death so many times \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/29/spanish-flu-survivor-dies-from-coronavirus-aged-108\">1918 Spanish </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/29/spanish-flu-survivor-dies-from-coronavirus-aged-108\">flu pandemic</a>, three and a half years spent as a Japanese prisoner of war, to experiencing anaphylaxis following a tropical insect bite,\u201d he said. \u201cBut somehow I\u2019ve always managed to miss it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p> <p>Frankland was born in Battle, Sussex, in 1912, and studied medicine at the Queen\u2019s College, Oxford and later at St Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School.</p> <p>When the second world war began he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942. After the war he started work in the allergy department of St Mary\u2019s hospital, and went on to become an assistant to Sir Alexander Fleming in his penicillin research.</p> <p>Among Frankland\u2019s many achievements was his work on desensitisation \u2013 he would regularly experiment on himself using insects supplied by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. </p> <p>His work revealed that hay fever sufferers could be become immune to pollen if exposed to a desensitisation treatment for three years, while many venoms could be neutralised by the same treatment in five.</p> <p>Despite helping millions of allergy sufferers, Frankland said his discoveries had been less about the desire to help than the love of solving problems. \u201cI think being a doctor is rather like being a detective \u2013 someone is sick and there\u2019s something you have to discover that\u2019s not obvious,\u201d he told the Daily Mail in 2005.</p> <p>Frankland talked of his regret in prolonging the life of Saddam Hussein, after advising the Iraqi dictator to give up his 40-a-day smoking habit. \u201cTo my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state,\u201d Frankland said.</p> <p>He retired from his job at St Mary\u2019s at the age of 65 but worked, unpaid, as a consultant at Guy\u2019s hospital for a further 20 years.</p> <p>In his last interview he reflected on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">global coronavirus pandemic</a>, saying it was \u201cgreat to see scientists, such as those at Imperial, working so quickly to help tackle the pandemic\u201d, and added he would be having a quiet birthday as the doors of his care home were closed because of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cMy birthday this year will be quite different,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been given a special request to have two of my children visit for a short while, but they will have to keep at a safe distance.\u201d</p> <p>Frankland \u2013 who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/12/queens-birthday-honours-list-knights-outnumber-dames-five-to-one\">made an MBE in 2015</a> for his services to allergy research \u2013 is survived by two sons and two daughters. His wife Pauline, to whom he was married for 63 years, died in 2002.</p>",
  "<p>As the personal tragedies arising out of this crisis mount up, of course our energies must be devoted to saving lives, and comforting and caring for one another.</p> <p>The early equating of this crisis to wartime never really took hold for me and many others, especially younger generations. But it did remind me that even in the depths of the second world war, many like Orwell, Laski, Bevan and Attlee looked back on the experience of the 1930s and said, \u201cNever again.\u201d They started dreaming, describing, debating and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-austerity-politics-boris-johnson\">planning the society</a> they would construct for the future.

Our new society must eradicate the individual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/02/loan-credit-card-payments-frozen-uk-financial-regulator-coronavirus\">economic insecurity</a> that comes from low pay, precarious work and the employment status, for many, of being little more than a chattel, capable of being discarded with no say and no control.</p> <p>The crisis has meant that many who have never experienced our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/950000-apply-for-universal-credit-in-two-weeks-of-uk-lockdown\">social security system</a> previously have suddenly discovered how brutally inadequate it has become after 10 years of austerity and targeted attacks on the unemployed, the poor, children, disabled people and others. The appreciation that anyone can fall, and therefore everyone needs a safety net, has made intensely relevant the design of a minimum income guarantee or universal basic income.</p> <p>The threat of recession hangs over our economy. There are still those who will argue that another period of renewed austerity is the solution, and as always that will mean the heaviest burden falling on working people. Austerity never worked in tackling the impact of the banking crisis and it won\u2019t work in addressing the consequences of the coronavirus crisis either.</p> <p>Plus we have the greatest crisis of all facing us: the existential threat to human existence from the climate crisis.

  "<p>CMC Markets, the financial spread-betting firm run by city tycoon Peter Cruddas, said business has boomed in the first quarter this year as the coronavirus wrought havoc on global financial markets.</p> <p>The company said net trading revenue from its core contract for difference (CFD) business, a form of derivative trading, almost doubled year-on-year to \u00a3214m in the 12 months to the end of March.</p> <p>\u201cAs announced in a series of upgrades throughout the financial year, net trading revenue across the group has been strong [throughout the 2020 financial year] and in particular during the final quarter of the year,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>CMC\u2019s coronavirus\u2013fuelled bumper year comes as more than 20 MPs have called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/03/impose-strict-curbs-on-gambling-during-covid-19-lockdown-mps-urge\">strict curbs on gambling during the Covid-19 lockdown</a>.</p> <p>Last week, the Betting &amp; Gaming Council <a href=\"https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/10pledges-safergambling/\">issued a 10-point pledge</a>, promising extra steps to ensure that firms do not exploit vulnerable people and addicts who may be at increased risk due to the inertia inherent in staying at home for long periods.

  "<p>You have never spent so much time at home, and once you have exhausted Netflix, your eyes may alight on all the filth you\u2019ve never noticed before. Have you ever dusted your ceiling? Of course you haven\u2019t. But now is the time to do it, because you don\u2019t have anything better to do. Here are all the other jobs you were previously too busy to worry about, but which will provide a sense of achievement \u2013 or at least a little exercise.</p> <h2><strong>Clean your oven</strong></h2> <p>Easily the worst job in the house, but a gleaming oven will become one of your life\u2019s new pleasures. \u201cPrevention is better than cure,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theorganisedmum.blog/\">Gemma Bray</a>, the creator of the Organised Mum Method. \u201cI swear by oven liners, which will catch everything at the bottom of the oven. You take it out and quickly rinse it under the tap. But before you can start using an oven liner you have to start off with a clean oven.\u201d</p> <p>You can go for a heavy-duty oven cleaner, but many people are put off by the harsh chemicals these contain. \u201cOther people swear by using bicarbonate of soda in a paste, which I have never really had much success with, especially if you are battling a really grimy oven.\u201d</p> <p>Bray takes out racks and leaves them to soak in a bath of very hot, soapy water. \u201cWashing-up liquid is one of the best things for tackling grease. Slowly, little and often, work on the bottom of the oven \u2013 even in 15-minute slots.\u201d Wait until after you have used the oven, and it has cooled but is still warm. \u201cUse hot, soapy water and a cloth, and every time you use the oven go in there, go at it and eventually you\u2019ll start to see a difference.\u201d</p> <p>To clean a microwave, slice up a lemon and put it in a bowl of water. \u201cPut it in for five minutes at full power,\u201d says Lynsey Crombie, AKA <a href=\"https://queenofclean.blog/\">the Queen of Clean</a> and author of The Easy Life: Quick Ways to Clean and Manage Your Home All Year Round. Leave to cool for a while \u2013 you don\u2019t want a face full of scalding steam \u2013 then wipe with a cloth.</p> <h2><strong>Freshen your fridge</strong></h2> <p>\u201cTake everything out and put it in a cool bag,\u201d says Aggie MacKenzie, the TV cleaning expert who runs <a href=\"https://aggiestips.com/\">AggiesTips.com</a>. \u201cHave a sink full of hot, soapy water ready and wash all the shelves. Wipe the inside of the fridge with water and a microfibre cloth \u2013 you don\u2019t really want to be introducing much in the way of products. The drip tray at the back can get clogged up, maybe with bits of labels from jars. Get a cotton bud, put some kitchen roll round it and dab in and out of the hole to keep it free-flowing.\u201d</p> <p>If you can manage, pull the fridge out and clean behind it. \u201cThat\u2019s when you discover you\u2019ve got mice, or you\u2019ve had mice \u2013 you\u2019ll see droppings,\u201d says MacKenzie. Gently dust or vacuum the condenser coils at the back of the fridge.</p> <h2><strong>De</strong><strong>scale your loo</strong></h2> <p>An unsightly lavatory is bothersome, but easily forgotten after every flush. Tackle it once and for all. You need to remove some of the water first so as not to dilute the cleaning product too much, says Crombie. Scoop it out with rubber-gloved hands, or \u201cplunge\u201d it down the U-bend with a toilet brush. \u201cPut some limescale-removing product down there and leave overnight.\u201d Denture tablets or soda crystals will also work. But Crombie cautions: \u201cIf you put it down and someone uses the toilet within half an hour, you\u2019re not giving it an opportunity to work. The reason I don\u2019t advise bleach is it doesn\u2019t break limescale down. It will look better, but in a few days it will come back.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Get a sparkling shower</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI use a 50/50 ratio of white vinegar and water solution in an old spray bottle,\u201d says Bray. \u201cIt helps to tackle the limescale and dirt. If you\u2019ve got a clogged-up showerhead \u2013 check first it won\u2019t damage the surface \u2013 you can sit it in a white-vinegar solution. I try to use as few chemicals as possible in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For the black mould spots around the silicone, \u201cget some tissue paper and soak it in a bleach solution\u201d. Your shower curtain can probably go in the washing machine \u2013 check the label \u2013 as can a non-slip bathmat. \u201cThey can go a bit gunky underneath, but they come out like new.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Wonderful windows</strong></h2> <p>Shop-bought window cleaning products or vinegar will work on the glass. \u201cIf you have UPVC frames, use a cream cleaner or a damp sponge with bicarbonate of soda on,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cFor wooden, painted windows, dry dust them then clean with an orange-oil-based product, to protect the wood. Don\u2019t forget to clean the handle \u2013 just use what you\u2019ve been using on the frame.\u201d Vacuum your curtains, and wipe blinds.</p> <h2><strong>Tackle the junk drawer</strong></h2> <p>This is the time to be ruthless. Empty it out, says MacKenzie. Give the inside of the drawer a vacuum and a wipe with a damp cloth. Then \u201conly put back the things you use. If you think: \u2018I might need that one day,\u2019 no, you won\u2019t because you haven\u2019t used it in the last year. I used to have a dish full of keys and I never knew what they were for. One day I just threw them away. Did I come to any grief? No.\u201d Rehome items to the places they belong.</p> <h2><strong>Under the bed</strong></h2> <p>Remove whatever it is you are storing under your bed and clean off the dust (there will be a thick layer), then vacuum underneath. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to flip your mattress if it needs it,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cGive it a vacuum.\u201d If you have a steam cleaner, use this too. \u201cHold the steamer 30cm away from the mattress \u2013 people go too close and get the mattress wet and then they can\u2019t go to bed. Leave the window open so the mattress can dry. If you have stains on your mattress, a carpet-cleaning product should get them off.\u201d</p> <p>She recommends a homemade fabric freshener: 20 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda and 20 drops of lavender essential oil in a 500ml bottle of water. \u201cJust spritz it on.\u201d Pillows can usually be washed \u2013 check the instructions.</p> <h2><strong>Walls, ceilings and doors</strong></h2> <p>Wallpaper, particularly if it hasraised patterns, can benefit from a vacuum. \u201cGently go over it with a brush attachment, or with a dry microfibre cloth or paintbrush,\u201d says Crombie. \u201cIf you have a flat-headed mop, use that to dry-dust your ceiling.\u201d While you are at it, use a brush (a clean paintbrush, or old makeup brush) to dust light fittings.</p> <p>Although some paint is washable, Crombie says she wouldn\u2019t recommend it, \u201cbut you can dry-dust\u201d. For marks, use a <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/best-magic-eraser/\">Magic Eraser or similar,</a> or get a sponge and gently wipe. Don\u2019t forget doors, particularly those with dirt-attracting panels, and frames. \u201cI use warm soapy water, and dry it instantly with a clean dry microfibre cloth.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Spruce up your sofa and soft furnishings</strong></h2> <p>If you are spending a lot more time on the sofa, you may as well improve your environment. Give it a thorough vacuum, including in the crevices and under the seat pads. \u201cGet a damp microfibre cloth and gently rub at any stains,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cIf you have ingrained dirt, borrow a steam cleaner. Check the labels of your cushion covers \u2013 some can be washed. I wouldn\u2019t wash feathered cushion pads, but most are synthetic fibres so follow the washing instructions.\u201d Pull out the sofa and vacuum underneath. \u201cBehind it, you\u2019ll see a massive layer of dust on the skirting board. That\u2019s where a lot of dust mites are.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Clean your clean</strong><strong>ing tools</strong></h2> <p>Finally, give your cleaning tools some attention. \u201cString mops give me the heebie-jeebies,\u201d says MacKenzie. \u201cA much better mop is a flat-headed one, with a cloth pad you take off after each time you wash your floor and stick in the washing machine. I wash my dustpan brush in the kitchen sink and dry it outside.\u201d</p> <p>Show your vacuum cleaner some love. Many have washable filters; the brush head will probably be clogged with hair. \u201cGet a small pair of scissors and snip right down the middle [of the tightly rolled hair]. It takes a while but it\u2019s terribly satisfying.\u201d</p> <p>Bray uses a new dishcloth each day and saves them up until they can go in the washing machine on a hot wash.

  "<p>Amazon has denied reports that it is no longer accepting new deliveries of books to its warehouses while prioritising essential goods amid the coronavirus outbreak, as major cutbacks at the UK\u2019s two main book wholesalers have begun to prevent bookshops up and down the country from acquiring new stock.</p> <p>Amid <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/writers-block-amazon-slams-the-door-on-new-books-and-bestsellers-zfl8s8w3l\">reports in publications such as the Times</a> that the online retail giant was turning away book deliveries to focus on household essentials and medical supplies, Amazon told the Guardian on Friday that it is still accepting new stock from publishers.</p> <p>However, with several major publishers moving some scheduled releases to later in the year, confusion reigns among readers about which books will be available during the lockdown.

Coronavirus sees indie booksellers get inventive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Monday and Tuesday respectively, wholesalers Gardners and Bertrams announced they were temporarily suspending all orders, making it more difficult for bookshops, particularly independents, to get fresh stock until restrictions lift. While publishers are continuing to supply large booksellers such as Amazon, Waterstones and supermarkets, independents are generally supplied by the wholesalers because of their small orders, meaning they now have only existing stock.</p> <p>Late on Thursday, Gardners reopened, allowing bookshops to order single copies of books for customers \u2013 but only for titles it has in stock.</p> <p>\u201cAt this stage we have a very limited offer and have not opened our business up in anywhere near the capacity it was. In fact much of it is very much closed,\u201d said Gardners\u2019s Nigel Wyman. \u201cWith a cut-down service and a very small number of staff we can maintain a safe working environment that adheres to the current government guidelines regarding social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Although Nielsen BookScan, the UK\u2019s official book sales monitor, says that sales were up 6% in the week to Saturday 21 March, they are believed to have since fallen as shops closed. Official data is no longer available from Nielsen, for the first time in its 22-year history, \u201cdue to the unprecedented temporary closure of bookshops in the UK\u201d, it said on Tuesday.</p> <p>Publishers are pushing back their big new titles, such as Raynor Winn\u2019s follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/the-salt-path-raynor-winn-review\">The Salt Path</a> and Ruth Jones\u2019s second novel, to the autumn and even to 2021. This is an attempt to prevent them getting lost in a world without bookshops. A senior staff member of one of the major publishers told the Guardian that their sales were currently at 20% of normal levels.</p> <p>Many indie booksellers, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-indie-booksellers-inventive-sales\">had been getting inventive</a> in order to deliver books on bikes and even skateboards, have begun to warn customers they will no longer be able to fulfil orders. At Warwick Books, owners Mog and Pauline Harris announced that the wholesalers\u2019 closure made things extremely difficult. \u201cWe are really sad to even think we have to do this, but as a small independent we have to think long-term and no books to sell is a tricky pickle for a bookshop,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.warwickbooks.net/message\">they wrote</a>.</p> <p>Gardners\u2019s change of heart was \u201cgood, but most orders we have received are for multiple books so it isn\u2019t very practical\u201d, they added on Friday. While publishers are responding well to direct orders, \u201clike us their systems aren\u2019t set up for small single-line orders so I imagine it won\u2019t be sustainable\u201d.</p> <p>Louise Ashmore at <a href=\"https://to-be-read.co.uk/about-us/\">Read</a> bookshop in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said the closure of wholesalers was a blow, but that Gardners\u2019s offer was a \u201chuge help\u201d, and \u201cwe\u2019ve been up until the early hours of the morning processing orders while we can\u201d.</p> <p>The store, which opened last year, is now hoping to buy books directly from publishers, to sell in a \u201cwhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone\u201d type of promotion. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if it will work but we feel that while we can still get to a postbox, we should still try,\u201d Ashmore said.</p> <p>Edinburgh\u2019s Portobello Bookshop has closed both its physical and online shop, despite Gardners\u2019s offer. \u201cUnfortunately under the new system the postage and admin costs are so high that it\u2019s not going to be affordable for us to bring staff out of furlough without passing those costs on to customers, which isn\u2019t something we\u2019d be comfortable doing,\u201d said bookseller Jack Clark.</p> <p>Emma Corfield-Walters at Bookish in Crickhowell in Powys, south Wales, said it had been a \u201chell of a week\u201d but welcomed the change at Gardners. \u201c[It] is also testament to Gardners\u2019s support to indies at this tough time; they could have just shut up shop but are constantly looking at how to work safely and still help us out when we need it most,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Indies are still doing their best to be inventive despite impact on their supply. <a href=\"https://wonderlandbookshop.co.uk/about/\">The Barrister in Wonderland in Retford, Nottinghamshire</a> has launched a PayItForward scheme, where customers can buy a book for those in their community who would benefit from one in the future, while at The Book Shop in Lee-on-the-Solent, owner Sarah Veal has come up with the idea of \u201cPositivity Boxes\u201d. At \u00a310 each, they contain \u201ca good book, choccy treat, a hot chocolate sachet, a bookmark and a card from the sender\u201d. More than 80 have been purchased and sent out in the last two weeks to people self-isolating, \u201cjust to let them know that they are being thought of\u201d, said Veal.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no better moment than now to have a bookseller in your life and sign up for a subscription,\u201d urged Nicky Dunne at Mayfair bookseller Heywood Hill. \u201cTwo mottoes, too: \u2018carpe librum\u2019 and \u2018chins up\u2019.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The North Atlantic may be a weaker climate ally than previously believed, according to a study that suggests the ocean\u2019s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide has been overestimated.</p> <p>A first-ever winter and spring sampling of plankton in the western North Atlantic showed cell sizes were considerably smaller than scientists assumed, which means the carbon they absorb does not sink as deep or as fast, nor does it stay in the depths for as long.</p> <p>This discovery is likely to force a negative revision of global climate calculations, say the authors of the Nasa-backed study, though it is unclear by how much.</p> <p>\u201cWe have found a misconception.

  "<p>The Italian footwear designer Sergio Rossi has died at the age of 84.

At Imperial College London medical students have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-forces-medical-students-sit-final-exams-online\">taken unsupervised exams</a> at home for the first time.</p> <p>If the pandemic has not eased by August, sitting exams in person could put students \u2013 particularly those with underlying health conditions \u2013 at risk. International students who have left the UK may also be unable to sit exams in August, students say, and it could make it difficult for others to begin their pupillage and effectively start their careers.</p> <p>Alex Mullen, a law student at BPP University Law School, says it would be a financial struggle for him to sit face-to-face exams in August. \u201cI have a scholarship designed to pay for my course and the costs of living until the end of the course, which is now longer than when they thought it would be. My tenancy also ends in August, so I could have to find somewhere to live for two weeks in the middle of what is going to be a really stressful exam season,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Robert Harris, a student at City Law school, says the situation is tense. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overplay our concerns and we recognise this is a difficult time for everyone and others have it worse, but still these are real concerns. For me, the key impact is on when I\u2019ll be able to start my pupillage. It seems strange that the Bar course is the only one to say [moving assessments online is] not possible.\u201d</p> <p>The BSB says it is exploring a range of contingency plans if restrictions remain in place in August. \u201cWe are very conscious that this is a difficult and uncertain time for students,\u201d it said in a comment. \u201cHowever, there is no secure solution that could be put in place by April to enable us to deliver these exams as normal. The next scheduled opportunity is August and that is what we are working toward.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Bar Council says it sees \u201cno reason\u201d why exams must be face-to-face in August and that it is \u201cconcerned\u201d that this is \u201cnot the best solution\u201d. \u201cIt creates delay and uncertainty for students. It means students will be sitting exams long after their teaching has finished, and very close to the time when their pupillages would start. And it is unclear how resits can be accommodated,\u201d Nicholas Vineall QC, Chair of the Bar Council\u2019s education and training committee, says. \u201cIt ought to be possible to arrange for these exams to be taken online.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in the legal profession, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) rowed back on plans to delay exams until the Autumn, after students urged the regulator to rethink. They have since asked universities to send proposals on how they would like to do exams instead. \u201cThey haven\u2019t said what online things must be used, they\u2019re just saying \u2018tell us what you want to do and we\u2019ll consider it\u2019,\u201d Charlotte Parkinson, Chair of the Junior Lawyers Division of the Law Society, says.</p> <p>Legal education is often traditional and slow to adopt online practices.

He has also connected with students over Zoom and Microsoft Teams. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to push this over the past couple of years and it has been quite slow but I think this period of being confined to our houses and having to do things online will move things along a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cLaw has begun to modernise.\u201d</p> <p>Students say regulators must be creative and find modern solutions, too.</p> <p><br></p>",

On one morning this week, searches revealed 17 Facebook pages hawking Covid-19 test kits and 18 pages selling other forbidden products.</p> \n<p>The Facebook pages either promote products, link to external websites where they can be bought, or give phone numbers and other means of contact for vendors. One popular Facebook page, called Covid-19 Tests, which had 5,000 likes, offered visitors a dialogue box to contact the seller. </p> \n<p>The vendor responded to one message saying they had sold out but added: \u201cWill have more stock end week, I will send you a link. How many kits did you want?\u201d</p> \n<p>After being alerted by the Guardian, Facebook began deleting such pages as well as paid adverts. \u201cFacebook is focused on preventing the exploitation of this crisis for financial gain,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said. \u201cWe have removed millions of ads, posts, pages and Marketplace listings for the sale of masks, hand sanitiser, surface disinfecting wipes and Covid-19 test kits, including all of those shared with us by the Guardian.\u201d </p> \n<p>The MHRA is particularly worried about sales of rapid testing kits, which take 10 minutes and do not require laboratory analysis. They look similar to pregnancy test sticks and use a drop of blood taken from a finger prick to measure the presence of antibodies. Certain antibodies are a strong indication of whether a person has previously contracted Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Some test kits claim to have a CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark that denotes the product was approved by regulators. However, guidance issued by Public Health England states: \u201cThere are no CE-marked tests for home use and it is illegal to supply such products.\u201d</p> \n<p>These appear to be the tests that were being sold by Beaini, the Bradford GP, via a website that had no contact name, no phone number and no email or postal address. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"731e648f509e48a12aa904c627551d547b128ab8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/731e648f509e48a12aa904c627551d547b128ab8/0_124_4340_2604/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Youssef Beaini\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youssef Beaini said: \u2018We will get all the pages deleted and taken down so that no illegal activity can occur.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bonds Clinic</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Facebook page promoting Beaini\u2019s kits was also anonymous.

  "<p>The world of energy generation has its established totems of sustainability. Solar panels, wind turbines \u2013 to many they seem beyond reproach. Yet for Jo Bandle, a process engineer at Atkins, the picture is more nuanced.</p> <p>\u201cLook at the waste you get from wind turbines,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them only have a life expectancy of 20 years, so when they get decommissioned that waste has to go somewhere. And think of the sheer numbers of them.\u201d</p> <p>Bandle, who specialises in nuclear power projects, knows her viewpoint is not an easy sell. \u201cPeople are quick to see the negatives of nuclear and not the positives, but none of the renewables are wholly positive,\u201d she says. The lifespan of Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, which Bandle works on, will be 60 years, during which time it will power about 6m homes \u2013 equivalent to about 8,000 turbines.</p> <p>Bandle, deputy lead of systems design, points out that the nuclear power industry has come a long way in terms of sustainability, purely by designing with decommissioning in mind. \u201cToday\u2019s fleet can be decommissioned more easily. Forty years ago, people didn\u2019t think about that. Nowadays, a huge amount of thinking goes into how we will decommission, how we will minimise waste \u2013 that is at the forefront of the design and planning.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a philosophy that\u2019s shared across the Atkins workforce. Kristina Parry, who works on building developments as an interior designer, has seen how sustainability is considered at every juncture of a scheme \u2013 even in terms of choosing a site that promotes greener behaviour from its eventual occupants. \u201cWe think about the location, ask how people will get to the site. We\u2019ll check that there are existing transport links, so people aren\u2019t forced to drive, and we\u2019ll assess the local facilities.\u201d</p> <p>The building itself then needs to be fit for purpose \u2013 and part of that is promoting a more environmentally conscious working life. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk with the architects to make sure we have the right rooms with the right adjacency for how people are going to use the spaces,\u201d says Parry. \u201cIf we\u2019re designing an office, for example, we\u2019ll design in videoconferencing facilities. That means the end users can have a more sustainable approach to meetings, rather than travelling to other sites unnecessarily.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e189e52dfd32a9607fe4bfa9e92099a6c9c1844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e189e52dfd32a9607fe4bfa9e92099a6c9c1844/0_333_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\" Supporting-key projects-WOODCOTE3 (2)\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atkins\u2019 new Epsom office has been awarded a Breeam excellent rating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even the finishing materials that give a building its aesthetic are scrutinised from an environmental perspective: \u201cWe are always mindful of making sure they have as minimal an environmental impact as possible, be it where they\u2019ve come from, what they\u2019re made from, or the impact on environmental air quality [from transporting them],\u201d she says.</p> <p>It\u2019s this focus on sustainability that helped Atkins bag a <a href=\"https://www.atkinsglobal.com/en-gb/media-centre/news-releases/2020/feb/2020-02-06\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breeam excellent rating</a> for its new office in Epsom, Surrey. \u201cEverything from the architecture to the interiors was done by the in-house team. It\u2019s an amazing place for staff to work,\u201d says Parry. For the Breeam assessment, a building is scrutinised in eight categories \u2013 with energy, materials, and health and wellbeing making up more than two thirds of the eventual score. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical buildings, but the social impact the surroundings have on staff, and on their physical wellbeing too.\u201d</p> <p>Buildings such as the new Epsom office set an important marker for what can be achieved. \u201cWe\u2019re flying the flag for environmental buildings by showing clients that they are achievable and can be done on time and on budget,\u201d says Parry. The recently opened <a href=\"https://www.e-architect.co.uk/england/bournemouth-university-poole-gateway-building\" rel=\"nofollow\">Poole Gateway building at Bournemouth University</a> \u2013 also rated excellent \u2013 is testament to what can be achieved when clients take that leap of faith.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always looking to use the most advanced materials, to build renewable energy into a building\u2019s infrastructure. Quantity surveyors generally hate the design team because we want to spend so much money,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen clients start to look at the long-term benefits of switching materials or switching the building processes, or heating systems, the message starts to get through, but the initial expense is quite high. It\u2019s a battle to get that passed sometimes.

  "<p><br>NHS and care workers have gripped public attention as the country responds to the Covid-19 pandemic. But the one million people who work in local government have also been working flat-out \u2013 work that will continue well past the present crisis, that has been made much harder by 10 years of austerity, and that is not being helped by some parts of Whitehall trying to micromanage the local response.</p> <p>As councils cope with a huge wave of demand on every front, from social care to refuse collection, they are taking daily instructions from ministers and officials across Whitehall, themselves under pressure and struggling to keep pace with directions from Downing Street.</p> <p>Ironically perhaps after years of cuts, the tensions aren\u2019t about money, but about communication and coordination. There have been delays, confusion and aborted work, such as changes of policy about whether central or local government is managing the assembly and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/doubts-over-take-up-of-government-coronavirus-emergency-food-parcels\">distribution of food parcels</a>, and local preparations for additional mortuary capacity being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/temporary-morgues-being-set-up-across-uk-amid-rising-covid-19-deaths\">put on hold </a>in favour of a national response.</p> <p>While some difficulties are inevitable, the fundamental problem is ministers persisting in the fantasy that everything works best when it is run from the centre.</p> <p>Limited understanding about the practicalities of local delivery has affected everything from identifying which vulnerable people need help to supporting local businesses.</p> <p>In some places food parcels have arrived stuffed with <a href=\"http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/news/Pages/first-coronavirus-food-parcels-leave-bad-taste.aspx\">biscuits and chocolate</a>, which then need to be supplemented with something nutritious.</p> <p>Meanwhile, public health directors are frustrated at being <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/category/updates/\">excluded from key communications</a> and the development of guidance by NHS England and government departments.</p> <p>Responsibility for commissioning public health policies was moved out of central government in 2013. As former public health director Gabriel Scally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/england-public-health-coronavirus-cuts-regional\"> said earlier this week</a>, public health budgets have since been systematically raided in the face of massive cuts to council funding. The heart of the local response to the virus now lies with a small number of council public health specialists \u2013 about 500 across England.</p> <p>As the first wave of infections hit, these specialists played a crucial role in the containment phase, chasing infection contacts and coordinating the local response.</p> <p>Among a torrent of other responsibilities, highlighted via the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/adayinthelifeofaDPH?src=hashtag_click&amp;f=live\">#adayinthelifeofadph</a>, local public health staff are collating and analysing data, giving advice on everything from protection equipment to homelessness, managing the implementation of social distancing, supporting vulnerable people, and working with the NHS, voluntary groups and government. </p> <p>All councils depend on these specialists to help implement the blizzard of guidance on infection control and safe working, as they work with GPs, volunteers, community groups, local businesses and government during the lockdown. </p> <p>Those who may need help are being identified from numerous sources, including responses to a government letter asking 1.5 million people judged at risk if they need help. Many people have contacted councils directly. Staff and voluntary workers \u2013 all trained in infection control \u2013 are making personal visits and keep in touch online and by phone, as well as delivering food and medicines and checking on social care and other welfare needs.

Councils are working with the NHS, care homes and voluntary groups to ensure residents being moved out of hospitals have somewhere to go and have the right support in place.</p> <p>The government has allocated councils in England <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876273/Covid-19_additional_funding_allocations.pdf\">\u00a31.6b</a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876273/Covid-19_additional_funding_allocations.pdf\">n of additional funds</a> to cope with Covid-19 pressures, such as buying support from care providers, but the guidance did not mandate the testing of patients before discharge, leading some care homes, such as in Liverpool, to refuse to take them. Continuing difficulties in getting personal protection equipment (PPE) to care staff are also hindering discharges, and infections in care homes will put a huge additional strain on adult social care.</p> <p>Social care staff continue to go to people\u2019s homes despite the lack of PPE.

It\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.localgov.co.uk/Councils-warn-of-wave-of-waste/50290\">growing problem</a>. Some council recycling centres have closed and the volume of waste is increasing just as sickness among refuse crews increases. </p> <p>Huge efforts have been made to get rough sleepers off the streets, including working with volunteers and businesses <a href=\"https://careappointments.com/care-news/england/143184/manchester-and-liverpool-rough-sleepers-to-be-housed-in-hotels-during-coronavirus-outbreak/\">to get people into hotels</a> and <a href=\"https://www.babergh.gov.uk/news/council-teams-and-local-business-restore-property-in-less-than-a-week-in-order-to-house-vulnerable-residents/\">revamp empty properties</a>. And councils are gearing up to help an expected <a href=\"https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/news/domestic-abuse-and-covid-19\">surge in domestic abuse victims</a>. </p> <p>Local authorities also have to handle the emotionally-charged practicalities around funerals. Guidance from Public Health England now says only immediate family are allowed to attend and social distancing rules must be maintained. </p> <p>Some families are waiting to remove bodies from hospital mortuaries in the hope that the rules might be relaxed in a few weeks, while many undertakers are not working as normal. As a result, mortuary capacity is rapidly running out, and emergency facilities are being built.</p> <p>Under intense pressure, local government\u2019s role has been a mix of community leadership, implementing national plans in ways that are sensitive to local needs, and providing support for everyone from rough sleepers to businesses.</p> <p>When the immediate crisis is over, councils need to ram home the message that while national guidance has often been essential in fighting Covid-19, local government is at its best when it has maximum freedom to meet local needs. When the plaudits are being handed out, councils will deserve huge credit for the energy and innovation they have brought to leading their communities.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus outbreak has brought Britain to a near standstill, with road travel plummeting by as much as 73%, to levels not seen since 1955.</p> <p>All forms of travel have plunged in urban areas. Walking, cycling and car and van journeys are all down by about three-quarters, while bus numbers have fallen by 60%. The number of large lorries has declined by just 40% as essential supplies continue to be transported.</p> <p>However, national data from Monday and Tuesday, the two most recent days available, shows a slight upward trend since the previous week, with motor traffic down only 63%, equivalent to 1962. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called the trend concerning. \u201cPlease follow medical and scientific advice to stay home and save lives,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The empty streets have already resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-big-drop-air-pollution\">big drops in air pollution</a>, which is likely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/17/air-pollution-likely-to-increase-coronavirus-death-rate-warn-experts\">reduce early deaths</a> from lung and heart conditions.

The government data also shows rail travel down 90%, and tube and bus journeys in London down by 94% and 83% respectively.</p> <p>Some experts suggest that people who have learned how to work effectively from home may continue to do so for a day or two a week after the Covid-19 crisis is over. This could help tackle the climate emergency, because the transport sector is the biggest emitter and the only one to have <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/roadtransportandairemissions/2019-09-16\">increased its emissions in recent years</a>. Others, however, say emissions could rise again if the coronavirus lockdown causes lasting financial damage to public transport services.</p> <p>Detailed data from <a href=\"https://vivacitylabs.com/\">Vivacity</a>, a video analysis company, shows that pedestrian, bicycle and car journeys in urban areas started falling a few days after the government announced it was moving from the contain to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\">delay</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\"> phase of its pandemic response</a> on 12 March.

And with about 80% of game sales now coming via digital download, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association, it had seemed that the sector was coronavirus-proof.</p> <p>However, blockbuster video game titles like The Last of Us II still tend to sell more copies in physical rather than digital form; often because mainstream audiences are less experienced with online purchasing, or because purchasers take advantage of pre-order offers and discounts from shops and supermarkets. The most successful game in the UK in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/sep/26/fifa-19-review\">Fifa 19</a>, achieved 75% of its sales from the physical product rather than through digital downloads.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Launching a really big game right now is going to cost you</p> <footer> <cite>Seth Barton, editor of MCV/Develop</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What the delay of The Last of Us Part II shows is that the closure of stores and the disruption to the manufacturing and distribution pipeline for physical software products is still problematic for the games industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe Last of Us II, by all accounts and appearances, looks to be finished, so this is a commercial decision,\u201d said Seth Barton, editor of industry news publication <a href=\"https://www.mcvuk.com/\">MCV/Develop</a>. \u201cSony is concerned that the crisis will stymie the launch of its flagship title for the year. Bricks and mortar retail still makes up a considerable part of the sales mix, especially for the biggest titles, and with every Game Digital store in the UK and every GameStop in the US closed, launching a really big game right now is going to cost you. There\u2019s also the possibility that the crisis has delayed production and shipping of high-margin collector\u2019s editions of the game.\u201d</p> <p>And if The Last of Us Part II has fallen victim to the uncertainty and disruption around Covid-19, it\u2019s likely other major releases will follow. Titles such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/02/games-most-anticipated-2020-preview\">Ghost </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/02/games-most-anticipated-2020-preview\">of Tsushima</a> and Cyberpunk 2077, which were also due for release in the next few months, may also be affected \u2013 if not by sales and manufacturing channels then by disruption to the development process itself.</p> <p>\u201cWhile big games have long been created by teams in distributed locations, having your individual staff all working from home is far from ideal,\u201d says Barton. \u201cThe process of bringing a big game to fruition is a complex one, and certain elements, such as performance capture, motion capture and [quality assurance] will be very hard to relocate out of dedicated spaces.</p> <p>\u201cQA is a particular bugbear, especially given the industry\u2019s penchant for incredible secrecy and round-the-clock shifts approaching launch. Sending test kits and code to testers\u2019 homes looks both practically difficult and potentially risky.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a21ef368f10af187cd75febd6ae5c1fd03fc8d8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a21ef368f10af187cd75febd6ae5c1fd03fc8d8b/0_0_5641_3385/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Promotion for Cyberpunk 2077 during the Tokyo Game Show 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Promotion for Cyberpunk 2077 during the Tokyo Game Show 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Game developer Will Luton, who now runs consultancy <a href=\"https://departmentofplay.net/\">Department of Play</a>, reiterates the difficulties that Covid-19 brings to games testing. \u201cFor consoles, people need access to developer test kits. Often there are fewer than needed and they are shared around in a studio, with QA departments using rolling shifts for 24-hour coverage. So getting these into the homes and set up for the right people at the right time will be a logistics challenge, especially considering that technically these kits need to be kept securely in one building.\u201d</p> <p>This winter was also set to host two major console launches: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/19/playstation-5-specifications-revealed-but-design-is-still-a-mystery\">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/25/xbox-series-x-console-features-12-teraflops-graphics-processor\">Xbox </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/25/xbox-series-x-console-features-12-teraflops-graphics-processor\">Series X</a>. But, given the reliance on complex manufacturing and distribution channels and the need to get tens of thousands of units into both digital and physical stores, might we see Microsoft and Sony rethinking the schedule?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/30/epic-video-games-self-isolating\">Now's the time \u2013 15 epic video games for the socially isolated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat depends on China\u2019s ability to control the virus, specifically in Shenzhen, the world\u2019s electronics factory, as there\u2019s nowhere else you can realistically move production,\u201d says Barton. \u201cIn addition, component supplies may be impacted, though the initial slowdown there generally seems to have picked back up.\u201d</p> <p>Luton also points to the security issues of having staff working from home while developing and testing PS5 and Xbox Series X titles. \u201cI would imagine Sony and Microsoft would be reluctant for their next-gen hardware to be in some private residence and they certainly wouldn\u2019t want to ship one there. But they\u2019ll have to change policy as the lockdown continues.\u201d</p> <p>The one positive factor is that digital channels are there if needed.</p> <p>\u201cOptical media manufacture is going to falter as supply chain is disrupted and bricks and mortar retail has completely disappeared,\u201d says Luton. \u201cWhile people are spending more money and time on games, a big chunk of the sales channel has just disappeared. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some AAA games now attempt a digital-only release as some of the Hollywood blockbusters have tried with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/26/film-industry-blockbusters-multiplex-cinemas-closed-coronavirus\">\u2018straight-to-streaming\u2019</a> approach. But it\u2019s a massive unknown.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s also the fact that key titles such as The Last of Us Part II and Cyberpunk are both set to launch on current generation consoles as well as the PC \u2013 so there is a lot of hardware out there that can already play these games.</p> <p>\u201cThankfully, this is the most resilient console market we\u2019ve ever had. The new consoles could be delayed into 2021 and we\u2019d still \u2013 Covid-19 permitting \u2013 be able to play all this winter\u2019s big releases on our current hardware. It pains me to say it, but we\u2019ve never <em>needed</em> new hardware less.\u201d</p>",

France\u2019s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave was leading on tie-break from Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi.</p> <p>Arkady Dvorkovich took a personal decision \u201cafter just a few seconds of thinking\u201d to suspend play last Thursday when he learned that international flights out of Russia would be banned from the next day. The global body Fide\u2019s president feared that the grandmasters from China, France, the Netherlands and the US would be stranded indefinitely.</p> <p>This is the third time in the last half-century that a Fide president has had to make such a decision, and the consequences of the previous two were momentous. In July 1972 Max Euwe bent the rules to allow Bobby Fischer to arrive late in Reykjavik to play Boris Spassky. The match still nearly foundered at the start, but Euwe\u2019s judgment was vindicated when Fischer\u2019s victory led to the greatest boom chess has ever known.</p> <p>In February 1985 the Fide president Florencio Campomanes stopped the first Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov in Moscow when Karpov led 5-3 in a race to six wins but had just lost two in a row. It probably came after pressure from Soviet officials who feared that the exhausted Karpov would collapse, even though both players said they wanted to continue. The match was replayed later in 1985, Kasparov won, but he ceased to trust Fide and in 1993 he and Nigel Short launched a breakaway organisation which split the chess world for 12 years.</p> <p>Events proved that Campomanes probably got it wrong. Now in 2020 Dvorkovich seems not to have seriously considered continuing the Candidates until its scheduled finishing date of 4 April. There were stringent medical precautions in place, and thus a good chance that the event could have been concluded normally. Dvorkovich is a former deputy prime minister of Russia, and would have been in a position to pull strings in Moscow for a request to lift the flying ban for a single chartered flight to take the players out of Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/iranian-chess-referee-who-fled-to-uk-could-face-arrest-shohreh-bayat-hijab\">Iranian chess referee who fled to UK could face arrest if  she returns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dvorkovich and Fide still plan to complete the Candidates, again in Ekaterinburg, later this year, but what if coronavirus persists for a long time? The world title match was scheduled for December 2020 at Expo Dubai, an event which now seems likely to be postponed until 2021. It would not be surprising if the conclusion of the Candidates was also to be delayed for 12 months, as all concerned still want the match to take place in Dubai.</p> <p>Teimour Radjabov qualified for the Candidates, withdrew citing virus fears, and now demands to be included if and when it continues. The Azerbaijani has many supporters, but Fide will not agree and the matter could end up in the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne.</p> <p>Carlsen, for his part, seems to be enjoying the argument: \u201cRegardless of what happens, I\u2019m not a victim. If I get to play a match that would be fun, it would be interesting, and if I get to sit on the title a bit more I\u2019m not going to complain.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3665</strong> 1 gxh5!

As Americans hunker down and stock up their larders, the wholesale price of common \u201cmidwest large\u201d eggs was triple what it was in early March. Such cost increases have already hit food banks, which are depleting their budgets as they buy more to keep up with demand.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"206c06149998d0eb5d9d97a27b5b2f19a71f9a64\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/206c06149998d0eb5d9d97a27b5b2f19a71f9a64/0_0_5000_3333/1000..jpg\" alt=\"National guard troops soldiers bag food that will be delivered to people in need at the Find food bank amid the coronavirus crisis in Indio, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">National guard troops soldiers bag food that will be delivered to people in need at the Find food bank amid the coronavirus crisis in Indio, California.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe are ramping up our purchasing, and we\u2019re buying in bulk,\u201d said Michael Altfest, at the Alameda County Food Bank, which serves parts of the East Bay region. \u201cRight now what we need is money.\u201d</p> \n<p>Distributing the food has also proved to be a challenge, as soup kitchens and free pantries across the country close down. Many of these distribution sites were based at schools, which have now been shut. \u201cOn day one of school closures, we lost access to 45 distribution sites,\u201d said Ash. Some of those schools have allowed food banks to use the grounds to set up food distribution centers. \u201cBut still, we have been scrambling to provide alternate sites and publicize the information,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Another reason for the closures is a lack of volunteers. The seniors and retirees who normally pitch in have been told to shelter at home to avoid contracting coronavirus. Corporate groups and students \u2013 who would often show up in big groups to help out \u2013 are unable to volunteer as much, with colleges shut and companies mandating that staff work from home, Ash said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus-how-to-file-what-to-expect\">What US unemployment benefits can I get during the coronavirus?

But staff at the state\u2019s largest food banks said they were worried about how they would keep up with thousands who had never needed assistance before. \u201cThe thing is we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll have this help,\u201d said Cassidie Carmen Bates at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano. \u201cAnd with that demand growing so quickly, we don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to put out food at this rate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guardsmen had helped pack the weighty box that Roxana Samayoa, 38, struggled to carry back home after stopping by the emergency distribution center in Pittsburg. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d need food like this,\u201d said Samayoa. She came to the US from El Salvador a year ago, along with her husband and three children, fleeing violence. \u201cWe were professionals there.

  "<p>With bars, nightclubs and restaurants closed to slow the spread of Covid-19, nightlife in Berlin was expected to come to a halt. But no, the beats are still thumping. The city\u2019s premier \u201cvirtual club\u201d is now in session.</p> <p><a href=\"https://en.unitedwestream.berlin/\">United We Stream</a> is a collaboration of about 40 clubs and several other nightlife businesses in Berlin. Every evening at 7pm (6pm UK time), DJ line-ups are live-streamed from the city\u2019s nightclubs. And people worldwide are tuning in to get a taste of Berlin\u2019s world-famous techno parties from their kitchens and living rooms.</p> <p>The live gigs are dropping from quintessential venues that embody the city\u2019s \u201canything goes\u201d rave culture: <a href=\"https://tresorberlin.com/\">Tresor</a>, a techno forefather founded in an abandoned former East German department store; <a href=\"https://griessmuehle.de/\">Griessmuehle</a>, in a resurrected grain mill; and <a href=\"https://sisyphos-berlin.net/\">Sisyphos</a>, a former dog food factory that became a hotspot for dusk-till-dawn open-airs.</p> <p>While there are no over-the-top costumes, sweaty high-fives between strangers or sex by the dancefloor, there are a few perks to virtual clubbing: no long queues or bouncers denying entry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The streams aren\u2019t a soundtrack for lockdown parties, but to reflect the 'critical, unbelievable and dramatic' situation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In each United We Stream set, DJs play alone, illuminated by light projections against empty dancefloors. It\u2019s a conscious decision to remind viewers that the streams aren\u2019t a soundtrack for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/fears-lockdown-parties-will-increase-global-spread-of-coronavirus\">lockdown parties</a>, but reflect how \u201ccritical, unbelievable and dramatic\u201d the situation is, says Lutz Leichsenring, press spokesperson for the Club Commission, the non-profit organisation behind the initiative.</p> <p>The Club Commission is requesting donations as it aims to raise \u20ac1m with United We Stream to support Berlin\u2019s clubs. Around \u20ac320,000 has been donated already, with the money to be distributed later by a panel, according to financial need. A Club Commission study found that around 9,000 people are employed in the nightlife sector, and that in 2018 it generated turnover of \u20ac1.48bn, with one in three tourists going to Berlin to party. Despite their success, Berlin\u2019s clubs were already facing a cocktail of challenges before the coronavirus crisis, including gentrification and speculative buying in a breakneck property market.</p> <p>In the past few months alone, Griessmuehle\u2019s location was set to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/club-closure-berlin-dance-east-west-germany-gentrification\">demolished to make way for a resort hotel</a>, and the notorious fetish venue KitKatClub was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/dec/05/berlin-notorious-fetish-club-may-be-forced-to-close\">faced with eviction</a>. At least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/germany-love-fast-cars-runs-into-berlin-radical-ravers\">four more clubs</a> could also be knocked down to make way for a motorway expansion.</p> <p>\u201cThis pandemic will be exploited to cancel contracts and close clubs,\u201d says DJ Mira, who recently played a United We Stream set for <a href=\"https://www.katerblau.de/\">KaterBlau</a>, a nightclub set in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/30/berlin-clubbers-urban-village-holzmarkt-party-city\">urban village with techno-hippy</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/30/berlin-clubbers-urban-village-holzmarkt-party-city\"> roots</a>. \u201cBerlin has more money, more people, and is built more closely together than 10 years ago. If locations disappear, culture disappears, and things won\u2019t ever be the same again.\u201d</p> <p>Pornceptual, a sex-positive party where clubbers get discounted admission for going naked, recently participated in United We Stream from <a href=\"https://alte-muenze-berlin.de/\">Alte M\u00fcnze</a>, a venue in a former mint. Co-founder Raquel Fedato praises the initiative but says it would be better if queer party collectives were included. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that the Berlin scene is united but [only] to a certain extent,\u201d she says.</p> <p>According to Leichsenring, United We Stream will keep broadcasting performances at least until 20 April, the earliest date Germany\u2019s coronavirus restrictions could be eased, but probably even longer. \u201cWe suppose that clubs will be the last to reopen,\u201d he says, \u201cso we will do the streams as long as necessary.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EllenAllien/\">Ellen Allien</a>, one of the world\u2019s most famous techno DJs and a born-and-bred Berliner, describes United We Stream as important escapism during lockdown times, mirroring how Berlin\u2019s nightlife itself also provides hedonistic R&amp;R for all.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still in the golden era [of Berlin clubs],\u201d she explains. \u201cThere are so many rules in clubs overseas that we don\u2019t have here \u2013 religion, the government, clubs having to close at 4am. Closing at 4am \u2013 that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has stalled scientific fieldwork and may even start to affect the monitoring of the climate, scientists have warned.</p> <p>Major projects to gather environmental data have been postponed or canceled over concerns that teams of researchers working together will spread the Covid-19 virus.</p> <p>The crisis has so far mainly stymied long-term studies, but concerns have been raised that routine monitoring of weather and the climate crisis may be affected if the pandemic drags on for an extended period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/26/call-isolated-britons-help-digitise-historical-rainfall-data\">Call for isolated Britons to help digitise historical rainfall data</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Petteri Taalas, secretary general of World Meteorological Organization, said: \u201cThe impacts of climate change and growing amount of weather-related disasters continue. </p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge, and may exacerbate multi-hazard risks at a single-country level. Therefore it is essential that governments pay attention to their national early warning and weather-observing capacities despite the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Wealthy countries that have deployed land- and ocean-based instruments, as well as satellites, to gauge temperature changes and other readings mostly have done so with fully or partly automated systems.</p> <p>This means that data will continue to flow without much hands-on human input but should the pandemic stretch out for many more weeks then missed repairs and replacements of instruments will become an \u201cincreasing concern\u201d, according to the WMO.</p> <p>Furthermore, in many developing countries measurements are routinely taken manually by scientists in the field and there are indications this work has dropped off.</p> <p>A huge slump in air travel since the start of the pandemic has dented the collection of ambient temperature and wind speed taken in-flight by sensors fitted to commercial airliners through an initiative called the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay program. A coalition of national weather services across Europe are discussing how to compensate for the decrease in the 700,000 climate observations normally provided per day by aircraft.</p> <p>In the US, a swath of climate research work has been called off or delayed. Nasa-led missions to survey the loss of land in the Mississippi River delta and hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico have been suspended. With all flights to and from Greenland suspended, a <a href=\"https://eastgrip.org/About.html\">project</a> to collect cores from the country\u2019s vast ice sheet has been voided for the year.</p> <p>Nasa has asked staff to work remotely where possible, with a spokesman telling the Guardian that the agency has a continuity plan to ensure that there is \u201cno interruption of climate-relevant data\u201d.</p> <p>A five-year Nasa <a href=\"https://dcotss.org/\">project</a> to study the impact of severe thunderstorms that enter the stratosphere is now mired in uncertainty. Researchers from several universities have partnered with Nasa to use its high-altitude <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-046-DFRC.html\">ER-2 aircraft</a> to take measurements this summer but this work is now on hold.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the delays we haven\u2019t started tests yet and it\u2019s not clear if we are going to be able to do that,\u201d said Kenneth Bowman, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University, who is working on the project. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know the timings, we are taking it week to week. It\u2019s always frustrating having all of your plans disrupted, not knowing when we will do what we want to do.\u201d</p> <p>Bowman said routine climate monitoring is \u201crobust\u201d and that he would be surprised if the pandemic disrupted this work unless it spooled out for many months or years.</p> <p>Gabriel Vecchi, a climate modeler at Princeton University, said while he was concerned about the impact of the pandemic on data collection he was \u201cquite heartened\u201d that observations of the Earth\u2019s surface have continued unabated so far.</p> <p>\u201cWe should all be grateful for the people and organizations that are continuing these essential forecast and monitoring operations, in spite of the severe challenges they are facing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If the pandemic lingers then climate scientists will face challenges shared by some other professions \u2013 meetings of teams will have to be reorientated, the maintenance of equipment will somehow have to be done and trips to research sites will be curtailed.</p> <p>This is occurring at a time when air pollution, as well as planet-heating gases, has declined considerably in <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/category/image-highlight/\">China</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\">Europe</a> due to a reduction in human activity.</p> <p>\u201cFor the most part these polluted areas have snuck up on people and they have become the norm and when the public realize it doesn\u2019t have to be that way, I can imagine considerable pressures to not let it go back to how it was,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, a veteran climate scientist.</p> <p>\u201cI can imagine that commuting from home may become a lot more common as we move ahead, to the advantage of the climate system and fossil fuel use, and to everyone.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>It was around 1 a.m. on Thursday when officer Jason Brown from the Albuquerque police department responded to a single gunshot on 3rd St and Central Avenue. The officer arrived to find Jon Jones seated in a black Jeep with the engine running, a near-empty bottle of mezcal on the floor behind the passenger\u2019s seat and a handgun under the driver\u2019s seat.</p> <p>According to Brown\u2019s <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jon-jones-arrest-statement-2020.pdf\">report</a>, Jones had a \u201cgreen leafy substance on his shirt and pants, consistent with marijuana\u201d and a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol coming from his facial area\u201d. He performed poorly on three field sobriety tests and his breathalyzer tests showed him \u201cat or above twice the legal limit.\u201d He was searched and <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jon-jones-arrest-statement-2020.pdf\">arrested on four different counts</a>, including aggravated DWI, negligent use of a firearm, possession of open container, and no proof of insurance in vehicle.</p> <p>This is far from the first time that the Jones has been in trouble with the law. The UFC champion was charged with a DWI in 2012 after smashing his Bentley into a utility pole in New York. Then, in April 2015, Jones was involved in a felony hit-and-run where he fled the scene after hitting a pregnant woman\u2019s car. The woman had sustained injuries from the accident, but, according to witnesses, Jones fled the scene after shoving cash in his pockets. Despite facing 18 months in jail for the felony, Jones avoided jail time and instead received 18 months of supervised probation.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Jones, his problems did not end there. While on probation for his felony charge in 2016, Jones was stopped in Albuquerque and given five tickets, including one for drag racing. The well-documented incident was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6yFu5ZD32c\">captured on body cam footage</a>.</p> <p>Then, in October 2019, Jones took a <a href=\"https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/10/ufc-jon-jones-plea-deal-in-strip-club-case-new-mexico\">plea deal</a> after pleading no contest to disorderly conduct in an incident with a cocktail waitress at a strip club. He had originally pleaded not guilty to a charge of battery after <a href=\"https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ufc-jon-jones-police-report-strip-club-incident-redacted.jpg\">being accused</a> of kissing and choking the waitress before slapping her in the genital region.</p> <p>Beyond his string of arrests and concerning legal incidents, Jones has also failed two separate drug tests administered by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which facilitates testing for the UFC. He was suspended on both occasions.</p> <p>However, Jones\u2019s latest incident raises some concerning alarms regarding the UFC champion\u2019s mental health. In the body cam footage distributed by the Bernalillo County district attorney, Jones appeared to be distraught and revealed that he was \u201cscared for his family\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have anxiety. I have anxiety,\u201d Jones repeated while the officer appeared to cuff him. \u201cWould you guys just allow me to take off my hoodie? Please?\u2026Please, please, because my anxiety gets so bad\u2026\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aIZXI5vfsM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6aIZXI5vfsM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The candid footage allows viewers a peak behind the curtain at Jones distressed state, his apparent intoxication, and some of the underlying familial and mental health issues that may be plaguing him. It is also the latest example of Jones\u2019s downward trajectory \u2013 a spiral that encapsulates every aspect of his life outside of the UFC octagon, where he remains champion.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Jones pleaded guilty to a DWI and will avoid jail time as long as he follows the terms of a plea agreement. According to the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/ufc/story/_/id/28978665/jon-jones-agrees-plea-deal-dwi-charge-new-mexico\">agreement</a>, Jones will serve 96 consecutive hours in a county Community Custody Program, complete 48 hours of community service, pay a $500 fine, and will remain on supervised probation for a year. He will also wear an ankle bracelet that will track his movements. All the other charges against him, including negligent use of a firearm and possession of an open container of alcohol, were dropped.</p> <p>Afterwards, Jones released a public<a href=\"https://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/1245122692560420869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https://www.sportbible.com/ufc/mma-news-jon-jones-makes-emotional-first-statement-following-last-weeks-arrest-20200401\"> statement</a>, where he admitted to an \u201cunhealthy relationship with alcohol\u201d:</p> <p>\u201cWhile we all work to understand and cope with stress and uncertainties surrounding the current state of our world, I want to express how truly disappointed I am that I have become the source of a negative headline again, especially during these trying times,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI am disappointed for letting down the people I care about the most - my family, friends and my fans. This morning I entered into a plea deal with the Albuquerque DA\u2019s office. I accept full responsibility for my actions, and I know that I have some personal work to do to which involves the unhealthy relationship I have with alcohol.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Jones\u2019s admission and the concerning footage, it remains unclear whether Jones will receive the help he needs from either the legal system or the organization that employs him. While <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/26/21195774/most-stupid-athlete-ever-fighters-react-to-jon-jones-dwi-and-negligent-use-of-firearm-charges\">several fighters have openly criticized and mocked Jones</a> following his latest run-in with the law, the champion\u2019s bitter rival, Daniel Cormier, did not see this as a cause for celebration, instead imploring the UFC to get involved to help Jones.</p> <p>\u201cI think the UFC needs to save him,\u201d Cormier told <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28972781/daniel-cormier-ufc-needs-take-measures-help-jon-jones\">ESPN</a>. \u201cKeep him, but then really try to help him try to get better.\u201d</p> <p>While the UFC has stripped Jones of his light heavyweight title in the past, it was not always due to his legal troubles. Jones was first stripped of the title in 2015 following the felony hit-and-run charge. Then, in 2016, Jones was stripped of the interim title after failing a pre-fight drug test in connection with his title unification bout scheduled for UFC 200. In September 2017, Jones was stripped for a third time after he tested positive for the banned steroid turinabol.</p> <p>When Jones was stripped of the interim title in 2016, UFC president Dana White revealed that he would \u201cnever take the risk of headlining a show with Jon Jones again\u201d. Since then, Jones has headlined five separate events, including as recently as UFC 247 in February 2020. Given how quickly White reconsidered his ruling on Jones, and the UFC limited action with regards to Jones\u2019s legal trouble, it is unlikely that the promotion will take any action against the UFC champion for his latest infraction.</p> <p>It is evidently clear that the 32-year-old fighter is in need of help for his potential mental health issues and substance abuse. And while the NHL has a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarBombBoom13/status/1051910130898329601?s=20\">player assistance program</a> and the NFL has an <a href=\"https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/PDFs/Agents/2016SOAPolicy_v2.pdf\">intervention program</a>, the UFC does not appear to have such a program in place. Yet given that the greatest fighter in a generation is in dire need of some serious help, it might be time for the UFC to implement such a program.</p>",

Reports to the contrary are completely false.\u201d</p> \n<p>Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau described such reports as \u201cconcerning and asked officials to look into similar claims that masks were being diverted away from his country.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to make sure that equipment that is destined for Canada gets to and stays in Canada, and I\u2019ve asked ministers to follow up on these particular reports,\u201d he said on Thursday.</p> \n<p>At a press conference in Brazil on Wednesday, the health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, said recent attempts by Bras\u00edlia to purchase protection gear such as gloves and masks from China had fallen through.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday the US sent 23 of their biggest cargo planes to China to pick up the material they had acquired. Many of our purchases, which we had hoped to confirm in order to supply [our health system], fell through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole world wants [these things] too. There is a problem of hyper-demand.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mandetta asked ordinary Brazilians to make themselves homemade masks from pieces of cloth so that health professionals could have the remaining professional equipment.</p> \n<p>As the pandemic worsens, panicked governments have been accused of using questionable methods to acquire supplies in the battle against the coronavirus. Tactics have ranged from blocking exports of medical supplies to sending spies on clandestine missions to find tests.</p> \n<p>Fearing shortages and a strain on their health systems, a number of states, including France, Germany and Russia, have taken measures such as stockpiling masks and hazardous materials, or hazmat suits.

In Italy, it took more than two weeks following a phone call from the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for the masks to be released. In Belgium, supplies had still not been delivered despite a formal police complaint from the country\u2019s health ministry. <br><br> Turkey has also threatened to commandeer domestic mask producers to make sure they are provided only to the state.

It has, however, since been one of the few countries to go the other way, selling or donating millions of masks to Europe. One such shipment bound for Italy went through the Czech Republic, where it was seized by authorities under disputed circumstances.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-world-map-countries-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Czech authorities denied allegations of state-backed stealing by Giornale Radio Rai, the radio news arm of Italy\u2019s public broadcasting company, RAI.

  "<p>David Farrier\u2019s idea in this book is to try and imagine our present moment of climate and ecological crisis from a far-distant future. What fossil traces will post-industrial human civilisation leave behind for the future to find? Roads and vast cities, long abandoned and forgotten, will show up as layers in the geological strata; our buried radioactive waste will still be deadly; our throwaway plastic will persist until eventually \u201cover the coming millennia, hydrocarbons leach from the fossil plastic, accumulating in small deposits and setting in motion a slow chemical return\u201d to its origins as oil. Future archaeologists may comment on the dreary sameness of our collective biomass: almost all of it <em>Homo sapiens</em>, along with the few species we like to eat. Which future archaeologists would those be, by the way? Sometimes Farrier is addressing human generations to come; at other times he\u2019s thinking on timescales longer than any species is likely to last, let alone ours with its over-sophistication and bad habits. One microbiologist fantasises that some day a \u201ccommune of evolved bees\u201d will encourage bee-scientists to study the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\" title=\"\">Anthropocene</a> as \u201ca warning for all hive-kind\u201d.</p> <p>The transience of what appears indestructible has been a rich theme in poetry and story. The mists shift on a bleak hillside in Kurosawa\u2019s <em>Throne of Blood</em>, where bloody Cobweb Castle is visible, now vanished and forgotten; Saxons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jul/03/poster-poems-ruins\" title=\"\">write poems</a> about stumbling on the ruins of Roman Aquae Sulis; Batman chases villains round the fallen grandeur of Gotham City. Farrier\u2019s argument is nuanced slightly differently, channelling our contemporary angst. It\u2019s not only that our way of life is transient. Our heedless interventions in the life of the planet \u2013 herding, ploughing, planting, building, mining, smelting, processing, communicating \u2013 have degraded its complexity and beauty in ways that will long outlast us, leaving their ineradicable taint. \u201cWe live in the shadow of an eclipse that will endure perhaps as many as ten million years before sound, shape and colour return in full to the land and the oceans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An uninitiated eye can only glide over Farrier\u2019s summaries, adding them on to the mounting heap of glum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The climate and ecological crisis hurts us: and not only materially, physically. It hurts in the imagination, in the stories we tell. An idea of nature\u2019s boundlessness, the recurring seasons, the ocean\u2019s endless renewal \u2013 vaster than we are and cruelly, consolingly indifferent to us \u2013 has salved our private and public despairs, perhaps often almost unconsciously, through plagues and floods and wars, tragic ending after tragic ending. I remember the happiness I felt when we were shown black and white slides, in school, of the equatorial forest \u2013 much too long ago for any warning that it was threatened. My happiness didn\u2019t make me want to go there; I just needed it to be there. Nature holds together our sense of being, organically, at the root; and it\u2019s therefore in the roots of our language. We didn\u2019t know how fundamental our trust was in \u201cthe treasure of nature\u2019s germens\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s Macbeth invoking chaos \u2013 until news came that the treasure after all couldn\u2019t be counted on.</p> <p>And therefore the language and style in which we address the crisis are all-important. Obviously there\u2019s a first responsibility for the words to produce effects: an urgent need to change minds, change governance, change practices. And then alongside that there\u2019s the other responsibility that words have: to put up their supple resistance to stupidity and ugliness and evil, so that our consciousness of what\u2019s at hand has form, and we can bear it. There\u2019s a fascinating chapter in Farrier\u2019s book on two contrasting approaches to burying nuclear waste. How can we warn the far future not to dig where we\u2019ve put it, when we know that the future won\u2019t understand our language?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b019deec76055d2abb759e68a2555c1dd123f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b019deec76055d2abb759e68a2555c1dd123f6/0_276_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olkiluoto nuclear power plant \u2026 the world\u2019s first underground repository for highly radioactive nuclear waste, on the island of Eurajoki, western Finland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olkiluoto nuclear power plant \u2026 the world\u2019s first underground repository for highly radioactive nuclear waste, on the island of Eurajoki, western Finland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Kingsley/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Near Carlsbad, New Mexico, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant has devised a scheme that sounds like a computer game: \u201cFive levels of warning messages, rising in complexity, and a mix of monoliths, buried clues and archives \u2026 accompanied by faces of disgust and repulsion, modelled on Edvard Munch\u2019s <em>The Scream</em> \u2026 A thirty foot earthen berm, studded with magnets and radar reflectors to signal an anomaly, will enclose the inner ring of granite markers.\u201d In Finland meanwhile, they\u2019ve decided that \u201cgiven the long lifespan\u201d of their nuclear waste repository on Olkiluoto island \u2013 it will probably be buried at some point under another ice age \u2013 \u201cit would be foolish to try to mark it\u201d. They will \u201cbury the waste in specially designed copper canisters; backfill the hole; and retreat, without leaving a single trace aboveground\u201d; it\u2019s meant to be forgotten. This difference, too, feels like a choice about language; it\u2019s aesthetic as well as practical. Only one of those options is in good taste.</p> <p>Farrier\u2019s book is full of fascinating things, yet doesn\u2019t in its totality work for me. Its central conceit, to begin with \u2013 that idea of viewing, in some unimaginably distant future, the fossils left behind by our Anthropocene \u2013 feels strained because such a future is indeed impossible to imagine. The very terms of our love for our planet will no doubt turn out in deep time to be so much stardust \u2013 or carbon, or whatever; we can\u2019t begin to know in what ways our depredations might matter, on the timescale proposed here. No doubt Farrier wants the future-fossil idea to work as a rhetorical device, reminding us of the sheer size of our disaster now; but the harder he works to conjure the geological scale of the problem, the more tempting it is for his language to become vatic and sententious. \u201cFragments of artificial glass will be glazed with cataracts, like glaucomatous eyes staring blindly into the dark.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/30/best-science-nature-and-ideas-books-of-2019\">Best science, nature and ideas books of 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farrier\u2019s a literary critic and not a scientist, and the book is intended for a lay readership; but there just isn\u2019t room here to begin to lay out the complexities of these diverse scientific disciplines.

Each \u201cecosystem in the ocean\u201d, she writes, \u201chas its own unique characteristics, with distinctive vulnerabilities, threats, and resiliences\u201d. A reader can\u2019t conceivably do justice to the chunks of science in <em>Footprints</em>: the account of lateral gene-swap transfer, for instance, or palaeoclimatologists\u2019 varying theses of the rhythms of ice ages.

We have to hope to turn this stinking, filthy tanker of our civilisation around: do something globally, for the first time ever, for our collective good. Not easy. And things won\u2019t ever all be all right again anyway, or all pristine, even at the best \u2013 they never were. Nature itself isn\u2019t pristine, that\u2019s a fallacy that belongs with the dream of original sin.

  "<p>When the overcrowded, long-distance bus from Johannesburg arrived at the Malawian border post of Mwanza last week, one passenger was dead. Fearing he had picked up Covid-19 in South Africa and infected all his fellow travellers, the guards sent everyone to a hastily built quarantine centre for 14 days.</p> <p>The man had died of other causes but Malawi, which is well used to devastating diseases like HIV and Aids, cholera and malaria, is taking no chances. Along with S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Comoros, South Sudan and Burundi in Africa, it is one of the last <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200329-sitrep-69-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=8d6620fa_4\">countries in the world</a> not to have confirmed a single Covid-19 case yet.</p> <p>In Malawi only 20 people a day can be tested for the virus, and there are just 25 intensive care unit beds and seven ventilators in the country of more than 18 million people. Since February, however, the government has been racing to curb Covid\u2019s arrival.</p> <p>It has wheeled out a \u00a324m preparedness plan, suspended international flights, banned weddings and gatherings of more than 100 people, closed schools and universities, and is making anyone arriving from Europe, China, or the US self-isolate. According to the ministry of health, 4,603 people who have entered the country in the past few weeks are \u201cunder surveillance\u201d.</p> <p>As an extra precaution, Malawi\u2019s president, Peter Mutharika, has reduced the number of people he meets to 10-20 a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have been told to regularly wash hands using soap or alcohol sanitiser.

Many people don\u2019t even have soap or running water and are already weakened with malaria, HIV or tuberculosis.</p> <p>Malawi has plenty of experience of handling contagious diseases but is barely prepared for a disease that can spread so fast, says Oxfam\u2019s international head of inequality policy, Max Lawson, a former resident of Malawi who is now based in Nairobi.</p> <p>\u201cIf Covid-19 gets in, it will spread rapidly across the country and many people will die. The health system is very weak and poorly resourced. The population is young, which may be in Malawi\u2019s favour with a disease like Covid-19, but there is a lot of untested TB and HIV in the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK government and other donors have not been supporting Malawi like they used to. They should immediately suspend the country\u2019s debt payments. It would cost very little and help a lot. As it is, Malawi will be hit very badly economically by Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>Health professionals fear it is only a matter of time before the pandemic reaches Malawi. \u201cIt has only been in the past few weeks that it has been spreading across Africa.

  "<p>Before the lockdown, I went to see a friend who lives a few miles away in south London. I cycled from Nunhead to her home in Blackheath. On the way I passed a tense crowd of people being forced to wait to get into the Iceland store in New Cross. I reached my friend\u2019s block of flats, climbed the stairs to her front door and laid my satchel on the doormat. She opened the door, greeted me from a distance of a couple of yards, removed the groceries she\u2019d asked me to bring, some salmon and a bottle of olive oil, and put them away. We chatted for about half an hour, me sitting on a step out in the hall, her standing in the doorway, neither of us getting closer than two yards. Her husband, whose mild cough a couple of days earlier had triggered her self-isolation, was a disembodied voice offstage. My friend and I always kiss hello and goodbye; we\u2019ve known each other for 10 years. Not this time. I went back to Nunhead, to queue for more food for my family \u2013 the butcher, the fishmonger and the greengrocer all had queues outside \u2013 then went home and washed my hands.</p> <p>It\u2019s the small necessary tasks that get you through the abnormality: the assignments, the missions, the good deeds. They break down the fearfulness and strangeness of the greater emergency into smaller, more manageable chunks of personal time where we can see what we have to do and see, just as importantly, that we can actually do it. The more we have to confront the enormity of the changes around us, and our own individual powerlessness to alter the tide of events, the more likely we are to break down or be paralysed. The merciful paradox of crises like these is to bring so many new chores and duties that the difficulties \u2013 sometimes the novelties \u2013 of solving each step helps occupy the part of our brain that yearns to know what\u2019s going on and do something about it.</p> <p>Large, terrifying realities like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-in-your-area\">growing death toll</a> from an incurable infectious disease, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/16/recession-markets-tumble-fed-emergency-rate-cut-coronavirus-ftse-dow-iag-flutter-business-live\">collapse of the world economy</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-what-is-self-isolation-quarantine\">sundering of all natural intimacy with wider family and friends</a> \u2013 the fact nobody has any idea what happens next \u2013 take second place to immediate tasks. How can S and I entertain our four-year-old today? Do we have enough milk? How can my siblings and I help our parents in Scotland, who are in their 80s, if we can\u2019t go to them? Am I two metres away from that guy? How much salmon is appropriate for a care package? Can I cycle up this steep hill to Blackheath, or should I get off and walk?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I spent a couple of years in a world where the only way you could get petrol was by buying it illegally from a taxi driver\u2019s official ration</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the past I saw the saving power of urgent personal tasks when I went to wars to write about them. It was quite frightening to head to a place where a war was: not knowing how you were going to be able to do your job in an unknown situation, the possibility of being detained and the (very remote) chance of being hurt. But I found that the closer I got to where war was, the less frightening it became. It broke down into a series of tiny surmountable personal tasks, surmountable, invariably, with the help of kind strangers as well as cash. Getting transport, the right ID, food, somewhere to sleep, finding people to interview, trying to talk your way past checkpoints, working out how, in a pre-mobile, pre-internet world, to communicate with home: seeing these problems and being obliged to overcome them created a set of stepping stones through chaos.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t always work out. If it\u2019s impossible to win those small personal battles \u2013 because you\u2019ve pulled a 14-hour hospital shift and there\u2019s no food in the supermarket, or you haven\u2019t got any money, or you\u2019re a single mother with a young child and you\u2019ve just fallen sick, or you missed the NHS-111 callback you waited all day for, or because the struggles you overcome are in your job and your job has disappeared \u2013 the anxiety about the bigger picture rushes back into the empty space left by a task undone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31f607c3bda4b239aad4501ab00426ffaed635a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31f607c3bda4b239aad4501ab00426ffaed635a2/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grozny after the Russian bombardment in the late 1990s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grozny after the Russian bombardment in the late 1990s</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Bouvet/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or you may find yourself dragged by the need to feel a personal win to more extravagant projects. Early in the series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/12/russia.chechnya\">wars that wracked Chechnya</a> as it tried to secede from Russia I came across an army of volunteers, drawn from the cohort of middle-aged, working class, ethnically Russian and Ukrainian women who did much of the municipal manual labour in late Soviet times. They were attempting to rebuild, pretty much by hand, the railway station in the centre of the Chechen capital Grozny, using the bricks from the shell-demolished rubble of the old one. I suspect they probably knew in their hearts that their work wouldn\u2019t stand \u2013 as it turned out, the worst of the shelling of their city still lay in the future \u2013 but that was why the sight of their self-consciously cheerful labour was so moving: they toiled feverishly in the moment to smother their misgivings about the future.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mean to sound confident in my knowledge of how to get through this. The day of my salmon run to Blackheath was also the day I realised my experience wasn\u2019t worth so much. I lived in Soviet Kiev when the USSR fell apart. I know first-hand about shortages and hoarding, hyperinflation and the black market. I spent a couple of years in a world where the only way you could get petrol was by buying it illegally from a taxi driver\u2019s official ration. I was once given a brick-sized bundle of banknotes tied up with string as small change for a bottle of wine. I queued for bread. I queued for half an hour for what certainly seemed like the only hard cheese left in the city, then saw the last kilogram bought by the woman in front of me. I\u2019ve also spent much of the past six years writing a novel set in England during the first onset of the plague in 1348.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A hefty minority of citizens have the ability to switch from Gardeners\u2019 Question Time persona to protagonist of The Road</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet there I was, in Britain in 2020, realising that my fellow citizens, many of whom have never been to a country in breakdown or been interested in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/29/black-death-not-spread-rat-fleas-london-plague\">Black Death</a>, absolutely had the jump on me in terms of hoarding \u2013 in the sense that every online outlet in the country had long since sold out of paracetemol, small freezers and cheap webcams. Experience and common sense tell me that panic-buying is a mistake. But if my experience had been that of a participant in a crisis, rather than a witness who always had the option of going back to a safe and normal country, it might have offered an alternative piece of wisdom: don\u2019t be the last one to panic.</p> <p>If you\u2019d asked me a few months ago, I would have speculated that the people of Britain weren\u2019t ready for a global health emergency. The evidence now is of a more nuanced truth: that a significant number of people aren\u2019t surprised when everything falls apart. Even if they\u2019ve never known quite how it would go down, they\u2019ve been expecting it, and the reaction is not to take comfort in the achievement of small, practical, immediate steps for daily life but to act as if the only two possible states for society to exist in are normality, and the apocalypse. I feel sure now that a hefty minority of my fellow citizens harbour the innate ability to switch from <em>Gardeners\u2019 Question Time</em> persona to protagonist of <em>The Road</em> in the blink of an eye \u2013 and, what is more disturbing, back again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"667e9815b409dab6c81c1de349e07a1cb81e3633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/667e9815b409dab6c81c1de349e07a1cb81e3633/0_65_2994_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Praying for relief from the Black Death.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Praying for relief from the Black Death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The boundary between the normal and the abnormal, between the states of social security and social breakdown, is elusive. Usually to arrive in the middle of somebody else\u2019s war or disaster as a foreigner is to be dropped into a kind of mirror image of a \u201cnormal\u201d country, where a massacre or the violent destruction of a building is a shocking event. In a country at war, or facing utter economic ruin, the sight of smartly dressed young people going off to work in an office, or a new building being built, is as shocking as an explosion. What you tend to miss, as an outsider, is the moment of transition from one state to another \u2013 when a normal country with occasional outbreaks of emergency shifts to being a crisis country with occasional outbreaks of peace and pleasantness.</p> <p>Once in Grozny at the end of 1994 I experienced this transition as a visitor. On the first day, the separatist-held city, surrounded as it was by Russian troops, still turned its face to the world of civilisation, in the sense that when the Russians bombarded an oil installation, the city authorities sent a fire engine, pointlessly, to tackle the flames, as if earnest civilian effort could enclose chaos and make it disappear. The next day, the Russians attacked, and regardless of the detail of what happened afterwards, the mood of the city changed. Its civilian character shrivelled. It seemed to me that when I walked across the main square in the morning there were still a few civilians trying to go about their business but that when I walked back a few hours later the passersby were all soldiers. The peace of the city, its civic spirit, had drowned. The only sound between the gunfire was the crackle of burning roof timbers and broken glass underfoot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/15/gender.uk\">Dispatches from a savage war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I feel in the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve lived through a similar transition as a native, but without the obvious physical destruction \u2013 a different kind of abnormality. I\u2019ve never been in an epidemic before and yet I find myself dogged by a kind of false memory of one. When I set out to write a novel set in a time of plague, unable, as I thought, to visit an infected England, I thought I would at least make, on foot, the journey my characters made, from the Cotswolds to Weymouth, where the Black Death first made landfall. I walked the route at the time of year the plague arrived, in July, and the summer of 2013 was hot and sunny. I imagined my characters disbelieving that the pestilence could be rife in such a fair green land of larksong, downs and flowers. For all the memories of wars this is the memory, the memory of an imagined thought from an epidemic six centuries ago, that comes to my mind on these days of brilliant blue plane-free skies, when the apple, cherry and magnolia blossom is so lush on the trees of London and the gutters are filled with pink petals: how can so many people be suffering when the world looks so fine and peaceful? But in the present I can\u2019t keep my thumb off the phone for long. And I don\u2019t know whether there are more ambulances or I simply notice them more: I hear sirens. I remember that people are suffering, and normal has gone away.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/12/to-calais-in-ordinary-time-by-james-meek-review\">To Calais, in Ordinary Time</a> by James Meek is published by Canongate.</em></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Josh Taylor bringing you the main stories on Friday 3 April.</p> <h2>Single-digit growth rate continues</h2> <p>The rate of the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus has continued to slow in single digits, passing over 5,300 confirmed cases in Australia on Friday.</p> <p>Two more deaths were recorded in Victoria and New South Wales.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, said he was \u201cquietly pleased\u201d with the numbers slowing, but community transmissions had been growing. There are now 300 community transmission cases in Sydney, 60 in Melbourne and 30 in Brisbane.</p> <h2>National cabinet moves to \u2018suppression\u2019 phase</h2> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the national cabinet is moving from a phase of reacting to slow the spread of the virus to reviewing the measures put in place around restrictions and support. Morrison said if the rate had continued as it was a few weeks ago there would now be 10,000 cases, almost twice the current number.</p> <p>Morrison said after this phase, the national cabinet would move into a recovery phase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Commercial tenancy agreement delayed</h2> <p>The national cabinet has yet to agree to an industry code of practice between businesses and their landlords. The mandatory code would potentially require landlords whose tenants have a turnover of less than $50m and are participating in the jobkeeper program to waive rent in proportion to the loss of turnover for that business.</p> <p>Morrison said how that works will be negotiated between the tenant and the landlord.</p> <p>For residential tenancies, Morrison said there was a moratorium (which some have argued is not legally enforceable) on evictions, but he said that didn\u2019t mean there was a moratorium on rent. He said state and territory treasurers were still working on policies on residential rents.</p> <h2>Modelling to be released</h2> <p>Morrison announced modelling for how many cases and deaths Australia is expected to see from coronavirus will be released by the government next week after more work, and review by the national cabinet.</p> <p>There will also be a national dashboard of coronavirus data pooled from all the states and territories updated every afternoon. It is expected it will be available in the next few days.</p> <h2>Regional workers</h2> <p>Anyone on a working visa wishing to go work in a regional area where there is work will need to register with the government as self-isolating, and remain in isolation for 14 days before they\u2019re allowed to travel to regional areas.</p> <p>Local government workers are also not eligible for the jobkeeper program, as they are the responsibility of the states and territories.</p> <h2>NSW cruise ship stand-off ends</h2> <p>The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, announced that two Carnival ships that had been off the coast of the state had departed overnight, and another five Royal Caribbean ships would be leaving for their port of origin after refuelling and restocking on the weekend.</p> <p>A man was removed from the now-infamous Ruby Princess overnight for medical treatment. There are still six cruise ships off the coast of NSW, and 19 across Australia.</p> <h2>Asic warns real estate agents over super advice</h2> <p>The financial regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australian-real-estate-agents-face-fines-and-jail-if-tenants-told-to-use-super-to-pay-rent\">has told real estate agent institutes</a> in a letter to advise agents not to suggest renters in financial hardship use the up to $20,000 people can access from superannuation in order to pay their rent. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has warned such advice would be in breach of the Corporations Act, and those in violation of the law could face fines of up to $1.6m for companies, or five years jail for individuals.</p> <h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/01/when-is-it-legal-to-leave-your-home\">Full Story podcast: when is it legal to leave your home?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Cases climb above 1 million as deaths pass 51,000</h2> <p>There are now more than 1,002,000 confirmed cases worldwide and more than 51,400 deaths. In the UK, there are more than 34,000 cases, after a sharp rise in the number confirmed cases on Thursday and more than 2,900 deaths. The US, which has the largest number of cases of any country, has more than 236,000 confirmed cases and more than 5,600 deaths.</p> <h2>Wuhan residents told to stay inside and be vigilant</h2> <p>Residents of Wuhan have been warned to stay indoors and strengthen protection measures, a few days before travel restrictions on the city at the centre of the pandemic are scheduled to be lifted. The city\u2019s top official urged vigilance as authorities sought to ward off a second wave of infection from incoming travellers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/china-gets-mixed-results-in-its-attempt-to-lift-lockdown\">while also easing some of its stringent containment measures</a>.</p> <h2>China to hold national day of mourning on Saturday</h2> <p>China will hold a national day of mourning on Saturday for \u201cmartyrs\u201d who died in the fight against the epidemic, the official Xinhua news agency says. Three minutes of silence will be observed at 10am across the country \u201cwhile air raid sirens and horns of automobiles, trains and ships will wail in grief\u201d, the news agency Xinhua said. China has reported a total of 81,589 confirmed cases, which exclude asymptomatic patients, and 3,318 deaths from the outbreak.</p> <h2>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer says global cases could be \u2018five-to-10 times higher\u2019 than reported</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, has said worldwide cases of Covid-19 could be \u201cfive to 10 times\u201d higher than the 1 million currently recorded. Murphy says the only numbers he has total faith in are the Australian numbers, because \u201cwe have the highest testing rate in the world\u201d.</p> <h2>WHO warns of a \u2018worrying spike\u2019 in cases and deaths in Middle East</h2> <p>Governments in the Middle East need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.</p> <h2>International airline seat capacity drops 80% from a year ago</h2> <p>International seat capacity has dropped by almost 80% from a year ago and half the world\u2019s airplanes are in storage, data shows, suggesting the aviation industry may take years to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>Heathrow to close one runway due to drop in air traffic</h2> <p>In related news, London\u2019s Heathrow airport has said it will close one of its runways from Monday because of a fall in traffic. The airport has two runways and will alternate which one they keep open on a weekly basis, a spokesman said.</p> <h2>Virus-stricken cruise liners docks in Florida</h2> <p>The Zaandam cruise liner, on which four people have died, has docked in Fort Lauderdale, after previously being denied entry. Dozens of other passengers are sick with flu-like symptoms on the vessels. Earlier this week, the ship offloaded its healthy passengers onto its sister ship, the Rotterdam, which has also been given permission to dock in Florida\u2019s Port Everglades.</p>",

Although this started before the pandemic, environmental groups fear the trend will accelerate because the crisis has pushed up the price of gold and the economic downturn that is forecast to follow will push more people to seek another source of income.</p> <p>Tensions over land and natural resources have been rising for some time, sometimes leading to murderous violence.

A global economic downturn will probably suppress demand for meat, timber, minerals, soy and other Amazon produce, which could ease pressure on the forest.</p> <p>But this will be countered by the likely domestic recession in Brazil, which could drive more poor people to clear land for subsistence cultivation.</p> <p>The health risks of such invasions are also enormous.

They have put out an appeal for extra food and medical assistance, and decried the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, which they say has made a bad situation worse.</p> <p>Although the government has imposed restrictions on visitors to indigenous territory due to health concerns, this could work to the benefit of criminals, said Antonio Oviedo, monitoring coordinator of Brazil\u2019s biggest environmental NGO, Instituto Socioambiental.</p> <p>\u201cThere are rules forbidding entry into indigenous lands and conservation areas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut land grabbers, illegal loggers and illegal miners do not follow the rules.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>What Mar\u00eda would most like to do at the end of each long day\u2019s siege at the care home where she works is yield to the small source of comfort she has denied herself for almost a month now.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hug my children, but I\u2019m so scared that I haven\u2019t done that for three weeks,\u201d says Mar\u00eda, who asked to use a pseudonym. \u201cI haven\u2019t been tested \u2013 so I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m positive.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of stopping for a hug when she gets home, Mar\u00eda leaves her shoes by the door, heads for the shower, and then makes sure her face mask remains in place at all times.</p> <p>The self-imposed strictures are painful but necessary. Health authorities across the country are scrambling to disinfect Spain\u2019s care homes, which have become one of the frontlines of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/covid-19-workers-in-spain-you-can-feel-the-fear-in-the-air\">the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis</a>. To date, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people in Spain and claimed more than 10,000 lives.</p> <p>By Mar\u00eda\u2019s reckoning, 50 residents of the home near Madrid where she works have died in the past three weeks, while around 90 others are isolated in empty rooms.</p> <p>\u201cAll the tests on residents have come back positive so far,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the doctor says how many tests were coming back positive, she said, \u2018My God! It\u2019s already too late to do something about this. We\u2019re probably all positive already.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Mar\u00eda and her colleagues have yet to be tested \u2013 or properly equipped as they wash, dress, feed and take their charges to the bathroom.</p> <p>Masks have been provided, but they are having to improvise gowns out of rubbish bags. According to the CSIF public workers\u2019 union, <a href=\"https://www.csif.es/contenido/comunidad-de-madrid/general/293178\">two care home workers have died from the virus in the Madrid region and another 400 have become infected</a>. Across Spain, health workers make up around 14% of all coronavirus cases.</p> <p>Madrid\u2019s regional government activated an emergency plan to deal with the situation on 26 March and has been sending health workers, civil protection staff and firefighters to assess and deal with the situation in each of the area\u2019s 470 care facilities. By Friday this week, emergency teams had visited 100 of them, according to a spokesman.</p> <p>On Thursday, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, president of the Madrid region, said \u201caround 3,000\u201d people had died of various causes in the region\u2019s old people\u2019s homes during March. A week earlier, her administration said that 1,065 Madrid care home residents had died over the first three weeks of March. The disparity suggests a huge surge in fatalities in the past few days.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard being there and knowing there\u2019s nothing you can do and that they\u2019re dying, one after another,\u201d says Mar\u00eda. \u201cYou do what you can, but staff are getting sick and the home is running with a minimum of people.\u201d</p> <p>While staff try to muddle through, residents sit in isolation, some lucky enough to have mobile phones to speak to their families, some not. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck in their rooms, where they have to eat.

Until recently, the worst situations he had found himself in were trying to stop forest fires in their tracks and dealing with violent gangs of mushroom hunters.</p> <p>For the past fortnight, however, he and a crew of fellow rangers and other volunteers have been working to disinfect care homes across the region of Soria, 230km northeast of Madrid.</p> <p>They, at least, have good kit: suits, gloves, face masks, goggles, hoods, rubber boots, and a backpack for the spray.</p> <p>\u201cWe try to be quite jolly when we go into a home,\u201d says Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda. \u201cWe say hello to everybody because it\u2019s pretty odd for the old people to see us dressed like that \u2013 they\u2019ve only seen the gear in movies and information films.\u201d</p> <p>The 50-year-old ranger has told his girlfriend about his volunteering duties, but not his parents \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want them to know and to worry\u201d.</p> <p>Still, says Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda, the work of recent days has been an education; the fear he felt at first has been replaced by action and a sense of purpose.</p> <p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a bit like fighting a fire: if you\u2019re not used to it, you worry because you\u2019re trying to figure out how to deal with something you\u2019ve never dealt with before.

We worked in Spain during the migration crisis, but not on internal stuff.\u201d</p> <p>He doubts that any health system in the world would have had the capacity to cope with the pandemic, adding that Europe and other parts of the developed world haven\u2019t seen a crisis on this scale since the second world war or the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918.</p> <p>\u201cThat means we\u2019ve had generations who have grown up free and healthy and seen life expectancy rising each year,\u201d he says. \u201cSo now, it\u2019s \u2018Wow!

I was so tired and fed up that I came home and said, \u2018That\u2019s it. I need to take a few days off to rest and recover.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her teenage daughter had other ideas. She looked squarely at her mother and said: \u201cIf those grannies and grandfathers are going to die, they\u2019re going to die. But if you don\u2019t go, it\u2019ll be worse for them. You need to go and do whatever you can.\u201d</p> <p>The pep talk worked and Mar\u00eda is determined to hold on as best she can for as long as she can. After all, she and her dwindling band of colleagues are all the human contact that many residents have as they endure weeks of confinement, isolation, or worse.</p> <p>\u201cThe other day, one of the grannies, who hadn\u2019t seen her daughter for a fortnight, wanted to give me a hug and a kiss,\u201d says Mar\u00eda.</p> <p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t because we\u2019re not allowed.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dua-lipa\">Dua Lipa</a> knew two things before starting the follow-up to her massive self-titled 2017 debut: she would call it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review\">Future Nostalgia</a>, and it would be \u201can album that was really fun and made me wanna dance and removed the outside world\u201d, she says. Few albums have fulfilled their intended purpose faster. Future Nostalgia was meant to arrive today, until an online leak brought it forward to the first Friday of Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Lipa wasn\u2019t sure it felt right to release it during the pandemic, but accurately concluded that her brilliant disco-wreathed anthems-in-waiting \u2013 the kind that transform kitchen tiles into a makeshift Studio 54 \u2013 might distract fans from the news.</p> <p>At the very least, a day of radio interviews and unceasing congrats stopped the 24-year-old from stressing about when to take her government-sanctioned daily walk. We FaceTime in the early evening of Future Nostalgia\u2019s premature birthday, Lipa at ease in a Christopher Kane \u201cTechno Sexual\u201d jumper, modish straw-on-tarmac hair tied up, saucer eyes unadorned. Like everyone, she has been self-isolating, eating chips and watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/a-zoologists-view-of-tiger-king-a-crass-expose-that-could-do-some-good\">Tiger King</a>. Unlike everyone, she is doing it in a plush Airbnb (her London flat flooded) with her model boyfriend <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fashion/article/dua-lipa-anwar-hadid-couple-dressing\">Anwar Hadid</a> (brother of models Gigi and Bella). Later, she will be conference-calling friends and family to \u201cdrink and dance through the phone\u201d.</p> <p>Although Lipa says today has felt like Christmas, it is still an anticlimactic arrival for an album that the British music industry has been banking on. Hers is the rare homegrown success not belonging to anyone named Sheeran or Adele, born from no-nonsense mega-pop in the vein of Britney and her idol Pink. In 2017, Lipa was the most-streamed female musician in the world. A year later, she became the first female solo artist to get five Brits nominations (she won two), and the youngest woman to break 1bn YouTube views with her video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU\">New Rules</a>, the single that transformed her from pop journeywoman to superstar. This January, it hit 2bn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj2U6rhnucI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nj2U6rhnucI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Success creates freedom and pressure, says Lipa. At 11 tracks, the focused Future Nostalgia bucks pop\u2019s trend for bloated, spread-betting albums that try to please all-comers. But her initial intention for the record \u2013 to have fun and ignore the world \u2013 came after online criticism threatened to dent her self-worth. \u201cPeople almost made me feel bad about my achievements, or didn\u2019t allow me to feel proud of the things that I\u2019ve done because they made me feel like I was almost unworthy of them,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I know I\u2019ve worked really hard and I did so much of the work, the performances and behind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>There are two key words here, the first being \u201calmost\u201d: Lipa is indomitable, not given to vulnerability, or at least not to showing it. The second is \u201cwork\u201d: Lipa\u2019s parents are Kosovar-Albanian Muslim immigrants who fled war-torn Kosovo for the UK in 1992. She was born in 1995, and lived in London until the family returned to Pristina when she was 10. At 15, she came back to pursue pop stardom, persuading her parents she would have a better chance of getting into a British university if she finished school here. Where most kids would go wild, Lipa grafted, pestered people with her demos and became an assiduous networker (the Instagram page for Girls Collective, a DIY talent agency she started with five friends, is still live). One connection led to another and she signed first with Lana Del Rey\u2019s management team, then to Warner Music.</p> <p>It took two years from releasing her debut single, New Love \u2013 showing off her trademark bungee-jump vocals and ex-vanquishing MO \u2013 to her first album. The latter was repeatedly delayed, Lipa a prime study of how pop careers build slowly and evolve publicly in the streaming era \u2013 and living proof of the \u201cadaptability\u201d she admired in her parents. \u201cWith every song, the momentum was building, but only tiny little bits,\u201d she says. \u201cI was doing new things, I was learning what was expected of me, how to be in front of a camera, how to better the last performance.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review\">Dua Lipa: Future Nostalgia review \u2013 a true pop visionary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her singles were not charting well. By the time she released two successive collaborations \u2013 modern pop\u2019s stabilisers \u2013 fans worried she was destined for pop\u2019s dumper. Then she unleashed the video to New Rules, \u201cand it was like rocket fuel\u201d, she says, a feminist sleepover fever dream and instant classic. It takes place in a luxury Miami Beach hotel, which she approached to fund the video, not because her label had shut its wallet, but in a savvy cash grab that let her \u201cpush it to another level\u201d.

You have to be made out of steel to not let words get to you. It\u2019s so sad that we have to learn lessons from somebody\u2019s death.\u201d</p> <p>But then, maybe we are a long way off when, as Lipa says, \u201ccertain leaders are inciting racism and almost making it acceptable for people to be racist and treating people in very vile and disgusting ways\u201d. British political parties are \u201cabsolutely\u201d sowing such division, she says. \u201cYou have people like Nigel Farage, who is very openly racist and that is just shocking, and there are people who beat around the bush. They\u2019re racist but \u2013 it\u2019s such a mindfuck \u2013 they have a lot of people fooled.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The scrutiny not just on social media but in the media, especially towards women, is so intense and unkind</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lipa is unusually specific about politics for a pop star of her stature. It\u2019s not just \u201cvote\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cvote Labour\u201d, or \u201cvote Bernie\u201d, or \u201cFUCK THE PATRIARCHY I AM DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT HANDMAIDS TALE SHIT WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK\u201d after Alabama banned abortion. She credits her parents for her voice, saying she was raised \u201creally liberal\u201d. She is most concerned about UK immigration policy post-Brexit. Had it existed in the 90s, she thinks it would have stopped the Lipas fleeing Kosovo (where her mum was a lawyer, her dad a dentist-in-training) for the UK, where they worked as waiters and studied for new careers.</p> <p>\u201cIt upsets me that probably some of the younger generations of refugees don\u2019t really have the same opportunities that I was given because of the fortunate \u2013 or unfortunate \u2013 fact that my parents moved to London and I was born here and able to live my dream and do something on a global scale,\u201d she says. Whether post-Brexit Britain still offers those opportunities, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna have to see how everything works out\u201d, she says cautiously. Brexit has been upsetting: \u201cBeing from Kosovo, I know what it would mean for them to be a part of the EU and be accepted.\u201d</p> <p>It is an obvious thing to say about someone who frequently entertains packed arenas, but Lipa evidently wants to be heard. Although she occasionally jumps into the conversational deep end but grips the safety rail (a devout Labour supporter, she indicates that she is no Corbyn fan, but won\u2019t say so outright), she sticks to her chosen guns. She kept Future Nostalgia relatively short to hold listeners\u2019 attention spans. \u201cI really wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t any tracks you could skip,\u201d she grins.</p> <p>Pop\u2019s detractors like to point out that it is an industry where artists conform to conventions. In the immortal words of Eilish: <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\">duh</a></em>. Lipa is a canny operator who understood that she had to play a certain game to reach the point where she could be herself. (Her ambition/achievement conversion rate is a big part of her aspirational appeal.) Lipa was surprised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/11/this-years-male-dominated-brit-awards-have-an-issue-with-women\">the under-recognition of female talent at this year\u2019s Brits</a> \u2013 evidence, critics said, of the British industry\u2019s inability to develop female talent \u2013 but she is pragmatic about what might seem like a conservative feeder system where new acts spew out singles and accept every possible collaboration. \u201cArtists that are already well known get the upper hand, so you do have to get on those playlists as much as possible to be heard,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f4fcf6c7ae0625d5aa89284c1f50d5df8bf3cda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f4fcf6c7ae0625d5aa89284c1f50d5df8bf3cda/0_0_4904_3247/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa at this year\u2019s Grammy awards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa at this year\u2019s Grammy awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Polk/Rolling Stone/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following Lipa\u2019s success, one such feeder system seemed to be getting young female acts to make their version of New Rules: Mabel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TQKyDD9Yig\">Don\u2019t Call Me Up</a>, Ella Eyre\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDvD7Ko3IM\">New Me</a> and Anne-Marie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzD_yyEcp0M\">Friends</a> to name just three.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve noticed \u2026\u201d she says, her game face dropping to reveal that she has absolutely noticed. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK, though!\u201d she says when called on it. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different ways to say the same thing, make it honest and unique to you.\u201d She resists the idea that anyone is being told to recreate someone else\u2019s success. \u201cArtists do have a lot of control.\u201d</p> <p>Had Lipa tried to recreate New Rules for album two, \u201cI\u2019d just be in a vicious cycle\u201d, she says. She says she struggled to find her \u201clyrical language\u201d on her debut, feeling more at ease writing sad songs. \u201cI learned that I could write happy songs that are still really authentic and have the possibility of being cool and not seen as bubblegum.\u201d Most striking is how she sings about sex: mutually pleasurable, orgasmic transcendence mirrored in dazzling disco reveries. On Good in Bed, she nonchalantly celebrates \u201call that good pipe in the moonlight\u201d from a toxic ex-with-benefits. \u201cEverybody thinks that as a woman, you have to be so <em>careful</em> about how you portray yourself or how you talk about sex, and everything has to be really <em>sweet</em>,\u201d she says mockingly. \u201cIt\u2019s just very colloquial and how I chat with my mates.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t like to apologise if I don\u2019t believe I should be apologising for something</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Future Nostalgia ends with its lone ballad, the weighty Boys Will Be Boys, where a children\u2019s choir backs Lipa singing about how girls grow up faster in a world of male violence. She wanted to make something that felt like the moment the lights go on at the end of a party, \u201cso it would almost end a bit abruptly and maybe make you feel uncomfortable\u201d. She has grown less accommodating, a dynamic she dealt with in real life in January, when she attended Lizzo\u2019s Grammys afterparty at an LA strip club. After they were filmed throwing money at dancers with Rosal\u00eda, Lipa was accused of exploiting women, sparking the hashtag #dualipaisoverparty where users revelled in her \u201ccancellation\u201d.</p> <p>Lipa \u2013 who no longer goes on Twitter \u2013 did not respond. \u201cI don\u2019t like to apologise if I don\u2019t believe I should be apologising for something,\u201d she says now. \u201cI believe in supporting women in all fields of work.

  "<p>Throughout history, pandemics have often had profound economic effects. The most famous of all, the Black Death of the mid-14th century, wiped out between a third and two-fifths of the population of western Europe. The labour shortages that followed are credited with hastening the end of the feudal system.</p> <p>Covid-19 is nowhere near as deadly as the Black Death, but the shock it has dealt to an already vulnerable global economy has been immense. Perhaps inevitably, there is talk of life never being the same again.</p> <p>But this is what was said last time. Many on the left thought that when the banks nearly went bust in 2008, the dominant free-market model would be replaced by a more progressive alternative.</p> <p>It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">didn\u2019t happen</a>. The scale of the crisis wasn\u2019t enough to bring about fundamental change; those who were the largest beneficiaries of free movement of capital were rich, powerful and well dug in; and the<strong> </strong>narrative that emerged about the 2008 crash was at odds with what really happened.</p> <p>Narratives matter a lot. Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s message to the American people in the 1930s was that their lives had been wrecked by Wall Street\u2019s greed. FDR positioned his government as the friend of the unemployed and the enemy of reckless speculation. The story told by the Thatcherites and the Reaganites in the late 1970s was that organised labour had become too powerful, and the big states that emerged from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/24/bit-by-bit-donald-trump-is-taking-apart-new-deal-glorious-legacy\">New Deal era</a> were strangling enterprise.</p> <p>The best example of how narratives shape political outcomes happened in Britain after the last crisis. The truth about the 2008-09 recession was that it was a global phenomenon facilitated by the deregulation of finance and inadequate supervision of banks. This allowed a debt bubble to inflate over many years. When it popped, the banks found themselves unable to meet the losses on their wild speculation.<strong> </strong>London\u2019s role as a global financial centre meant Britain suffered more than most.</p> <p>But the narrative that emerged was different. The story told by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government of 2010 was that Britain\u2019s problems were the result of the previous Labour government\u2019s profligacy. Budget deficits had been run in good times and had exploded when the economy started to contract. The Conservatives offered any number of soundbites: Labour had crashed the car, it had <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/11/labour-deficit-cut-public\">maxed out </a><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/11/labour-deficit-cut-public\">the nation\u2019s credit card</a>, it had failed to mend the roof while the sun was shining. Britain would have to endure a painful period of austerity to mend the hole in the public finances, but Gordon Brown was to blame.</p> <p>It all looks a bit different this time. Although his approval ratings have picked up, Boris Johnson\u2019s task of weaving a compelling narrative out of twin economic and public health crises is much more difficult than the challenge that faced David Cameron in 2010.</p> <p>Johnson has been forced to go further and faster in his response to Covid-19 than Brown did back in 2008. The cost of lost output is unknowable because it is unclear how long the economy will be locked down, but it will be enormous \u2013 and inevitable. The government has decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/non-key-workers-tourists-defy-physical-distancing-advice-uk\">keep all but essential workers at home</a>. It therefore has no choice but to protect jobs and incomes, whatever it takes. The budget deficit is going to balloon, just as it did at the end of the noughties, and for the same reason: recession means the government spends more and takes in less in tax.</p> <p>Nor will it be realistic for Johnson to say that he has no alternative but to impose another period of belt-tightening when the economy eventually comes out of hibernation. Austerity was an economic failure, resulting in a lost decade for wages, sluggish growth and public finances in a worse state than they were before the last crisis.</p> <p>But austerity has also proved a political liability for the Conservatives. The public is in no mood to stomach NHS cuts. Nurses and care workers are a lot more popular than bond dealers and bankers. To <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/09/tories-neglected-north-10-years-levelling-up-must-happen-now-hs2\">scrap infrastructure projects</a> \u2013 the customary, if short-sighted, response of hard-up governments down the ages \u2013 would be a repudiation of the manifesto that won the prime minister his election victory less than four months ago.</p> <p>One of the problems a party faces when it is in power for a long time is that blaming the opposition for the mess it allegedly left behind no longer cuts it. The Conservatives have been in power for a decade. They will eventually be held to account over how prepared the UK was for this crisis.</p> <p>Questions will arise: was the NHS equipped to cope with a pandemic? The years ahead of the financial crisis saw the biggest sustained increase in <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/spending-english-nhs/\">health spending</a> since the creation of the NHS in 1948; the years since 2010 have seen the smallest increases. Was the welfare system in a better shape to cope with the sharp contraction of the economy in 2008, or in 2020? Benefits were far more generous a decade ago than is the case today. Labour actually made a much better job of mending the roof.</p> <p>For the right, this is the second major economic crisis in little more than a decade. It\u2019s the second time the state has needed to come to the rescue of an economic system where the gap between rich and poor has widened, corporations pay as little tax as they can get way with, too little attention is paid to the climate emergency, and a large proportion of the workforce is one paycheck from penury. For the left, it should be an open goal.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</em></p> <p><br></p>",

In recent years it has invested enormous sums of money in its own English-language news infrastructure to project its image around the world.</p> \n<p>At the forefront of this response has been the state-owned English-language 24-hour rolling news channel CGTN, which recently began broadcasting from a new UK base in west London with a mission statement of \u201creporting the news from a Chinese perspective\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"388645c12184c781f83fc3b6d5a153421c612506\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388645c12184c781f83fc3b6d5a153421c612506/194_357_3406_2043/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Chinese medics posing on 13 March after arriving in Rome from Shanghai to help fight the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese medics posing on 13 March after arriving in Rome from Shanghai to help fight the coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANSA/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Although CGTN is facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/23/ofcom-investigates-cgtn-over-coverage-of-hong-kong-protests-china\">ongoing investigations by the media regulator Ofcom</a> over its impartiality and other issues around press freedom, its criticism of western governments is less overt than that of other state-backed news networks such Russia Today or Iran\u2019s Press TV.</p> \n<p>Instead, in the past week the channel has broadcast a combination of inspiring individual stories about Chinese doctors saving lives against the odds during the coronavirus pandemic, videos of Chinese aid arriving in European and African nations, and footage of China\u2019s economy already recovering from the lockdown \u2013 along with more unusual footage, such as film of an Ethiopian man who believed he could stop the infection by putting garlic up his nose.</p> \n<p>On Thursday afternoon, it aired a series of interviews with Chinese diplomats and medical workers across Europe, with a presenter introducing interviews on how \u201cChina\u2019s experience fighting Covid-19 is proving invaluable to other countries trying to contain the crisis\u201d.</p> \n<p>They also interviewed the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands who criticised western media for their coverage of coronavirus aid: \u201cDo they really wish China to stand by?

  "<p>This is a piece about panic buying in the time of coronavirus, and maybe I should stop right there. None of us needs more panic in our lives right now. If there\u2019s one thing psychologists can agree on, it\u2019s that panicky behaviour is contagious. Every time we read an article telling us not to be selfish and ransack the supermarkets, it triggers the thought that food is running out and we must urgently get to the nearest Tesco and buy five packets of pasta and as many tinned tomatoes and lentils as we can carry.</p> \n<p>These are certainly unsettled times in which to feed ourselves. Over the past month, we have been exposed to an uncanny sight that has been almost unknown in Britain for decades: empty supermarket shelves. When you are not used to it, this sight does strange things to your insides.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, pre-lockdown, I popped to Sainsbury\u2019s on the way home from school with my 11-year-old son. He drags his heels at shopping, but I assured him I only wanted to buy potatoes. I had everything else I needed for a shepherd\u2019s pie. But we stopped in our tracks to see that there were no potatoes and indeed, no vegetables of any kind anywhere in the fresh produce aisle, except for a few sad packs of drooping mixed veg for stir fries. The locusts had been. I was aware that hand sanitiser and pasta and toilet roll were in short supply, but hadn\u2019t realised that the fresh and frozen produce aisles were now emptying, too. I suddenly felt shaky. The last time I had seen a food shop with so little actual stuff in it relative to the shelves was on a school trip to Soviet Russia 30 years ago. My son\u2019s eyes lit up: boring old food shopping had become a post-apocalyptic scavenger hunt. \u201cWill frozen roast potatoes work in a shepherd\u2019s pie?\u201d he exclaimed in the near-empty wastes of the frozen food section.</p> \n<p>What is generally called panic buying \u2013 a common human response to crisis \u2013 is not caused by food shortages per se, but by fear. At its root is a fear of scarcity, and this fear is self-fulfilling, because the more people anxiously stockpile, the more others get infected by the panic and the faster the food runs out. According to Steven Taylor, a clinical psychologist and author of The Psychology of Pandemics, which was published last year, there are parallels between the ways people are behaving now and the way they behaved during earlier pandemics such as the Spanish flu of 1918, when there was panic buying of Vicks VapoRub, and the 1968 flu pandemic, when food was looted from restaurants. The difference now, Taylor observes, is that the panic can escalate much faster via social media and online news.</p> \n<p>\u201cInevitably, someone posts dramatic photographs of panic buying,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThis amplifies the sense of scarcity and perceived urgency, which leads to further panic buying.\u201d</p> \n<p>The American food writer Helen Rosner <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/we-are-all-irrational-panic-shoppers\" title=\"\">has noted</a> an element of \u201cfantasy\u201d to the shoppers who fill entire trolleys with cases of mineral water, given that \u201cstaying at home for a few weeks isn\u2019t quite nuclear holocaust\u201d. We need to keep reminding ourselves that there is still generally plenty of food going around, even if it does not always reach the right people at the right time. Prof Tim Benton, who is research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank, told me that the UK has \u201cfull warehouses\u201d of non-perishable food and that \u201cthe flow of fruit and vegetables from Europe is OK at the moment\u201d, although distribution has clearly been made much more challenging by the spread of coronavirus in Spain and Italy, and the fact that lorries carrying fresh foods have been subject to more delays and checks than before. But there is still food in the shops. Rationally, we don\u2019t need to panic.</p> \n<p>But who said the human relationship with food was fully rational? Many people reacted to news of the virus by rushing to the shops, as if the prospect of running low on coffee beans were more terrifying than the risk of exposing yourself or others to infection. One of these people was me. Along with a couple of extra bags of coffee, I stocked up on ground almonds for my daughter who loves to bake; and lemons because they improve everything.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Uncertainty breeds fear, and fear makes a person wonder whether there is enough butter in the fridge. The restrictions on our movement in recent days and weeks, coupled with a daily drip-feed of unease, have been unlike anything most of us can remember. We can\u2019t visit our elderly relatives or even find out whether we are infected or not, but we can at least stock our kitchens with sardines and long-life milk \u2013 or gin, as the case may be \u2013 to give us the sense that we are somehow prepared. As the Harvard epidemiologist Karestan Koenen says, \u201cfood buying helps us feel in control\u201d.</p> \n<p>The way we eat at any given time reflects our national state of mind. For 50 years or more in the UK, we have been eating with the largesse of a people who felt that food was an inexhaustible fountain. Unlike the wartime generation, we did not worry too much about wasting odds and ends or saving the bit of bread that was not mouldy, because we knew that there would always be another loaf. Nor did we have to keep track of the seasons, because in the never-ending summer of the supermarkets, blueberries could be shipped in for our pleasure no matter what the month. Yes, there were <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/society/food-banks\" title=\"\">food banks</a>, but most of the population could push the idea of scarcity far to the back of our minds. For many, these past few weeks have been a shock: a moment when almost everyone in the country felt at least a bit insecure about food, and started to realise that the fountain could dry up.</p> \n<p>In some ways, this has been a rare moment of clarity, when we finally recognise how much we owe to the low-paid \u201ckey workers\u201d who put in the hours to grow and harvest and pack and cook and deliver so that the rest of us can have food available at all times. But with that clarity comes a new unease. The panic buying and shortages \u2013 even if temporary \u2013 have revealed to us that our food system is built on a far less solid foundation than we imagined.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>On 20 March, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, commented that people should buy only \u201cwhat they need and not more than what they need\u201d. You can tell that something radical has shifted in our attitudes to food shopping when the Conservative party \u2013 which for so long has defended the right of the food industry to sell us anything it likes, regardless of its effects on our health \u2013 starts asking people to restrict what they buy for the sake of others.</p> \n<p>Hancock\u2019s comments were prompted by a much-shared video featuring a critical care nurse called Dawn Bilbrough, who filmed herself in tears after coming off a 48-hour shift in intensive care and finding that she was unable to buy any fruit or vegetables in the supermarket. \u201cYou are just stripping the shelves bare of essential foods,\u201d Bilbrough says in the video. \u201cJust stop it. Because it\u2019s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you\u2019re at your lowest, so just stop it. Please!\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"06ee9134-0929-4dce-95c4-6b56997291b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jmSPOSGpAYs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To watch Bilbrough\u2019s video is to feel a visceral reaction against the selfish stockpilers who have deprived this hard-working NHS nurse of fresh produce. Her righteous rage is the same anger that people have felt throughout history towards the hoarders and speculators who put their own interests above the common good. During the Great Famine of England and Wales in 1315-17, the lords hoarded grain while the poor starved. In times of war, hoarding is loathed more than ever, and tends to be more severely policed. In 1941, an egg dealer in Folkestone was sentenced to three months of hard labour for illegally hoarding thousands of eggs and selling them on the black market. With rationing in place, to fiddle the system by taking more than your fair share of food was seen as an appalling form of cheating.</p> \n<p>But what on earth would a fair share of food be by today\u2019s standards? Nowadays, you might get through half a week\u2019s wartime ration for meat and eggs in a single breakfast. There was an outcry during the first days of lockdown when some convenience stores reported that police had been trying to stop shopkeepers from selling Easter eggs on the grounds that they were not \u201cessential\u201d food. </p> \n<p>For more than half a century, the freedom and abundance of our food system taught us that we could have whatever we want, whenever we wanted it, assuming we could pay. Over the past five years, food delivery services took this freedom still further. Whatever our hearts desired could be ordered up on an app and biked round in minutes, without fear of being judged for ordering too much or failing to share. Suddenly, coronavirus has tested the limits of our rights as consumers. For many modern families, there has been a profound shock to this new reality.</p> \n<p>Eating is once again framed as a moral act. There have always been people who felt reassured by bulk buying, and the rest of us didn\u2019t feel the need to judge them for this quirk. But our scrutiny of others has sharpened \u2013 and some individual behaviour has been remarkably irresponsible. Supermarket workers have described acts of astonishing selfishness. In an excellent <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/grocery-store-employee-covid-19_n_5e78c99ac5b6f5b7c54839ae\" title=\"\">article</a> for HuffPost, American grocery store worker Karleigh Frisbie Brogan described in horrified terms watching one shopper \u201cuse his forearm to empty a shelf of refried beans into his cart\u201d. As coronavirus spread through Singapore in February, there was an outcry when <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-groceries-supplies-ntuc-sheng-siong-12406906\" title=\"\">a photo</a> was shared on Facebook of a middle-aged woman in a medical mask pushing a trolley piled to shoulder height with instant noodles. Most of the reactions consisted of crying with laughter emojis coupled with insults. Several people suggested that this \u201caunty\u201d would die not from coronavirus but from an overdose of MSG.</p> \n<p>Most of us would not go so far as to wish harm on the hoarders, although we can certainly unite in righteous indignation against these new villains of our post-coronavirus life. Besides the selfish shoppers who clear the shelves of fresh fruit, there are cold-hearted profiteers who buy up essential foods, as well as hand wash and face masks to sell them on at an inflated price. Sky News reported finding a carton of formula milk (normal price: \u00a311) being sold on eBay for more than \u00a3300.</p> \n<p>The media have focused heavily on these stories of hysterical greed in the shops. \u201cSelfish Tesco shoppers block NHS staff from getting into supermarket after working gruelling 60 hours on coronavirus frontline\u201d read one headline from the Sun on 23 March. But this fixation with selfish shoppers is not good for anyone\u2019s anxiety levels. Some eating-disorder sufferers \u2013 who are already often grappling with feelings of guilt about buying food \u2013 have reported that reading stories of panic buying have triggered worries that they must not buy food at all, lest they be taking food away from people who need it more. Another reason we should stop talking so much about the stockpilers is that their role in the current upheaval (or their responsibility for the current shortages) is probably not all that important.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Have you noticed that one of the main features of panic buying is that it is always done by other people, and never by ourselves? It is a label we attach to others in order to make ourselves feel better about our own shopping choices. He panic buys. You stock up. I tirelessly provide food for my family.</p> \n<p>A binary opposition has sprung up in our culture between shoppers \u2013 who are portrayed as grasping and selfish \u2013 and workers \u2013 who are heroic, especially anyone who works for the NHS. But NHS workers go shopping, too. Some of the people who took vegetables from the shelves before Dawn Bilbrough got there will have been other nurses just like her. They probably didn\u2019t take much more than usual.</p> \n<p>True panic buying \u2013 as in, cupboards full to the rafters with ramen noodles or packets of pasta \u2013 is actually much less common than we think. When market analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel looked at data from 100,000 UK shoppers in mid-March, it found that only 3% of the population engaged in full-blown panic buying. The rest of the increase in food sales over the past month \u2013 an extra \u00a31bn in the first three weeks of March \u2013 could be explained by consumers adding just a few extra items here and there. Chris Morley of Kantar wrote that the research suggested \u201chuge volumes of consumers were adding a few extra purchases of products they normally buy, and adding a few purchases of categories that they don\u2019t often buy into their trolley or basket [lentils being an obvious example] and were shopping more regularly than usual\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the term panic buying,\u201d says risk expert Tim Benton. He admits that there have been a few examples of \u201cstupidity\u201d from consumers in the shops, but he argues that for the most part, our patterns of shopping in recent weeks have been a \u201crisk-resilience issue\u201d rather than a \u201cpanic response\u201d. People have been told it is their duty to go home and stay there (and in some countries such as Canada, consumers have been <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/think-about-coronavirus-outbreak-when-planning-for-spring-break-champagne\" title=\"\">explicitly told</a> by politicians to stock up with enough supplies to last a week or two). At the same time, people can no longer have lunch or dinner outside of the home at cafes or restaurants or work canteens, which previously would have accounted for around 30% of all calories eaten in per day in the UK. \u201cThey can\u2019t eat out, so they stock their larders,\u201d says Benton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"232941ba43e80d4248b19e553b650f4ffb2147a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/232941ba43e80d4248b19e553b650f4ffb2147a0/0_0_4761_2857/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers queue outside a supermarket in Huddersfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers queue outside a supermarket in Huddersfield.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Vaughan/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of the people buying more food than usual will have been doing so in order to help out friends and neighbours who are stranded at home. In Singapore in February, journalist Annie Tan observed that many people \u201cdecided to multiply their shopping list\u201d in order to \u201cspare their friends and family from knee-numbing queues\u201d. I have seen the same thing here, with WhatsApp groups filling up with neighbourly offers to share everything from fresh fruit to self-raising flour.</p> \n<p>Instead of panic buying, perhaps we should speak more of resilience buying. There is solace in feeling prepared, especially when we actually have no idea what\u2019s coming next. During the second world war, the writer Alice B Toklas lived in rural France with the art collector Gertrude Stein. In The Alice B Toklas Cookbook, she describes how she accumulated a store of dried fruits, including 4lb of citron and 2lb of raisins, which she was saving to make a liberation fruit cake when the war was over. From time to time, she would look at the fruit in its jars and feel \u201ccheered\u201d during the \u201cdismal days of that winter\u201d.</p> \n<p>This is not a war, thank God. Many people are invoking the spirit of the blitz \u2013 and some of us are certainly digging for victory, judging from the fact that vegetable seeds have been bought in vast quantities. But we are not having to make do with wartime rations of dried egg just yet. Knowing that we have a store of the half a dozen things we dread running out of can make us more equipped to summon up the reserves of patience and humour we are all going to need over the next few weeks.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>When I put out a request on Twitter asking what items people felt they needed to stock up on most urgently, I was stunned to receive more than 1,300 replies. Many of them read like prose poems, speaking of private passions. \u201cParmesan. Just parmesan,\u201d read one. \u201cGarlic, olive oil, capers, anchovies, bacon. With them I can make any pulse, grain, or starch taste great,\u201d was another answer, from food broadcaster Sheila Dillon. Chef Alex Rushmer replied that his one essential was Lao Gan Ma crispy chilli oil, because, \u201cIf all you had was rice and noodles, Lao Gan Ma would make it OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Common themes emerged. Apart from the obvious answers of staple grains, other popular essentials included onions, ginger and garlic, frozen veg, lemons and cheese, butter and oil, various kinds of pickles and spices: all ingredients for enhancing a meal rustled up from pantry goods. Many people named their favourite stimulants, from teabags to coffee to wine. \u201cDark chocolate, floor cleaner, gin\u201d, read one of the most bracingly honest replies. Someone wrote from day 15 of lockdown in Madrid to warn that although she had laid in 10 litres of olive oil, she had not anticipated how much chocolate she would want: \u201cYou\u2019ll need comfort food after a hard, sad day.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spirit that mostly emerged from these tweets was not one of panic, but of warmth and resourcefulness. People started to swap helpful tips on where to source certain hard-to-find products. There was a discussion of the fact that yeast \u2013 which is near-unobtainable in mainstream supermarkets, because so many people have started baking for comfort during lockdown \u2013 could still be found in some Polish shops, where it is labelled <em>dro\u017cd\u017ce</em>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"629c21287327ac24ddd98447731dda71d15361c4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/629c21287327ac24ddd98447731dda71d15361c4/0_297_4611_2766/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Panic buying continues as hundred queue at Costco Lakeside as the Coronavirus pandemic worsens.

A few weeks ago, when there were acres of empty shelves in the out-of-town hypermarkets, I strolled into a medium-sized Turkish shop near where I live in Cambridge and found plentiful supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables, cheeses and yoghurts, dried goods and breads and much more. Many of the items were both cheaper and more appetising than the supermarket equivalent, yet I didn\u2019t witness any customers piling their basket especially high. In a family-run shop like this, you would feel silly to clear the shelves. Others have reported that Korean and Chinese supermarkets in the UK have generally remained much better stocked than the big supermarket chains.</p> \n<p>And yet many British people still ignore these independent shops, in their eagerness to join the queue at a hollowed-out supermarket. It is as if we have been brainwashed to believe that these familiar superstores are the only ones that can supply us with the abundance and choice we have become accustomed to.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>For years, food policy expert Tim Lang has been an almost lone voice in the wilderness, arguing that UK food security needs to be improved. In his new, very timely book \u2013 Feeding Britain: Our Food Problems and How to Fix Them \u2013 Lang notes that most consumers think that \u201cas long as there is food on the supermarket shelves, all is well in the world. It is not.\u201d According to Lang, Britain has long had \u201ca false sense of security about food\u201d, and all the more so post-Brexit. There\u2019s an assumption that, as a rich country, we will always be able to buy the produce we need from abroad, but this is a risky assumption in times of crisis.</p> \n<p>The empty shelves we have been so shocked by are not just reflective of the behaviour of individual shoppers, but of a supermarket system based on \u201cjust in time\u201d delivery systems. The idea \u2013 eagerly embraced by all the major UK food retailers \u2013 is that the business carries minimal stock, buying only what it needs at any given time, to save on the cost of storage. It\u2019s an efficient and highly profitable model \u2013 as long as imports are freely flowing. But even in the good times, as Lang explains in his book, the plenty in our supermarkets was based on \u201cstretched and risky food supply chains\u201d. The current crisis has laid bare the problems with having a food system so heavily weighted towards imports.</p> \n<p>A country with the UK\u2019s climate will never be fully self-sufficient in food \u2013 we can\u2019t grow our own coffee beans, to take one pressing example \u2013 but Lang argues that far more land should be given over to food production. \u201cThe UK cannot grow rice or mangoes or bananas, but it could grow 100% of apples, pears and soft fruit, and a more diverse range of vegetables.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89103ae6e068353782cb849b6a27a3ccd4644973\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89103ae6e068353782cb849b6a27a3ccd4644973/0_0_5568_3342/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shopping restrictions at a supermarket in Warrington march 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping restrictions at a supermarket in Warrington last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another weakness in our food supply that coronavirus has highlighted is that it is so unfairly and unequally distributed across the population. The coronavirus outbreak has pushed millions of people in the UK to the brink of food poverty. A <a href=\"https://foodfoundation.org.uk/covid-19-latest-impact-on-food-2/\" title=\"\">report from the Food Foundation</a> in March found that the combination of self-isolation, erratic food availability and a drop in income was leaving many vulnerable households at serious risk of not being able to access an adequate diet without government aid. During the week before lockdown, a food bank in Enfield reported an 80% surge in visitors. As Tim Benton comments, the question is not currently whether there is enough food in the UK, but who gets it \u2013 and that ultimately needs to be addressed by the government.</p> \n<p>The problem of individual panic buying may turn out to be a trivial worry compared with other, deeper issues in the food system, such as how to remodel it to deliver healthy food for all. Since social distancing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/uk-supermarkets-ease-coronavirus-shopping-restrictions\" title=\"\">some temporary rationing</a> were put in place in UK supermarkets, panic buying has largely taken care of itself. Because of the social distancing rules, one day last week I found myself one of only 11 people allowed inside a small supermarket. Each item was limited to no more than three per customer, but I only saw people take one or two. The atmosphere felt as hushed as a church, and I noticed that everything from eggs to \u2013 yes! \u2013 potatoes were now available again. Steven Taylor, expert in the psychology of pandemics, notes that rationing is a far more effective strategy for stopping panic buying during a pandemic than either pleas from the government or \u201csocial shaming and ridicule\u201d. Once rationing is in place \u201cand people can see that they can still obtain staples, fears of scarcity tend to abate\u201d.</p> \n<p>A much more serious issue on the horizon is panic buying not by consumers, but by governments. On 24 March, Bloomberg reported that some governments had started to put in place protectionist food policies as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Serbia has halted exports of sunflower oil and Kazakhstan is no longer allowing wheat flour or carrots to leave the country. If such protectionism spreads widely, it could result in higher prices and shortages of certain commodities, particularly for a country such as Britain that is so heavily dependent on imported food.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\">\u2018We can\u2019t go back to normal\u2019: how will coronavirus change the world?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe problem,\u201d says Tim Benton, \u201cis that the more countries [engage in hoarding food], the free flow of food becomes sticky and imports start getting hammered.\u201d Technically, there is enough food in the world to feed current populations. According to the Agricultural Market Information System, which tracks food supplies across the world, \u201cglobal reserves of non-perishable goods such as wheat and rice should be sufficient to meet any imminent demand\u201d. Trade runs on trust, but at this moment of crisis, many countries seem to be feeling jittery and thinking only of national interests. Benton notes that in the current global food system \u201cwe are seeing every country working for itself\u201d. His concern is what could happen to imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from Europe into the UK, given shortages of labour in southern Europe as a result of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>These are testing times for food delivery drivers, as Dan Saladino reported on a recent episode of the BBC Food Programme. There have been cases of drivers making the epic journey back from Spain or Italy with lorryfuls of fresh food, only to be turned away at distribution sites in the UK because of fears that they might be bringing in infection. The rest of us should be grateful that, for now, there are still plentiful supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables in Europe, and drivers still prepared to make the trip and get it for us. But we need to stop taking this bountiful flow of food for granted, and start thinking about building a more resilient system. As Benton points out: \u201cYou can\u2019t stockpile lettuce.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Spurred into action by the spring sunshine, our resident carrion crows have one thing on their minds. Just as they\u2019ve done for the past five years, this pair have begun to build on the foundations of last year\u2019s nest, high in the crown of a statuesque oak \u2013 the tallest tree in their territory.</p> <p>Unlike rooks and jackdaws, which are social species and tend to nest in colonies, <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/carrion-crow/\" title=\"\">carrion crows</a> are fairly solitary birds. Reaching sexual maturity at about three years of age, they form socially monogamous but genetically promiscuous pairings. This means that, while they typically mate for life, extra-pair copulation between a female and a male other than her pair-bonded mate is not unusual.</p> <p>The nest is about 15 metres up, near the top of the canopy, close to the trunk and wedged securely between two thick forked limbs. From afar it looks like a platform of jumbled sticks, but through my spotting scope I can see that it is in fact cup-shaped.</p> <p>Once the tree is in leaf, the nest will be concealed from sight, but for now it is in full view of predators and, though they have yet to lay, the crows are actively defending their territory, mobbing the local buzzards as they circle overhead, and seeing off passing sparrowhawks and kestrels. For another measure of protection, they have constructed a decoy nest in a neighbouring tree, conspicuously sited on an outer branch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2149b3838187cbc52dd9c9e3c583fafb62e64df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2149b3838187cbc52dd9c9e3c583fafb62e64df/0_0_3987_2641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crow\u2019s nest composed of sticks and fishing material\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Once the tree is in leaf, the nest will be concealed from sight, but for now it is in full view of predators.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Redding/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The male and female have been working together to construct their high-rise abode, taking it in turns to alight on my silver birch and break off twigs.

Governments are trying to create \u201cgreen lanes\u201d to allow fresh produce to circumvent restrictions on travel and commerce. The European commission has guidelines to try to extend that flexibility to seasonal agriculture workers.</p> <p>Many farmers are buying time by delaying harvests. Strawberry producers, for instance, are ventilating tunnels and removing their fleeces to lower temperatures and slow ripening.
