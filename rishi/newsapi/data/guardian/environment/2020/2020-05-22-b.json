  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global known death toll passes 335,000</h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 5,180,982 people have become infected, while at least 336,404 have died around the world. The figures, which are based on official releases and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic.</p> <h2>South America is now pandemic\u2019s centre \u2013 WHO</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec8173a8f0864e579f16205#block-5ec8173a8f0864e579f16205\">South America has become a new centre of the pandemic</a>, with Brazil hardest-hit, while cases are rising in some African countries that so far have a relatively low death toll, the World Health Organization says.</p> <p>\u201cIn a sense, South America has become a new epicentre for the disease,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert, says. He adds that Brazil is \u201cclearly the most affected\u201d.</p> <h2>Police spoke to Downing Street adviser after trip during lockdown</h2> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec822258f0886ce4f5d8cdb#block-5ec822258f0886ce4f5d8cdb\">police have spoken to the prime minister\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings</a> about breaching the government\u2019s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus.</p> <p>Officers approached him days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror finds.</p> <h2>Peru extends state of emergency</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec8379f8f0864e579f162f0#block-5ec8379f8f0864e579f162f0\">Peru extends its state of emergency until the end of June</a> with only a very partial lifting of its lockdown as infections continue to climb despite more than two months of confinement.</p> <p>Peru is the second-worst affected Latin American country, with more than 111,000 cases and a death toll of 3,148, according to official figures.</p> <h2>Iceland to lower national emergency rating</h2> <p>Iceland is set to lower its national emergency rating on Monday, as authorities say there are just two people left in isolation waiting to recover from their infections. Iceland has <a href=\"https://www.covid.is/data\">recorded 1,803 confirmed cases</a>; 10 people have died and 1,791 have recovered.</p> <h2>80 million infants may have missed out on routine vaccines</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec7f5d48f0864e579f16036#block-5ec7f5d48f0864e579f16036\">About 80 million infants may have missed out on vaccines</a> for diseases including diphtheria, measles and polio as a result of the disruption to healthcare services caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization says.</p> <p>According to data collected by the WHO and its partners, the provision of routine immunisations for children under the age of one has been hindered in at least 68 countries, causing disruption to vaccine programmes not seen since their inception in the 1970s.</p> <h2>660,000 forced to flee homes since UN\u2019s ceasefire call</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-open-churches-as-brazil-death-toll-passes-20000-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec7b6598f0886ce4f5d86f4#block-5ec7b6598f0886ce4f5d86f4\">Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes</a> since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire to focus on handling the pandemic, an NGO says.</p> <p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres reiterated his call for an end to conflict this week. But the Norwegian Refugee Council says that the UN security council has failed to provide leadership for ceasefires, peace talks or protection of civilians during the pandemic.</p> <h2>UK orders quarantines for new arrivals</h2> <p>Two-week quarantines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/22/uk-arrivals-8-june-quarantine-for-14-days-coronavirus\">will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June</a>, with a \u00a31,000 fine awaiting anyone who breaches the measure.

  "<p>Since shops reopened in France last week, luxury fashion boutiques in the French capital have been revamping their security measures to create a transformed high-end experience.</p> <p>In one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/people-feel-a-bit-nervous-france-braces-for-end-of-lockdown-paris\">first countries in Europe to open for consumers to such an extent</a>, luxury destinations are becoming self-aware pioneers in inventing a new shopping environment. The challenge is \u201cto make people today feel charmed as much as safe\u201d, says Jennifer Cuvillier, the head of style at the department store Le Bon March\u00e9 \u2013 no small challenge in the context of global luxury sales projected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/fashion-industry-reels-as-coronavirus-shuts-shops-and-cancels-orders\">drop by 50% this year</a>, according to a recent report by Baines.</p> <p>Shoppers are welcomed to Le Bon March\u00e9 by an eerily masked and gloved army of staff \u2013 150 to be precise, one for each visitor at the store\u2019s maximum capacity in these post-confinement days. A shop assistant privately chaperones visitors through the almost invariably glass-shielded displays.</p> <p>In an ambience lodged between a museum visit and a dystopian sci-fi movie, they follow the mandatory curated route so as to avoid any potential physical contact. The tills are shielded by acrylic screens, such as at Chanel on Rue Cambon.</p> <p>The majority of the shops disinfect and quarantine any item that has been touched, for 48 to 72 hours. And, of course, the changing rooms are sanitised after every use. To counter these rather daunting measures, brands seem to be focusing on offering personalised and upgraded services: luxury labels including Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior have begun offering private shopping sessions.</p> <p>All the efforts notwithstanding, a week after doors reopened, the initial rush seems to have faded. While on 11 May, crowds flocked to the boutiques on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and Avenue Montaigne \u2013 a seemingly endless line of luxury-hungry shoppers awaiting the opening of Louis Vuitton \u2013 the situation has radically changed: Chanel, C\u00e9line and Yves Saint Laurent are all queue-less a week later, and the boutiques almost empty. Sales assistants at Galeries Lafayette Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and Loewe both confirmed traffic had fallen significantly.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an initial craze that didn\u2019t last,\u201d notes R\u00e9my Faure, a hair colourist. \u201cOne of my clients went straight out on the 11th to buy an electric-blue Kelly bag at Herm\u00e8s. But a lot of people have started thinking more critically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/21/the-fashion-system-must-change-bfc-and-cfda-call-for-an-industry-reset\">about their life choices and needs during the confinement</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Serge Carreira, a fashion lecturer at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, says: \u201cWith the absence of tourists, who make up the large majority of luxury sales, boutiques are empty.\u201d</p> <p>Shopping is not going away, he says, but it is changing: \u201cThose who shop will do it differently, more determinately; it won\u2019t be a heat of the moment decision but something thought out.\u201d</p> <p>Coming out of Galeries Lafayettes Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, Samantha, 34, and Elena, 33, suggest that the slump in shopping is down to the fact that there is nowhere to show off any new outfits. \u201c<em>\u00c0 quoi bon?</em>\u201d (What\u2019s the point?) grumbles Samantha. Theatres, cinemas, restaurants, cafes and bars are closed. \u201cThe only places to visit are shops,\u201d adds Elena, for whom <em>l\u00e8che-vitrine </em>(literally \u201cwindow licking\u201d, as the French call browsing) is one of the few outdoor activities available in the city now.</p> <p>According to Carreira, the slowness could be due to habits gained in the lockdown: \u201cShopping addicts shopped as much as they could during the confinement, many people have adopted the habit and, one can assume, don\u2019t see the point of going out to a city still with a ghost-like feeling.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>More than 30 shorebird species that fly across oceans each year to visit Australia \u2013 including nine that are threatened \u2013 are being hunted during their long migrations, according to a study that analysed decades of records from 14 countries.</p> <p>The study, which experts said filled a major gap in the world\u2019s knowledge about the impact of hunting on declining shorebird numbers, found that more than 17,000 birds from 16 species were likely being killed at just three sites \u2013 Pattani Bay in Thailand, West Java in Indonesia and the Yangtze River delta in China.</p> <p>Prof Richard Fuller, a co-author on the study, said that figure was \u201cterrifying\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe know hunting is going on at hundreds of other sites around the flyway. It\u2019s highly likely that unsustainable hunting levels are being executed for many species,\u201d Fuller said.</p> <p>All the birds use the East-Asian-Australasian Flyway \u2013 one of nine recognised migratory routes around the globe.

It has gone under the radar for a long time,\u201d Gallo-Cajiao said.</p> <p>\u201cBecause these birds fly across vast areas, hunting needs to be measured and monitored considering the cumulative levels of hunting at various places throughout the region.</p> <p>\u201cUp to now, all we had was bits and pieces of data on hunting from different individual sites, but nobody had pooled them together to get a better picture.

Labor\u2019s vote in Dawson crashed by more than 12%. George did that by pulling populist stunts like the egregious website.

This might seem an arcane diversion, but it\u2019s important. It marks the point in time when China hawks on the Coalition backbench started to front-run the government\u2019s China policy.</p> <h2>The official line on Beijing became tougher in increments</h2> <p>Let\u2019s remind ourselves quickly about what happened. In March 2017, Malcolm Turnbull <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/28/china-extradition-treaty-government-isolated-abbott-joins-critics\">had to yank a proposed extradition treaty</a> with China because of an internal boilover. Labor, the Greens and the former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/20/cory-bernardi-stalls-china-australia-extradition-treaty-for-six-months\">lined up in support of a disallowance motion</a> to scuttle the proposed treaty with China, and a handful of Liberal senators telegraphed they would back the disallowance.</p> <p>Perhaps some of the opponents were intent on creating opportunistic havoc for Turnbull and then foreign minister Julie Bishop, but in the main, the internal resistance to the treaty was entirely principled.</p> <p>The argument from Liberals who dissented from government policy was Australia should not be party to an extradition treaty with an authoritarian regime where the rule of law does not prevail \u2013 an impeccable principle for anyone who cares about human rights and basic principles of liberty. The mystery was not the pushback, but why Australia had contemplated such an agreement in the first place. It seemed symptomatic of a loss of moral clarity in the relationship; that the dollars had clouded the sense.</p> <p>Prevailing in that internal battle taught the China hawks there was merit in pushing the envelope, and it is fair to say after that incident, the government\u2019s official line on Beijing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/09/china-says-turnbulls-remarks-have-poisoned-the-atmosphere-of-relations\">became tougher in increments</a>.</p> <p>Obviously the shift that played out during 2017 is significantly more complex and multifaceted than a backbench tail wagging a frontbench dog. There is a good book to be written documenting how and why Australia\u2019s tone about China became more muscular, and how that pivot was then <a href=\"https://insidestory.org.au/journalists-on-the-ramparts/\">filtered and amplified through the media</a> \u2013 resulting in a complex bilateral relationship being presented routinely in cartoonish and sometimes hysterical terms. The era of the \u201cpanda hugger\u201d was unleashed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/australia-australia-pm-scott-morrison-disappointed-if-china-coronavirus-invesigation-tariff-plan-linked-covid-19-inquiry\">Scott Morrison 'disappointed' if China tariff plan is linked to coronavirus investigation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s a great story, but the simple point to establish right now is a front-running, or pace-setting, dynamic was created within the government after the 2017 treaty boilover. That dynamic has persisted, and if anything accelerated, to the point where the Coalition\u2019s China hawks have factions.</p> <h2>Let a hundred flowers bloom</h2> <p>George, not known for playing well with others, is a solo act. The New South Wales conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/scott-morrisons-push-for-who-reforms-a-herding-cats-exercise-liberal-senator-says\">Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is another soloist</a>. Then there\u2019s the group that have dubbed themselves \u201cThe Wolverines\u201d (which believe it or not is a reference to a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087985/\">Patrick Swayze movie, Red Dawn</a>) \u2013 people like Andrew Hastie, the head of parliament\u2019s intelligence committee, James Paterson and Tim Wilson. This latter group runs as a pack, coordinating messaging.</p> <p>This front-running is largely unrestrained by Scott Morrison or senior ministers \u2013 at least not in public \u2013 which is a dynamic worth investigating. Given the issue in question is the China relationship \u2013 a matter of great import given the combustibility of the geopolitics, and the importance of the trading relationship to Australia\u2019s economic prosperity \u2013 Morrison could muzzle. He could insist that he and the foreign minister articulate Australia\u2019s foreign policy, and yet he mostly gives the hawks their head, provided the language doesn\u2019t get too florid.</p> <p>We are witnessing a contemporary Maoism. <em><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-silence-that-preceded-chinas-great-leap-into-famine-51898077/\">Let a hundred flowers bloom</a>, and a hundred schools of thought contend.</em> The obvious question to ask is why? There are a few potential answers. Morrison evidently calculates the risk of muzzling up-and-coming MPs who believe they must speak outweighs the benefits of dialling down the diplomatic noise.</p> <p>Presumably the prime minister intuits a crackdown on the free range China seminar within his own ranks would lead to a lethal breakout at some point or other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9829be965a283d80615b6990ab5fd264684419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9829be965a283d80615b6990ab5fd264684419/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Payne and Morrison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The China conversation under way in the polity is in part a function of the historical moment.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other benefit for Morrison of the free range seminar is it allows his government, domestically, to project many positions on China. It allows the government to speak to people in the community who fear the hegemonic ambitions of the authoritarian regime in Beijing. The hawks represent those view points, while the grown-ups in the ministry maintain a more measured diplomatic tone, trying to keep trade on the rails.</p> <p>Now why would Morrison feel the need to be all things to all people? A cynic might observe this is situation normal for this prime minister, but the worst thing about cynicism is it saps curiosity. We need to be curious about why things happen, and there are significant issues to tease out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/chinas-coercive-behaviour-a-wake-up-call-australias-former-top-public-servant-says\">China's coercive behaviour a 'wake-up call', Australia's former top public servant says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The China conversation under way in the polity is in part a function of the historical moment. Australians can see the great powers are in flux. China is rising, and America is withdrawing from global leadership. The geopolitical gear shift isn\u2019t elegant, it\u2019s chaotic and unsettling, and we are wedged between our most important security partner, America, and our economic interests in the region.</p> <p>Then of course, Covid-19 hit, bringing with it an overlay of domestic economic insecurity. Anyone in politics right now knows unease is building in the Australian community. You can feel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/essential-poll-one-in-10-australians-who-have-lost-jobs-fear-they-wont-work-again\">a ripple of anxiety in our Guardian Essential poll</a> as people begin to fret about their labour market prospects, with unemployment still to peak at 10%. A strong majority in that survey suspects China isn\u2019t being transparent in its reporting about the scope of the pandemic. A significant chunk of the sample, over a third, thinks the Covid-19 virus was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab\">engineered and released from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan</a>.</p> <p>We know that economic downturns light a match under nativist sentiment. We saw it during the global financial crisis, which triggered Brexit, and created the wave that carried Donald Trump to the presidency. We largely avoided a witches brew here because we were shielded from the worst of the fallout by China\u2019s demand for our commodities and by an economic stimulus program rolled out by the then Labor government.</p> <p>But the negative economic effects of Covid are harder to insulate ourselves from, despite the Coalition\u2019s stimulus now dwarfing Labor\u2019s in 2009. There has always been a current of community opposition to foreign investment, to foreign workers, to threats beyond our borders. That\u2019s in Australia\u2019s collective DNA. But this undercurrent of nativism will be turbocharged by the economic shock associated with the coronavirus.</p> <p>Over the coming months, the government is going to be dealing with rising protectionist sentiment, both domestically and internationally \u2013 and here\u2019s a prediction. While the Wolverines faction have been out promulgating the perils of proximity to the Chinese Communist party, those same MPs will also be on the frontline of resisting a return to protectionism.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a journey, this column, so let\u2019s bring our story together: Morrison giving the China hawks their way \u2013 while pursuing a more restrained diplomatic line at senior levels \u2013 presumably works in his head as an automatic stabiliser in febrile political times.</p> <p>Bubbling grievances and anxieties are validated by one arm of the government, while the grown-ups work to keep the China relationship more or less on the rails, and duck to avoid being co-opted by the lunatic in the Oval Office, who would burn the world to the ground to survive his date with the ballot box in November.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite the game of chicken, this. Maybe it works, and Australia manages to weather the geopolitical storm. Or maybe things go to shit in a really big way, because China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/australia-china-ties-at-risk-of-slipping-into-permanent-hostility-former-senior-diplomat-warns\">declines to be played off the break by Australia</a> for domestic purposes, and the lunatic burns us all.</p>",
  "<p> To listen to the more vociferous critics of Daniel Andrews \u2013 confined mostly to the Murdoch media and a rogue Victorian Liberal MP \u2013 he is a dictator revelling in his power, with \u201ca disturbing streak of authoritarianism\u201d, a premier who wildly exaggerated the risk of Covid-19 and is now deliberately hampering the economic recovery.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s nonsense and wouldn\u2019t matter much except that now is a moment when trust in governments \u2013 at dangerously low levels pre-pandemic \u2013 has tentatively revived. Who would have thought it? Citizens like governments to work through issues using evidence, to be honest about the complexity of challenges, to protect the health and wellbeing of their people. They even like governments of different political hues working together if possible. They loathe transparent point-scoring, and they will forgive inevitable mistakes.</p> \n<p>The sniping against Andrews defies reason. Australia\u2019s health response to the global pandemic has been superb to date, for whatever combination of factors including geography, early social distancing restrictions, the national cabinet process and brave public health advice. The economic recovery will be slow, painful and complicated, and most likely less edifying.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/09/covid-19-competence-has-given-australian-governments-some-political-capital-but-theres-a-flipside\">Covid-19 competence has given Australian governments some political capital.

State governments of both major parties have performed slightly differently, but exceptionally well by any international comparison. We have had 101 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/may/20/coronavirus-active-cases-australia-data-update-how-many-new-numbers-today-map-stats-statistics-hotspots-postcode-covid-19-deaths-death-toll\">Covid-19 deaths to date</a>.

It\u2019s a stunning achievement.</p> \n<p>Andrews is the most experienced of the premiers and has grown in his 10 years as Labor leader, six as premier. He and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian lead the biggest and most powerful states, which between them have had the largest numbers of coronavirus cases, with 48 deaths in NSW and 18 in Victoria to date.</p> \n<p>The times, as Monash University\u2019s associate professor Paul Strangio points out, play to Andrews\u2019 strengths and style, with the crushing victory in the 2018 state election empowering him further. \u201cHe\u2019s always been prepared to take leadership risks on the calculation that the public prefers decisiveness and assertiveness, rather than vacillation,\u201d Strangio says.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Not a popularity contest\u2019</h2> \n<p>Victoria was the most firm among the states in insisting on early shutdowns in March and has been most cautious in reopening its society and economy. It is Victoria, too, that has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/victorian-treasurer-s-china-comments-spark-outrage-among-federal-colleagues-20200519-p54uix.html\">asserted its independence</a> over its economic relationship with China.</p> \n<p>After Scott Morrison detailed the national cabinet\u2019s three-stage roadmap for lifting coronavirus restrictions on 8 May \u2013 emphasising that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/the-three-step-plan-to-relax-restrictions-and-reopen-australia-after-coronavirus-crisis\">timing would be at the states\u2019 discretion</a> \u2013 it was Andrews who held firm that no Victorian could visit their mother on Mother\u2019s Day. The state\u2019s announcement on loosening restrictions would not happen until the following week, after a testing blitz could be analysed.</p> \n<p>Andrews did begin lifting restrictions, but they remain the tightest in the country. For now, Victorians cannot stay overnight at the home of family or friends \u2013 in every other state, this is allowed. Unlike other states, cafes and restaurants in Victoria are<strong> </strong>still unable to seat diners, but from next month, they can host up to 20 patrons at a time indoors and, all going well, that will increase as weeks go by. Victoria has been more cautious about students attending school \u2013 some years return on Monday, with all students back by 9 June.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/20/social-distancing-rules-australia-when-will-end-guidelines-coronavirus-laws-physical-covid-19-restrictions-signs-posters-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-nt-tasmania\">Social distancing rules explained: Australia's current state by state coronavirus guidelines</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But these are differences of timing, not substance, and Andrews has explained them this way. He has listened to the advice of the state\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, and this has been slightly different to national advice. There\u2019s no perfect answer to how to handle this virus, no one set of modelling that sets a roadmap. \u201cThis is not a popularity contest; it\u2019s a pandemic and we\u2019ve got to make good logical decisions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do,\u201d he told ABC radio this week.

Michael O\u2019Brien, a former treasurer, is considered a measured moderate, and became leader of the Liberal party after the devastating election loss of 2018. The party did not expect to win that election, but the 6% swing against them \u2013 especially the desertion of small-l liberal voters in its Melbourne heartland \u2013 highlighted an identity crisis that still persists.

The government deserves to be scrutinised on many fronts, including the lack of independent oversight over billions in spending, and the $24.5bn in new borrowing the government is proposing, which will more than triple state debt.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we just see budget black holes being filled and paying recurrent expenses like public service wages out of borrowed money, that is the road to economic ruin,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien told the Age recently.</p> \n<p>Victoria\u2019s engagement with China over its Belt and Road initiative \u2013 against national policy \u2013 and the suggestion of state treasurer Tim Pallas that Canberra had vilified China by pursuing an independent coronavirus inquiry, has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/victorian-treasurer-s-china-comments-spark-outrage-among-federal-colleagues-20200519-p54uix.html\">raised eyebrows</a> even among senior Labor figures.</p> \n<p>Yet O\u2019Brien\u2019s efforts have been undermined from within. Shadow planning minister Tim Smith, a master of self-promotion, has been tweeting away for months, first demanding the resignation of a senior health official for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/victoria-defends-deputy-chief-medical-officer-after-she-compared-james-cook-to-covid-19\">tweet comparing the coronavirus with Captain Cook\u2019s arrival</a>, and then indulging in almost daily sprays against Andrews.

  "<p>India has reported more than 6,000 new Covid-19 cases, its biggest one-day increase, while China<strong> </strong>has abandoned setting a GDP growth target because of the \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>The sharp increase in new infections in <strong>India</strong> came after the government began easing lockdown restrictions and as airlines prepared to reopen selected domestic routes.</p> <p>\u201cThis surge has happened after movement of people was partially allowed,\u201d said Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at India\u2019s public health foundation. \u201cBut if you see overall, this is a much lower trajectory as compared to the rest of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Babu said India \u201cseems to have the capacity\u201d to contain the coronavirus, after authorities reported a total of more than 118,000 cases \u2013 up 5% from Thursday\u2019s figure - including 3,583 deaths.</p> <p>India\u2019s lockdown has been extended to 31 May but the rules have been relaxed in regions less severely affected by the pandemic. Roughly 30% of domestic flights are due to resume from Monday.</p> <p>Infections have surged in <strong>Indonesia</strong>,<strong> </strong>the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, ahead of celebrations this weekend to mark the end of Ramadan, raising questions about the government\u2019s commitment to curbing the pandemic.</p> <p>The country reported 973 new cases, its highest one-day count, bringing its official total to more than 21,000 \u2013 although the real figure is thought to be much higher. Officials have said the public are not taking proper precautions, but only four of 34 provinces and 26 cities have imposed wide-scale restrictions.</p> <p>The rates of new infections have begun to dip in much of the world, but the disease is continuing its deadly march in <strong>Latin</strong> <strong>America</strong>, which was described by the World Health Organization on Friday as \u201ca new epicentre\u201d of the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong> reported 150 new deaths, a record daily number that took the country\u2019s official death toll from Covid-19 to 3,249. Authorities reported 8,894 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 326,448.</p> <p><strong>China</strong>\u2019s 3,000-member National People\u2019s Congress opened in Beijing on Friday with a minute\u2019s silence for coronavirus victims. The gathering was delayed by two months and has been shortened to a week because of the pandemic.</p> <p>In an apparent acknowledgement of the steep challenges China faces from a stricken economy and increasing international hostility, the premier, Li Keqiang, said \u201cno specific target\u201d would be set for growth this year, for the first time since the country began publishing GDP goals in 1990.</p> <p>\u201cThis is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,\u201d Li said, adding that the government would instead \u201cgive priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Singapore</strong> said its case total now exceeded 30,000, with 612 new infections, almost entirely in cramped dormitories for the city state\u2019s low-paid migrant workers.</p> <p><strong>Thailand</strong> said it would maintain its state of emergency until the end of June. Shopping centres and department stores in the kingdom opened at the weekend for the first time in almost two months as the rate of infection slowed, but bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports remain off-limits.</p> <p>The WHO said <strong>Africa</strong> was approaching 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>The UN said the virus was assumed to be spreading throughout <strong>Yemen</strong>. Appealing for urgent funding, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said Yemen\u2019s healthcare system \u201chas in effect collapsed\u201d.</p> <p>He said aid workers were turning people away because of a lack of medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment in the war-ravaged country. Yemen\u2019s malnourished population has among the world\u2019s lowest immunity levels.</p> <p>Months before a general election in <strong>New Zealand</strong>, the leader of the main opposition party was ousted after a poll showed an 84% approval rating for the way the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has handled the pandemic.</p> <p>In the <strong>US</strong>, pictures emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a factory visit in Michigan. The president had earlier been called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear a mask during a tour of the plant.</p> <p>The <strong>Czech Republic</strong> said the virus remained under control nearly two weeks after shopping centres, cinemas and restaurant terraces were reopened. \u201cThe massive easing of 11 May did not affect the epidemiological curve,\u201d said the health minister, Adam Vojtech.</p> <p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, the government said the Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area \u2013 the two areas hardest hit by Covid-19 \u2013 would be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday.</p> <p>The loosening means all of Spain will now be in at least the second phase of the exit plan: people can meet in groups of up to 10, and restaurant and cafe terraces can reopen at 50% capacity. Places of worship will be able to operate at 30% capacity.</p> <p>The health minister, Salvador Illa, said 47% of the country would move to the third and penultimate stage on Monday, meaning people can visit shopping centres and eat inside restaurants, both of which will operate at 40% capacity.</p>",

But, he said: \u201cFundamentally mutations, especially here, are nothing to worry about ... it is just some kind of minor typo [in the genome] that are either neutral or actually often not favourable to the virus.\u201d<br><br><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108506v1\">The study</a>, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by a team of researchers in the UK and France, who scrutinised more than 15,000 coronavirus genomes collected from patients around the world since the outbreak began. <br><br>Across all the genomes they uncovered 6,822 mutations in total, relative to the ancestral genome, but none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Further analysis revealed 273 of the mutations cropped up repeatedly \u2013 with the team focusing on the 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cThere is no such thing as a European strain, an American strain, an Icelandic strain- there has been a lot of mixing from the beginning of the pandemic,\u201d said Balloux. <br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIf there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better, then we should see it happening multiple times,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a mutation that happened once over the pandemic, then that is most unlikely to be something beneficial [to the virus].\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">They then looked at whether these mutations made the virus more transmissible. \u201cWe just work out whether the ones that carry a mutation, whether they have more descendants, whether they are actually spreading faster [than closely related genomes without the mutation] \u2013 and the answer is no,\u201d said Balloux, adding the mutations could be introduced by enzymes involved in the body\u2019s immune system. In fact, the team says, some of the mutations studied seem to be actually harmful to the virus.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Balloux added that while there is not enough data as yet to explore whether mutations may make the virus more deadly or cause more severe symptoms, he said it is unlikely.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cViruses don\u2019t benefit from killing their hosts.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to unveil the plans at the daily Downing Street briefing later. The measures, which will be introduced next month, will be reviewed every three weeks, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said. Tony Smith, a former head of Border Force, said he was surprised quarantine measures had not been brought in sooner.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sir Paul Nurse: \u2018We are desperate for clear leadership\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute and 2001 Nobel laureate for medicine, has delivered a scathing attack on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe are desperate for clear leadership at all levels,\u201d he told the BBC. He said the UK had been \u201ctoo much on the back foot, increasingly playing catchup\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Care home boss calls for repeat testing</strong></p> \n  <p>Weekly testing of all residents and staff could help ease the Covid-19 outbreak in care homes, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest care providers said. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, which took part in a government pilot of whole-home testing, said asymptomatic cases meant the virus could spread without being noticed. He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is either once a week or once a fortnight. Some of the research that seems to have been done would suggest that weekly would be the most effective way. There was a real reluctance to test staff. They were going to test the residents but they were not going to test the staff. But that was the most highly likely way the infection could have come into the home.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Government borrowing hits record \u00a362bn in April</strong></p> \n  <p>UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993.</p> \n  <p><strong>Independent Sage warns against school reopening plan</strong></p> \n  <p>The Independent Sage committee has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The group, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says that new modelling of the coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September reduced the risk still further. A straw poll of Unison members working in schools in England found that the vast majority remain concerned over the safety of their workplaces opening to more pupils on 1 June.</p> \n  <p><strong>New spitting incident at a London station</strong></p> \n  <p>Union leaders have condemned another \u201cdisgusting and frightening\u201d spitting incident at a London station. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said a man approached staff at Mile End London underground station on Thursday and demanded they open the gate as he did not have a ticket for the barriers. He became aggressive and swore at an older female customer who intervened, and spat at her, said the union. British Transport Police were called and spit samples were taken from the female customer\u2019s face and arm. The incident follows the death of ticket office worker Belly Mujinga from coronavirus following an incident at London Victoria station.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T11:23:42.775Z\">at 12.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec7a7548f0864e579f15b59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T10:20:41.744Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello everyone.

Delaying until September reduced the risk still further.</p> \n  <p>The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so that new cases are found and isolated fast. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,\u201d Professor King said. </p> \n  <p>In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a \u201cvital\u201d part of the decision-making process.</p> \n  <p>The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes.</p> \n  <p>King said the decision of when to re-open schools was a \u201ccareful balance\u201d but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Professor King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance and England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty. </p> \n  <p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cSupport for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly.

The draft comes before China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament next week and is certain to be passed without change or real opposition.</p> \n<p>A draft version circulating on Friday would allow the \u201cnational security organs of the central people\u2019s government\u201d to set up outposts in Hong Kong, which has its own police force. These security bodies would \u201csafeguard national security,\u201d the document states.</p> \n<p>Last month Hong Kong authorities arrested 15 of the city\u2019s most prominent pro-democracy figures for illegal assembly; the new legislation could make such activists and campaigners still more vulnerable.</p> \n<p>The spectre of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 has hung over the last year of unrest in Hong Kong. Particularly as violence escalated, there were mounting concerns among demonstrators that police or military personnel might be sent over from the mainland to clear the streets \u2013 fears that are now likely to deepen, analysts said.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The draft] includes specifically a provision for mainland security forces to be deployed to Hong Kong if necessary, which suggests that they have already thought about this and are prepared to put it into the law,\u201d said Prof Steve Tsang, the director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo they are expecting the protests to come, and they are prepared to go and crush them. And I regrettably think they will crush them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, explicitly linked provisions of the new law to the \u201cdisturbances\u201d of the protest movement.</p> \n<p>She said in a statement that offences covered in the legislation were \u201cexactly the situations which the political and business sectors in Hong Kong and members of the public have been worrying about over the past year\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe emergence of various incidents involving explosives and firearms has posed the risk of terrorism, seriously jeopardising public safety,\u201d the statement said, adding a frequently stated and unsubstantiated charge that the protesters were manipulated by foreigners.</p> \n<p>Lam said late on Friday the new laws would improve business confidence in the city and would not damage the interests of foreign investors, China\u2019s state news agency <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/23/c_139080188.htm\">Xinhua reported</a>.</p> \n<p>For years Beijing had been chipping away at the autonomy that Hong Kong was guaranteed for 50 years when the British colonial administration handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997. But it has also had setbacks, with mass protests forcing authorities to drop a national security law in 2003 and more recently the extradition law that sparked last year\u2019s demonstrations.</p> \n<p>By passing laws for the city in Beijing, and allowing Chinese security forces to be stationed there, China\u2019s Communist party leadership is sweeping away even a pretence of autonomy. Helena Wong. a pro-democracy legislator, said: \u201cEven the [Hong Kong] government will not be able to regulate what the [Chinese security] agents do in Hong Kong.\u201d</p> \n<p>News of the law stunned Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy activists and lawmakers, and there was an outpouring of fear, grief and anger in the city. On Friday afternoon legislators protested against the decision in the legislature and were forcibly removed. Street demonstrations will follow, with the first mass gathering expected on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Downloads of VPN software that allows users to circumvent Chinese censorship and browse anonymously rose overnight after the law was announced.</p> \n<p>There is no hope that the legislation can be altered or delayed by people turning out on the streets in Hong Kong, but over the past year many protesters said they had come out on to the streets out of desperation rather than in real hope of change.</p> \n<p>Even if authorities have more tools to stop demonstrations, and an even clearer message of intent to break the movement, intimidation alone is unlikely to keep Hong Kong\u2019s people off the streets. Some will be hoping to garner international support, which they see as the only slim hope of pushing back against Beijing.</p> \n<p>Pompeo\u2019s statement attacking China\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d move was part of a strong chorus of international condemnation. In a joint statement with the Australian and Canadian foreign ministers, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the proposed new law, and he emphasised that the \u201clegally binding\u201d 1984 agreement \u2013 which promised Hong Kong 50 years of autonomy \u2013 remained in force.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaking such a law on Hong Kong\u2019s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019, under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n<p>A bipartisan bill being introduced by the US senators Chris Van Hollen and Pat Toomey would impose sanctions on officials and entities that enforce any new national security laws, the Washington Post reported.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s foreign ministry said it would fight back against any US attempt to influence the law.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/uk-has-too-much-at-stake-to-confront-china-over-hong-kong\">UK has too much at stake to confront China over Hong Kong</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is unclear how many western countries will have the appetite to enforce costly sanctions or other penalties at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is causing massive economic strain.</p> \n<p>Lam insisted that Hong Kong was and \u201cwill remain a very free society\u201d. She brushed off concerns about the economic impact of China\u2019s move.</p> \n<p>Hong Kong has functioned as a regional hub for many international companies who want to do business in China but also seek the protection of an independent judicial system.

Should the respected leader\u2019s view mellow in light of the extraordinary circumstances then Woakes expects the rest of the setup to fall in line.</p> <p>Woakes said: \u201cI\u2019m a believer that people serve their time, so to speak. He\u2019s gone through a tough time being left out of the World Cup; going on to see that team lift the trophy must have been difficult for him. I think if people have gone away for a time and worked on their weaknesses they should be allowed a second chance. In a way I felt sorry for him but I understand the decision from the management, captain and rest of the team.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t 100% know what will happen but I\u2019d be happy to see Alex back in England colours. I would imagine the majority would have the kind of views I have given. I don\u2019t know why anyone would see that any differently. We have a culture and an environment in the England squad we all try and pull in the right direction. If Alex is willing to do that then I imagine everyone would be happy to see him back.\u201d</p> <p>The white-ball team\u2019s goal of a second global title will probably be delayed by the expected postponement of the T20 World Cup in Australia this October (the slot for which looks set to be taken by a rescheduled Indian Premier League). It means the Test team will take priority selection-wise this summer \u2013 if that was not already the case \u2013 and not least since movement between formats is likely to be restricted by the bio-secure measures in place.</p> <p>Although he is the leader of the attack in one-day internationals, Woakes is among the red-ball bowlers who resumed individual training during the past two days with an hour-long session at Edgbaston that included five overs bowling at \u201c50%\u201d and fitness work, supervised at a distance by the Warwickshire physio, Gerhard Mostert. His day began with a temperature check at home, the results of which are entered into an app, before arriving at the ground in full kit, making regular use of the hand-washing stations and training with a batch of balls that only he is permitted to touch.</p> <p>A temporary ban on using saliva to shine the ball is expected to be confirmed by the International Cricket Council and so the 31-year-old expects players will need to work harder to get swing during the proposed six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan.</p> <p>Woakes, who has been forced to train wearing an alice band due to 12 weeks without a haircut, said: \u201cFrom a bowler\u2019s point of view we\u2019ve just got to find a way to shine it for harder and longer to find a way of getting some shine on the ball. Thankfully it\u2019s a Dukes ball and not a Kookaburra this summer, because then we would be struggling. I\u2019m sure we will find a way of getting some shine and making sure it does move off the straight.</p> <p>\u201d<br></p>",

The US president then claimed hydroxychloroquine \u2013 less toxic than the original chloroquine \u2013 was a cure, and later said he was taking it himself against coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The drugs are fairly safe for patients being treated for malaria, but Covid-19 is a very different disease. The authors of the paper pulled together results for more than 96,000 patients in 671 hospitals, taking one of the drugs, with or without an antibiotic such as azithromycin, between 20 December and 14 April.</p> \n<p>The death rate among all groups taking the drugs was higher than among people who were not given them. One in six of those taking one of the drugs died, while one in five died if they were taking chloroquine with an antibiotic, and one in four if they were on hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic.

But the US authors of the study say, allowing for these differences, there was still higher mortality among those taking the drugs.</p> \n<p>The team also found that serious cardiac arrhythmias, which cause the lower chamber of the heart to beat rapidly and irregularly, were more common in all the groups receiving one of the four treatment regimens. The biggest increase was in the group treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic, where 8% of patients developed a heart arrhythmia compared with 0.3% of patients not given the drugs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the first large-scale study to find statistically robust evidence that treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with Covid-19,\u201d said Prof Mandeep R Mehra, lead author of the study and executive director of the Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital advanced heart disease center in Boston, US.</p> \n<p>\u201cInstead, our findings suggest it may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death.

It threatens to undermine all the cherished institutions and rights that distinguish this international city from mainland China. The legislation is designed to prevent \u201csedition, subversion, secession and treason\u201d, but the manner in which it is being introduced is undercutting Hong Kong\u2019s relative autonomy, its independent judiciary and its legislature.</p> <p>The issue has always been controversial. In 1989, Beijing became worried by Hong Kong\u2019s support for the pro-democracy movement in China; it requested that the territory draft anti-subversion laws on its own after 1997, when Hong Kong was handed over to China by Britain. Although this is required by article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/hong-kongs-security-laws-what-are-they-and-why-are-they-so-controversial\"> the Basic Law</a>, it has never been enacted. In 2003, the Hong Kong government tried to introduce the legislation, resulting in street protests of half a million people. This time, following months of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/the-stakes-are-higher-hong-kongs-battle-lines-redrawn-for-post-covid-protests\">bitter protests</a>, Beijing has clearly run out of patience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China\u2019s Communist party has shown that it can outplay the protest movement with the very same crash-and-burn strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress \u2013 delayed by two months because of the global pandemic \u2013 the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3085574/two-sessions-2020-beijing-sets-sights-hong-kong-legal\">announced</a> that Beijing would impose the legislation on Hong Kong by adding it to an annex of the Basic Law. This bypasses Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, whose procedural gridlock climaxed last week with pro-democracy legislators being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-52702076\">carried out</a> by security guards while a pro-Beijing politician was installed as a committee chair. Beijing is effectively taking away Hong Kong\u2019s right to legislate for itself, promulgating laws that will be forced upon the territory.</p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has said that safeguarding national security is necessary and urgent, given \u201cthe mutual disruption approach\u201d adopted by radical protesters and the deadlocked legislature. But one measure of the speed with which these measures are being rushed through was her answer at a press conference to the question of who would be responsible for enforcing the law. \u201cI am unable to give you all the details today,\u201d she said. The law is expected to be approved by the National People\u2019s Congress as early as 28 May, when the plenary session winds down. It could be in Hong Kong\u2019s books by the end of June.</p> <p>The decision to bypass Hong Kong\u2019s government and legislature shatters any pretence that the city still enjoys \u201cthe high degree of autonomy\u201d that it was promised in 1997. The method of promulgation also undermines the independence of Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary and its rule of law, equally prized by the Hong Kong population and the multinational businesses headquartered here. As news of the decision broke out, the stock market <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-markets/hong-kong-stocks-drop-5-as-beijing-pushes-security-law-idUSP8N2B401N\">plunged</a> by 5.5%, its biggest fall in five years, with property stocks and banks the worst hit.</p> <p>Draft copies of the legislation, viewed by reporters in Beijing, <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1527656-20200522.htm\">indicate</a> that mainland security agencies will be allowed to operate in Hong Kong. These security services often target dissidents, rights lawyers and journalists in China. In Hong Kong, it is believed that at least one of the five booksellers that disappeared from the territory in 2016 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/missing-british-bookseller-appears-on-television\">abducted</a> by mainland security agents. The legislation might also mean an end to the freedoms of speech and assembly that Hong Kongers have enjoyed since 1997 \u2013 even as these freedoms were gradually curtailed in recent years.</p> <p>In Hong Kong, the news was met with numb disbelief. It was \u201cthe saddest day in Hong Kong\u2019s history\u201d according to the pro-democratic Civic party politician Tanya Chan. The very vagueness of mainland Chinese definitions of sedition, subversion and secession could criminalise groups such as religious believers, political parties advocating greater autonomy and even those who organised Hong Kong\u2019s massive protests, some of which saw more than 1 million participants.</p> <p>Given that Hong Kong\u2019s future autonomy is now uncertain, the move also brings into question the city\u2019s future as an international business centre. The news was met by protests in the legislative council and calls for more street action in spite of the ongoing restrictions on gatherings of more than eight people due to the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">'This is the end of Hong Kong': China pushes controversial security laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hong Kong\u2019s defenders have often hoped the city would be protected by its role as a world city, thanks in no small part to the institutions that distinguish it from mainland China.

  "<p>Donations will be quarantined for 72 hours and customers required to use hand sanitiser before browsing the clothes rails and handling the bric-a-brac on the shelves, under plans drawn up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/nov/09/charity-shops-are-what-conscious-consumers-need-we-must-defend-them\">the UK\u2019s charity shops </a>as they prepare to reopen their doors in June.</p> <p>Charities have been badly hit by the lockdown, with some reporting millions of pounds a month lost as a result of shops being closed. Many are keen to reopen, but rules around physical distancing and hygiene mean they may have to operate on reduced hours and put new rules in place for both donors and shoppers.</p> <p>Barnardo\u2019s will be among the first to start trading, with plans to reopen 70 of its 700 UK shops in England from 15 June, with staff and volunteers restarting the previous week to begin preparations.</p> <p>In line with <a href=\"https://www.charityretail.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CRA-charity-shop-reopening-pack-V3.0-May-14-2020.pdf\">guidance </a>issued by the Charity Retail Association (CRA) it will be putting all new donations \u2013 from clothing to books, china and glass \u2013 into quarantine for a minimum of 72 hours to reduce the risk of contamination. Donors will be directed to \u201cdonation\u2019\u201d points, such as empty shops or warehouses, rather than just leaving goods in doorways and outside shops. All changing rooms will be closed.</p> <p>Preparations for reopening also include hiring waste companies to deal with the donations that have piled up, unsorted, outside shops in city and town centres since lockdown.</p> <p>Charities rely heavily on income from their high street and online retail operations to shore up their fundraising operations, but receipts have plummeted since the shops closed. Small regional charities with no national support network have been particularly hard hit.</p> <p>Cancer Research UK estimates the impact of coronavirus to be a 20-25% drop in its fundraising income \u2013 a shortfall of \u00a3120m. It is planning a phased reopening of its shops in England from 29 June \u2013 subject to government guidance.</p> <p>Jo Mewett, head of retail for Cancer Research UK said: \u201cWe\u2019re planning significant safety measures and putting new processes in place for receiving and handling donations. These include installing hand sanitiser stations, cough guards, contactless payment and face coverings for staff, as well as floor markings inside our larger superstores.<strong> </strong>Donated items will have a quarantine period before they are sorted to be sold in stores.\u201d</p> <p>The plan is similar at the British Heart Foundation, which has 750 UK stores as well as an online operation, and has lost around \u00a310m a month as a result of the lockdown.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/20/oxfam-to-close-in-18-countries-and-cut-1500-staff-amid-coronavirus-pressures\">Oxfam</a> \u2013 which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/20/oxfam-to-close-in-18-countries-and-cut-1500-staff-amid-coronavirus-pressures\">particularly under pressure</a> \u2013 is also urging members of the public to hold on to items and donate them when its 650 shops and donation banks are open again.

An earlier version said that Barnardo\u2019s planned to reopen 70 of its shops on 8 June. That was an option considered at the time of publication. However, after publication Barnardo\u2019s contacted the Guardian to say that subsequent to government guidance the planned date to reopen those shops is 15 June.

  "<p>The government has unveiled a major shift in border policy to be introduced next month in a bid to prevent a second wave of Covid-19 in the UK.</p> \n<h2>What has been announced?</h2> \n<p>All arrivals into the UK, apart from a short list of exemptions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/22/uk-arrivals-8-june-quarantine-for-14-days-coronavirus\">will be required to self-isolate for 14 days</a> from 8 June.</p> \n<h2>How will it work?</h2> \n<p>All arriving passengers will be required to fill in a contact locator form with contact and travel information so they can be reached if they, or someone they may have been in contact with, develops the disease.</p> \n<h2>Is it being enforced?</h2> \n<p>Yes. Anyone failing to comply may face enforcement action. A breach of self-isolation would be punishable with a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England or potential prosecution and unlimited fine. The level of fine could increase if the risk of infection from abroad increases. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will set out their own enforcement approaches.</p> \n<p>Border Force will undertake checks at the border and may refuse entry to any non-British citizen who refuses to comply with the regulations and is not resident in the UK.</p> \n<p>Failure to complete the contact locator form will be punishable by a \u00a3100 fixed penalty notice.</p> \n<p>Public health authorities will conduct random checks in England to ensure compliance with self-isolation requirements.</p> \n<p>Removal from the country would be considered as a last resort for foreign nationals who refuse to comply.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why is this happening now?</h2> \n<p>The Home Office says that as the transmission rate in the UK falls and the number of travellers arriving increases, imported cases may pose a larger threat as they could become a higher proportion of the overall number of infections in the UK and increase the spread of the disease.</p> \n<p>Air passenger arrivals into the UK have plunged 99% during the lockdown period, although at least 95,000 people arrived in April alone.</p> \n<h2>Why didn\u2019t it happen before?</h2> \n<p>The Home Office chief scientific adviser, Prof John Aston, says that while there has been significant community transmission of the virus within the UK, the impact of putting in place additional border restrictions would have been negligible to the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>However, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/air-passenger-quarantine-plan-makes-no-sense-uk-adviser-says\">has faced criticism</a> for not enforcing stricter measures in the first three months of the year when the pandemic began. In late February and early March the policy was to advise all arrivals from a shortlist of global regions, including Wuhan in China, to self-isolate, but this was withdrawn on 13 March. Since then arrivals have been given leaflets on the border advising them of lockdown restrictions.</p> \n<h2>Are there any exemptions?</h2> \n<p>There will be limited exemptions and a full list will be published on <a href=\"http://gov.uk/\">Gov.uk</a>. The Home Office has already confirmed the following will be exempt:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Road haulage and freight workers, to ensure the supply of goods is not impacted.</p></li> \n <li><p>Medical professionals who are travelling to help with the fight against coronavirus.</p></li> \n <li><p>Anyone moving from within the common travel area, covering Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p></li> \n <li><p>Seasonal agricultural workers who will self-isolate on the property where they are working.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How long will it last?</h2> \n<p>The government is going to review the measures every three weeks. Looking further ahead, it has said it will look at more options including air bridges \u2013 agreements between countries who both have low transmission rates to recognise their respective screening measures for departing passengers and removing the need for quarantine measures for incoming passengers.</p>",

Soros reckons the EU would only need to offer a 0.5% annual interest payment. That\u2019s the equivalent of raising a whopping \u20ac1trn and only repay \u20ac5bn per year. Forever. </p> <p>Soros says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures. Perpetual bonds or consols are such a measure. They should not even be considered in normal times. But if the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts. This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.</p> <p>The coronavirus and climate change are threatening not only people\u2019s lives but the survival of our civilization.</p> <p>The European Union is particularly vulnerable because it is based on the rule of law and the wheels of justice turn proverbially slowly. By contrast the coronavirus moves very fast and in unpredictable ways.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>In order to borrow so cheaply, the EU would need to maintain a AAA credit rating</strong>. That would mean agreeing taxes to cover the cost of servicing the bonds. A long process, that would be opposed by those who won\u2019t accept collective borrowing.</p> <p>But Soros has a solution:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The taxes only have to be authorized; they don\u2019t need to be implemented. Authorization should take a few weeks, not a few years.

But it\u2019s very clear that the retail activity will remain worrying weak for some time yet and that the government will have to borrow a few hundred billion pounds this year.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Thomson-Cook, </strong>chief economist at financial services group Equals, says we should welcome<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/may/22/uk-government-borrowing-record-high-april-retail-sales-slump-covid-19-coronavirus-business-live?page=with:block-5ec767ce8f08a1782fa7f6b7#block-5ec767ce8f08a1782fa7f6b7\"> the jump in borrowing</a> - the alternative is worse.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK\u2019s budget deficit is at the highest level since records began in 1993.

Unlike previous generations, the young have been unwilling to take to the streets to galvanise political change.</p> <p>Yet, they have enthusiastically embraced individual causes. Top of their list has been climate change. Pressure from young voters (and from those not yet able to vote) contributed to the UK, Welsh and Scottish governments each declaring a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate emergency</a> in 2019.

In the US, where the unemployment rate hit 24.9% in 1933, President Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Deal\u201d was a mainstay of recovery. Policies to help the young were central. Taking some lessons from that history might help the UK maintain its stocks of human and social capital, those essential building blocks of a productive economy, which were cruelly dissipated in past recessions, particularly those of the 1980s.</p> <p>Roosevelt\u2019s favourite New Deal policy was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It hired young, unmarried men to work on conservation and development of natural resources in rural areas. During its nine years of operation, 3 million young men, mainly aged 18 to 25, passed through the CCC. Most of the jobs were manual. It was credited with improving the employability, wellbeing and fitness of participants.</p> <p>Introducing a UK version of the CCC focused on mitigating climate change risks and aimed at those aged 16 to 24 could avoid the creation of yet another \u201clost generation\u201d, scarred by long spells of unemployment. It would build on the enthusiasm of the young to save the planet. There is no shortage of issues to address \u2013 flood risks, tree planting, domestic heating conversion, renewable energy, restoring biodiversity etc. Funding would come partly from expanded allocations to the relevant departments in the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. Organisation could build on the successes of public/private sector and community initiatives during the pandemic. No brainer?</p>",

It is only a matter of time before the death toll reaches 100,000.</p> <p>During the Democratic primary, Biden spoke of restoring normalcy after four years of Donald Trump, frequently appealing to voters\u2019 nostalgia for the presidency of Barack Obama. But now, as he faces the general election amid the deepening economic turmoil, the presumptive Democratic nominee is reaching for the legacy of a radical American president: Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p> <p>\u201cThe blinders have been taken off,\u201d Biden told supporters recently during a virtual fundraiser from his Delaware home, where he has been since March. \u201cBecause of this Covid crisis, I think people are realizing, \u2018My Lord, look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, Biden, who has climbed above Trump in national polls, has openly courted progressive leaders and ideas, adopting some of the populist rhetoric more commonly associated with his vanquished rivals, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. In turn, they have offered their full-throated endorsements, casting Biden, a pragmatic dealmaker who still believes in bipartisan comity, as the perhaps unlikely herald of a new progressive era.</p> <p>\u201cA shift of frame matters \u2013 it\u2019s not to be underestimated,\u201d the California congressman Ro Khanna, who was a co-chair of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, said of Biden\u2019s bold messaging. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different vision for what he thinks the next four years should be about.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Biden nor Trump has yet laid out their vision for what the first 100 days of a new presidency might look like, a benchmark established by FDR during which he offered a series of sweeping reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478/0_0_3000_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\ufeffBut Biden and his economic advisers believe they must be prepared to marshal a far more ambitious domestic agenda than they initially imagined. During daily virtual meetings, Biden and his team are beginning to draft a new governing vision that reflects the scale and urgency of the crisis that Biden predicted may \u201ceclipse what FDR faced\u201d.</p> <p>The task is not entirely new to Biden. As vice-president, he led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the recession, and his campaign hopes to leverage his remarkably scandal-free stewardship of the nearly $800bn stimulus package with Trump\u2019s handling of the economy.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, Biden said he would share a detailed plan \u201cfor the right kind of economic recovery\u201d, aspects of which are expected to include massive investment in public health, expansive legislative action on climate change, and broad new protections for workers.</p> <p>Last week, Biden announced six policy taskforces \u2013 centered around issues that include healthcare, climate and the economy \u2013 that pair his supporters with ideological allies of Sanders. Among those chosen to participate are some of the young, progressive leaders most skeptical of his approach, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p> <p>In a joint press release announcing the taskforces, Biden said the groups would help \u201ctransform our country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVice-President Biden understands in his gut that this is a totally different order of magnitude than any president has ever dealt with,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union and a member of the healthcare taskforce.</p> <p>Henry said the coronavirus has exposed the underlying causes of the US\u2019s problems, calling public attention to issues she believes government and business leaders can no longer afford to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cWe had [38] million people that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">have lost jobs</a>. But that\u2019s on top of the 64 million Americans who already made less than $15 an hour before Covid,\u201d she said. Without paid sick leave, some essential workers are reporting for work even if they feel ill because they can\u2019t afford the alternative while fast-food and healthcare workers stage protests to demand protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of inequality has sort of hit people between the eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Jared Bernstein, one of Biden\u2019s economic advisers, said Biden was looking beyond the \u201ccyclical\u201d challenges posed by the pandemic to the many \u201cstructural\u201d problems it has revealed.</p> <p>\u201cBiden is, I think, developing a particularly robust agenda that really strikes at this reality that the Trump economy was built on a house of sand and has turned out to be totally non-resilient to any shock,\u201d said Bernstein, who advised Biden during his tenure as vice-president.</p> <p>Biden, Bernstein said, recognizes the need for an \u201curgent expansion\u201d that better insulates the American economy from the \u201cshocks that are coming fast and furiously\u201d not as a direct result of the pandemic but from climate change and income inequality.</p> <p>Biden has also made other gestures. He has adopted aspects of Sanders\u2019 free college tuition proposal. He has embraced Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bankruptcy proposal and joined with the senator, viewed as a potential running mate, to call for better oversight of how the Trump administration spends the coronavirus relief fund. </p> <p>Critics on the left have scoffed at the notion of Biden as an FDR-style visionary. After all, they say, Biden once told supporters that under his presidency \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d.</p> <p>David Sirota, a former adviser to Sanders 2020 presidential campaign, dismissed Biden\u2019s overtures to the left as performative politics \u2013 a \u201ccanned SNL skit\u201d that progressives were being asked to accept as \u201csomething real\u201d.</p> <p>\ufeffRepublicans, meanwhile, view Biden\u2019s expanding policy aspirations as a political gift. After the taskforce members were announced, the Republican National Committee tagged Biden a \u201cbanner-man for the socialist agenda\u201d.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s policy platform \u2013 which includes a public option for healthcare and an aggressive plan to combat the climate crisis \u2013 might have been considered far-reaching in another presidential cycle. But during the primary he resisted pressure from activists to embrace progressive litmus-test items such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.</p> <p>Campaign aides and allies say Biden\u2019s calls for change are part of a policy evolution in response to the crisis, not a sudden embrace of a Sanders-style agenda. Biden himself has pointed to his nearly 50-year political career as a guide for how he would make \u201cinstitutional\u201d changes \u201cwithout us becoming a socialist country, or any of that malarkey\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Gwin, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cHe\u2019s scaling up the solutions he\u2019s proposed so that we can meet this moment, get through this crisis, and ensure that we come out on the other end with a stronger middle class and a more resilient country.\u201d</p> <p>Surrounding his planning for the presidency is the uncertainty over who will control the House and Senate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/us-senate-democrats-elections-2020\">which is suddenly within reach for Democrats</a>. Yet there are signs that the coronavirus, and Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, have scrambled the political calculus, giving Biden new latitude to move in a far bolder direction.</p> <p>A recent survey by the non-partisan <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">Pew Research Center</a> found that the public\u2019s view of the economy has darkened dramatically: just 23% of Americans describe the economic outlook as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, down from 57% at the start of the year. The same poll found <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">overwhelming</a> support for the $2tn coronavirus relief measure passed by Congress last month, a marked contrast from the<a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2009/03/16/obamas-approval-rating-slips-amid-division-over-economic-proposals/\"> polarized, partisan views</a> of the stimulus package passed to stem the economic fallout from the Great Recession.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t underscore enough the extent to which this economic moment is unprecedented,\u201d said Steph Sterling, vice-president of advocacy and policy at the liberal Roosevelt Institute. \u201cOur institutions need to shift to meet the moment in a way that only government can.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is widespread frustration at the British government\u2019s muted initial response to China\u2019s plans to impose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/chinas-national-security-law-ban-subversion-and-separatism-hong-kong\">new security laws in Hong Kong</a>, raising the perennial questions about what the UK can realistically do to persuade China to protect the territory\u2019s cherished freedoms.</p> <p>Johnny Patterson, the chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, described the UK\u2019s response so far to the planned crackdown as \u201climp, inane and could have been copied and pasted directly from their previous statements\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was utterly inappropriate given the gravity of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing\u2019s decision to impose the worst kind of draconian legislation without consulting the [Hong Kong] legislative council is a direct breach of the handover agreement. Given Britain\u2019s moral and legal duties as co-signatories of that settlement, the prime minister should be leading the way in calling it out and drawing together like-minded countries to coordinate a joint response.\u201d</p> <p>A subsequent UK, Canada and Australia statement issued on Friday was tougher in tone.</p> <p>Arguably, the chances of forcing China to rethink are dependent not on the UK government \u2013 which handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a 50-year form of semi-autonomy known as one country, two systems \u2013 but largely on the reactions of others, notably the markets, the people of Hong Kong and the US Senate.</p> <p>The UK, as former colonial power and joint signatory of the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration, could seek to persuade Chinese diplomats that the destruction of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms will destroy its economic value to China. It could also warn that the measures will provoke the kind of street protests that forced China to shelve a clampdown the last time this was attempted, in 2003. Months of new protests would only damage Beijing\u2019s image, already tarnished by allegations of a coronavirus cover-up and negligence.</p> <p>The UK Foreign Office could privately lobby the US to end Hong Kong\u2019s preferential trading status by declaring it is no longer an autonomous jurisdiction. Moves to this effect are already under way on a bipartisan basis in the US, and could become a focus of revived plans for a G7 leaders\u2019 meeting in Washington next month. The UK foreign affairs select committee chairman, Tom Tugenhadt, applauded the tough initial US response, saying: \u201cBeijing is killing the one country, two systems model followed by all President Xi\u2019s predecessors. He\u2019s turning his back on the past.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from that, the UK in extremis could offer sanctuary to as many as 150,000 British national overseas passport owners in Hong Kong \u2013 something the Home Office has resisted but which has support from the liberal internationalists on the Tory benches.</p> <p>But the government is leery of confronting China or enlisting in Donald Trump\u2019s trade war on the country. At both official and business level, cooperation between China and the UK remains intense. In recent weeks the chancellor, the health secretary and the deputy national security adviser have all spoken with the Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming.</p> <p>The golden era hailed by the former prime minister David Cameron may be over, but the UK does not favour Trump\u2019s economic decoupling. The UK is the number one European destination for Chinese foreign investment, which in the past five years has equalled the sum in the previous 30 years. China is also the UK\u2019s third largest market. Trade has slumped in recent months but may rebound.</p> <p>Indeed Liu, speaking to 1,500 CBI members in a webinar on Wednesday, portrayed the UK and China as \u201cthe flagbearers for free trade and globalisation beyond Covid-19\u201d, contrasting that alliance with Trump\u2019s protectionism and flouting of a rules-based order.</p> <p>In the view of Nicolas Veron, of the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel, it is almost as if the UK, weakened after Brexit, could become a site of competition or testing ground between China and the US as they each seek the UK\u2019s allegiance.</p> <p>The ambassador seemed confident that the UK government was not about to turn against his country. \u201cWe heard some politicians spreading this argument for \u2018decoupling\u2019, and some even go so far as to preaching the cold war rhetoric against China, and that is very harmful. I had webinars with the Chinese business community because they are very concerned. They do not know how pervasive, how massive and how influential this rhetoric is.

  "<p>The UK government\u2019s approval of a large new gas-fired power plant has been ruled legal by the high court. A legal challenge was brought after ministers overruled climate change objections from planning authorities.</p> <p>The plant, which is being developed by Drax in North Yorkshire, would be the biggest gas power station in Europe, and could account for 75% of the UK\u2019s power sector emissions when fully operational, according to lawyers for ClientEarth, which brought the judicial review.</p> <p>The planning inspectorate recommended that ministers <a href=\"https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/EN010091/EN010091-001253-FINAL%20Drax%20Recommendation%20Report.pdf\">refuse permission for the 3.6GW gas plant</a> because it \u201cwould undermine the government\u2019s commitment, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008, to cut greenhouse emissions\u201d by having \u201csignificant adverse effects\u201d.</p> <p>It was the first big project rejected by planners because of the climate crisis. However, Andrea Leadsom, who was secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy at the time of the planning application, <a href=\"https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/EN010091/EN010091-001251-Drax%20Re-Powering%20Decision%20Letter%20of%204%20October%202019%20Signature%20Copy.pdf\">rejected the advice</a> and gave the go-ahead in October. </p> <p>The government\u2019s actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny at the moment as the UK will host a UN summit in early 2021. At the meeting, nations will need to dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/most-countries-climate-plans-totally-inadequate-experts\">avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures</a>. For the summit to be successful, experts say, the host nation needs to take a leadership role at home.</p> <p>Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at ClientEarth, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very dissatisfied by today\u2019s judgment, rejecting our arguments against the lawfulness of the government\u2019s decision and of its approach to assessing the project\u2019s carbon lock-in risk. We will consider an appeal.\u201d</p> <p>A Drax spokeswoman said: \u201cDrax power station plays a vital role in the UK\u2019s energy system, generating reliable, flexible electricity for millions of homes and businesses. The development of new high-efficiency gas power would support the UK\u2019s decarbonising energy system.\u201d</p> <p>She said the company\u2019s ambition was to remove, not add, carbon to the atmosphere by 2030. It would do this by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. The gas plant is capable of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future, the company says.</p> <p>John Sauven, the head of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cBuilding new gas-fired power stations when the UK has a net zero carbon target is hardly showing climate leadership. It also makes little economic sense. The costs are already higher than for renewable options like wind and solar. Investing money to increase pollution may still be legal but it\u2019s no longer defensible.\u201d</p> <p>ClientEarth argued that the combination of the project\u2019s large scale, level of emissions and long operating life made it a significant threat to the UK\u2019s carbon targets. The group has previously inflicted three defeats on ministers over their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/high-court-rules-uk-air-pollution-plans-unlawful\">failure to tackle air pollution</a>.</p> <p>The planning inspectorate concluded that wind and solar power would cut energy bills for consumers, while the proposed gas plant would not. \u201cBoth [Drax] and [National Grid] confirmed that it is the production of renewable plants that will deliver cheaper energy,\u201d it said.</p> <p>This year there have been a series of legal actions against polluting infrastructure projects on climate grounds. Last week the Good Law Project launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/18/legal-case-launched-over-uks-outdated-energy-policies\">legal action</a> over decade-old energy policies that it said the government was using to approve fossil fuel projects such as Drax\u2019s gas plant, even after ministers had pledged to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.</p> <p>In April, Transport Action Network <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/21/campaigners-take-legal-action-over-27bn-uk-road-building-scheme\">launched a legal challenge</a> to try to prevent billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money being spent on a huge road-building programme, which it said breached the UK\u2019s legal commitments to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution.</p> <p>In February the court of appeal ruled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-chang\">plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport were illegal</a> because ministers did not adequately take into account the government\u2019s climate commitments. This was the first major ruling in the world to be based on the 2015 <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\">Paris climate change agreement</a>. Heathrow is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.internationalairportreview.com/news/117096/heathrow-third-runway-challenge-court-ruling/\">overturn this decision in the supreme court</a>.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cWe welcome the high court\u2019s ruling issued today which supports the secretary of state\u2019s decision to grant consent for the Drax repowering project. We are going further and faster than any other major economy in taking action on climate change.</p> <p>\u201cAs we transition to net zero emissions in 2050, natural gas can provide a reliable source of energy while our world class renewables sector continues to grow, supported by record levels of investment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Bob Geldof doesn\u2019t do nostalgia.

From mouthy young punk star with opinions to spare; to Saint Bob, the impassioned campaigner behind Live Aid, one of the biggest global fundraising initiatives of all time; to a tragic figure who lost his first wife, the TV presenter Paula Yates, and their second daughter, Peaches, to drug overdoses.</p> <p>The new documentary is an attempt not simply to remind us of those early days, but also to reposition the Rats as the ultimate in influential outsider bands, a group that came out of the grey repression of Holy Catholic Ireland in the 1970s with the belief that it could \u2013 and should \u2013 change the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fbb2eb35df23a28f221670b41f122499ef492a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fbb2eb35df23a28f221670b41f122499ef492a4/0_0_5013_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Boomtown Rats, pictured in 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Boomtown Rats, pictured in 1978.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fin Costello/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe needed to change our lives and the only way to do that was to get the fuck out Ireland,\u201d Geldof says, adding that it always infuriated him that the group were seen as \u201csome kind of Johnny-come-latelies \u2026 when really we were Johnny-come-earlies\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an assumption that we\u2019d jumped on a bandwagon because there was no understanding that our songs were written against the background of the Ireland we came from, a culture that was enshrined in aspic where the authorities were desperately trying to hold on to power and there was no hope.\u201d</p> <p>A new album, also called Citizens of Boomtown, the band\u2019s first in 36 years, has been released, and had it not been for the coronavirus pandemicthe next few months would have been spent promoting it. \u201cAlthough obviously that\u2019s all up in the air now.

  "<p>Few residents of the world\u2019s great metropolises would have thought much about plagues before this year. Outside China and east Asia \u2013 made vigilant by swine flu and Sars \u2013 the trauma of pandemics such as Spanish flu or typhoid has largely faded from popular memory. But our cities remember.</p> <p>An outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-pandemics-have-changed-american-cities-often-for-the-better-137945\">prompted administrators</a> to take over the task of cleaning streets, clearing gutters and collecting rubbish. It worked, and governments across the US adopted the responsibility over the next decades. A misconception that the odour emanating from wastewater was responsible for diseases such as cholera prompted one of <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/cholera-pandemic-new-york-city-london-paris-green-space\">the world\u2019s first modern underground sewer systems</a> in London, and the development of wider, straighter and paved roads - which helped prevent water from stagnating.</p> <p>Cities have evolved over the centuries according to theories of how to fight disease, turning features such as public parks and sewers into \u201ca mundane part of city thinking\u201d, says Michele Acuto, a professor of global urban politics at the University of Melbourne.</p> <p>The legacy Covid-19 might leave on the world\u2019s great cities is being hotly debated, although most specialists admit it is too early to know for sure. \u201cIt will depend in the end on how we analyse this virus: how is it spreading? How is it making people sick?\u201d says Roger Keil, a professor of environmental studies at Toronto\u2019s York University. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the full answers, but once they become clearer, urban planners and other professionals will start to think as their predecessors did 100 years ago, as they laid sewer pipes and cleaned out parts of the city that were considered insalubrious.\u201d</p> <p>The sanitary infrastructure that trails in the wake of Covid-19 may be digital, Acuto says, in the form of the surveillance technology used by cities such as Singapore and Seoul to retrace the steps of infected people and warn others who have crossed their path. Life in the megacities of the future will be less private than ever.</p> <p>Some of the changes already taking shape may make cities more pleasurable: mayors from Bogot\u00e1 to Budapest are taking the opportunity to lay down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/cleaner-and-greener-covid-19-prompts-worlds-cities-to-free-public-space-of-cars\">vast networks of bike lanes</a>. Athens is widening its pavements, enlarging public squares and banning traffic from areas beneath the Acropolis. The pandemic has strengthened the case for making neighbourhoods self-sufficient, in the vein of Melbourne\u2019s plan to put shopping, leisure and work <a href=\"https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/policy-and-strategy/planning-for-melbourne/plan-melbourne/20-minute-neighbourhoods\">within 20 minutes of its residents\u2019 homes</a>, or the promise by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/paris-mayor-unveils-15-minute-city-plan-in-re-election-campaign\">transform it </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/paris-mayor-unveils-15-minute-city-plan-in-re-election-campaign\"> into a 15-minute city</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"405d9f60c4111318072bc3a02bdd68ea8da42cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/405d9f60c4111318072bc3a02bdd68ea8da42cf1/0_406_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk on a closed street as part of New York City\u2019s Open Streets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk on a closed street as part of New York City\u2019s Open Streets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the good news. The bad is that the pandemic is a catastrophe for many of the things that make cities worth living in. Busy streets, squares and nightclubs will be zones for transmission for as long as the virus lasts. And once it does abate, many of the comedy clubs, bars, galleries and theatres that have shuttered their doors may never reopen. \u201cIt\u2019s crippling to the life and energy of New York,\u201d says Roddy Bottum, a member of the band Faith No More and a fixture of the city\u2019s music scene.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many venues in the city that are small, and have to keep up their month-to-month payments. How are those places going to survive? How will opera take place, or Broadway shows? Social distancing in the audience and masks on stage? It\u2019s horrifying to think about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible for a while,\u201d says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of geography and urban studies at Temple University. \u201cPeople have to get used to the idea of sitting closely again. Then they have to have enough job security and money to blow 100 quid on an evening of interpretative dance.\u201d</p> <p>But he is among those who are bullish on the prospects of a resurgence of city life. \u201cThe modern city is indestructible,\u201d he says. \u201cFires, earthquakes, bombings, the blitz of London or the siege of Stalingrad: these cities lost population, but then they came back.\u201d</p> <p>People return for fundamental reasons, he says. They need work, and cities create lots of it. \u201cCities are engines of economic growth,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want work, you eventually have to come to the cities, because the density makes work more efficient. They are the most innovative and creative places in the world; where the creative types, the artists, the scientists, compete and collaborate. If there is going to be a rebound, it\u2019s not going to be in the rural areas. It\u2019s going to be in the cities.\u201d</p> <p>But the rebound might not be strongest in the cities that currently have superstar status. People were already leaving the cores of metropolises such as New York and Paris before Covid struck, says Joel Kotkin, a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University in California. London\u2019s population was being sustained <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c88b4c54-b925-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea203\">only by international arrivals</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe outmigration was being accelerated by several factors,\u201d Kotkin says. \u201cMillennials are getting into their 30s and are thinking of buying a house, getting married, having kids, and of course the pandemic is going to make space more attractive. And the kind of urban development we\u2019ve had has produced enormous inequality, much worse in the big cities, and that was chasing people out.\u201d</p> <p>The enforced experiment in working by Zoom over recent months might convince some they can survive outside big cities. Downtown offices were falling <a href=\"https://www.regus.com/work-us/revolutionising-how-to-sell-workspace/\">out of favour</a> for years even before Covid sent tens of millions of employees home \u2013 companies such as Twitter and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-employees-work-from-home-rest-of-the-year-2020-5\">Salesforce</a> have already said they will allow workers to stay there. The need to physically distance their employees may require companies to rent even more expensive office space, adding to the allure of alternative arrangements.</p> <p>It is true that cities have historically bounced back from pandemics, Kotkin adds, \u201cbut some went through hundreds of years of decline. They pay a price. They won\u2019t disappear, but we\u2019ll have a much more dispersed world.\u201d</p> <p>If the fate of the metropolis is to be decided anywhere, it will be Asia, where the largest migratory waves in history have been into cities such as the Indian capital, Delhi, for the past three decades.</p> <p>Millions of those migrants left for their home villages in the days after India announced it was going into lockdown. Many of those who didn\u2019t now find themselves trapped in cities, such as Mumbai or Bangalore, and running out of cash.</p> <p>It has made apparent that India\u2019s urbanisation process has been a rush job, says Gautam Bhan, from the Indian Institute for Human Settlements, a Delhi-based research centre.</p> <p>\u201cOur model has created cities without the capacity to support the people who live in them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply scarring, psychologically wounding experience to have worked in a city for 10 years and to realise no one here is looking out for you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93e3d46f1f7817194e71e15cbe537c68d239c94f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93e3d46f1f7817194e71e15cbe537c68d239c94f/0_18_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue to get on buses to leave the city of Ahmedabad in India as the lockdown is extended.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue to get on buses to leave the city of Ahmedabad in India as the lockdown is extended.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amit Dave/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unless urban safety nets can be weaved, Bhan says, workers might eschew better paying work in big cities for safer options closer to home. \u201cThey might not return to Delhi or Mumbai. They will go to small towns and smaller urban centres, where they make a bit less but think: \u2018I\u2019m safer, nearer to home, and won\u2019t be cut off like this again.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/life-after-coronavirus-pandemic-change-world\">Cities after coronavirus: how Covid-19 could radically alter urban life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inequality will not just shape the recovery of the cities of the global south. Among the few winners from the pandemic are likely to be the tech conglomerates whose products have allowed parts of our lives and industries to continue functioning from home. Their dominance in cities such as Seattle and San Francisco is likely to be extended, says Mark Muro, a senior fellow with the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBig tech will get bigger. It is brimming with revenues from before the crisis and fat balance sheets that will allow it to buy other companies,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The leaders of some cities might choose to lean in to these changes, pursuing a Singapore-style model of luring the wealthy and ambitious, along with the ground army of food-delivery workers, cleaners, drivers and cooks to keep their lifestyles humming.</p> <p>There is historical precedent to the wealthy consolidating their hold on cities after disasters, says Keil. \u201cIf you look at residential real estate, the people who ruled Florence before the plague were all those who owned the land and ruled Florence after the plague,\u201d Keil says. \u201cThere is a certain consistency. If you look at how these major events have hit cities, the ones who come out on top were the ones who were on top before.\u201d</p> <p>But what happens next is not predestined. A virus is a biological phenomenon, but it is being governed by social and political processes, Keil says. The solidarity being forged by communities banding together to feed vulnerable people in neighbourhoods, or to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/coronavirus-america-rent-strike-protest\">organise rent strikes</a>, could prove just as crucial in shaping the future of the world\u2019s great cities as the forces of government policy or capital. \u201cThere is no one path for all great cities to follow,\u201d Keil says. \u201cThis is a negotiated process. It\u2019s one we have some agency in.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>A few years ago, I sought help for my </strong><strong>obsessive</strong><strong>-compulsive </strong><strong>disorder, which I could trace back to when I was</strong><strong> about</strong><strong> 14. I did CBT, which I found positive and helpful.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have a son who is now two years old, and </strong><strong>worry he has started to display OCD tendencies, and that I am passing it on. Though I am far better than I was, I struggle with managing some behaviours, including handwashing. </strong><strong>With the threat of Covid-19, this has ramped up,</strong><strong> and I have been </strong><strong>fastidious about the whole household washing hands. I try to do it in a \u201cnormal\u201d way, but sometimes feel I need to wash my hands more often. I wonder if my son picks up on the fact that I am more stressed when we wash his hands. He recently said: \u201cI need wash my hands again \u2013 I dirty\u201d and got upset when I tried to dry his hands with a towel, wanting a different one; just being touched by the towel I had offered provoked him to wash his hands again.</strong></p> <p><strong>We have just started toilet training, which has opened up a </strong><strong>new world of opportunities for my son to touch the toilet/potty, and I don\u2019t know how to be reasonable about what contact necessitates hand</strong><strong>washing. How can I keep my OCD under wraps and act as normally as possible around my son, to avoid him developing similar issues?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s great you are so thoughtful about your behaviour and how it may affect your son. I consulted psychotherapist Graham Music (<a href=\"http://childpsychotherapy.org.uk\" title=\"\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>) and the first thing we both wanted to know was: what happened to you aged 14? This felt like an important piece of information. My own OCD behaviours stemmed from my mother going to hospital when I was nine; they can still rear their heads <strong>\u2013</strong> but in a diluted form <strong>\u2013</strong> when I\u2019m anxious and am seeking to control my immediate environment because my usual coping mechanisms are overwhelmed. This is probably what\u2019s happening to you. In your treatment, I\u2019m sure you learned that OCD is a particular set of behaviours around intrusive thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Music said, \u201clet\u2019s think about your boy. There\u2019s something that happens around that age anyway; two-year-olds can be quite obsessional; that\u2019s normal. He\u2019s very likely imitating you, rather than starting to display true OCD behaviour which, generally speaking, manifests later.\u201d</p> <p>Your son may be picking up on your anxiety for everyone to keep their hands clean and wanting to do the right thing <strong>\u2013</strong> and nothing more. Of course you don\u2019t want it to turn into something else, but in these heightened times, and with your history, you may be picking up on something you recognise, and giving it more meaning than it deserves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/24/i-slept-with-my-best-friends-ex-now-im-terrified-of-confrontation\">I slept with my best friend's ex. Now I'm terrified of confrontation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing that may help, Music advised, is \u201cif you could find ways of relaxing a little, looking after your anxious self\u201d. What might those be at the moment? Maybe talking about it to your husband, who you say in your original letter is very supportive; or checking in with a trusted friend? If you can find ways to dissipate your angst, that will go some way to helping you to deal with your son in a more relaxed way; it will also help you eventually see your son\u2019s behaviour as the separate entity it is. (Is your husband worried?) Remember also that when we worry about things, it\u2019s very hard to step back, have an air of confidence and joke about them, all of which would be useful tools right now.</p> <p>Practically speaking, could you allow yourselves to wash your hands when you come in, and have certain protocols around toilet training and washing hands before eating, etc, but try to relax about touching things that are already in the house? Forgetting, if we can, about coronavirus for a moment, a sterile environment is not optimal for our immune system.</p> <p>If your son, for example, balks at using a towel he perceives to be dirty, you could gently model that \u201cMummy can use it\u201d, and if he asks to wash his hands when he doesn\u2019t need to, you can say, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to now.\u201d Remember the way you say things is probably more important than what you say; and also remember that he may need time to take this message on board.</p> <p>If you can, you might also want to consider both of you going outside into the garden, if you have one, and getting (safely) dirty. Slowly he will learn the difference between when to wash his hands and when to be more relaxed about it.</p> <p>\u2022 Send your problem to <a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

  "<p>When Simon Anthony quit his lucrative but miserable job at a London investment bank to solve sudoku puzzles on YouTube, it looked like a bit of a leap. His early posts had done well to gain 100 views. Perhaps he had overestimated the demand for long videos of a 46-year-old man putting numbers in a grid from his spare room in Surrey.</p> \n<p>A year later, Anthony is one half of an unlikely viral sensation: Cracking the Cryptic, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-UOdK8-mIjxBQm_ot1T-Q\">the channel</a> he runs with his old friend Mark Goodliffe, has become a lockdown fixture for millions. Much to the puzzlement of both men, they have turned sudoku into what right now might be the world\u2019s most popular spectator sport.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing when a video goes viral because it just goes everywhere,\u201d Anthony says from his home in Reigate. The channel he launched three years ago has taken off in the past few weeks, attracting more than 200,000 rapt subscribers and almost 30m views. \u201cIt\u2019s just very, very surreal,\u201d he adds.</p> \n<p>Anthony\u2019s latest hit is The Miracle Sudoku, a strangely compelling 25-minute video in which he takes on a seemingly impossible grid. In each video, a live view of the puzzle fills the left half of the screen, next to a webcam view of Anthony or Goodliffe, who commentate on their attempts to solve it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yKf9aUIxdb4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking,\u201d Anthony says as he considers a grid that contains only two given numbers. As well as the normal rules (each row, column and block of little squares must contain the numbers one to nine) this puzzle contains a series of constraints. Adjacent cells can\u2019t contain consecutive digits, for example.</p> \n<p>At first Anthony thinks the compiler must be trolling him. Then slowly he begins to add numbers to the screen. When, 10 minutes in, he finds a place for all the ones and twos, Anthony dares to dream. \u201cThis is just staggering,\u201d he says as the threes then fall into place, never departing from a soothing Home Counties monotone. \u201cWe are watching magic unfold here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Soon it becomes clear that Anthony is going to solve the puzzle. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve got the adjectives to describe what is going on here,\u201d he says as numbers pour into the grid like rain on a desert. \u201cIt\u2019s like the universe is singing to us.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cf5aa0ee3285f4d54d38d23ca1db90f0c6869bc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf5aa0ee3285f4d54d38d23ca1db90f0c6869bc/17_26_2537_1522/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Anthony solves the \u2018miracle\u2019 sudoku\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Anthony solves the \u2018miracle\u2019 sudoku.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That excitement swept across the web this week, particularly in America, home to 27% of Anthony\u2019s audience. \u201cI swear to God, this 25-minute video of a guy doing a Sudoku puzzle is the most riveting television I\u2019ve seen all year,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanaSchwartzzz/status/1262625197259014146\">tweeted Dana Schwartz</a>, a 27-year-old Los Angeles-based author and screenwriter not hitherto known to the English puzzling community. The Guardian\u2019s resident mathematician and puzzle master, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/18/can-you-solve-it-sudoku-as-spectator-sport-is-unlikely-lockdown-hit\">Alex Bellos, also highlighted the channel</a> and set the \u201cmiracle\u201d puzzle for his devotees, noting: \u201cWhat makes the videos so joyous is the constant stream of \u2018aha!\u2019 moments.\u201d</p> \n<p>Demand had already surged in lockdown. Anthony launched the channel in June 2017 but with its spare-room scenery, low-fi design and split-screen webcam format, it looks like it was made for this moment. Anthony suspects something else is happening. \u201cWe\u2019re getting an awful lot of emails saying we\u2019re helping people with their mental health,\u201d he says. \u201cThere seems to be a sort of ASMR-type quality to the videos.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before the \u201cmiracle\u201d post, the big breakthrough came last month when Anthony put up another 25-minute video. It elicited phrases such as \u201cgood grief!\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s quite startling, it really is\u201d, but didn\u2019t really stand out. Anthony has watched it race towards 4 million views. \u201cIt\u2019s just bonkers,\u201d he says, still baffled. \u201cWe focus all our time on solving puzzles but the YouTube algorithm is one that we have not cracked.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tweets poured in from maths royalty. Simon Singh, the writer, Rachel Riley of Countdown fame and Bobby Seagull, the teacher and University Challenge star, are all fans. But fame has gone quickly mainstream \u2013 and global.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve officially unlocked a new level of boredom... currently watching videos of a man solving sudoku puzzles,\u201d James Charles, a 20-year-old millionaire American makeup artist with 19 million YouTube subscribers and 2bn views, tweeted last month. He had been binge watching the channel for days. \u201cThe videos are SO interesting but also help me relax!\u201d he told his 5.5 million Twitter followers. \u201cWTF IM LEGIT WATCHING HIM RN,\u201d one replied.</p> \n<p>Anthony and Goodliffe, who is 53 and lives in Gloucestershire, have now increased output to two daily videos and receive dozens of submissions a day from sudoku constructors. They have launched three apps and a range of merchandise.</p> \n<p>Anthony, who has two young children, does not regret quitting his City job. \u201cI only did it for one reason and was constantly aware I was working my youth away,\u201d he says. He left with some savings and a notion that money from YouTube ads might then pay the bills. His income is still lower than it was \u2013 but it\u2019s now climbing fast.</p> \n<p>Anthony met Goodliffe at a crossword championships 20 years ago, before the sudoku boom of 2005. Puzzling then was exclusively a pencil affair and newspapers were the only outlet. \u201cNow there is a way to reach these vast audiences from a loft in Reigate. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d For the second time this month, Anthony struggles to find the adjectives.</p>",

  "<p>Sweden has received considerable media scrutiny in recent days. According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/20/sweden-becomes-country-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-per-capita/\">coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world</a>, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK. But they are higher than those of Portugal and Greece, two countries with a similar size of population to Sweden. The <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">figures</a> are also much higher than Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbours, with Denmark at 11,182 cases and 561 deaths, Norway at 8,309 and 235, and Finland at 6,537 and 306.</p> <p>International observers and critics within Sweden blame these depressing figures on its controversial Covid-19 strategy. Unlike the rest of Europe, or what is often cited as the exemplar nation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing\">South Korea</a>, Sweden has not imposed any lockdowns nor carried out mass testing. Its policy has been to slow the spread of the virus by exhorting its citizens to practise voluntary social distancing.</p> <p>Some restrictions have been enforced, such as a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people, and a stipulation that drinks can only be served on seated tables as opposed to bars. Everyday life in Sweden is not the same as before. There are fewer people in shopping centres and public transport. Working from home has become the new normal for those who can. But people continue to socialise outdoors freely, while primary schools, hairdressers and shopping centres remain open.</p> <p>But despite the high number of deaths, about 70% of Swedes <a href=\"https://www.msb.se/contentassets/01163f676a3348cfa68491c617b5e1d0/1544449-msb_resultat-coronaundersoknng_200510.pdf\">support</a> their government\u2019s approach. In fact, there has not been much public debate or organised opposition to the strategy. The deaths have indeed shocked many Swedes, especially the disproportionately high number of deaths among those over 70 in care homes and those from working-class, immigrant backgrounds. The debates, however, seem to be taking a more socioeconomic angle. In other words, the reasons for these deaths are being blamed on structural, economic, and social deficiencies \u2013 but not on the strategy itself.</p> <p>Why is this so? One explanation that has been aired frequently points to the high degree of trust between government agencies and citizens. The argument is that the level of government transparency and the state\u2019s service-mindedness has created an environment where the people trust their government and experts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/just-7-per-cent-of-stockholm-had-covid-19-antibodies-by-end-of-april-study-sweden-coronavirus\">Just 7.3% of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by end of April, study shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whereas this might explain the lack of opposition, it is far from exhaustive. For example, Norway, Denmark and Finland are also known as high-trust societies. But all three have imposed far more restrictive measures, ranging from lockdowns to declaring a national emergency.</p> <p>Second, the fact that some of the people most affected by the high death rate are from the <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200418-coronavirus-spotlights-swedish-segregation\">poorest immigrant groups</a>, such as the Somali community, whose voice is not always well represented in the media, goes against this image of a universally trusting and transparent society.</p> <p>Perhaps another explanation is that Sweden has a very different way of perceiving the current crisis. Instead of seeing it as a national emergency or a fight against an \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d, there seems to be a tendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem. It is viewed as something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts, rather than an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties for the sake of national security. Indeed, whenever a non-scientific expert such as me criticises the Swedish strategy, the response has often been that I am not an expert.</p> <p>This is where Sweden is unique, something that may be attributable to its history. The country has not experienced a national emergency or crisis for more than 100 years. Since around the Swedish general strike of 1909, it has not seen any profound social conflicts, for example the miners\u2019 strike in Britain, or a civil war, as in Spain or Finland. Any foreigner who has lived in Sweden will know how conflict-averse Swedish people seem to be. Furthermore, Sweden has not engaged in any armed disputes since the 1810s. This is in contrast to Denmark and Norway, which were occupied by Germany in the second world war, and Finland, invaded by the USSR in the same period. A rallying cry of unity in the face of national adversity isn\u2019t part of the collective cultural fabric in Sweden.</p> <p>This lack of experience with handling national crises goes some way to explaining why there is a technocratic and dispassionate outlook to Covid-19, as opposed to a sense of urgency. It is also why the public health agency in Sweden seems to have few qualms about \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Whereas other countries see it as a dangerous national experiment, Swedish health officials regard it more as a type of medical prescription. It might not be 100% effective and some deaths might occur, as in any medical situation. But in the long run, it could work in mitigating the negative effects of the virus, without mass social disruption.</p> <p>It is for this reason that the denial by the Swedish government and health officials that it is actually pursuing \u201cherd immunity\u201d seem so halfhearted, a rebuttal to critical foreign press rather than its citizens. For a foreigner living in Sweden like me, it is not entirely reassuring. How long Sweden will continue with this policy is difficult to ascertain. But as long as Covid-19 is seen in this light, and it looks as if it will, a U-turn seems unlikely.</p> <p>\u2022 Tae Hoon Kim is a South Korean geopolitical and economic analyst based in Stockholm, Sweden</p>",

One of the world\u2019s richest countries, they said, was bungling its response.</p> \n<p>But today, Japan can make a strong case for being another coronavirus success story, albeit one that has failed to resonate globally in the same way as those in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p> \n<p>So far, Japan \u2013 a country of 126 million people with one of the biggest elderly populations in the world \u2013 has confirmed 16,433 infections and 784 deaths, out of a global death toll of more than 300,000 people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Japan\" data-alt=\"Japan deaths\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Japan\">Japan deaths</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In Tokyo, where almost 14 million people live, new cases have remained below 40 for more than a fortnight, with just five cases reported on two consecutive days this week. That compares with a peak of 206 new cases reported on 17 April. On Friday, the public broadcaster NHK reported just three new cases in the capital in the previous 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Achieving such low figures barely seemed possible in early April when, just as the number of cases began to rise sharply in Tokyo and other major cities, neighbouring South Korea \u2013 with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/test-trace-contain-how-south-korea-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve\">widely praised regime</a> of testing, tracing and treating \u2013 was flattening the curve.</p> \n<p>On 7 April, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, belatedly declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/japan-shinzo-abe-declares-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus\">state of emergency</a> in the capital and other affected areas that was later expanded to include all 47 of the country\u2019s prefectures.</p> \n<p>But Japan\u2019s version of \u201clockdown\u201d \u2013 requests to avoid unnecessary outings, work from home and observe social distancing \u2013 came across as a timid response to a situation that risked spiraling out of control.

  "<p>As the coronavirus spreads around the world, there are concerns that it will mutate into a form that is more transmissible, more dangerous or both, potentially making the global health crisis even worse. What do we know about the way the virus is evolving?</p> \n<h2>Is the virus mutating?</h2> \n<p>All viruses mutate and the Sars-Cov-2 coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is no exception. Mutations arise when the virus replicates inside cells and mistakes are made in copying its genetic code. Unlike humans, whose genes are written in double-stranded DNA, the coronavirus genes are carried on single-stranded RNA.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>How fast is the virus mutating?</h2> \n<p>The coronavirus is actually quite stable. Scientists have analysed about 13,000 samples in Britain since mid-March and found that new mutations appear roughly twice a month. The rate of mutations is important because the faster a virus mutates, the quicker it changes behaviour. A fast-evolving virus can be harder to make a vaccine against because by the time it has been developed, the parts of the virus the immune system attacks might have changed. Seasonal influenza mutates so rapidly we need a different vaccine each year.</p> \n<h2>How does coronavirus vary around the world?</h2> \n<p>The genetic code from coronaviruses around the globe show that it splits into groups as it spreads. There is nothing unusual about this. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/17/9241\">Researchers in Germany</a> identified three main genetic groups of the virus in April, which they named A, B and C. Groups A and C are mostly found in Europeans and Americans, while group B is most common in East Asia. But there are smaller groups too, which scientists can use to trace infections back to their sources, and ultimately back to a region such as Wuhan or northern Italy.</p> \n<h2>Why do mutations matter?</h2> \n<p>Mutations happen by chance all the time. Most have little effect, and some hamper the virus, but over time single or multiple mutations can potentially build up that make the virus more successful by enabling it to spread more easily. Mutations can also make the virus more dangerous, for example by making it more efficient at infecting cells.</p> \n<h2>What mutations has the virus picked up?</h2> \n<p>A number of mutations have caught scientists\u2019 attention. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine studied more than 5,000 coronavirus genomes from around the world and discovered <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.066977v1\">several mutations</a> that may be evidence of the virus adapting to humans. Two mutations are in the critical \u201cspike\u201d protein that the virus uses to invade cells.</p> \n<p>The spike mutations are rare at the moment, but Martin Hibberd, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, said their emergence highlighted the need for global surveillance of the virus. That will reveal whether the new mutations help it to spread and whether vaccines may need to be redesigned.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v1\">another preliminary study</a>, scientists at Sheffield University and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico found similar mutations in the spike protein which the authors claim may help the infection to spread. While that is possible, other scientists believe it is too early to know whether any of the mutations are helping the virus thrive.</p> \n<p>Prof Nick Loman at the University of Birmingham said that all coronaviruses are very similar and that viruses with particular mutations can rise up in different areas for a range of reasons. A major factor is which virus gains a foothold first, the so-called founder effect, which may come down to one person\u2019s travel plans rather than any adaptation of the virus. \u201cFrom the point of view of people who are understandably concerned about this pandemic, I\u2019m sure it will not matter which mutations the virus has. It\u2019s not a good virus either way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look to see if any of the mutations change behaviour and we don\u2019t have any evidence for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there is some reason for hope. <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108506v1\">Another preliminary study</a>, this time by researchers in the UK and US, revealed that after looking at more than 15,000 coronavirus genomes from patients around the world, scientists found no sign the virus is becoming more transmissible \u2013 in other words it is not becoming easier to pass from person to person.</p> \n<p>The team found 6,822 mutations in total, relative to the ancestral genome, however none of the genomes showed more than 29 single position changes, known as SNPs. The researchers then focused on 31 mutations that appear to have arisen independently at least 10 times.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf there is a mutation that appears and makes it transmit better, then we should see it happening multiple times,\u201d said Prof Francois Balloux, a co-author of the research at University College London. However the team found these mutations either had a neutral impact on the virus, or were actually detrimental to it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>What else can mutations tell us?</h2> \n<p>As scientists learn more about the genetic makeup of coronaviruses, they will be able to use the information to trace an individual\u2019s infection to nearby clusters and ultimately back to its origin. That can be useful for tracing outbreaks and spotting newly imported infections. But intense monitoring will also flag up how the virus mutates and acquires resistance to and drugs and vaccines that are used in the future. \u201cAs those become available, we would expect to see functional mutations just like with see with antibiotic resistance in bacteria,\u201d Loman said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

  "<p>Dear Gavin Williamson,</p> <p>Ten years ago I was a soldier serving as an intelligence analyst in Helmand province in Afghanistan. The coalition government had just come to power, and we were visited by a delegation of ministers including Liam Fox, the new Defence secretary.</p> <p>With hundreds of eyes staring him down, he stood there, in the heart of a land where so many British servicemen and women were still losing their lives, and told us that life was going to get tougher for us. There were going to be cuts at the Ministry of Defence: there would be pay freezes, pensions were to be looked at, defence contracts stripped back. It was brutal but honest. It was a display of leadership. He assured us that he would always support our best interests, but there would be fights he would lose.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What we begrudge is the divisive way you are pitching teachers against the general public</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ten years on, I am an English teacher and the head of a large department in a state secondary school. It\u2019s the toughest job I\u2019ve ever had. I worked hard in the military. I work even harder as a teacher. Every day is like being on an operational tour. The past nine weeks have been the most difficult yet.</p> <p>I say, now as a teacher, Mr Williamson, you are our secretary of state: you are our boss and we are looking to you for leadership.</p> <p>We are yet to experience any such leadership. Your daily briefing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/education-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-may\">on Saturday</a> was an ideal time for you to tell the nation that there are thousands of teachers ready to go back to school when called upon \u2013 when your government reassures parents and teachers alike that it\u2019s safe. It was also an opportunity for you to stand with us and explain that teachers are working incredibly hard to ensure that our students don\u2019t lose out.</p> <p>You are our voice, yet you did not speak for us. You spoke in divisive, hyperbolic rhetoric of how \u201cwe owe it to the children\u201d and that the unions had a \u201cduty\u201d to get teachers back to school. You called us heroes last week. Nobody believes these empty words. I don\u2019t believe it, you don\u2019t believe it. You ramp up the hyperbole and you divide us further from the people we serve.</p> <p>You and your colleagues do not need to remind teachers what we owe and to whom. The biggest pleasure in my role as an educator is the awareness of why I am here.</p> <p>Driving home after being with key workers\u2019 children at school on Tuesday, I heard George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, respond to a question on schools reopening with a retort that NHS workers and supermarket staff have been working throughout lockdown. It is unhelpful and unwarranted attacks on teachers like this that demonstrate both a lack of leadership and a lack of understanding from people running our country. We are still working, much like parliamentarians are: at a distance.</p> <p>So I\u2019d like to reassure everyone in government that in the past nine weeks of school closure, my team have done an incredible job creating an online and remote service for our students that is as accessible as we can make it \u2013 the same goes for schools and teachers up and down the country. We have planned for every eventuality all the way up to the autumn term. We have set work, marked it and communicated with students about their studies. We have created hundreds of videos to complement lessons. Monitoring our students\u2019 progress from afar has proved a challenge \u2013 endless spreadsheets, phone calls and Zoom chats has helped. At the same time I have asked my team to plan for our future so that when we do go back to school, we are all ready.</p> <p>Every bit of hard work we have been doing for our school, our students and our community has been done in the backdrop of a pandemic. A pandemic we are not immune from. Colleagues, including myself, have fallen ill: some with mild symptons, others far worse. There are pregnancies and underlying health conditions. Many are looking after their own children. Some are looking after elderly family. Some have lost family and friends. </p> <p>Despite, or perhaps because of all this, we want to go back to school. I have had to fight with members of my team who have been told to stay away because they want to go in and help. We are desperate to return. Selfishly, it\u2019s our safe place too. We love what we do and the period of lockdown has been a stripped-back, frustratingly draconian version of what we love doing best: being educators.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/british-schools-science-children-education-testing-tracing\">When should British schools reopen?

As well as new unconditional offers, experts say this could include making universities withdraw offers accepting low grades that they made to fill places.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/forget-freshers-week-universities-prepare-to-teach-new-first-years-online\">Forget freshers' week: universities prepare to teach new first years online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian has learned that several universities, including one in the elite Russell Group, have sought legal advice on how to challenge the OfS move, which they see as a dangerous encroachment on their autonomy.</p> <p>Ministers are concerned that school leavers might accept an unconditional offer from a university other than their chosen institution because they want certainty. They are also worried that if some universities change offers to gain an advantage, their competitors will be forced to follow suit, leading to a domino effect with lots of universities ignoring A-level grades.</p> <p>A Westminster source said: \u201cThere were some universities where every single one of their offers were converted to unconditional overnight in response to the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Controversially, the OfS expects institutions that suddenly handed out large numbers of unconditional offers after 11 March, the date the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">pandemic</a>, to withdraw those offers from students who haven\u2019t yet accepted them.

But universities say the wording of the proposed new OfS powers, which are currently being <a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/publications/consultation-on-the-integrity-and-stability-of-the-english-higher-education-sector/\">consulted</a> on, is so imprecise that they do not know which offers might fall foul of the rules.</p> <p>Dr Dean Machin, strategic policy adviser at the University of Portsmouth, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough uncertainty to be coping with right now without coming to terms with a vague new power. We don\u2019t know what will be acceptable. It increases uncertainty at a time when that is the last thing we need.\u201d</p> <p>He says Portsmouth did not switch any offers, but a minority of other institutions saw the financial risks ahead and decided to act quickly. He adds that the sector generally saw this as bad practice, because by siphoning off students at a time of crisis they could potentially sink their competitors.</p> <p>Smita Jamdar, head of education at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, who has been advising universities on the new OfS powers, says institutions should be extremely cautious about withdrawing any offers, which could lead to accusations of having misled students. \u201cStudents may feel they are having something valuable taken away from them. Institutions need to think carefully about the legal rights of the students and the reputational impact of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Jamdar is concerned that the OfS has not defined which sorts of offers it wants to stamp out. She says universities could, for example, be challenged for accepting students with lower grades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d1c5e709d0890bdf6bfe2fba9b2e8b8cfa85fe1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c5e709d0890bdf6bfe2fba9b2e8b8cfa85fe1c/794_477_2251_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester: \u2018These powers are intended to circumvent the act that enshrined universities\u2019 autonomy in law.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is also unhappy with the OfS plan to backdate the new rules to March. \u201cIt\u2019s an important principle of the law that you should know the consequences of your actions at the time you do them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, agrees it is not clear exactly which behaviour the OfS intends to punish. \u201cIn clearing every year there are universities that pretty much accept anyone they think would benefit. So if you usually take students with low grades in a normal year, are you going to fall foul of the OfS for doing it this year?\u201d</p> <p>He is concerned that universities are being hit with new rules at a time many are expecting A-level grades to be less trustworthy. \u201cIf you are an admissions officer trying to fill your places and make rapid decisions it is really hard,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Andrew Hargreaves, founder of the research consultancy dataHE, which has been helping universities to understand their position in the absence of A-level exams, says: \u201cI just don\u2019t recognise this narrative that is coming from government about universities as villains, with the OfS coming along on its white charger to rescue young people. This is a sector trying to react to a changed environment, that genuinely wants its students to succeed.\u201d Many in the sector argue that there is no real evidence that unconditional offers are hurting students.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/loss-of-international-student-fees-could-decimate-uk-research\">Loss of international student fees could decimate UK research</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vice-chancellors are also concerned that the government is seeking to control far more than admissions. The consultation sets out proposals to prevent universities \u201cengaging in any form of conduct\u201d that could have a negative impact on students or the \u201cstability or integrity\u201d of the higher education system. It emphasises that this \u201cincludes but is not limited to\u201d admissions. University chiefs say any number of issues the government doesn\u2019t like could fall into this definition.</p> <p>Jamdar says this is \u201capparent opportunism. The sector has asked for support and the government has seen it as the chance not only to ensure stability in recruitment, but also to establish a basis to intervene in a much broader and quite onerous way. I feel deeply uncomfortable about it.\u201d</p> <p>Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, agrees. \u201cThis is a time of crisis, but we are still in a democracy. These powers are deliberately intended to circumvent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2016/oct/18/higher-education-research-bill-needs-amended\">Higher Education Act of 2017</a>, which enshrined universities\u2019 autonomy in law.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to supporting our world-class universities and students through this challenging time. Prospective students will understandably feel nervous about their future, and their interests must be put first.

That\u2019s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was \u201cthrowing everything at it\u201d.</p> <p>But while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed \u2013 Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research \u2013 ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days.</p> <p>This is why.</p> <h2><strong>Why might a vaccine fail?</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this week, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure we will get a vaccine.\u201d</p> <p>But he was right to be circumspect.</p> <p>Vaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show.</p> <p>More than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/first-fda-approved-vaccine-prevention-dengue-disease-endemic-regions\">approved only last year</a>, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years.</p> <p>Scientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both. But none have been licensed, partly because Sars fizzled out and Mers is regional to the Middle East. The lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2, but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus.</p> <p>A chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger long-lasting immunity. About a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses, but the immune response fades so rapidly that people <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2170159/\">can become reinfected</a> the next year.</p> <p>Researchers at Oxford University recently analysed blood from recovered Covid-19 patients and found that levels of IgG antibodies \u2013 those responsible for longer-lasting immunity \u2013 rose steeply in the first month of infection but then <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066407v2\">began to fall again</a>.</p> <p>Last week, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that most people who recovered from Covid-19 without going into hospital <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.092619v1\">did not make many killer antibodies</a> against the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what is particularly challenging,\u201d says Stanley Perlman, a veteran coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa. \u201cIf the natural infection doesn\u2019t give you that much immunity except when it\u2019s a severe infection, what will a vaccine do? It could be better, but we don\u2019t know.\u201d If a vaccine only protects for a year, the virus will be with us for some time.</p> <p>The genetic stability of the virus matters too. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year. The rapid evolution of HIV is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease.</p> <p>So far, the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus seems fairly stable, but it is acquiring mutations, as all viruses do. Some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus\u2019s protein \u201cspikes\u201d which are the basis of most vaccines. If the spike protein mutates too much, the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection.</p> <p>Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped identify some of the virus\u2019s mutations, called them \u201can early warning\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Another challenge: making any vaccine safe</strong></h2> <p>In the rush to develop a vaccine \u2013 there are now more than 100 in development \u2013 safety must remain a priority. Unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill, the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people.</p> <p>This means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous side-effects. During the search for a Sars vaccine in 2004, scientists found that one candidate <a href=\"https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672\">caused hepatitis</a> in ferrets. Another serious concern is \u201cantibody-induced enhancement\u201d where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse. The effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478436/\">Sars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574614/\">Mers</a>.</p> <p>John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the difficulties, the specific difficulties, that every vaccine will give you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>We should </strong><strong>\u2018end up with something</strong><strong>\u2019 \u2026 but what does that mean?</strong></h2> <p>When the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told a No 10 press briefing that a vaccine was \u201cby no means guaranteed\u201d, his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed, but added: \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something.\u201d Many scientists share that view.</p> <p>In all likelihood, a coronavirus vaccine will not be 100% effective.</p> <p>Those in development draw on at least eight different approaches, from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient\u2019s cells, which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against.</p> <p>Ideally, a vaccine will generate persistent, high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also \u201cT\u201d cells to destroy infected cells. But each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection,\u201d says David Heymann, who led the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Sars epidemic.</p> <p>Early results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use.</p> <p>The US biotech firm Moderna reported antibody levels <a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine\">similar to those found in recovered patients</a> in 25 people who received its vaccine.</p> <p>Another vaccine from Oxford University did not stop monkeys contracting the virus, but did appear to prevent pneumonia, a major cause of death in coronavirus patients.</p> <p>If humans react the same way, vaccinated people would still spread the virus, but be less likely to die from it.</p> <p>How well a vaccine works determines how it is used. Armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years, countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least two-thirds of the population.</p> <p>Coronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others, on average, but if two or more are immune, the outbreak will fizzle out. That is the best-case scenario.</p> <p>More likely is we will end up with a vaccine, or a number of vaccines, that are only partially effective.</p> <p>Vaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people, but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection.</p> <p>Meanwhile, older people might get vaccines that simply prevent infections progressing to life-threatening pneumonia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the ability to induce immunity, you\u2019ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection,\u201d says McCauley.</p> <p>But partially effective vaccines have their own problems: a vaccine that doesn\u2019t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve, making the vaccine redundant.</p> <h2><strong>So, is the virus here to stay?</strong></h2> <p>The simple answer is: yes.</p> <p>Hopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there. \u201cIf and when we have a vaccine, what you get is not rainbows and unicorns,\u201d says Larry Brilliant, CEO of Pandefense Advisory, who worked on the WHO\u2019s smallpox eradication programme. \u201cIf we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection, then we are doomed to have Covid become endemic, an infection that is always with us.\u201d</p> <p>The virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be harder to get rid of Covid than smallpox,\u201d says Brilliant. With smallpox it was at least clear who was infected, whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing. A thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country, all other nations are at risk.</p> <p>As David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told a Chatham House webinar recently: \u201cUnless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in.\u201d</p> <p>Or as Brilliant puts it, the virus will \u201cping-pong back and forth in time and geography\u201d.</p> <p>One proposal from <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-advance-market-commitment-and-how-could-it-help-beat-covid-19\">Gavi, the vaccine alliance</a>, is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an \u201cadvance market commitment\u201d. And Brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now. \u201cWe should be demanding, now, a global conference on what we\u2019re going to do when we get a vaccine, or if we don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf the process of getting a vaccine, testing it, proving it, manufacturing it, planning for its delivery, and building a vaccine programme all over the world, if that\u2019s going to take as long as we think, then let\u2019s fucking start planning it now.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How will we live with the virus?</strong></h2> <p>People will have to adapt \u2013 and life will change. Heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment. People must play their part too, by maintaining handwashing, physical distancing and avoiding gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. Repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines, so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available, he adds. Immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate.</p> <p>Yuen Kwok-yung, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Hong Kong, has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed \u2013 but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work, and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas.</p> <p>At restaurants, tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus. \u201cIn our Hong Kong perspective, the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Sarita Jane Robinson, a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the University of Central Lancashire, says people are still adapting to the \u201cnew normal\u201d and that without more interventions \u2013 such as fines for not wearing face masks \u2013 \u201cwe could see people drifting back to old behaviours\u201d.</p> <p>We might become blase about Covid-19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on, but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore, she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/has-the-coronavirus-pandemic-made-us-all-nicer-community\">Has the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One last possibility could save a lot of trouble.

It\u2019s not exactly the same thing, of course, but there is a faint echo of the <em>omert\u00e0</em> out in the Icelandic pastures. Maybe the circumspection and modesty H\u00e1konarson shows throughout our interview is the social cost of living and working in a small country \u2013 and what can sometimes inhibit progress.</p> <p>In The County, there is no easy resolution; it works the same way in real life. Attempts to create independent farming ventures in Skagafj\u00f6rdur some 25 years ago were nipped in the bud by the co-operative. There was talk that Kaupf\u00e9lag Skagfir\u00f0inga might use its weight to quash the film\u2019s funding, but it never happened \u2013 nor has it responded to the film. The County prompted a brief resurgence of debate on social media, and the odd newspaper article, about how the area operates.

  "<p>In our time of social distancing, the desire for physical contact has never been so intense. And yet we are untouchable. This experience has had its more conspicuous consequences, such as the government scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/headlines-neil-ferguson-coronavirus-death-rate\">Neil Ferguson</a> breaking his own rules to meet his lover during lockdown. This notion of forbidden touch, unique and even shocking as it may be to us, has a multitude of echoes in literature. Cultural constraints and taboos on touch are reflected, overturned or used for dramatic purposes by writers throughout history, and our own bookshelves are newly rich with the comfort of identification. Who would have ever guessed that the plague-ridden, the apocalyptic or the edicts of Victorian England would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/01/the-end-of-coronavirus-what-plague-literature-tells-us-about-our-future\">quite such resonance</a>?</p> <p>The sensual is, of course, as much enhanced by restraint as diminished by it, and the whole canon of forbidden, throbbing longing in literature contains particular potency in the present. Often by necessity, desire is all, and consummation, if it ever happens, can be secondary in impact to the distanced gazes, tiny brushes and glances that precede it. Little is as sexy, or as frustrating, as restricted touch.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An exquisite suspense lies in the space between obedience and disobedience, uniformity and special status</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A physical gesture, however slight, is more often a turning point for characters than anything spelled out in dialogue. This was summed up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/13/iris-murdoch-100-books-full-passion-disaster\">Iris Murdoch</a> in <em>The Black Prince</em>: \u201cOnly take someone\u2019s hand in a certain way, even look into their eyes in a certain way, and the world is changed forever.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\">Keats</a> wrote that \u201ctouch has a memory\u201d, and the anticipation or the recollection of the physical is often where the excitement, fervour and true poetry lie. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/emily-dickinson-lyndall-gordon\">Emily Dickinson</a> expressed it: \u201cWithin its reach, though yet ungrasped / Desire\u2019s perfect Goal \u2013 / No nearer \u2013 lest the Actual \u2013 / should disenthrall my soul \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>The physical spaces between the lover and the loved are filled with suspense.

While she and Angel are still resisting a relationship made problematic by class differences and personal history, \u201cTess was trying to lead a repressed life, but she little divined the strength of her own vitality\u201d. <em>Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles </em>is a deeply sensual novel in which the two protagonists barely touch, yet the heroine\u2019s physical beauty, the fertility of their surroundings \u2013 the oozing valley, dairy farm, rank overgrown garden \u2013 all represent that very vitality as they circle and yearn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/24/helen-simpson-interview-great-unspoken-subject-between-couples-is-probably-whose-job-is-more-import\">Helen Simpson</a>\u2019s young lovers in her story \u201cBed and Breakfast<em>\u201d</em> don\u2019t even need to hold hands as their \u201cglances arrowing beams of sheepish delight\u201d alone make people turn to them and stare, while Sally Rooney\u2019s Connell and Marianne in <em>Normal People</em> are restrained from showing their real feelings because of a stringent social pecking order: \u201cConnell moves towards Marianne almost imperceptibly, and their arms touch. She want to pick up his hand and suck on his fingertips one after the other.\u201d She can do no such thing in public. The barrier in contemporary interactions is often a screen. In Kamila Shamsie\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/10/home-fire-kamila-shamsie-review\">Home Fire</a></em>, Isma notes: \u201cBut \u2018touch\u2019 was the one thing modern technology didn\u2019t allow, and without it she and her sister had lost something vital in their way of being together.\u201d</p> <p>Forbidden or disaster-laden touch has been thematically explored from the beginning of storytelling: think the apple of Eden, King Midas, Apollo and Daphne, Tantalus, Pygmalion and Thanatos myths, where touching can have calamitous consequences.

Von Aschenbach\u2019s gaze upon the young Tadzio in <em>Death in Venice</em> by Thomas Mann is obsessive, but the distance cannot be broached because of age, gender and a cholera epidemic. Poor Esther of Dickens\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\">Bleak House</a></em>, always on the margins of family and society, is ravaged by a disease assumed to be smallpox that leaves her further isolated. Of course, social edicts on physical engagement were more stringent in much of the 19th century than the century preceding and following it. And, in futuristic novels, oppressive regimes such as Margaret Atwood\u2019s Gilead<em> </em>in <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> severely circumscribe touch.</p> <p>\u201cMost classic novels were written in times when touch was much restricted and therefore it was much more significant when it happened,\u201d says John Mullan, author of <em>What Matters in Jane Austen?</em>. \u201cIn <em>Persuasion</em>, for example, there\u2019s this extraordinary moment, when Anne is invited into a carriage and Captain Wentworth \u2018without saying a word \u2026 quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage. Yes; he had done it. She was in the carriage, and felt that he had placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it.\u2019 It\u2019s a completely non-verbal exchange, which would be powerful now, but all the more in a period where you were allowed to link arms, but with gloves, and even wore gloves when dancing, so contact was just electric in that world.\u201d</p> <p>Carriages and cars instil an awareness of space and further hesitancy, and can therefore be the perfect arena for the most discreet contact. In Sterne\u2019s <em>A Sentimental Journey</em>, Yorick holds Madame de L\u2019s hand in his carriage, rather than trying to do more, and shows her that his feelings for her are deeper than simple lust. Charles Ryder lights a cigarette for Julia Flyte as she drives in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/evelynwaugh.fiction\">Brideshead Revisited</a></em>, and a tension is set up that infects the rest of the novel: \u201cAs I took the cigarette from my lips and put it in hers, I caught a thin bat\u2019s squeak of sexuality, inaudible to any but me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09dbdeb5b82a0b1eb688af16a8d51efa6f2f03e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09dbdeb5b82a0b1eb688af16a8d51efa6f2f03e8/0_172_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kept apart \u2026 Hayley Atwell, Ben Whishaw and Matthew Goode in Brideshead Revisited (2008).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kept apart \u2026 Hayley Atwell, Ben Whishaw and Matthew Goode in Brideshead Revisited (2008).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC FILMS/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The constraints of class, racial and religious differences keep physical contact in check, just as possible homosexuality is cloaked in literature, from Shakespeare to Proust to EM Forster to James Baldwin. Both status and sexuality are at play in Carol Ann Duffy\u2019s poem \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/08/carol-ann-duffy-book-club\">Warming Her Pearls</a><em>\u201d</em>: \u201cNext to my own skin, her pearls. My mistress / bids me wear them, warm them, until evening.\u201d This is as close the maid will get to her love object. In several of her novels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sarahwaters\">Sarah Waters</a> explores similar class and sexuality boundaries, slowly encroached upon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/04/big-bold-and-brilliant-books-to-last-through-lockdown\">Big, bold and brilliant: books to last through lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Primitive creatures that we are, there\u2019s nothing like a few inbuilt rules and regulations and the odd institution to ratchet up the erotic tension. An exquisite suspense lies in the space between obedience and disobedience, uniformity and special status. In places where touch is expressly forbidden \u2013 schools, nunneries, consulting rooms \u2013 any brushing of skin speaks volumes. In writing my novel <em>The Seduction, </em>a therapist\u2019s office became the theatre for unspoken tensions, the taboo against touch magnified in a space in which any physical contact would mark the moment of true boundary breaking.</p> <p>That same aching denial runs through many novels set in formal establishments. In school novels \u2013 <em>Notes on a Scandal, Olivia, </em><em>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie \u2013 </em>the slightest of touch after all the delicious torture of gazing and longing is explosive. The nuns\u2019 self-conscious awareness of the visiting official, Mr Dean, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/01/rumer-godden-rereading-india-novels\">Rumer Godden</a>\u2019s <em>Black Narcissus</em> culminates in Sister Ruth\u2019s attempt to seduce him by the daring act of swapping her nun\u2019s habit for modern dress. </p> <p>With restraint a necessity, more is left to the imagination.

\n  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, announces jobkeeper on 30 March:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cToday, I announce that we are committing $130bn over the next six months to support the jobs and livelihoods of what we anticipate are being almost <strong>six million</strong> Australians, who will need that lifeline in the months ahead.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Around 900,000 employers and sole traders express interest, and then enrolments commence in mid-April.</p> \n  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, reports on 24 April that around 400,000 employers, covering 2.5 million employees have enrolled.</p> \n  <p>In his address to parliament on 12 May, Frydenberg says:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cThere are now more than 835,000 businesses employing more than 5.5 million workers who are formally enrolled in the program.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Then on 14 May, the treasurer announces the number of people on jobkeeper \u201cnow exceeds six million\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, after collecting the tax file numbers and other information on eligible employees, the ATO begins paying out jobkeeper earlier this month. Three fortnights of payments have been made so far, and the next is set to be paid by Sunday.</p> \n  <p>It is then that the ATO realises it is paying out much less than expected, and goes back to check the numbers. The total number of employers is right, but the employees is way down.</p> \n  <p>The ATO determines it was an incorrect response on the enrolment form that led to massively inflated employee numbers.</p> \n  <p>So it\u2019s not clear how the original number was determined, but I am sure there will be questions on it soon.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:43:57.580Z\">at 9.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec78c3f8f0864e579f15a62\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:25:51.399Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Clive Palmer plans to sue WA over hard border</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The mining magnate and former senator <strong>Clive Palmer</strong> <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-22/clive-palmer-threatens-high-court-challenge-wa-border-closure/12276368\">says he is planning to take Western Australia to the high court</a> over the state\u2019s hard border closure, after being refused entry.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:32:46.581Z\">at 9.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec787468f0864e579f15a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:07:50.641Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australian stock market closes for the week, via AAP:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The ASX has finished the week on a sour note, dropping 53.4 points with every sector except tech stocks closing lower.</p> \n   <p>The Australian share market has closed lower, rejecting a move above 5,600 as traders turned cautious amid fresh US-China tensions.</p> \n   <p>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index finished Friday down 53.4 points, or 0.96%, at 5,497 points, while the broader All Ordinaries closed down 52.2 points, or 0.92%, to 5,608.7.</p> \n   <p>The Australian dollar was buying 65.36 US cents, down from 65.71 US cents at the close of trade on Thursday.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T08:11:50.116Z\">at 9.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec785ce8f0886ce4f5d8519\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T07:59:08.023Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Services Union is calling on the jobkeeper payment to be expanded now there\u2019s <em>a lot</em> less money being spent than forecast.</p> \n  <p>The assistant national secretary of the union, <strong>Linda White</strong>, said the payment should be extended to employees who were excluded because of the ownership structure of their employer, such as dnata and Air Niugini. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey should have access to the same financial support as other Australians,\u201d White said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cDnata employees have been stood down without pay since March and are struggling to put food on the table for their families.

Instead of reporting how many employees were eligible, businesses reported how much they expected to receive for their employees.</p> \n  <p>In that way, one became 1,500.</p> \n  <p>We are not joking. Here is the official release.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Joint media release with the Australian Taxation Office</strong></p> \n  <p>Late yesterday, the ATO and Treasury advised the Government of a reporting error in estimates of the number of employees likely to access the JobKeeper program. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>The enrolment forms completed by 910,055 businesses who have self\u2011assessed as eligible under the scheme had indicated that this program would cover around 6.5 million eligible employees. <br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>The ATO\u2019s review of these forms has found that around 1,000 of those businesses appear to have made significant errors when reporting the estimate of eligible employees on their enrolment form. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>The most common error was that instead of reporting the number of employees they expected to be eligible, they reported the amount of assistance they expected to receive. </strong><br></p> \n  <p><strong>For example, over 500 businesses with \u20181\u2019 eligible employee reported a figure of \u20181,500\u2019 (which is the amount of JobKeeper payment they would expect to receive for each fortnight for that employee).</strong></p> \n  <p>This reporting error has come to light as the ATO and Treasury have been analysing the amounts being paid out under the scheme, reconciling these with the estimates provided by enrolled businesses of the likely number of eligible employees. It was not picked up by the ATO earlier as their primary focus in the first fortnight of JobKeeper payments was on ensuring that JobKeeper payments were paid promptly to those eligible for them, and not paid to those who were ineligible. These initial estimates from businesses of employees covered are not linked to payments, and so were not as carefully analysed.</p> \n  <p>Importantly this reporting error has no consequences for JobKeeper payments that have already been made to eligible businesses, as payments under the scheme depend on the subsequent declaration that an eligible business makes in relation to each and every eligible employee. This declaration does not involve estimates and requires an employer to provide the tax file number for each eligible employee. By contrast, the only use of the information collected in respect of the reporting error was to provide an early estimate of the number of expected employees likely to access the JobKeeper program.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T04:46:18.116Z\">at 5.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec756488f08a1782fa7f661\"

from stable to negative, but maintains its AAA rating from the Fitch ratings agency.</p> \n  <p>Ratings like this dictate how easy it for countries to borrow money, as well as the interest rates on those borrowings.</p> \n  <p>As AAP reports:<br></p> \n  <p>Fitch said it expects Australia\u2019s economic growth will fall sharply in 2020 and government spending in response to the health and economic crisis will cause large fiscal deficits and a sharp increase in government debt.</p> \n  <p>It forecast the $2tn economy to contract 5% this year driven by a plunge in economic activity during the second quarter due to virus containment measures.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhile these measures have effectively curbed the spread of the virus, they also constrained household consumption and reduced business sentiment and investment,\u201d Fitch said. </p> \n  <p>It expects a gradual economic recovery to begin in the second half of 2020 affirmed Australia\u2019s rating but said a downgrade is possible in the absence of a fiscal consolidation strategy or if there is economic or financial sector distress.</p> \n  <p>Fitch said fiscal deficits are set to swell at both the federal and state levels as a result of the discretionary fiscal measures such as the jobkeeper wage subsidy program and economic contraction. </p> \n  <p>It forecast the government deficit to rise to 6.9% of GDP in 2019-20 and 9.0% in 2020-21, from 1.2% in 2018-19.</p> \n  <p>Fitch\u2019s move follows a similar action by S&amp;P Global Ratings in April, when it downgraded the outlook on Australia from stable to negative as a result of the government\u2019s stimulus measures. <br></p> \n  <p>The federal treasurer,<strong> Josh Frydenberg</strong>, said Fitch\u2019s action is a reminder of the importance of maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur measures are temporary, targeted and proportionate to the challenge we face and will ensure Australia bounces back stronger on the other side, without undermining the structural integrity of the budget which Australians have worked so hard to restore,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n </div> \n <p

New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has said it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep borders across Australia closed, given the number of new coronavirus infections has stabilised, and is opening her own state for regional tourism on 1 June.</p> \n  <p>But other premiers disagree. \u201cWe are not going to be lectured to by a state that has the highest amount of cases in Australia,\u201d Queensland premier<strong> Annastacia Palaszczuk </strong>has said. <strong> Mark McGowan</strong> lobbed a Ruby Princess comment towards NSW the day before. The national health advice is there is no reason not to reopen. The states say their health advice is to keep the borders closed.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The active (known) Covid-free states are working on whether or not they can create their own travel bubbles, which would exclude NSW and Victoria, something NSW really does not want. It is opening up its state to travel, with even the ski resorts open for business. As it was always going to, the moment politics was thrown back into the mix, any sense of national unity between the leaders is very quickly dissipating. Still, national cabinet will be held next Friday and it\u2019s possible they can come to some sort of agreement, or at least a cease-fire, then.</p> \n  <p>It comes as South Australia eases some rules today: from Friday, cafes and restaurants can seat 10 customers indoors for meals along with 10 outdoors. The change has come earlier than expected and SA will also look to move to stage two ahead of schedule.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the commonwealth has announced it will be spending $1.8bn on local government projects, as it looks to kick start the economy with infrastructure investment. The economic recovery is the number one priority now, and you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more about it on Tuesday, when the prime minister gives his national press club address.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll cover all the day\u2019s events as they unfold.

We\u2019ll try and do more next week \u2026</p> <p>Dom Frey pays tribute to Anthony Partington, a witty English teacher, now head of Stamford Welland academy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inspirational, humorous, talented, witty and a brilliant teacher. As a disengaged student he captured my imagination with his passion for American lit texts and Shakespeare. He really brought them to life for me and completely challenged my (very limited at the time) world view that men could be sensitive, popular and educated at the same time. Sadly, I didn\u2019t grow up in the most diverse environment at the time! He was a breath of fresh air, never afraid to give an opinion or to challenge my personal mediocrity. He inspired me to go to university and be successful and engaging like him when all I wanted to do was coast through life as a 16 year old. <br> I\u2019m an English teacher now and I\u2019d like to think I rock a little bit of the party boy attitude and pedagogical style with my students as often as I can. I even find myself saying: \u201cwill ya bloody shoot oop!\u201d From time to time in his Wigan accent.   Thank you, Anthony. Legend!</p> </blockquote> <p>Laura Parker relives the heady days of Leeds in the 1980s:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Learning Spanish at Roundhay high with Mrs Dronfield changed my life. I went on to do Latin American Studies at university where I learnt Portuguese, spent a year in Brazil and was bitten by the travel bug. In the intervening three decades, I\u2019ve had the good fortune to live and work in many places \u2013 including for over 10 years in Bulgaria. There I met my Italian husband with whom I\u2019m now locked down in northern Italy.</p> <p>I can still muddle through a conversation in Spanish \u2013 which this weekend I will with my Spanish brother-in-law \u2013 and think of Mrs Dronfield every time I do. Thanks to her rigour, learning Italian was less painful than it might have been.</p> <p>I would just like her to know that in the hills of Piedmont here\u2019s an English woman speaking Italian and thinking of her brilliant Spanish teacher.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alison Leonard recalls a moral conundrum:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Olga Wilkinson inspired me. There were times when she discarded the syllabus entirely and challenged us directly with moral problems from history. For instance, when I declared myself a pacifist, she asked me whether, if I found myself standing next to Adolf Hitler and happened to have a gun on me, I would kill him and thus save millions of lives. (I was flummoxed, but went on to study philosophy at university.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Gillian Fitzgerald fondly remembers an early champion of equality in Liverpool:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We made xylophones in Mr Bleasdale\u2019s class. It was the age of sewing for girls, woodwork for boys, but not with Mr Bleasdale. I sawed, sanded and varnished pieces of wood, ready for Mr Bleasdale to tune each one. He drilled holes in each end, ready for twine to be threaded through. At last, our xylophones were ready. I\u2019ll never forget the thrill of playing a musical instrument I had made.</p> </blockquote> <p>Luke Bosman remembers language classes with Mike Clark:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was a shy lad who would naturally have preferred to sit unnoticed, to put my efforts into bookwork and to quietly succeed. Yet somehow he took this boy with a speech impediment (one of the reasons why I hated to speak) and helped me to grow in confidence, such that by the time I had finished my A-levels, for which he had also been one of my Russian teachers, I could speak confidently.</p> <p>When I qualified as a teacher, I had an interview at a school where, unbeknown to me, he was the head of department. One of the interview questions was, \u201cWhat motivated you to become a teacher?\u201d I was obliged to answer that my inspiration was sitting to the headteacher\u2019s left. I didn\u2019t get the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jerry Goddard goes back 50 years to a history class in Bedfordshire in the 1960s:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Patrick \u2018Harry\u2019 Eavis treated every pupil as if you were three-five years older than you were. Talk about high expectations. \u2018So retell the Martin Luther / Diet of Worms impasse with the pope. But why not turn your A4 page sideways and do it in an eight caption comic book style?\u2019 It made you pr\u00e9cis in a really creative way. I can remember him playing the violin and joining us sixth formers in carol singing, raising money for Oxfam. He was a liberal socialist and believed in community. <br> Did it do mean me any good? Well I\u2019m 67 and now retired after a lifelong career in education including teaching, training, writing, advising, directing and now a member of the board of a local university. What success I\u2019ve had in my career was because of trying to emulate his style.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Where was the Upside?</h2> <p>In the race for vaccines: eight volunteers produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/astrazeneca-could-supply-potential-coronavirus-vaccine-from-september\">Covid-19 antibodies</a> in a US vaccine trial, the first human trial results.

  "<p>Voters will occasionally forgive a government they deem heartless, if they reckon it has the steel to get the job done. They might even, though rarely, forgive a government they deem incompetent, if they believe its heart is in the right place. What they will never forgive is a government that is both uncaring and useless. And yet that is precisely the judgment that now hovers over Boris Johnson and the administration he leads.</p> <p>Johnson had surely intuited as much when he performed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">rubber-burning U-turn</a> late on Thursday, ditching his previous insistence, reiterated 24 hours earlier, that foreign-born NHS and care workers must pay an extra fee for the privilege of using a service that could not function without them. The notion of such a surcharge reeked of meanness of spirit, the demand that it increase from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624 stank. The hypocrisy was particularly pungent: even Scrooge didn\u2019t clap on the doorstep for those from whom he was squeezing every penny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Public patience for a government that is incompetent will not last long</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clearly in-house genius Dominic Cummings is losing his touch if he didn\u2019t see that one coming. Of course, the surcharge policy would have to be ditched. No government could be on the wrong side of health and care workers during a pandemic that has the nation clinging to doctors and nurses as its only protection. That would be true of a government that was handling things well. But it is triply true of a government handling things badly.</p> <p>No need to dwell on the excess deaths number, which suggests Britain will soon have lost as many people to coronavirus as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/almost-55000-excess-uk-deaths-during-covid-19-outbreak-says-ons\">lost civilians</a> in the second world war. Contemplate instead the current situation, in which the government has already eased the lockdown in England and plans to ease it more on 1 June, even though it has not yet built a robust system that can find, test, trace and isolate new cases.</p> <p>Maybe it will all come good on the night. Perhaps at 11.55pm on 31 May, a breathless Matt Hancock will rush towards the Downing Street microphone to announce, still panting, that the contact-tracing app is online and the last contact-tracer is in place. But for now this looks like a government that has seen a cart and a horse and put them in the wrong order. Surely, the first move was to build the system that would keep the lid on any future outbreak and only then \u2013 once the app was tested and working, once the tracers were not merely recruited but fully trained, once the local health organisations best placed to run testing were involved \u2013 start lifting the restrictions that have kept the virus under relative control.</p> <p>Instead, the government is now hastily <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-easing-the-uk-out-of-lockdown-is-a-confidence-game-and-the-pm-is-losing-11991899\">changing its story</a>, explaining that an app previously touted as essential is now merely \u201cthe cherry on the cake\u201d, so there\u2019s no need for us to worry if it\u2019s not ready yet. The focus now, they tell us, is on those human contact tracers. Except they\u2019re not fully up to speed either. No wonder the NHS Confederation <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52748564\">is warning</a> of \u201ca second surge\u201d if the lockdown is eased any further.</p> <p>Cart-before-horse has become the repeating pattern. Johnson dumped the simple \u201cstay home\u201d advice for the opaque \u201cstay alert\u201d \u2013 prompting the number of Britons who regard the government\u2019s messaging as clear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benatipsosmori/status/1263477716675973120?s=20\">to drop</a> from 90% to 56% \u2013 on 10 May while the daily death rate was still grievously high. He said people should be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to their workplaces, before those places had been retooled for physical distancing. The inevitable result was to nudge people back on to trains and buses \u2013 regardless of his suggestion that they should avoid public transport \u2013 before he\u2019d ensured a sufficient, accessible supply of the face masks that the best advice suggests are necessary for such travel. He\u2019s doing it again now on schools, announcing a return date of 1 June <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/05/reopening-schools-question-logistics-not-risks-teachers\">before</a> the extra teachers and classrooms are in place that would allow socially distanced teaching to be viable.</p> <p>Logic would dictate that you prepare first and, once that\u2019s done, you loosen the restrictions. Johnson\u2019s preferred method is to signal a relaxation, then scramble to put in place the mechanisms that might make that relaxation possible.</p> <p>The consequences of this \u201cact now, prepare later\u201d approach have been lethal. Witness the decision to release infected patients from hospital and back into care homes unequipped to receive them. Reporting by the BBC\u2019s Lewis Goodall <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1263219921124720640?s=20\">shows</a> that the more expensive homes had the staff, and the space, to keep the virus at bay and keep their residents alive; the cheaper ones worked staff round the clock with no PPE, and the disease duly ran riot. Incredibly, those well-resourced homes kept their residents alive in part by defying government instructions, imposing an early lockdown when the official advice was to keep the doors open.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/21/nhs-workers-bereavement-scheme-unfairness\">We forced the government to do right by NHS workers.

Some of that, the BMJ argues, goes back to decisions taken over several years, such as austerity and the \u201cdecimation\u201d of the country\u2019s local and regional public health capacity. That may predate Johnson\u2019s premiership, but it does not predate this government, which has been in power for a full 10 years. This is on them.</p> <p>So far the public has been patient. It has granted its leaders the benefit of the doubt, allowing that this is a global crisis not of their making. Crucially, it has wanted to believe that the government means well, even if it is stumbling. That\u2019s certainly been the perception of Johnson himself, who came so close to death at the hands of the virus. The surcharge row was a perilous moment because it shook that understanding, casting the government as lacking basic compassion.</p> <p>More such moments are coming. Why is it right that foreign-born porters, cleaners and care workers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1263501628692406272?s=20\">are excluded</a> from the automatic visa extension that has rightly been granted to doctors and nurses? Why is an army veteran who served this country, who worked and paid taxes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/19/british-army-veterans-children-call-on-government-to-waive-27000-nhs-bill\">landed</a> with a \u00a327,000 bill for treatment that would be free to everyone else? How could Johnson praise two migrant nurses for saving his life and then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikegalsworthy/status/1263101739223232512?s=20\">say</a>, \u201cOn the other hand \u2026\u201d as he attempted to defend charging them to use the NHS they work for?</p> <p>He would be wise to learn the lesson of the reversal that was forced on him by an adroit Labour leader this week.

Especially when I\u2019m increasingly opting for meals such as tinned spaghetti on toast. Because real comfort foods are the ones you remember.</p> <p>Tinned spaghetti on toast is something my grandma (who was a great cook, before old age and dementia) used to make me for lunch, when I\u2019d go and stay with her as a kid. And it\u2019s a carb-on-carb delight I can\u2019t remember tasting since my 90s childhood. Triple carb, actually, if you count all the sugar in the tomato sauce. I remember the roughness of the piece of kitchen roll she\u2019d tuck into my collar when serving me this; a kitschy affectation, like something out of a 70s Italian restaurant. I remember the butter on the lightly charred white toast (it absolutely <em>has</em> to be white, for minimal nutritional value) melting into the neon orange sauce and creating something so much greater than the sum of its parts. This is an experience I\u2019ve felt compelled to recreate in lockdown. And I can confirm that spaghetti on toast is still food of the gods.

Their sharp-edged concrete home is a sterile limbo, but its purpose is to house a huge, unseen orchard for a future world following an unspecified apocalypse. In the 28-minute, black-and-white film\u2019s lushly shot opening, a terrifying, oily, blood-black flood has overwhelmed the streets of Bethlehem, artist Larissa Sansour\u2019s childhood city.</p> <h2><strong>Backward and </strong><strong>forward</strong><strong> \u2026 </strong></h2> <p>But what kind of seeds are they sowing there? The two women \u2013 Dunia, played by Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass (Succession\u2019s stepmom Marcia) and Alia (Baghdad Central\u2019s Maisa Abd Elhadi) \u2013 have rather different ideas about how to move forward. Now that the world outdoors is a blank canvas, should they shirk the oppressive weight of the past and start anew, as the younger Alia argues? Or must they remember not only to maintain who they were, but to avoid making the mistakes of earlier generations, as Dunia implores from her deathbed?</p> <h2><strong>Going </strong><strong>global \u2026 </strong></h2> <p>Shot between the UK and Palestine and performed in Arabic, the 2019 film, which Sansour co-directed with her partner S\u00f8ren Lind, was commissioned for the Danish Pavilion at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale. The situation facing Palestinians, caught, like the women, between \u201cwhat was and what\u2019s to come\u201d, is clearly high on the artist\u2019s agenda.

  "<p>For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures \u2013 and those of their staff \u2013 into uncertainty. That\u2019s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. \u201cI\u2019d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we\u2019d prepared,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I\u2019d also removed items from tables, so there weren\u2019t as many touch points.\u201d But when Boris Johnson\u2019s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.</p> <p>The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. \u201cPrior to the shutdown, we\u2019d been talking about what our strategy would be \u2013 I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game\u201d, he says of being ready for business the next day. \u201cWe had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t without its problems. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they\u2019re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum\u2019s desserts ... that\u2019s six different containers at least. We spent about \u00a32,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that\u2019s a lot of money. But it\u2019s hopefully keeping us going.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f2044da140e84d0fbcda537c9453465806870d24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2044da140e84d0fbcda537c9453465806870d24/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Blaikie delivering fruit and vegetables to Edinburgh zoo\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blaikie now makes weekly deliveries of leftover fruit and vegetables to Edinburgh zoo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shot remotely by P\u00e5l Hansen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite making headway before the lockdown, it wasn\u2019t until the national furlough scheme was announced that Blaikie could reassure staff their incomes were secure. \u201cI always like to put myself in other people\u2019s shoes, so that was a relief [when I heard about the support]. It\u2019s quite difficult for me to get staff where I\u2019m located \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to get here if you don\u2019t have your own transport. It\u2019s taken me years to build a good team \u2013 11 of us in total \u2013 who understand the way I operate. When these people disappear there\u2019s a lot you\u2019re losing \u2013 not just a member of staff, but knowledge and experience, too.\u201d</p> <p>With the government support package now in place \u2013 and extended until October \u2013 Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub \u2013 where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers \u2013 was born. The feedback keeps him going. \u201cThere\u2019s an older couple and the wife\u2019s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have the soup at 12 o\u2019clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That\u2019s what makes it worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just people benefiting, either \u2013 residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub\u2019s surplus wares. \u201cI had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: \u2018You should take this to the zoo.\u2019 So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door \u2013 and that\u2019s been it ever since.\u201d Now Blaikie\u2019s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors \u2013 the zoo\u2019s main form of income \u2013 have come to a standstill. \u201cYou\u2019d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don\u2019t look as good, but they\u2019re perfectly fine for the animals. When we\u2019re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along \u2013 nothing\u2019s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers \u2013 apples, cabbages, broccoli - I\u2019ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they\u2019re all under a lot of pressure.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/22/now-i-have-a-future-how-furlough-helped-a-paddle-sports-business-stay-afloat\">\u2018Now I have a future\u2019: how furlough helped a paddle-sports business stay afloat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While it\u2019s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie\u2019s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. \u201cWe have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways.

  "<p>Conceived almost a decade ago, the Pr\u00edncipe label burst out of Lisbon\u2019s poorer outskirts and onto an international scene enriched by burgeoning global sounds. While the song Danza Kuduro and acts such as <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/burakasomsistema\">Buraka Som Sistema</a> took kuduro to car sound-systems and festival tents worldwide, Pr\u00edncipe were keen to expand on the genre\u2019s potential and break down racist, sexist and classist barriers holding it back locally. There are hints of house, techno and hip-hop in their music but the African-diaspora sound of Pr\u00edncipe primarily incorporates Angolan kizomba\u2019s intoxicating rhythms, melodic tarraxinha and the more skeletal, hard-hitting tarraxo. Few on the roster capture the sheer breadth of these styles as well as Lisbon-via-Bordeaux producer N\u00eddia, whose repertoire shines across party-starters and darker tracks. Following a joyous debut EP, her <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nidia-nidia-e-ma-nidia-e-fudida/\">first album for the label landed in 2017</a>, pulling no punches with its heady, high-octane batida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ae552e3b7083b309f4f9d2fe2dcbc700fa1cfdf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae552e3b7083b309f4f9d2fe2dcbc700fa1cfdf1/0_0_2000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"N\u00eddia: N\u00e3o Fales Nela Que a Mentes album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">N\u00eddia: N\u00e3o Fales Nela Que a Mentes album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/37k7KzGQIMEnoxD15qq4uL?si=MAoyfjGpQPmuS1rZ02YGwQ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/37k7KzGQIMEnoxD15qq4uL\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>N\u00eddia\u2019s new record \u2013 N\u00e3o Fales Nela Que a Mentes \u2013 is a more meditative affair, ridden with intimacy, introspection and bittersweet melancholia. The melody on mid-album cut Raps demonstrates this well, beginning with licks of uncertainty and paranoia before unfurling into a progression cooler and calmer than any summer evening. Percussion across the release is consistent in quality yet varied in style, from the shuffle and sway driving lead single Capacidades to the thrilling clap and hand-drum beat of Nik Com and the moody, captivating rumble underpinning Popo.

  "<p>This pandemic is frightening for many people \u2013 especially those at the highest risk \u2013 and the need for effective prevention and treatment is pressing.</p> <p>When there is no direct evidence about what is best to do with a new disease, we need to create it. Clearly, that means recognising that some seemingly sensible interventions may not produce the intended effects. All of medicine is a bit uncertain (unlike maths, where proof is immutable). We can be very certain about some things (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-sarcastic\">drinking bleach</a> is harmful) and less certain about others (could <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52371688\">vitamin D</a> be useful?) Admitting uncertainty is something medicine historically finds difficult. But if we don\u2019t recognise the gaps in our knowledge, we won\u2019t research them. And good research has to be the way out of this.</p> <p>There are now thousands of research papers on Covid-19, but many of such poor quality that we shouldn\u2019t rely on them. This means extra care and critique is needed. And on that basis, we simply don\u2019t know if <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/vitamin-d-a-rapid-review-of-the-evidence-for-treatment-or-prevention-in-covid-19/\">vitamin D, for example, will help with Covid-19 </a> (although all UK residents get a <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/\">recommendation either to take or consider taking vitamin D</a> the evidence for benefit is either <a href=\"https://ec.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/ec/8/2/EC-18-0432.xml\">absent or small </a>with the exception of asthma). To know if it will help against Covid-19 needs rapid research \u2013 for instance, assessing the vitamin D levels of people with severe Covid-19 against similar people who have less severe Covid-19 or avoid getting it altogether, or asking a group of people at high risk to diligently take supplements, and monitoring what happens. </p> <p>As far as hydroxychloroquine goes, initial trials of this drug \u2013 which is typically used to prevent malaria (and has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">promoted by Donald Trump</a> as a possible cure for all things Covid-19) \u2013 were initially of poor quality, tiny, and with no control groups. Yet they were widely reported as showing it helped, while better quality trials that followed <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-what-do-the-clinical-trials-tell-us/\">showed it didn\u2019t</a>. Research is now focused on whether it might work as a <a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/news/covid-19-drugs-trial-rolled-out/\">preven</a><a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/news/covid-19-drugs-trial-rolled-out/\">tive measure</a>. Knowing what doesn\u2019t work is vital. It means that we can stop wasting resources on things that don\u2019t work \u2013 and avoid unnecessary side-effects. It\u2019s also clear that hydroxychloroquine has cardiac side-effects, a fact that needs care in monitoring. There is no such thing as an intervention that is free of side-effects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-doctors-whistleblowers-history-silenced\">Doctors have been whistleblowers throughout history. They\u2019ve also been silenced</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This doesn\u2019t just go for drug treatments. It should hold true for non-drug treatments. There is a clamour for everyone in public to wear a face covering. Does it work? Some research papers insist it does \u2013 offering reasons as to why fabric will stop the passage of viral particles from the mouth and nose. But what really matters is whether this would result in fewer people being infected. So far, three reviews of the evidence (which have yet to be peer-reviewed) have found no or slender evidence, at best, for any benefit. But a bigger concern is a lack of investigation of unintended consequences. Would people wearing face coverings manage not to touch their faces or would they subconsciously take risks, which results in more infections, not fewer? What does this mean for deaf or lipreading people, or those with cognitive difficulties? Hazards for some may be accepted if there are outweighing benefits for everyone \u2013 but, when the evidence is so slender, we need rational deliberation. </p> <p>Would policymakers assume face coverings work, and make decisions on, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/public-could-told-wear-face-18172932\">encouraging the use of public transport </a>on this basis without high-quality evidence to tell us this is safe? The truth is that we don\u2019t know, because we don\u2019t have the studies. The counter-argument is \u201cit\u2019s a global pandemic, we can\u2019t wait for the results of research\u201d. I would argue that because it is a global pandemic, we need good, rapid research even more: the results will be applicable to far more people than usual when a drug or potential preventive measure is tested, hence the need to get better evidence for everyone. And yes, the need is urgent \u2013 but this pandemic has no clear end in sight.</p> <p>We could do fast, pragmatic, real-world studies, supplying masks to a geographical area with encouragement and instruction on use, and monitor for comparative changes in infection rates, together with carrying out field studies to observe people\u2019s behaviour. Difficult, yes; but impossible, no. The World Health Organization has made it clear that we need research during pandemics (and drug trials have got off to an amazingly fast start), but this needs to hold true for things like face coverings too. What seems a sensible and obvious solution may not be. Harms and unintended consequences are everywhere, but are only reckoned with properly if we look for them.</p> <p>Medicine is now in the era of Covid-19. This could be a turning point: where we take the uncertainty we are facing and, rather than assuming that our interventions will work, everyone \u2013 citizens, patients, researchers and healthcare staff \u2013 comes together to reduce it.</p> <p>\u2022 Margaret McCartney is a GP who writes about evidence-based medicine; she is the author of The State of Medicine: keeping the promise of the NHS</p>",

Everybody\u2019s been having a difficult time. People are knocking on neighbours\u2019 doors to borrow money for food. The mayor and the village chief gave us relief packs before, but it wasn\u2019t enough. They should give us more. They\u2019re growing stricter with the lockdown, too.

I cooked the Lucky Me noodles that my mother bought the other day. I added vegetable leaves to make it more nutritious. They loved it. I always get good food because I\u2019m pregnant, but the children have been eating soy sauce and cooking oil with their rice. What\u2019s important is they have rice to eat. My mother bought 15kg of rice before the lockdown. It\u2019s lucky that my father still had work then. I\u2019m afraid we will run out of rice soon though because we also provide for my sister\u2019s family nearby. My mother can\u2019t stand not to help them, too.

But we teeter on the threshold of what could be the greatest depression for centuries. People who are losing their jobs and homes, with only politicians\u2019 promises to put in their bank account, have every right to ask whether now is the time to prioritise the climate \u2013 or couldn\u2019t it wait a year or two while we sort out this catastrophe first?</p> <p>That question has a clear answer: a green recovery can produce higher returns on public spending and create more jobs in both the short term and the long term, compared to the alternative of pouring stimulus cash into the fossil fuel economy.</p> <p>Those findings come from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\">study of the potential for a green recovery</a>, based on a survey of finance ministries and central bankers, and a comparison with the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, conducted by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, former World Bank chief economist Lord Stern, and leading economists from Oxford University.</p> <p>After the financial crisis in 2008, calls for a green recovery were partially successful. <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/urgently-needed-global-green-new-deal\">About 16% of the global stimulus spending was green</a>, including subsidies for renewable energy, seed funding for research and development, and new technology such as electric vehicles.</p> <p>That proportion may seem small, and the effects of the rest of the spending \u2013 much of which went on carbon-intensive projects such as concrete construction and coal \u2013 were soon apparent: carbon emissions, which had fallen 1.4%, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/31/emissions-rise-un-climate-chief\">rebounded by a record amount</a> of nearly 6% in 2010.</p> <p>Yet the green stimulus bore fruit. Renewable energy expanded, and the cost of wind and solar power fell far faster than predicted, to the point where both forms of power are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/wind-and-solar-plants-will-soon-be-cheaper-than-coal-in-all-big-markets-around-world-analysis-finds\">competitive with fossil fuel generation</a>, without the need for subsidy.</p> <p>If that was possible from just 16% of stimulus spending, what could be done if the proportions were reversed? We are much better prepared to create green jobs now, according to the Oxford study. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">Shovel-ready projects</a>, from insulating homes to widening cycle lanes, abound. Electric vehicle charging points are needed around the world, and the slack in public transport can be used to upgrade rail networks.</p> <p>Car companies, with government incentives, could hasten the move from petrol and diesel engines. The renewable energy industry has progressed in the last decade, making home solar installation cheap and offshore wind farms viable.

But more needs to be done to ensure that people see the positive, rather than associate falling emissions with falling prosperity.

Those are certainly needed \u2013 as the failure to attach conditions after the 2008 crisis clearly shows \u2013 but can seem like punishing industries already on their knees. Workers on airlines and in shale fields are workers too, with mortgages to pay and families to care for. Shrugging off the loss of their jobs as the casualties of a cleaner future is not good enough: there must be a clear path to high-quality alternatives.</p> <p>After the financial crisis, capital did not reel for long \u2013 the initiative was soon recaptured by austerity advocates and increasingly by populists who persuaded voters in many countries that the rollback of the state was the price of fiscal stability. The same forces are still in place: Donald Trump\u2019s White House has already seized the excuse to repeal dozens of regulations on clean air and water, threatening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/earth-day-50-years-anniversary-environment-trump\">reverse environmental protections to a pre-Nixon state</a>.

  "<p>When people ask me what kind of films I like, I never know what to say. I like everything! Total trash, high art, comedy, horror, British realism, Czech surrealism, Hong Kong action, Hungarian inaction, you name it. But if there\u2019s one kind of film I\u2019ve never really loved, it\u2019s westerns. Sure, I\u2019ve seen some great ones, but as a genre it has never really appealed. I\u2019m not American. I\u2019m not into guns. And the demonisation and slaughter of indigenous peoples doesn\u2019t really grab me.</p> <p>Most of all, I\u2019ve never really liked John Wayne. I think of him as the personification of humourless, swaggering, macho Hollywood conservatism: a supporter of McCarthyite anti-communist witch hunts, gun rights, the Vietnam war, Ronald Reagan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/20/john-wayne-racist-homophobic-views-1971-playboy-interview\">white supremacism</a>. (In a 1971 Playboy interview Wayne said, \u201cI believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility.\u201d) And I recall anecdotes about how he stole his whole drawling cowboy shtick off the veteran stuntman Yakima Canutt. He did have a great voice, though.</p> <p>All of this goes some way to explaining why I\u2019ve never seen The Searchers, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/searchers-ford-action\">its reputation</a> as the greatest western \u2013 if not one of the greatest movies \u2013 ever. I\u2019ve never seen any of John Ford\u2019s movies, in fact. Maybe if I watch it I\u2019ll finally fall in love with the genre? As Wayne might put it, that\u2019ll be the day.</p> <p>I broadly knew the plot of The Searchers already: white girl is kidnapped by Native Americans; John Wayne goes off looking for her. For a long time. I\u2019m not sure if he finds her but I\u2019m willing to bet he finds himself. I\u2019d factored in a little outdated prejudice, but oh my God, The Searchers is one of the most fantastically racist movies I\u2019ve ever seen!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/12/ive-never-seen-the-magnificent-seven\">I've never seen \u2026\u00a0The Magnificent Seven</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Things start out well enough. The opening shot is a wonder to behold. Here\u2019s the silhouette of a woman in the doorway of her wooden cabin, emerging on to a dazzlingly sunlit porch and one of the most iconic views in cinema: Monument Valley. The landscape throughout the film is jaw-dropping. America is just stunningly beautiful; add in Technicolor and VistaVision and it looks hyperreally perfect: cornflower-blue skies like a touched-up vintage postcard, the deep, rich hues of rock and wood. Ford makes terrific use of the landscape, rhyming the isolated peaks with his rugged, isolated characters in the frame. The horsework (that\u2019s a technical term) is also amazing: orchestrated streams of riders surge across the screen, scaling precipices and plummeting down them. The action is epic and all the more exciting for the lack of fakery (although is it speeded up?). There probably aren\u2019t enough skilled stunt riders to do this kind of thing any more.</p> <p>But then there\u2019s Wayne. Everyone is in high spirits when his character Ethan returns from the civil war (albeit under suspicious circumstances), until he reminds them what an unapologetic racist he is. When Ethan\u2019s adoptive nephew Martin \u2013 who is an eighth Cherokee \u2013 sits down at the dinner table, Ethan goes all surly. \u201cA fella could mistake you for a half-breed,\u201d he sneers. Ethan hates the \u201cInjuns\u201d with a passion, even before they come and ransack the family homestead and make off with two young women. He knows a surprising amount about their culture, but has no respect for it. When he finds a dead Comanche, he shoots out his eyes so that he won\u2019t be able \u201cto wander the spirit lands\u201d. He\u2019d fit right in at Abu Ghraib. I\u2019m not warming to him.</p> <p>As well as a racist, Ethan is an asshole. Not just to Martin; to everyone. He\u2019s quick to punch people or chuck stuff at them. He gets sulky when he\u2019s not in charge. He\u2019s also utterly lacking in compassion. Look how he delivers the news to fellow searcher Brad that he has found the corpse of his fiancee, Lucy. When Brad asks for more details, Ethan flies into a rage: \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Draw you a picture? Don\u2019t ever ask me!\u201d Like <em>he\u2019s</em> the real victim.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Ethan, though, The Searchers as a whole seems to hate them Injuns. The plot contrives to demonise them from the outset by barely identifying them as individuals and having them kidnap innocent white girls, thus affording Wayne and co a patch of moral high ground they don\u2019t really deserve. Running through the film is a deep-seated paranoia about racial purity. Any dilution of whiteness is considered mortifying, from Martin\u2019s \u201chalf-breed\u201d status to the traumatised captives Ethan helps liberate, but considers ruined by their exposure to the Comanches. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re white,\u201d a cavalryman says. \u201cThey ain\u2019t any more,\u201d snarls Ethan. The same applies to the missing Debbie; Ethan\u2019s obsession is driven by a desire not to rescue her, but to kill her for going over to the other side.</p> <p>There are only two significant Native American characters: Scar, the mysterious chief of the kidnapping Comanche tribe (intriguingly played by blue-eyed Jewish actor Henry Brandon) who at least gets to explain that he has lost sons to white enemies; and Look (Beulah Archuletta), the bride Martin mistakenly acquires during a bartering session. This is the only thing in the movie that makes Wayne\u2019s character laugh. Look inexplicably dotes on Martin, smiling coyly, batting her eyelashes at him and serving him coffee. He literally boots her out of his bed (which Ethan finds hilarious). Look is later killed in a raid, which is convenient for Martin\u2019s marriage prospects. Martin\u2019s whole romantic subplot is played as jaunty comedy, and doesn\u2019t really sit with well the heavy central story.</p> <p>In its defence, the film hardly portrays Ethan as a hero. He\u2019s clearly a psycho as well as a racist haunted by past traumas, ultimately becoming the \u201csavage\u201d he views the Native Americans to be. So you could argue The Searchers is more a study of racism than a racist movie. But is that good enough? When the hero\u2019s climactic moment of change is his decision not to kill his niece for not being white enough, that\u2019s not really saying a lot, is it? It\u2019s the old, \u201cIsn\u2019t it great how this objectionable racist has become slightly less racist?\u201d \u2013 a device that\u2019s still in use today (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/30/green-book-review-mahershala-ali-viggo-mortensen-peter-farrelly\">Green Book</a>). That might have made white America feel better about itself in 1956, with the second world war a recent memory and the civil rights struggle heating up, but it wasn\u2019t enough to wash the sour taste out of my mouth today.</p> <p>All the same, I have to admire Wayne for agreeing to play such an unappealing character. He commands the screen effortlessly, never overselling Ethan\u2019s torment and obsession. Is my dislike of him driven by my own prejudices? If so, I\u2019m no better than him. If not, then it\u2019s down to the strength of his performance. Either way, I was wrong. Reading up afterwards, I discover that during the shoot, Wayne found Beulah Archuletta crying alone in a tent one day. It turned out she was going to miss her son\u2019s wedding. Wayne promptly halted production and flew Archuletta back to California so she could attend. Perhaps there\u2019s a soul beneath that leathery machismo after all.</p> <p>The Searchers might not be the beginning of my love affair with westerns, but I\u2019m not some saddle-sore old grouch who\u2019s happy to plod on, stewing in my own resentment. No: like Ethan, I can change. Maybe there\u2019s another western out there that will cement my appreciation for the genre. I\u2019ll keep on searching. It may take some time.</p>",

The ship\u2019s name (Win Far No 636), the dead man\u2019s passport number, and where the boat was now headed: the port of Kiribati, a central Pacific island nation on the equator.</p> \n<p>But for Mitchell, president of the Association of Professional Observers (APO), it was sadly nothing new \u2013 another death, devoid of facts.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve recorded one or two deaths of fishery observers every year since 2015,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cAll with the same outcome: no information.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"169cd14a5c0569f4a7e883e6c5031f7f7c8aaf5d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169cd14a5c0569f4a7e883e6c5031f7f7c8aaf5d/0_0_600_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Mitchell\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Mitchell advocates on behalf of fishery observers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Liz Mitchell</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her non-profit organisation advocates on behalf of this little-known workforce of ocean watchdogs, who have suffered a rash of disappearances and unexplained deaths that experts say is no coincidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe playbook of each disappearance or death is the same. The news leaks out from unofficial sources. The families are told: \u2018We\u2019re looking into it.\u2019 They hear nothing. They express grief and anger and they are overwhelmed with questions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mitchell fired off emails about Kaierua to officials, urging investigators to examine the potential for foul play or medical neglect, and to preserve critical evidence. On 25 March, Kiribati police said a pathologist had found that Kaierua, a 40-year-old father of four, had died from a traumatic brain injury. They were treating his death as murder.</p> \n<p>The tragedy brought the tally of deaths or disappearances at sea among this vulnerable workforce to nine since 2015, including a Ghanaian observer whose disappearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/16/ghana-fisheries-observer-vanishes\">was reported</a> by the Guardian last year.</p> \n<p>Independent fishery observers have one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. They travel aboard fishing vessels, tracking catches \u2013 including any bycatch of endangered species \u2013 in order to preserve fish stocks. Their job, if done properly, can pit them against hostile crew, particularly if they spot activities such as illegal fishing, trafficking or shark finning. Harassment and intimidation are common.</p> \n<p>To make matters worse, jurisdictional responsibilities at sea are complex: many ships fish in international waters, or fly the flags of countries reluctant to bring prosecutions. There is no international protocol for investigating the death of an observer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"355e856d8bcff78fd17fa745d794c36a8e3d0d60\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/355e856d8bcff78fd17fa745d794c36a8e3d0d60/0_0_743_419/500.jpg\" alt=\"Eritara Aati Kaierua\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fishery observer Eritara Aati Kaierua reportedly died from a a brain injury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In many cases observers are operating unprotected, according to a<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200218124407.htm\"> report </a>in February by Greenpeace, the APO and the University of New York.

Following pressure from the US fishing industry, claiming observers carry a threat of infection, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issues temporary waivers on the federal requirement for fishing vessels to carry observers.</p> \n<p>In an open letter last month, 19 NGOs including Greenpeace and WWF expressed concern about this development, saying any relaxation of monitoring and surveillance of commercial fisheries would allow more illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which already accounts for $23.5bn (\u00a318.8bn) and one in five wild-caught marine fish.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"708bfb4f2e6eb43e63dda4036629f736150b4c4e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/708bfb4f2e6eb43e63dda4036629f736150b4c4e/0_0_2500_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Longline fishing vessels caught illegally transferring fish at sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Longline fishing vessels caught illegally transferring fish at sea.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The very reason fishery observers are needed \u2013 the difficulty of seeing what happens aboard ships in international waters \u2013 is also what makes them vulnerable. While global data is scarce, a 2016 survey of alleged incidents reported by US observers, obtained via freedom of information requests by the APO and Public Employees for Public Responsibility (Peer), found that reports of alleged harassment from 2013 to 2015 had <a href=\"https://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/assaults-on-fisheries-observers-more-than-double-in-two-years-with-no-reported-enforcement/\">more than doubled</a>, rising from 35 to 84. </p> \n<p>Preliminary findings of a similar survey for 2017 and 2018 suggest the problem is continuing.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is difficult to get a picture of trends at this stage, but I can say harassment is a continuing problem,\u201d says Kevin Bell, a staff lawyer at Peer based in Washington, DC.</p> \n<p>After reporting a spike in observer sexual assault and harassment claims earlier this year, the NOAA said it was hiring more investigators and victims\u2019 advocates to respond and had introduced a prevention programme.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the NOAA said the spike was reflective of it monitoring allegations for the first time. It reported 23 allegations of sexual assault and harassment against observers in 2018 and 15 in 2019.</p> \n<p>The deaths/disappearance of three observers, including US citizens Keith Davis and Josh Sheldon in 2015 and 2016, and Usaia Masibalavu, a Fijian who was working on a US-flagged vessel, also in 2016, prompted the NOAA to carry out a safety review in 2018.

  "<p>The abundance of microplastic pollution in the oceans is likely to have been vastly underestimated, according to research that suggests there are at least double the number of particles as previously thought.</p> <p>Scientists trawled waters off the coasts of the UK and US and found many more particles using nets with a fine mesh size than when using coarser ones usually used to filter microplastics. The addition of these smaller particles to global estimates of surface microplastics increases the range from between 5tn and 50tn particles to 12tn-125tn particles, the scientists say.</p> <p>Plastic pollution is known to harm the fertility, growth and survival of marine life. Smaller particles are especially concerning because they are the same size as the food eaten by zooplankton, which underpin the marine food chain and play an important role in regulating the global climate. The new data suggests there may be more microplastic particles than zooplankton in some waters.</p> <p>\u201cThe estimate of marine microplastic concentration could currently be vastly underestimated,\u201d said Prof Pennie Lindeque, of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK, who led the research.</p> <p>She said there may well be even smaller particles than those caught by the fine mesh nets, meaning the numbers \u201ccould be even larger again\u201d.</p> <p>Another new study shows how microplastics have entered the food chain in rivers, with birds found to be consuming hundreds of particles a day via the aquatic insects on which they feed.</p> <p>Microplastic pollution has contaminated the whole planet, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/14/microplastics-found-at-profuse-levels-in-snow-from-arctic-to-alps-contamination\">Arctic snow</a> and mountain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/the-hills-are-alive-with-the-signs-of-plastic-even-swiss-mountains-are-polluted\">soils</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/12/microplastic-pollution-in-oceans-is-far-greater-than-thought-say-scientists\">many rivers</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/plastic-pollution-mariana-trench-deepest-point-ocean\">deepest oceans</a>.

They found 2.5 times more particles in the finest net than in the 333 micron net, which is the kind usually used to filter microplastics, and 10 times more than in the 500 micron net.</p> <p>The surface trawls off the coast of Plymouth in the UK and the coast of Maine in the US showed similar results, suggesting they are representative of waters near populated land. The particles were dominated by fibres from textiles such as ropes, nets and clothing.</p> <p>\u201cUsing an extrapolation, we suggest microplastic concentrations could exceed 3,700 particles per cubic meter \u2013 that\u2019s far more than the number of zooplankton you would find,\u201d Lindeque said. These tiny animals are among the most abundant species on the planet.</p> <p>Dr Ceri Lewis, a marine biologist at Exeter University, who was part of the team, said: \u201cUnderstanding more about the smaller microplastics is important as it is these smaller particles that are more likely to be ingested by the zooplankton that form the basis of marine food webs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/19/microplastics-can-spread-via-flying-insects-research-shows\">Microplastics can spread via flying insects, research shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The research on microplastics in rivers, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15139\">published in the journal Global Change Biology</a>, analysed the droppings and regurgitated pellets of white-throated dippers at 15 river sites in south Wales. The scientists said the results were startling.</p> <p>They found that the birds, which feed on river insects, were eating about 200 pieces of plastic a day. These were mostly fibres, and a quarter were larger than 500 microns.</p> <p>The team also found that the dippers were feeding thousands of plastic fibres to their nest-bound chicks during their development. Previous research by the scientists had shown that <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1301891-plastics-found-in-fifty-percent-of-freshwater-insects\">half of the river insects</a> contain microplastic fragments.</p> <p>Prof Steve Ormerod, of Cardiff University, who led the work, said: \u201cIn almost 40 years of researching rivers and dippers, I never imagined that one day our work would reveal these spectacular birds to be at risk from the ingestion of plastics. It is a measure of how this pollution problem has crept up on us.</p> <p>\u201cDippers are the world\u2019s only songbirds able to dive and feed on river insects, but that wonderful adaptation also means they have no escape from this pollution.\u201d</p> <p>The impact on the health of the birds is not yet understood. \u201cIt is imperative we understand whether microplastics add to the other pollution problems that affect dippers and other river organisms, and we use that knowledge to guide remedial action,\u201d Ormerod said.</p>",

So not only is that promotion that I can\u2019t do any more \u2013 the thing that I love doing \u2013 any revenue that I was going to make from shows, that\u2019s just gone.</p> <p><strong>Ella Eyre</strong> I\u2019ve always fought to have different avenues of income: publishing, writing for other people, brand deals. So even though my tour has been pushed back, it won\u2019t heavily affect me financially as such. But in the future, if I wasn\u2019t able to tour, it would be a massive problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a364f198f2a1b47eacd7776b03a888d125e54f1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a364f198f2a1b47eacd7776b03a888d125e54f1b/0_417_3333_4167/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ella Eyre.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ella Eyre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>James McGovern</strong> We set up our own record label with our management company, so that\u2019s saved us. We\u2019ve been able to cut our expenditure completely and the Irish government is looking after artists and unemployed people really well. We\u2019ve stopped paying ourselves because our income is from live music in effect and we\u2019re getting \u20ac350 (\u00a3320) a week from the government, which is totally survivable.</p> <p><strong>Jeremy Pritchard</strong> We\u2019ve got an album out in August. I doubt we\u2019ll do anything [live] this year. It isn\u2019t the only way to promote music, but it\u2019s certainly the way that\u2019s most significant to me because that\u2019s how I understand what music means to people \u2013 by playing it in front of them. There was a period of brief inspiration at the beginning of lockdown when we realised we couldn\u2019t get together \u2013 we managed to make a couple of videos and use some 3D modelling software to do photos \u2013 but the novelty\u2019s worn off. I just miss playing music with my friends. All our income for this year really should have come from festivals over the summer and touring. We\u2019ve applied for the same government schemes as any other self-employed people.</p> <p><strong>Sara Quin</strong> We\u2019re fucked, too. It\u2019s not just about making money, it\u2019s about that ecosystem of our agents, managers, band, crew, our creative collaborators, our merchandise business; they\u2019re all so integrated and the engine is that we get on the bus and play for people. We see the pain of all the people who are working on commission for us, who rely on our contract work. We\u2019re in emergency mode, thinking about: what if we never return to normal? Is there a normal we can build for our business that won\u2019t require us going back to the way it was before?</p> <p><strong>Live venues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/13/uk-live-music-festivals-sector-at-risk-coronavirus\">are in critical condition</a>.

If any other industry was worth that amount, it would be funded at grassroots level by government. It\u2019s not, because it\u2019s seen as a frippery that should stand on its own two feet. The government is rightly proud of the music industry as a cultural export, but it chooses not to recognise it as an economic export because that means it needs funding to stay afloat. It needs it very badly now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62b3f8d339a800fcfa7002cdc830c885ac2f6851\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62b3f8d339a800fcfa7002cdc830c885ac2f6851/0_0_3089_1855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Pritchard of Everything Everything.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Pritchard of Everything Everything.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Knowles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Quin</strong> In Canada, there\u2019s a great deal of government support for the arts. But there are varying degrees of catastrophic situations right now. It\u2019s hard for artists to be front-page news when they\u2019re talking about mass infections at meatpacking plants, or healthcare workers, or the Indigenous population. It\u2019s hard to say: \u201cGuys, what if the folk festival scene breaks down?\u201d I\u2019m sort of being tough love with our community. While I wish the government would swoop down and fix everything, I\u2019m not afraid there\u2019s not going to be a music scene. Some venues will survive and some won\u2019t; the people that survive survive, the people that don\u2019t, they find something in the ashes and build something different.</p> <p><strong>Is there a positive side to this?</strong></p> <p><strong>Quin</strong> We were already talking about the climate crisis, the cost of shipping gear and flights, travelling the globe, building this huge production; how long can we sustain that model? I feel inspired as a small business owner to be thinking about what my future business looks like. How can we build something that will thrive? That actually feels really exciting.</p> <p><strong>Garratt</strong> It\u2019s really forced me into myself, and I\u2019m not in a great place at the moment, so that hasn\u2019t helped my creativity whatsoever. Being up in [my studio] feels like I\u2019m torturing myself because I\u2019m not necessarily giving a good part of myself. Like Sara, the thing I\u2019ve been really able to thrive in is thinking about how we create new ideas that end up being sustainable whether everyone\u2019s inside or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/22/murder-capital-review-bristol\">The Murder Capital review \u2013 people really need this band</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>McGovern</strong> I\u2019ve found myself able to write again and to reconnect with the reason why I started playing music as a child, which was to connect with myself emotionally. Writing full songs over emails doesn\u2019t work for us \u2013 there\u2019s too much of a human element in what we do \u2013 but having the time to spend the entire day coming up with a guitar line or a vocal melody, there\u2019s no immediate pressure from something around you, that\u2019s been interesting. It\u2019s a bleak positive.</p> <p><strong>Eyre</strong> When the reality of how long this was going to last settled in, I didn\u2019t want to pressure myself to be creative, but I think by having no pressure I\u2019ve been able to enjoy Zoom writing sessions and have fun with the people I work with regularly. I already had a bunch of songs ready to go; if anything, lockdown has allowed the pressure to be taken off the release of them. There\u2019s no worry about a \u00a370k music video or marketing strategy or how many bloody TikToks, I\u2019ve just enjoyed being able to put music out. The expectation is different. It has allowed everybody to relax and be creative about how we\u2019re presenting stuff and making stuff to keep our fanbases engaged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78dd3db174830e8ca1b1278d455cc14797e185c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78dd3db174830e8ca1b1278d455cc14797e185c8/59_347_1156_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tegan and Sara (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tegan and Sara (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trevor Brady</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you feel a pressure to constantly create content for your fans?</strong></p> <p><strong>Quin:</strong> My hesitation is that it\u2019s a form of labour we do for free that is generating money for Instagram and Facebook and Twitch. I know it\u2019s not cool to be a sell-out and to say you need money and you want your fans to pay for things, but I feel as artists we need to be comfortable being transparent about that. I\u2019m inspired by people doing livestreams and making content, but I don\u2019t feel inspired to do it, because I hate playing concerts to people holding up their cellphones, and I don\u2019t want to play a concert to my cellphone.</p> <p><strong>Garratt:</strong> It\u2019s a technical experience, not an emotional one. But I don\u2019t have a choice not to do it because I\u2019m putting an album out and I want as many people to experience it in as honest a way as I can create. I\u2019m lucky in that I can recreate it in the studio pretty accurately, but I would absolutely swap that sofa over there for a couple of warm bodies.</p> <p><strong>McGovern:</strong> I don\u2019t turn my nose up at that stuff in any way, but I don\u2019t know how we could achieve it in a way that we would be happy with. There\u2019s no point in doing it if we don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. I\u2019ve seen some great ones though \u2013 I\u2019ve got great comfort from watching James Blake\u2019s Instagram Lives.</p> <p><strong>We live in an age where fans expect to be more directly connected with artists via social media, which can be a fraught relationship. Has lockdown made that relationship better or worse?</strong></p> <p><strong>Eyre:</strong> I\u2019ve always had a direct relationship with my fanbase. I was really active on Twitter before Instagram was a thing, and I\u2019m still pretty personable. To be honest, I think that was a mistake on my part early on, because they expect so much more of me now. But I think lockdown is providing a more intimate experience for them \u2013 you\u2019re literally letting fans into your home, you\u2019re wearing the same clothes twice, there\u2019s not a glam team. And in the same way that they\u2019re relying on us to keep them entertained, as an artist I\u2019m sort of relying on them \u2013 the song I released a couple of weeks ago is not a single, I played a demo of it on my [Instagram] story and everyone wanted us to put it out, so we did it just for fun, haven\u2019t pushed it anywhere. I think, ultimately, it\u2019s made us closer.</p> <p><strong>McGovern:</strong> I\u2019ve stepped further and further away from it. We did a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/10/tim-burgess-twitter-listening-parties\">Tim Burgess Listening Party</a> on Twitter, which was nice, but I\u2019ve actually turned my phone off now. It\u2019s been off for eight to 10 days, and it feels good, to be honest. My attention span wasn\u2019t there to read a novel if I wanted to do that, so I thought: fuck that, I\u2019m going to turn the thing off. I\u2019ve bought a Nokia 105 for when I get out.</p> <p> <strong>Spotify has introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/23/spotify-tip-jar-musicians-pay-fans-donate-artists\">a tip jar for artists</a> \u2013 what are your thoughts? There has been a lot of talk about how unfair to artists the royalty system on streaming services is; is this the time to change it? If so, how?</strong></p> <p><strong>Garratt</strong> It\u2019s offensive to artists that are putting the music on that platform and it\u2019s offensive to the consumer. It\u2019s a platform owning up to the fact that there\u2019s an issue, and the Band-Aid they are putting around that issue is to make it the consumer\u2019s problem to fix it.</p> <p><strong>McGovern</strong> It\u2019s a load of fucking horseshit. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying: a PR cover-up for a situation where we\u2019re not being paid clearly for having our music on their platform.</p> <p><strong>Quin</strong> We don\u2019t ask people to go to the grocery store and make a decision on how much they\u2019re going to spend on a loaf of bread; it costs whatever it costs. Instead of asking consumers to solve the problem, the industry needs to have a reckoning about the way we value music, and that needs to be platform-wide. All the different streaming platforms, the record labels, the publishers, the artists who own their masters \u2013 we have to decide what music costs and then go collectively to the consumers and say: \u201cThis is how much a loaf of bread costs.\u201d It would be good PR for Spotify: \u201cWe\u2019re going to increase everyone\u2019s subscription by a couple of bucks and instead of us putting those dollars back into our nest, we\u2019re going to distribute that money in an equitable way to the people that create the music.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Pritchard</strong> Spotify is the whipping boy for the whole cultural problem, but compared to other digital platforms that don\u2019t even have the decency to identify themselves as streaming services, it has at least tried to monetise things for artists. The problem lies in the obstructions that lie between the digital service providers and the artists; it\u2019s with the rights holders, it\u2019s with the majors. And they\u2019re all under non-disclosure agreements; you can\u2019t get anywhere with it because you can\u2019t get any straight answers. The consumer doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and they have to know or the change will never happen.</p> <p><strong>Before the pandemic, some advances were being in made in areas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/11/music-festivals-agender-equality-wireless-green-man-slam-dunk-male-lineups\">such as gender imbalance and representation</a>. Is there a danger this will slip off the agenda as the industry focus</strong><strong>es on getting back on its feet?</strong></p> <p><strong>Eyre</strong> I don\u2019t see why it should make any difference.

I always feel like 50-50 lineups \u2026 it\u2019s moving in the right direction, but I think it\u2019s neglecting the major problem of the way women are spoken to from a young age, from their parents and in the classroom, and the way they perceive what a viable career is and what industries they\u2019re welcomed into.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/18/tegan-and-sara-people-never-talk-about-women-and-drug-use-positively\">Tegan and Sara: \u2018People never talk about women and drug use positively\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Quin</strong> What I rarely hear is what we\u2019re going to do with young men to teach them how to be better as adults when they get these jobs, or become members of bands, how they can be better allies, how they can use their power. While it\u2019s lip service to say we\u2019re going to reach gender parity on festivals, I think it\u2019s really in your court, the festival programmers and music programmers. You can tell an eight-year-old girl she can be a mixing engineer or an EDM artist, but if every time we look at a Coachella lineup it\u2019s all men making money on the DJ sets or whatever, it\u2019s hard to inspire young women until those things change.</p> <p><strong>Name one thing you want to change in the music industry after this?</strong></p> <p><strong>Quin</strong> Tegan said she\u2019s thinking about how to make our digital footprint more meaningful and our carbon footprint smaller. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re moving forward. The future is going to require us to do a lot more online interaction and have more connection with our fans in a way we never did before. I want to make sure we\u2019re not doing it out of obligation and just to market things. I want to feel we\u2019re connecting back with an audience we love.</p> <p><strong>Pritchard</strong> More understanding, more transparency across the board: between artists, consumers, digital platforms, government, venues. More mutual support.</p> <p><strong>McGovern</strong> I hope musicians and fans realise how special the live show is and don\u2019t take it for granted ever again.

I\u2019d like to see a more relaxed energy from major labels about what they\u2019re putting out, not stressing too much about radio plays and streaming. It\u2019s brought it all back to releasing music and seeing what happens.</p> <p><strong>Garratt</strong> I don\u2019t want anyone starting out to make the same mistakes I did. The insane amount of pressure put on young artists to be a finished product before they\u2019ve even started putting their first record out, the expectation from labels, management, journalists \u2013 it\u2019s far too much.

Both are estrogens, which are the main reproductive related hormones in women.</p> <p>The reasons for the shortages are mysterious and have an international dimension.</p> <p>Information from the distributors provided to the TGA contains a single word \u2013 \u201cmanufacturing\u201d \u2013 without further explanation.</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/07/leading-uk-doctors-call-investigation-hrt-shortage\">shortages of similar hormone replacement therapies</a> in the UK since at least August last year, with some commentators suspecting the cause was Brexit related disruption, although the British government denied this.</p> <p>The issue made the front pages of the nation\u2019s newspapers and was described as a \u201cscandal\u201d, with reports of women travelling overseas to get hold of patches, and ordering dubious replacements online.</p> <p>So far even British government health officials, who have summoned pharmaceutical bosses for urgent meetings, have had problems pinpointing the causes.</p> <p>Two manufacturers \u2013 Novartis, which manufactures Estradot, and the London based Theramex, which makes a range of hormonal drugs for women including the Evorel Sequi and Conti range, have been at the centre of inquiries in the UK.</p> <p>Both seem to have had problems at the same time, with resulting panic buying and shortages in other products as women and their doctors sought alternatives.</p> <p>Both Novartis and Theramex have blamed manufacturing difficulties and assured the British Menopause Society that they are increasing production, but shortages have been persistent. In May the companies said that production was no longer a problem, but there were still issues with the distribution chain.</p> <p>Part of the issue seems to be that Theramex took over another manufacturer in 2018, and production was slowed before the takeover, with the company since struggling to meet demand.</p> <p>There were also problems starting in 2018 when patch production was stopped because of issues manufacturing the glue for patches, which was made in China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/remote-communities-going-without-essentials-amid-lockdown-nt-groups-say\">Remote communities going without essentials amid lockdown, NT groups say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for Pfizer said the company\u2019s focus was on providing a consistent supply of these contraceptives for patients.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to actively resolving this matter.

Novartis was seeking further information.</p> <p>She could not explain why all the products across manufacturers contained estradiol, nor shed light on the distribution chains involved.</p> <p>As well as the obvious implications for women on contraceptive products, HRT products can be used to treat conditions such as osteoporosis, and other serious complaints.</p> <p>Withdrawing from them could cause a resurgence of menopausal symptoms, which were debilitating for many members, according to the Australian Menopause Society.</p> <p>Women affected by the shortages are likely to face cost implications. For example, Estalis Sequi patches, which are on the PBS but currently unavailable, sell for $5.60 at Chemist Warehouse to customers with concession cards.
