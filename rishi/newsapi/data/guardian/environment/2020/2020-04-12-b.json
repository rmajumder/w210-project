The Associated Press reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Long before there was a global coronavirus pandemic, brick-and-mortar retailers struggled to get people to walk through their doors instead of shopping online.</p> <p>Now those retailers are faced with an even more Herculean task: how to stay on people\u2019s minds and more importantly their pocketbooks when many of their store doors are closed.</p> <p>More than 250,000 stores like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Nike that sell non-essential merchandise have temporarily shuttered since mid-March in response to the pandemic. Thats 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.</p> <p>\u201cRetail has hung a closed sign on the door literally and metaphorically,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThis is the most catastrophic crisis that retail has faced worse than the financial crisis in 2008, worse than 9/11. Almost overnight, the retail economy shifted from being about things people want to things that they need.\u201d</p> <p>Some retailers have responded to the challenge by coming up with creative ways to stay relevant. Nike, for instance, introduced workout apps in China when the coronavirus first surfaced there, resulting in an 80% increase in users within the quarter and a 30% increase in online sales. It\u2019s now pushing a similar campaign in the U.S. and Europe.</p> <p>Yoga pants maker Lululemon is holding online classes in North America and Europe after gaining thousands of new followers in China on WeChat. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts during a recent call that during its first week of closures in the U.S., it saw nearly 170,000 customers join Lululemon for its live classes.</p> <p>Small businesses are also pivoting in order to hold onto customers. Camp, a new toy chain that set itself apart from online retailers by doubling down on the physical experience, is hosting virtual birthday parties and creating curated gift boxes now that its five stores have gone dark. Politics &amp; Prose, a popular Washington D.C. bookstore, was also forced to temporarily close and is now starting to stream author talks online and offering a curbside pickup service.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9395128f082dfd549d5368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T22:31:48.406Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has outlined his plan to safely reopen the United States in an op-ed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/joe-biden-coronavirus-reopen-america.html\">published in today\u2019s New York Times</a>. </p> <p>His three steps include: 1) getting the number of new cases down significantly through continued social distancing and improved supply lines to our hospitals with a more thorough deployment of the Defense Production Act; 2) the establishment of widespread, easily available and prompt testing with contact tracing strategy that protects privacy; and 3) increasing the capacity of our healthcare system to protect against the potential flare-up of cases when economic activity reopens.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFor more Americans to go back to their jobs, the president needs to do better at his job,\u201d Biden wrote. </p> <p>As if Trump, the great counterpuncher, was going to take that lying down.

Most notable among them is New York, which alone accounts for 1,439 nursing home deaths but has so far declined to detail specific outbreaks, citing privacy concerns.</p> <p>Experts say the deaths may keep climbing because of chronic staffing shortages in nursing homes that have been made worse by the coronavirus crisis, a shortage of protective supplies and a continued lack of available testing.</p> <p>And the deaths have skyrocketed despite steps taken by the federal government in mid-March to bar visitors, cease all group activities, and require that every worker be tested for fever or respiratory symptoms at every shift.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9341e18f081a236f192188\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T16:30:18.314Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cuomo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/cuomo-de-blasio-new-york-schools\">pitched skirmish with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio</a> has continued into a second day with the governor reasserting that a final decision on opening schools will be made by him. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to open any schools until it is safe from a public health point of view,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWe won\u2019t open schools one minute sooner than they should be opened, but we won\u2019t open schools one minute later than they should be opened either.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, De Blasio\u2019s announced that New York City\u2019s school district, which oversees 1.1 million students, would shutter for the rest of the academic year to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, only for Cuomo to insist no decision had been made. The governor is only reemphasizing that line during today\u2019s briefing. </p> <p>\u201cAm I, as I sit here, prepared to say what we\u2019ll be doing in June?

And as governor of the state, I\u2019m not going to pick one over the other. You need a public health strategy that is safe, that is consistent with an economic strategy. How do you re-open but how do you do it in a way that is smart from a public health point of view. Rhe last thing we want to see an uptick in that infection rate and an uptick in those numbers that we worked so hard to bring down.

coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro, about whom Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, wrote <a

southern hemisphere experiences in the virus might teach us about the seasonality or otherwise of Covid-19, Dr Nabarro offered a disturbing thought: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think <strong>it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time</strong> to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nabarro was also asked about Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the WHO and his threat this week \u2013 how serious he was was, as ever, unclear \u2013 to withdraw US funding for the international healthcare body:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The World Health Organization actually works on behalf of all the governments in the world. And it operates within mandates that are given to it. And, and we have to rely on information that\u2019s received from different governments. And that then permits us to work out what\u2019s going on \u2026 but <strong>we know that there will be many things that are found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been done</strong>.

A day later, health and human services secretary Alex Azar issued a similar warning. The White House did not issue national social distancing guidelines until 16 March. </p> <p>On Saturday, Trump vowed to rebuild the US economy, which has suffered trillions of dollars in damage from the outbreak, as a tribute to those who have died. Trump predicted that the economy to rebound like a \u201crocket ship\u201d because Americans have combated the coronavirus the \u201cright way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it the right way. We took care of social distancing and all of the things, words that nobody ever heard before, frankly, and phrases.

Obviously, no one is going to deny that.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated. But you\u2019re right.

But after a miracle escape, he scrambled par, then embarked on a run of six birdies and an eagle over the remaining ten holes. Almost flawless golf; he grasped every opportunity on offer.

The 28-year-old German is the defending champion here at Augusta, and went into the Tournament full of confidence (and the wiener schnitzel he served up at the Champions Dinner). He\u2019s living up to his billing, bouncing back from a disappointing opening round of 74 with a 68-69 salvo. He\u2019s right in the mix, hoping to become only the second player after Jack Nicklaus (1965 and 1966) to successfully defend his Masters title. Who can stop him?</p> <p><strong>How about the new world number two?</strong> Seve Ballesteros already has two green jackets to his name, and he\u2019s in the mood to win a third. Specifically, he in a <em>bad</em> mood: he\u2019s been raging all week at PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman, who has banished him from the American tour for a year, on account of not playing enough golf to earn his card. (To be fair to Seve, his volatile volleys at Beman aren\u2019t a patch on those sent down by Mac O\u2019Grady, who has called Beman a \u201cthief with a capital T\u201d and compared him to Adolf Hitler!) But there\u2019s no keeping Seve from Augusta, and he\u2019s desperate to make a told-you-so statement. He\u2019s one off the lead after three rounds.</p> <p><strong>Or is the Great White Shark about to land his first major? </strong>Greg Norman, only ranked six in the world but surely on an upwardly mobile journey that\u2019ll take the man from down under straight to the top, leads at the 54-hole mark after a fine 68 yesterday.</p> <p><strong>And then there\u2019s Nick Price. </strong>The young Zimbabwean, who came so close to winning the Open Championship four years ago, broke the course record at Augusta National yesterday. He made ten birdies on his way to 63, very nearly becoming the first man to shoot 62 in a major; sadly his 20-footer on 18 looped the loop in slow motion and failed to drop. Millimetres from history. He\u2019ll be a bit higher than #52 in the world next week.</p> <p><strong>Also lurking: </strong>the resurgent Tom Watson (#4) coming out of a two-year slump; the reigning Open champion Sandy Lyle (#3) whose big drives and draws are perfectly suited to this course; Tom Kite (#16) who has finished in the top ten at Augusta nine times in the last 11 years; Donnie Hammond (#99) who won his first PGA Tour event, the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, at La Quinta in California earlier this year; and Tommy Nakajima (#7) who has been clocking up wins on the Japanese tour for fun (21 in the last four years).</p> <p><strong>But maybe it\u2019s going to be a step too far for 46-year-old Jack Nicklaus, and not just because he\u2019s got four shots to make up on Norman.</strong> Nicklaus has won only twice since 1980, his powers seemingly very much on the wane: he was in contention for three PGA Tour tournaments last season, but couldn\u2019t convert any of those good positions into a win. Most unlike the Golden Bear. For the record, Jack is world number 33, though to be fair, had the R&amp;A been cobbling together these rankings back in the sixties and seventies, he might have spent the odd week or two at the toppermost of the poppermost.</p> <p><strong>After the third round, the top of the leader board looked like this: </strong></p> <p><strong><em>-6: </em></strong><em>Greg Norman<br> <strong>-5: </strong>Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Donnie Hammond, Nick Price<br> <strong>-4: </strong>Tommy Nakajima, Tom Kite, Tom Watson<br> <strong>-2: </strong>Danny Edwards, Gary Koch, Sandy Lyle, Mark McCumber, Jack Nicklaus, Corey Pavin, Bob Tway</em></p> <p><strong>The weather today is utterly gorgeous, perfect conditions for golf. </strong>Sunny, but not too blistering, and very little wind.

Since the arrival of Covid-19 measures, it hasn\u2019t been used once.</p> <p>Instead, families opt to hold a service at home. Many of the usual traditions are still there: a table with memories of the deceased, a selection of songs they loved. There\u2019s a greater emphasis on sharing photos.</p> <p>Funerals have become more invidualised through time. Watkins thinks Covid-19 is bringing greater focus on those personal touches and new ways of finding meaning. She\u2019s relieved people are continuing to hold a gathering of some form, given the role funerals play in the early stages of grief.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have been surprisingly accepting that this is a serious virus \u2013 I haven\u2019t had anyone objecting greatly to the fact they have these restricted numbers,\u201d she says. \u201cThe funerals we\u2019re having are still meaningful.\u201d</p> <p>James MacLeod is the managing director of Tobin Brothers Funerals in Melbourne, one of the largest private funeral companies in Australia. </p> <p>In January it helped the China Funeral Association to write guidelines for funeral procedures after the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.</p> <p>When it became clear Australia would be affected by shutdowns the company wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, stressing the importance of funerals.</p> <p>MacLeod argued they were more essential than ever at a time when people were distressed at not being able to visit older family members in aged-care facilities.</p> <p>\u201cSome will no doubt see this as a letter written from self-interest,\u201d MacLeod wrote. \u201cI do however write \u2026 as a concerned individual for the long-term mental health of the client families that we care for.\u201d</p> <p>Tobin Brothers has established a mortuary specifically for patients who have died from Covid-19.

Communal prayer is followed by burial and then condolences and mourning at the family home.</p> <p>Malas says the restrictions mean viewing the body can only occur at a distance, with no touching or kissing, and the closure of the mosques means communal prayer is held in the funeral parlour.</p> <p>Families now unable to host people in their home have turned to Facebook and WhatsApp.</p> <p>He has had regular calls from people in distress.</p> <p>\u201cPeople come together at a time of death and they can\u2019t do that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really tests the ties between people and those relationships.</p> <p>\u201cI guess the positives are people are trying to make an effort to stay in touch with one another.

All guests, including those tuning in online, wore navy blue. A Carlton flag was draped over the coffin and the club theme song played as mourners left the chapel. The same song played when Scott and Jemillah walked into the reception on their wedding day in 2017.</p> <p>Not being able to surround herself with friends and loved ones has made Jemillah feel as though she\u2019s \u201cnot really going through the normal grieving process\u201d. There will be a larger get-together when things return to normal, but at the moment processing complex emotions feels delayed.</p> <p>\u201cI did feel really hollow afterwards because we couldn\u2019t have a wake or anything,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cSo there was no time to debrief or cry or laugh with each other.

  "<p>In the spring of 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was engaged in a campaign to defeat Jim Crow laws in Birmingham, Alabama.</p> <p>As they approached the Easter weekend that year, no victory was in sight. But Dr Martin Luther King Jr knew there was something in the logic of Easter that suggested the way to victory might be counterintuitive. He decided to go to jail on Good Friday and stay there through the Easter weekend. He would not be free to preach a sermon on the holiest day of the Christian year, but he would pen his famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail as he waited to see a way forward.</p> <p>In the midst of this world\u2019s deepest darkness, the Christian story of the resurrection points towards the power of hope. As we weather a global pandemic, Easter offers a moment for us to reflect on the role of suffering and the possibility of radical solidarity.</p> <p>Over the past month we have entered a new reality where despair is ever-present and fear pervasive. The death toll keeps rising, and instead of honest leadership we have a president who uses press conferences as political rallies. Trump might remind us of Pontius Pilate, who came from a well-known family and oversaw a tense, violent relationship with the Jewish minority of Jesus\u2019 day. America today is not unlike the Roman Empire in which Christ was crucified as an insubordinate revolutionary.</p> <p>Suffering is not anathema to Christians. In the Christian story, Jesus \u2013 the son of the creator of the universe \u2013 willingly undergoes a painful, bloody, public death. It is the last sacrifice, so that others do not need to continue the bloodletting. This is an astounding idea, a reversal of all our dominant values, our hunger for immortality, for power, for pleasure above all else. The crucifixion is the story of Jesus\u2019 ultimate sacrifice and solidarity with the world.</p> <p>But the story does not end with death. It ends with resurrection, an unbelievable miracle, and with the Holy Spirit persisting in a global community.</p> <p>Can we come together as a global community today? As we take hope in the Easter story, we must also take the lessons of Christ\u2019s life, which was spent in radical communion with the poor and sick.</p> <p>The Poor People\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has taken up the campaign begun by Martin Luther King Jr and others in 1968, which was itself a revival of the early church\u2019s commitment to the least of these. We stand for the 140 million poor and low-income people who were left out of Congress\u2019s Covid-19 relief package: the 60 million workers who do not have paid sick leave, the 25 million with no health insurance, the 72 million who already have medical debt, the 8 million to 11 million people who are homeless, the 11 million undocumented immigrants who will receive no support. Often, in the midst of America\u2019s obsession with the middle class, we forget those who have nothing. But Christ did not forget them.</p> <p>And, as we seek solutions to this virus at home, we must remember its global reach. India\u2019s 1.3 billion people are all in a 21-day lockdown. In Africa, the difficulty of social distancing in dense areas, paired with underlying conditions caused by malnutrition, could portend a devastating toll. As developing countries become harder hit, people are faced with the choice of infection or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/03/we-will-starve-zimbabwes-poor-full-of-misgiving-over-covid-19-lockdown\">starvation</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is little interest in the United States for increasing aid abroad. On the contrary, industrial nations expect to bring in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52178968\">tens of billions</a> in debt payments in 2020. The International Monetary Fund, aid organizations and world leaders are calling on creditors to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/africa-leads-calls-for-debt-relief-in-face-of-coronavirus-crisis\">suspend</a> these payments. But there is much more that could be done. Many of the same leaders, including the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/26/pr20108-remarks-by-imf-managing-director-during-an-extraordinary-g20-leaders-summit\">IMF leadership</a> and Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/07/world-must-combat-looming-debt-meltdown-in-developing-countries-covid-19\">economists</a>, have called for the IMF to help countries through this crisis by providing, as it did in 2009, large amounts of debt-free <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR\">special </a><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR\">drawing </a><a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR\">rights</a>. We could end the illegal sanctions on countries like Iran and Venezuela, which target civilians and have caused tens of thousands of deaths. Or we could make a commitment to ensuring that when a vaccine is found, it will be available to all.</p> <p>American leaders have not taken any of these actions \u2013 and we should not be surprised. This is the way of a civilization that has lost touch with its own humanity. It is the sign of a civilization that cannot last. But Christ\u2019s life and death reminds us that we must continue the struggle. The resurrection reminded Christ\u2019s followers that the death of the body is not the ultimate evil. On the contrary, it is the death of the soul, the death of our ability to see clearly what is right, which is far more devastating.</p> <p>Christ\u2019s life was an indictment of the Roman Empire and ultimately he was executed for his revolutionary protests. Pontius Pilate washed his hands before ordering the crucifixion, much like western governments might wash their hands today as they turn away from the suffering they could have avoided.</p> <p>This Easter, the resurrection offers an indictment of empires and leaders that have become cruel in their hunger for power. But it also offers us a path forward. Though empires rise and fall, our ability to love and care for one another persists. When we press on in solidarity with those who are suffering, even when a way forward is not clear, we prepare ourselves to receive the good news of this season.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Rev Dr William J Barber II is president of Repairers of the Breach and co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign</p></li> <li><p>Dr Leah Hunt-Hendrix is a writer and co-founder of Way to Win</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Keir Starmer\u2019s immediate task, as the new leader of the opposition, is to scrutinise and hold to account the government\u2019s handling of the most serious public health crisis for a century. Sir Keir was right this weekend to insist that <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/labours-keir-starmer-demands-urgent-talks-on-recall-of-parliament-so-ministers-coronavirus-decision-can-face-scrutiny\" title=\"\">parliament must return</a> after the Easter break, if only in virtual form. Flawed assumptions and poor planning in February and March made a terrible situation worse. Labour\u2019s job is to provide constructive criticism and help prevent future errors being made.</p> <p>But with the leadership question settled, the party must also begin to think through the implications of a crisis that has transformed the country. As Sir Keir revealed the makeup of his shadow team last week, the first drumbeats of dissent became audible. On the left, there was dismay at the return of well-known critics of Jeremy Corbyn, such as Liz Kendall, Wes Streeting and Pat McFadden. One MP <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b48bf77-b708-4d94-86d4-353f9abb4d32\" title=\"\">anonymously sniped</a> that members of the shadow Treasury team were to the right of the free-spending chancellor, Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>A desire to read the runes of a new leader\u2019s first moves is natural. But Labour must avoid at all costs the internal power struggles that bedevilled it during the last five years. Britain is currently experiencing the kind of event that redraws a political map already unrecognisable after Brexit; fresh thinking and analysis are required that are adequate to the times.</p> <p>When the country eventually emerges from the crisis, there will be loud calls for a gradual return to business as usual. But the pandemic has ruthlessly exposed how unsatisfactory, in many respects, the status quo ante was. The global economy is unlikely to re-emerge unscathed once Covid-19 is under control; traumatised by this experience of vulnerability, nations may place a new premium on increased self-sufficiency, particularly in areas such as medical supplies.</p> <p>Debate about what constitutes a moral economy is likely to take centre stage. In Britain, belated recognition of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-key-workers-applause-is-not-enough\" title=\"\">key workers</a>\u201d has exposed the often grotesque mismatch between the market price and the social worth of their labour. A more communal sensibility may come to temper the language of meritocracy and aspiration \u2013 the dominant political idiom in Britain since the 1980s. Even before the epidemic struck, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/levelling-up-why-boris-johnson-cant-stop-saying-it-and-what-he-really-means-speech-politics-language\" title=\"\">levelling up</a>\u201d agenda of the Boris Johnson government signalled an awareness that liberal individualism \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s default political setting \u2013 did not speak to the core values and priorities of much of the country. What the Labour movement used to call \u201cfraternity\u201d may be coming back into fashion. The party needs to discern what that might mean in a modern setting.</p> <p>In shaping a response to changing times, Labour has rich resources to draw on from its history. It should revisit the neglected communitarian strand of its tradition, which had its beginnings in the <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/labour-churches-and-ethical-socialism\" title=\"\">ethical socialism</a> of late 19th-century pioneers such as William Morris and was later developed by thinkers such as <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1964/07/30/the-socialism-of-r-h-tawney/\" title=\"\">RH Tawney</a>. The latter, in particular, deserves to be read again: his call for a economy in which social purpose took precedence over commercial and individual gain would find a ready audience among many of those taking to their doorsteps each Thursday evening.</p> <p>Conventional politics will not be resumed for a long time, but when a semblance of normality does return, a reckoning will take place on terrain that should play to Labour\u2019s strengths and core values. The same, of course, was said after the 2008 crash; 10 years of Conservative government and austerity followed. If Labour, and its arguments, are to be better prepared this time, the intellectual work must start now.</p>",
  "<p>So far, discussions of a coronavirus exit strategy have mainly focused on the steps that could bring an end to the lockdown. In the short term, both in the UK and elsewhere, there is nothing more desirable than letting people resume their lives, once it is safe to do so.</p> <p>But the speed of the \u201creturn to normal\u201d is not the only thing that matters. The manner in which the world\u2019s leaders manage the colossal economic and political shocks caused by the virus is also of the utmost importance. And at the top of their list of priorities, alongside human welfare, must be the biosphere and its future.</p> <p>It\u2019s too soon to say with any confidence what impact coronavirus will have on the climate emergency. The brakes placed on economic activities of many kinds, worldwide, have led to carbon emission cuts that would previously have been unthinkable: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/climate-crisis-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-nature-bounces-back-but-for-how-long\" title=\"\">18% in China</a> between February and March; between 40% and 60% over recent weeks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c59fd16-6020-4798-b8f1-5df686bbd97a\" title=\"\">in Europe</a>. Habits and behaviours once regarded as sacrosanct have been turned on their heads: road traffic in the UK has fallen by 70%. Global air traffic has halved. Meanwhile, a much-needed spotlight has been thrown on humans\u2019 troubling relationship to wildlife, with some experts arguing that the degradation of the natural world and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/human-impact-on-wildlife-to-blame-for-spread-of-viruses-says-study-aoe\" title=\"\">exploitation of other species</a> is among the pandemic\u2019s causes.</p> <p>In human terms, the economic contraction precipitated by the virus \u2013 and predicted by the World Bank to lead to a severe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who\" title=\"\">depression</a> \u2013 is sure to be brutal. No one, and least of all an elected government, would have chosen to limit emissions in this way. But if further savage waves of destruction to people\u2019s livelihoods are to be avoided, rather than simply stored up or ignored until they become unignorable, just as coronavirus was, every possible effort must now be made to ensure that the recovery, when it comes, is as green as possible; that any and every stimulus package is directed towards renewable energy and zero- or low-carbon infrastructure and transport.</p> <p>The urgency and desperation surrounding all such efforts are likely to militate against progressive measures. Already, governments are coming under huge pressure to bail out oil and gas companies (in the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/the-fossil-fuel-industry-is-broken-will-a-cleaner-climate-be-the-result\" title=\"\"> US and Canada</a> this has already begun). But while in the short term the low oil price, which is also the result of a price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, could have the damaging effect of making oil more competitive against renewables, plunging demand and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/the-fossil-fuel-industry-is-broken-will-a-cleaner-climate-be-the-result\" title=\"\">turmoil in the industry</a> provide an opportunity that must be seized by all who oppose the continued dominance of fossil fuels.</p> <p>There are other questions besides the future of oil that the crisis has opened up in unexpected ways. Huge political shifts are under way, with fiscally conservative governments such as Boris Johnson\u2019s intervening in economies to an unprecedented extent. What was once impossible (socialist, reckless) now turns out not to be, at all. Could the renewed shock of human vulnerability in the face of Covid-19 make way for an increased willingness to face other perils, climate chaos among them?</p> <p>Impossible to say at this stage, perhaps. Certainly not without a fight against all those who will promote a return to business (and emissions) as usual. But with the postponement of crucial UN biodiversity and climate conferences, it has never been more important to keep up the pressure. There is no exit strategy from our planet.</p>",

  "<p>The UK could end up with the worst coronavirus death rate in Europe, one of the government\u2019s leading scientific advisers has said.</p> \n<p>Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a pandemics expert on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the figures of almost 1,000 daily hospital deaths showed the UK was in a similar situation to other European countries that had been badly affected.</p> \n<p>Just hours before the news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-deaths-in-uk-hospitals-surpass-10000\">that the number of hospital deaths had hit 10,612 as of 5pm on Saturday</a>, Farrar told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cNumbers in the UK have continued to go up. I do hope that we are coming close to the numbers reducing. But yes, the UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>He held up Germany as an example of a country with a lower death rate that had \u201cvery early on introduced testing on a scale that was remarkable and continued to do that and isolate individuals and look after those who got very sick\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBy isolating those that were positive it meant they weren\u2019t able to infect other people,\u201d he said. There were undoubtedly lessons to learn from that, he added.</p> \n<p>With the UK considering ways to end its lockdown, Farrar said testing in the community had been a way for Germany to buy time to deal with the crisis. It had given it an additional six to eight weeks to ensure health systems were up to capacity, he said.</p> \n<p>On the same programme, Alok Sharma, the business secretary, avoided the question of whether the UK was at risk of having the worst death rate in Europe. On Friday, its daily hospital death toll was 980, higher than either Italy or Spain before their curves started to flatten.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"abbd660ab502312a76485de210c3df7a2c5effda\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abbd660ab502312a76485de210c3df7a2c5effda/128_271_1531_1912/801.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Jeremy Farrar\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Jeremy Farrar: \u2018The UK is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Drew Turner/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>France has recorded a daily death toll of more than 1,000, but unlike the UK, it has been including mortality in care homes in its daily figures.</p> \n<p>Sharma said it was a global pandemic and that different countries were at different stages in the spread of the disease. He insisted that the measures the UK had taken were on course to slow the trend of number of deaths and the advice to stay at home was aimed at flattening the curve.</p> \n<p>Later, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, did not dispute Farrar\u2019s analysis, but said the government was advised by many different experts and that the future spread of the virus was \u201cunknowable\u201d. He said it underlined the importance of the government\u2019s advice to stay at home during Easter.</p> \n<p>A disputed recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-will-be-europes-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-study-predicts\">study from world-leading disease data analysts</a> projected that the UK would become the country worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe.</p> \n<p>The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle predicted 66,000 UK deaths from Covid-19 by August, but this was revised down to 37,000 later because of the recent slowing in the increase of the death rate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The 66,000 figure had been rejected by scientists whose modelling of the probable shape of the UK epidemic is relied on by the government.

She eventually won two lawsuits against him, the judge forcing him to pay back a total of \u20ac62,000 (around \u00a355,000).</p> <p>Van de Leur and her boyfriend were homeless for two years, sleeping in a car every night. Survival meant long afternoons collecting a few cents on the beach, eating complimentary food in supermarkets. Sometimes they would shoplift. Before helping with youth camps at gyms, she would douse herself in sample supermarket perfume. Although there was a romantic aspect to Van de Leur\u2019s life in those days, finally free with her partner against the world, it was always tempered by the cold reality.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you have no food and have to shoplift, it\u2019s crossing a line, crossing your own borders that you never thought you would do,\u201d she says. \u201cBut to survive, you would do anything that you need.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Within 24 hours everything was cancelled.

Van de Leur was wandering around a park one day in 2010 when she noticed a man and woman having an affair. She took photos of the pair and then confronted the woman, eventually demanding \u20ac2,000. \u201cI was really in the lowest state you can think of,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the street with really nothing and when this happened, she asked me if I wanted money. I said, quick-thinking: \u2018Yes.\u2019 Because I needed it.\u201d</p> <p>One night a few weeks later she was arrested by a large group of police. Initially detained for 72 days, Van de Leur was charged with blackmail and then also possession of child pornography after photos were allegedly found on a folder in her laptop. The latter charge fell apart in court after her lawyer argued several people had access to her computer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09df24b1ebf1132079ce5e22fc7a959a48488f08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09df24b1ebf1132079ce5e22fc7a959a48488f08/0_31_3899_2476/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Verona van der Leur arrives at court with her lawyer in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Van der Leur arrives at court with her lawyer in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcel Antonisse/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The damage was done.

  "<p>It\u2019s a while until payday and a big, unexpected bill has arrived. The money will eventually be there but in the meantime, there is a cash flow problem. Most of us have been there \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a> is no different.</p> <p>The chancellor has a whopping cash flow problem. Locking down the economy in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> pandemic means that tax revenues have dried up at a time when the state is promising to spend billions more on health, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">wage subsidies</a>, small business grants and universal credit.</p> <p>It\u2019s not unusual for the state\u2019s spending to exceed its revenue and when it does the gap is normally covered by borrowing. The government sells bonds \u2013 or gilts \u2013 to investors and uses the proceeds to plug the hole.</p> <p>In the current crisis, the government\u2019s need for ready cash is so great it can\u2019t get the gilts out of the door quickly enough. Fortunately, though, Sunak has an understanding bank manager in the form of Andrew Bailey. The governor of the Bank of England, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\">agreed to solve the Treasury\u2019s cashflow</a> problem by printing as much money as the chancellor needs provided Sunak agrees to pay off his overdraft by the end of the year.</p> <p>This may sounds a bit technical, but it matters a lot. For the time being the economy is effectively being kept going by the state. Only bits of the private sector are operating as normal and the longer the lockdown the bigger the bill for the Treasury. All of which raises the question of how it is to be paid for. More specifically, does the use of the government\u2019s overdraft facility mean that the UK is heading down a road that ends with the Bank printing money to pay for government spending?</p> <p>How the government goes about footing the bill for Covid-19 depends on the scale of the economic damage, but it is already clear that early estimates of a short, sharp shock were too optimistic. The current crisis looks likely to prove more costly than the recession of 2008-09, until now the deepest slump of the post-war era.</p> <p>Sunak has options. The first is to do what George Osborne did in 2010 and impose a period of belt-tightening as soon as the recession ends. This would involve an austerity budget \u2013 or more likely a series of austerity budgets \u2013 in which taxes would be raised and spending cut in order to reduce the size of the government\u2019s annual budget deficits.</p> <p>This option is unlikely to prove all that attractive. The lesson of the Osborne experiment is that trying to get the deficit down too fast leads to sluggish growth, which reduces tax revenues and means it takes longer to reduce borrowing. Moreover, the tightest financial settlements on the NHS in its history left the health service poorly prepared to cope with a pandemic. There will be political uproar if Sunak goes to the austerity route.</p> <p>A second option is to to follow the example of post-war governments and rely on a mixture of growth and inflation to restore the public finances to good health over time. Between 1939 and 1945, the wartime government ran annual budget deficits of 20% of national output or more. National debt \u2013 a measure of the budget surpluses and deficits accumulated over centuries \u2013 rose to 250% of gross domestic product. Yet over the next half century, the debt to GDP ratio gradually came down to stand at around 30% by the turn of the millennium.</p> <p>Borrowing is currently dirt cheap for the government, so Sunak could decide to get the economy fully functioning again before worrying too much about the public finances. The lesson from the decades after 1945 is that governments only really have a deficit problem if they have a growth problem.</p> <p>The third option is monetary finance, under which the Bank of England is instructed to print enough money to cover whatever the government chooses to spend. In the short-term, this is precisely what Bailey is doing with his overdraft facility. There are those who say it should be made permanent in order to help rebuild the economy and prepare it for the challenges of global heating.</p> <p>The temporary nature of the overdraft means that it is not really monetary finance. Gordon Brown\u2019s government made use of the same arrangement during the financial crisis of 2008-09 but paid its \u00a320bn overdraft off within two months. Sunak has promised to pay off his overdraft by the end of the year, which he could do either by selling more gilts or by raising taxes. Alternatively, he could decide that his overdraft \u2013 on which he only has to pay 0.1% interest \u2013 is far too useful to dispense with in the current circumstances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>No question, going down the monetary finance route means a line will have been crossed. The Bank of England\u2019s independence would be called into question. Fears that printing money would lead to runaway inflation would be stoked.</p> <p>But the lines are getting pretty blurred anyway. Back in 2009, the Bank of England launched a money creation programme known as quantitative easing. It involved Threadneedle Street buying gilts and corporate bonds from the private sector in return from cash. It was not strictly monetary financing because the Bank did not buy the gilts directly from the government and it pledged that it would later sell them again. No gilts or other assets have been sold, although the Bank and the Treasury like to maintain the fiction that they will be.</p> <p>So, yes, Sunak\u2019s overdraft may prove to be temporary. But that was what was said 11 years ago about ultra-low interest rates and QE. In a crisis what was once taboo can quickly become mainstream.</p>",

  "<p>BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest investors in banks and fossil fuel companies, has been hired by the EU to work on potential new environmental rules for banks.</p> <p>Campaigners raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/21/blackrock-investor-climate-crisis-blackrock-assets\">BlackRock\u2019s widespread financial interests</a> in sectors that could be directly impacted by new environmental rules.</p> <p>The European commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, said this week that BlackRock had beaten eight other bidders on a contract to study how the EU could best integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its banking supervision.</p> <p>BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest investment manager, with $7.43tn (\u00a35.97tn) in assets under management on 31 December, before the coronavirus pandemic caused a global market rout. The majority of those assets are in products that track equity and bond indices, meaning the company by default controls large stakes in many of the world\u2019s biggest companies.</p> <p>Analysis by InfluenceMap for the Guardian found that BlackRock in October controlled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/12/top-three-asset-managers-fossil-fuel-investments\">shares in fossil fuel companies worth $87.3bn</a> that held 3.27bn barrels of fossil fuel reserves. BlackRock is a top-three investor in all eight of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, and a top-10 investor in the 12 most <a href=\"https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P221119-1.pdf\">systemically important banks</a> in the world.</p> <p>Katrin Ganswindt, a climate and energy campaigner at <a href=\"https://urgewald.org/english\">Urgewald</a>, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said: \u201cAppointing BlackRock as advisor to the European commission on environmental, social and governance factors seems a bit like letting the fox guard the henhouse. On top of being the world\u2019s largest investor in fossil fuels, they are also among the leading global financiers of the weapons industry.</p> <p>\u201cWe are baffled as to why the European commission didn\u2019t think there would be a massive conflict of interest with this choice.\u201d</p> <p>The commission will pay BlackRock\u2019s Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) arm \u20ac280,000 (\u00a3244,000) for the study, according to a <a href=\"https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:165869-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML&amp;src=0\">contract award notice</a> published on the commission\u2019s website \u2013 equating to only 1.3% of the $24m pay given to the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, in 2018, or 0.007% of the company\u2019s $4.5bn operating profits in 2019.</p> <p>However, decisions made by European banking regulators on ESG issues could have significant financial effects on the companies whose shares BlackRock holds. For instance, looser restrictions on bank lending to companies fuelling the climate crisis could profit both oil companies and lenders.</p> <p>BlackRock itself has been strongly criticised for blocking progress on environmental issues. Guardian analysis of data from ProxyInsight found that BlackRock opposed or abstained on 82% of climate-related shareholder resolutions at the companies whose shares it managed between 2015 and 2019, far lower than many rivals.</p> <p>However, in 2020 the company has taken significant steps to make environmental sustainability a core part of its business. In January it said it would divest from companies that made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/blackrock-says-climate-crisis-will-now-guide-its-investments\">25% or more of their revenues from coal</a>, as well as pledging to start using its voting power to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/09/blackrock-joins-pressure-group-taking-on-biggest-polluters\">force companies to disclose climate risks</a>.</p> <p>A European commission spokesman said contract was awarded \u201cin full and strict compliance with the applicable EU procurement rules, including those on the eligibility of tenderers and the prevention of any potential conflict of interest\u201d.</p> <p>BlackRock\u2019s tender was better than competitors, and it will form only one input in the EU\u2019s policymaking, the spokesman added.</p> <p>A spokesman for BlackRock said its FMA arm functioned separately to the investment management unit.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe are honoured that BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory has been selected to perform an analysis to inform the European commission\u2019s action plan on sustainable finance, deploying our expertise and capabilities in advising public-sector clients on structural trends, including the transition to a low-carbon future.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the European commission\u2019s suggested fee of \u20ac550,000.

  "<p>Unprecedented times call for drastic measures. People are struggling to cope with lockdown and the financial pressures that come with it. Rugby players are no exception. A front-row forward suddenly knows more about the government\u2019s furlough scheme and pay cuts than many who work within the financial sector. I am one of the players, coaches, physios and other support staff who have found our lives turned upside down. But this is not just about reducing player wages to help clubs survive the crisis. The parlous state of the game\u2019s finances predates Covid-19.</p> <p>Rugby has to find a way to come out of the crisis stronger, not weaker. Players will help by taking a pay cut but the ultimate ambition of rugby must be to grow the sport. In the long term no business prospers simply by cutting back: a good product, proper investment and, above all, a motivated workforce are necessary for that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/09/shutdown-gives-rugby-union-an-unmissable-opportunity-to-reset\">The Breakdown | Shutdown gives rugby union an unmissable opportunity to reset</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a Bedford Blues player, I have been put on the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/sunak-emergency-covid-19-loan-what-do-companies-think\" title=\"\">furlough scheme</a> in an attempt to prevent my club\u2019s financial ruin. This has become all too common up and down the country. Taking a 20% pay cut and no opportunity to earn match fees or win bonuses is one of the new normalities of life. There are other changes, too.</p> <p>The novelty of home workouts, park runs and passing the rugby ball into a garden post is wearing off. I\u2019m sure most players are desperate to get back to team training. Some are lucky to have, or be located near, a form of outdoor space but others are cooped up in apartments, throwing themselves into HIIT workouts, or succumbing to their partner\u2019s wish to record a TikTok video, something I have avoided so far!</p> <p>A player lives by the schedule planned by others. You work from weekend to weekend. Take that away and you are left with a feeling of emptiness. And then, to top it all off, you get told you will be given a pay cut, put on a furlough scheme, without any end date. Some players do not even know where the next job will be, as contract negotiations come to a halt.</p> <p>Rugby\u2019s finances in the professional era do not make great reading. Bedford and my former club Exeter usually turn over a profit by the end of the financial year, but these success stories are uncommon. So uncommon it poses worrying questions about the sport\u2019s future. Add Covid-19 to the mix, with all clubs heading towards a financial deficit, and rugby\u2019s future looks as uncertain as the pandemic.</p> <p>Inflation of player wages has undoubtedly not helped clubs to balance the books. Financial cuts have become a necessity to stay afloat and players have tried to do the honourable thing. A member of newly promoted Newcastle told me many players voiced their concerns when information was distributed via text messages and emails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42597e7bee6609d33a8e136fe8eee2fe3a00ac18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42597e7bee6609d33a8e136fe8eee2fe3a00ac18/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racing 92\u2019s Olivier Klemenczak (front) and La Rochelle\u2019s Arthur Retiere in February.

No one wanted to destroy the club and not have a job.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to a player at Perpignan, in France\u2019s second division, clubs there have also told their employees they will receive a salary deduction. Players feel a sense of \u201cbeing left in the dark\u201d as Perpignan and other clubs in France are \u201cstill under the illusion they will be back training in May and they will finish their league games\u201d.</p> <p>Nevertheless even if the French leagues don\u2019t restart, players there can be encouraged by the ch\u00f4mage system, which helps those unable to sign any contracts after the end of their fixed term to get 12 months\u2019 pay while searching for another job.</p> <p>For players in the UK, there is much less certainty. Those out of contract are left with a deafening silence because club recruitment has halted. Most clubs are waiting for further news about the government\u2019s help schemes. But rugby\u2019s long-term financial future is not all about cutting players\u2019 wages. The sport has a global market. Cut too far and you risk your best players moving overseas. Too often as a player you hear how, in financial terms, rugby has made no progress over the last decade.</p> <p>Meanwhile the standard of play, athleticism and skill has continued to increase. The sport is becoming faster and more physical, which has led to careers being shorter. Looking at it in those terms, players have a case for being paid more, not less.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/premiership-set-for-extended-break-before-resuming-behind-closed-doors\">Premiership set for extended break with contingency plans to finish season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what about the business of rugby? Players are invested in this as much as anyone; arguably more than most. We have questions that demand answers. Are those running the sport maximising its potential? Is it gathering the best television deals and sponsorship? Is the game understandable, attractive and accessible to viewers?</p> <p>My friend from Perpignan said rugby, in the UK particularly, is not progressing: \u201cThe product selling seems average. In France there is more money being spent on rugby with TV rights being a lot more lucrative. Pro D2 matches are on Thursday and Friday nights, then the Top 14 is played on the weekend. Maybe they can try this with the Championship and Premiership?</p> <p>\u201cI think overall though, rugby needs to drop the \u2018amateurishness\u2019 to it. It needs to be streamlined into a strong business. Look at the finances overall, yes look at the wages, but don\u2019t just look at that.\u201d</p> <p>His passion is obvious and he speaks for all of us.</p>",
  "<p>Drug treatment experts have raised concerns a drop in the supply of illicit drugs to the UK triggered by the lockdown is leading to an increase in the number of users turning to more dangerous alternatives.</p> <p>A reduction in global travel, increased border restrictions and a slowdown in movement within the UK has resulted in a drop in the supply of illicit drugs, including heroin and the designer drug spice.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that border guards have noted a recent drop in seizures as traffic into the country subsides, while senior police sources have noted the dip in supply.</p> <p>But experts have warned that fewer drugs on the streets is not as positive as it sounds, as users are already turning to high-strength alternatives such benzodiazepines, while there is a significant risk of heroin users substituting with fentanyl, a lethal drug 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin.</p> <p>The number of drug-related deaths is at a record high, according to the most recent official estimates, driven by deaths linked to drug misuse.</p> <p>The reduced supply is also leading to an increase in the price of some substances, including cannabis, and decreasing the purity of others as dealers cut them with different chemicals to increase bulk, experts have told the Guardian.</p> <p>Dr Rachel Britton, the director of pharmacy at the drug, alcohol and mental health charity We Are With You, which runs 80 drug treatment services across England and Scotland, said: \u201cWe are receiving reports that the coronavirus is affecting the supply of illicit drugs.</p> <p>\u201cWhile less drugs on the street may seem like a good thing, what replaces them is usually more dangerous. We know the purity of many drugs is decreasing as dealers cut them with different substances to increase their bulk. This means people often don\u2019t know what they are taking, increasing the chance of overdose.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also hearing reports that to make up for shortages in drugs such as heroin and spice, a large amount of high-strength benzodiazepines have entered the market, which are a lot more potent than normal diazepam.\u201d</p> <p>A key concern is that users of heroin may turn to the powerful opioid drug fentanyl as an alternative. There have already been reports of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/03/fentanyl-deaths-on-the-rise-drug-added-to-heroin-report\">rise in deaths in the UK caused by the drug</a> prior to the pandemic. The drug is typically up to 50 times stronger than heroin, although one type, carfentanyl, is 5,000 times stronger and used as an elephant tranquilliser.</p> <p>Niamh Eastwood, the executive director of the drugs charity Release, which is setting up a <a href=\"https://www.release.org.uk/covid-19-impact-drugs-market\">network of people across the UK to provide information</a> on what is going on in the drugs market in light of the coronavirus, said: \u201cOne significant concern is the arrival of fentanyl which would be devastating. This drug has been linked to the overdose crisis in the US and Canada, but so far the UK has largely been spared.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, even with the absence of fentanyl, the UK already has record levels of drug deaths. If fentanyl or any of its analogues were to start to appear this would be catastrophic.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Hamilton, senior lecturer in addiction and mental health at the University of York, said: \u201cThe problem with fentanyl is it has wreaked havoc in North America because it\u2019s estimated to be between 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin.</p> <p>\u201cPre-Covid we\u2019ve not had anything like the problems North America has had but the consensus is that it\u2019s only a matter of time \u2013 and Covid could be the crisis that triggers that.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, most heroin comes from Afghanistan and while some fentanyl has been produced and supplied from China in the past, that is no longer the case.</p> <p>\u201cThe added problem with fentanyl is that we\u2019re no longer reliant on China because it can be domestically produced,\u201d Hamilton added.</p> <p>Lawrence Gibbons, National Crime Agency (NCA) drugs threat lead, said: \u201cDuring the unprecedented situation the UK is facing, the NCA remains committed to relentlessly pursuing organised crime groups who present the most significant threat to the UK, including those trafficking drugs.</p> <p>\u201cOur work in the illicit drugs space remains a high priority and we\u2019re aware that criminals may adapt to changing circumstances. We are monitoring intelligence and working with partners to ensure that we, and the whole law enforcement system, are alert to any increase, decline or indeed changes in drug supply chains and can respond swiftly.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cUK law enforcement including Border Force are working to prevent drug trafficking into the UK and to disrupt drugs supply within the UK.

This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad.</p> <p>The analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively.</p> <p>Erik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world\u2019s total carbon emissions.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.\u201d</p> <p>The unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said.

However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad.

Do we take hold of our destiny and make sure the differences are mitigated, abolished where possible \u2013 or do we just let things happen, do we let the market rule, in which case there will be enormous suffering.\u201d</p> \n<p>Welby was speaking after broadcasting an Easter Sunday service from the kitchen of his home at Lambeth Palace. It was a \u201cvery strange\u201d experience compared to the usual Easter service with 1,500 people at Canterbury cathedral, and required him and his wife Caroline to do \u201ca lot of tidying up\u201d, he told Marr.</p> \n<p>The service, recorded on a iPad at a makeshift altar on the Welbys\u2019 kitchen table, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and streamed on the Church of England\u2019s Facebook page and website.</p> \n<p>In his sermon, he said: \u201cWho does not feel the shock of the last few weeks?\u2026 So many people right across the country are anxious about employment, anxious about food, isolated from loved ones and feel that the future looks dark.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople right across the globe feel the same uncertainty, fear, despair and isolation.

The decision had been taken by all bishops with much pain, thought, discussion and prayer, he said.</p> \n<p>He understood that many people were unhappy with the guidance. \u201cI\u2019m unhappy \u2013 I would love to be in Canterbury cathedral,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut this is not about us, it\u2019s about example and service.

We want to ban these words for ever!\u201d</p> \n<p>In particular, the EU was facing an \u201cepochal challenge\u201d, which would determine its future and the future of the world. \u201cThe crisis we\u2019re facing should not make us forget the many other crises bringing suffering to so many people.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Calls for a comprehensive package of debt relief to help poor countries cope with the coronavirus pandemic have intensified after research showed that more than 60 countries are spending more on paying their creditors than they are on health.</p> <p>Before a series of key meetings this week, the Jubilee Debt Campaign said it was vital to relieve the mounting financial pressure on poor countries by cancelling their debt payments this year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/urgent-call-to-head-off-new-debt-crisis-in-developing-world\">JDC</a> said that among the 121 low and middle-income countries for which 2019 data was available an average of 10.7% of government revenue was spent on public health systems, compared with 12.2% on external debt payments.</p> <p>Of the 121 countries, 64 were spending more on debt servicing than on public health. The JDC said there was already pressure on the budgets of poor countries even before the economic shock of Covid-19, which had led to falls in commodity prices, huge capital flight, an increase in future borrowing costs, and loss of income in other ways such as remittances.</p> <p>Many African, Latin American and some Middle Eastern countries commonly pay more than 10% interest on their borrowings while richer nations can pay 1% or less.</p> <p>Sarah-Jayne Clifton, thedirector of the JDC, said: \u201cIn the face of a medical emergency the scale of Covid-19, it is indefensible that poor countries are having to spend more money on debt payments than on healthcare. Before this crisis hit, 64 poorer countries were already spending more on external debt payments than on their public health systems.</p> <p>\u201cWe need urgent action by the international community to cancel developing country 2020 debt payments.

  "<p>A lot has been written about how this pandemic is exacerbating social inequalities. But what if it\u2019s because our societies are so unequal that this pandemic happened?</p> <p>There is a school of thought that, historically, pandemics have been more likely to occur at times of social inequality and discord. As the poor get poorer, the thinking goes, their baseline health suffers, making them more prone to infection. At the same time they are forced to move more, in search of work, and to gravitate to cities. The rich, meanwhile, have more to spend on luxuries, including products that hail from far-flung places. The world becomes more tightly connected through trade, and germs, people and luxury goods travel together along trade routes that connect cities. On paper, it looks like a perfect storm.</p> <p>What about in reality? Historian Peter Turchin has described a strong statistical association between global connectedness, social crises and pandemics throughout history. An example is the second century CE, when the Roman and Chinese empires were at the peak of their wealth and power; the poor in both places were very poor, and the ancient silk routes were enjoying a heyday. Starting in 165CE, the Antonine plagues struck Rome; within a decade plague was devastating China too, and both empires then went into decline.</p> <p>The plague of Justinian in the 6th century and the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Black-Death\">Black Death</a> in the 14th century emerged in similar circumstances, and Turchin sees the same forces at work again today: globalisation, leading to the emergence of new human pathogens, combined with widening inequality. \u201cAnd now it looks like our Age of Discord got its own pandemic,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/coronavirus-and-our-age-of-discord/\">blog</a> last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-turn-back-the-clock-30-years-on-global-poverty\">Coronavirus could turn back the clock 30 years on global poverty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pandemics don\u2019t always trigger social unrest, but they can do, by throwing into relief the very inequalities that caused them. That\u2019s because they hit the poor hardest \u2013 those in low-paid or unstable employment, who live in crowded accommodation, have underlying health issues, and for whom healthcare is less affordable or less accessible. This was true in the past and remains so today. During the 2009 flu pandemic the death rate was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297400\">three times higher</a> in the poorest fifth of England\u2019s population than in the richest. Covid-19 is showing no signs of departing from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/coronavirus-inequality.html\">pattern</a>, which, because of the way the socioeconomic dice fall, also has a racial dimension.</p> <p>But there is something brand new about this pandemic, which has never been seen before in the history of humanity \u2013 and that is our unprecedented global experiment in lockdown. These lockdown measures are designed to slow the spread of the disease, relieve the burden on health systems and ultimately save lives \u2013 and it looks as if they may be doing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52133054\">that</a>. But they may also be exacerbating social inequalities themselves.</p> <p>We won\u2019t have a full picture of their impact until the pandemic is over, but there have been anecdotal <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/covid-19-inequality-and-gig-economy-workers\">reports</a> that point to this, and some more systematic analyses are emerging. Preliminary findings from a survey of 1,200 Norwegians, <a href=\"https://www.oslomet.no/en/research/featured-research/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-affecting-people-s-health-and-careers\">published</a> last week, indicate that people with lower levels of education and income are more likely to be temporarily laid off. They can apply for a government furlough scheme, similar to the one in the UK, but they are also more likely to see their income fall and to worry that their unemployment might become permanent.</p> <p>The Norwegian study found no correlation between poverty and self-reported sickness from Covid-19, but it did find that poorer, less well-educated people were less likely to comply with social distancing guidelines. It\u2019s hard to tell why, says demographer Svenn-Erik Mamelund of Oslo Metropolitan University, who was involved in the survey, but he has theories.</p> <p>People in lower socioeconomic groups may feel more pressure to go out to work, Mamelund says. They may also have lower levels of health literacy, less trust in officialdom, and even language problems if they are of non-Norwegian origin. He fears that these lower levels of compliance with public health measures might spill into higher levels of sickness and death later on, as they are exposed to the disease.</p> <p>Whether these measures are justified by the threat Covid-19 poses to human life is impossible to say, but those who imposed them knew there would be a high price to pay. Last year Mamelund sat on a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/influenza/publications/public_health_measures/publication/en/\">committee</a> that advised the World Health Organization on non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of a pandemic. The committee\u2019s job was to assess the costs and benefits of measures for slowing disease spread \u2013 everything from hand-washing to border closure \u2013 based on the available evidence. They came up with a list of recommendations that excluded lockdown, even in the worst-case scenario. \u201cWe never suggested lockdown because we knew it would be so harmful socially and economically for all countries,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I never thought the rest of the world would follow China\u2019s lead.\u201d</p> <p>Norway has a small population \u2013 5.4 million people \u2013 and a well-funded welfare state. There have been no protests there, so far, but the social impact of lockdown has been more visible elsewhere. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/india-wracked-by-greatest-exodus-since-partition-due-to-coronavirus\">India</a> there have been reports of deaths among unemployed migrant workers returning home in search of food; many countries, including the US, have seen workers taking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikes_during_the_2020_coronavirus_pandemic#Rent_strikes\">industrial action</a>, and anger has been expressed in rural communities over wealthy city-dwellers retreating to their second homes for the duration.</p> <p>Governments should keep an eye on these developments, in weighing up when and how to lift the lockdown, because even if it\u2019s difficult to argue today that the cure is worse than the disease, the cure might provoke an entirely different malaise \u2013 and history teaches us that no society is immune to that.</p> <p>That\u2019s the symptomatic treatment. In the long term, of course, they \u2013 and we \u2013 should address the dreadful inequality in our societies, which this pandemic is picking apart with a lethal scalpel.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author.

It\u2019s not quite a revolution, but it\u2019s an epic conceptual awakening.</p> <p>I live in Parma, but despite the profound anguish here in Italy, it also feels, paradoxically, as if the world has come right in some way. With our despoiling suddenly stopped, wildlife is returning with innocent ebullience. Bottlenose dolphins have been playfully leaping in the <a href=\"Bottlenose%20dolphins%20have%20been%20playfully%20leaping%20in%20the%20waters%20around%20Venice\">waters around Venice</a>.

Outbreaks of localised barbarism and criminality are predictable when people feel impoverished, paranoid and vulnerable. Already, in Italy, we\u2019ve had instances of toughs refusing to pay in supermarkets. Democratic politicians have had a taste of almost dictatorial power over the people, and it will be hard to roll back rule by emergency decrees. Countries like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/hungarian-journalists-fear-coronavirus-law-may-be-used-to-jail-them\">Hungary</a> might be slipping away from the democratic fraternity. Public health will be an excuse to ramp up state surveillance and, when we need to jump-start the economy, environmental protections may well be ripped up. The counter-revolution, those seers say, is just around the corner.</p> <p>But despite all these fantasies, one of the consequences of the crisis is that we\u2019re suddenly more serious about the truth. \u201cAccurate scientific, economic, political and social information about what is happening somewhere,\u201d <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">Bill Foster</a>, a history lecturer at Homerton College, Cambridge, told me last week, \u201cis suddenly valuable everywhere. It\u2019s literally a matter of life and death. We might just be tempted now to remember what we lost when we started to abandon trying to find truths together.\u201d It\u2019s intriguing that it\u2019s taken this pandemic, rather than sensitive referendums and elections, to persuade social media companies of the need to <a href=\"Bill%20Foster,%20a%20history%20lecturer%20at%20Homerton%20College,%20Cambridge\">combat fake news</a> and conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Without truth there is no trust, and the gates of civilisation are wide open to political blackguards and devious disinformation. Those gates have been open for decades, and it\u2019s one of the hard-to-swallow lessons of this contagion that gate-keeping is paramount, that we need boundaries and membranes. Having managed a therapeutic community for almost a decade, I\u2019ve always known that blocking, or expelling, damaging elements was vital to communal wellbeing (you can\u2019t, for example, have drug use in a rehab). I knew that monastic wisdom depended on enclosure. But I still instinctively baulked at any impediment to free movement on a global level. We internationalists inevitably struggle to accept the idea. And yet the very first principle of a functioning group (as enunciated by Nobel prize-winning political economist, <a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Elinor </a><a href=\"Nobel%20Prize-winning%20political%20economist,%20Elinor%20Ostrom\">Ostrom</a>) is \u201ceffective exclusion of external, unentitled parties\u201d.</p> <p>The penny has also dropped that wellbeing isn\u2019t individual but social. We are not actually independent at all, but dependent. We can make each other sick and we can try to make each other well. We\u2019ve understood that a healthy community (as Wendell Berry wrote in his essay <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">Health Is Membership</a>) isn\u2019t merely human, but also \u201cits soil, its water, its air\u201d.</p> <p>It has been fascinating to see the speed at which other attitudes have changed. The indignation expressed towards people not respecting <a href=\"https://scienceandsociety.duke.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Berry-Health-is-Membership.pdf\">social distancing</a> (from those who would never normally describe themselves as moralists) has been understandably shrill: here too we\u2019ve suddenly realised that the wellbeing of the group is endangered by indifferent individuals, and that community \u2013 for which we\u2019ve yearned for so long \u2013 means originally simply a pooling of duties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba36caf01032dfedadb4284a7c06c27095a8af8/0_187_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man with a bouquet in San Fiorano, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 16th day of quarantine in San Fiorano, one of the 11 small towns in northern Italy that has been on lockdown since February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marzio Toniolo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/need-roots-disconnection-past-community\">The Need for Roots</a></em>, her manifesto for how to refound society after the second world war, the philosopher and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/03/religion-simone-weil\">Simone Weil</a> wrote that \u201cthe notion of obligations comes before that of rights\u201d.

Last week I was cutting the communal grass of our palazzo \u2013 the only place our kids can play outside \u2013 with a borrowed billhook, which is a bit like cutting hair with a fork.</p> <p>That centring has been mental as well as physical. It\u2019s a truism of modern life that we struggle to be settled or present. Because we can be anywhere, we actually end up being nowhere. We suffer, as the sociologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/15/zygmunt-bauman-obituary\">Zygmunt Bauman</a> once wrote, an<strong> \u201c</strong>electronically assured out-of-placeness\u201d. We\u2019re notoriously fidgety and lacking attention. We just keep clicking and tapping. When I was running our community, one of the hardest things for those in early recovery was just to sit still. We used to have Quaker-like silences twice a day, and to begin with, many just couldn\u2019t cope with the sudden stillness.</p> <p>It seems to me as if we\u2019re all in a similar situation right now. We\u2019ve come to an emergency stop, and it\u2019s painful not just because we\u2019re separated from others, but because we can no longer separate from ourselves. Until now we\u2019ve kept frenetically busy to keep from reflection, but now that we\u2019re still, demons, voices and shame can quickly surface. I know friends who are suffering panic attacks, even something close to psychosis. Many are alone and far from the solace of any fellowship.</p> <p>The poet and psychologist Hala Alyan wrote a <a href=\"https://emergencemagazine.org/story/this-is-not-a-rehearsal/\">beautiful essay</a> in <em>Emergence</em> magazine last week, in which she suggested that this pandemic is \u201cserving as a flashlight \u2013 illuminating people\u2019s unsteadiest, half-finished parts. It\u2019s showing us where our work remains. People talk about their ex-boyfriends, their long-resolved eating disorders, their childhood secrets\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c69c7fb4a2bde0187e3684175851e605ab3e8a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c69c7fb4a2bde0187e3684175851e605ab3e8a7/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A daughter paints her father's toenails while her mother looks out of a balcony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schoolteacher Marzio Toniolo, 35, has been documenting life under lockdown in San Fiorano since February.

The Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen once described <a href=\"wounds%20and%20pains%20become%20openings%20or%20occasions%20for%20a%20new%20vision\">a healing community</a> as a place not where \u201cwounds are cured and pains are alleviated\u201d, but where \u201cwounds and pains become openings or occasions for a new vision\u201d. I don\u2019t delight in the pain, but I am glad we\u2019re being honest about it.</p> <p>It may be that this medical emergency will offer the space and time for us to focus, for once, on our interior worlds. Because any speculation about the future is redundant unless there is spiritual, as well as medical, healing. Johnny Sertin, founder of a soul-centred consultancy called Becoming, said last week: \u201cWe need another way, another world, but it\u2019s impossible if we cannot do that from a place of being at home with who we are.\u201d</p> <p>As we\u2019re all pondering self-preservation, it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re wondering what has been eating us up all this time. Many of the friends I\u2019ve talked to in recent weeks have expressed relief that there\u2019s an enforced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/social-distancing-tips-the-rules-of-safe-shopping-under-coronavirus\">detox from shopping</a>. Many seem to have realised the true nature of consumerism, which is that we\u2019re not only consumers but also being consumed by it. Choice is so limitless that we never make up our minds. All the energy, movement and money to buy stuff and experiences leaves us feeling empty and remorseful. I personally know that every time we drive to the out-of-town shopping mall, built (allegedly) on the proceeds of organised crime, with speakers in the car park blasting the very worst pop music, to buy cheap clobber for the kids \u2013 it rips my spirit.</p> <p>As long ago as 1955, Victor Lebow suggested that we seek \u201c<a href=\"https://sustainablesociety.com/social/consumerism#.XoxVEFNKi9Y\">spiritual satisfaction</a>\u201d in consumption. Acquisition pretends to fill an existential void but only deepens it. We\u2019re constantly engaging in a psychic gorging and purging that leaves us weak and guilty. It\u2019s only during this slow-down that I realise how similar we are to Leonia, the imaginary society described by Italo Calvino in <em>Invisible Cities</em>: \u201cexpelling, discarding, cleansing a recurrent impurity. Street cleaners are welcomed like angels\u201d.</p> <p>It feels as if this crisis is allowing us to glimpse the back office of society, not just those street cleaners, but also the detritus we\u2019re sprinkling every day online. Perhaps it\u2019s because notions of <a href=\"expelling,%20discarding,%20cleansing%20a%20recurrent%20impurity.%20Street%20cleaners%20are%20welcomed%20like%20angels\">personal protection</a> are now at the forefront of our minds, or because talk of biometric monitoring and state surveillance are now being explicitly discussed\u2026 but I feel as if we\u2019ve finally awoken to the truth about the information age: that it\u2019s we who are being informed upon. In an attempt to understand this pandemic, many of us are fixated with statistics, graphs and clusters. But we\u2019re also constantly giving ourselves away. That jittery clicking comes at a cost. As that old adage goes: \u201cWhen something online is free, you\u2019re not the customer, you\u2019re the product.\u201d</p> <p>It seems even more important now, because almost the last distraction now left to us is the internet. All our social rituals \u2013 in pubs, clubs, schools, religious gatherings \u2013 are currently mediated by screens. There\u2019s still idealism in our digital connections, as evidenced by the open-source community\u2019s collaboration on the design or production of medical equipment. But our online habits are being constantly monetised. Writing about surveillance capitalism last week, Simona Guerra, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leicester, said that, just like manual labour of old, \u201chuman activities themselves are sold and bought\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f41c164bd787f13616a56806c69e38df49fa9431/0_27_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The deserted Gallery Vittorio Emanuele II, Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Marfisi/AGF/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of this crisis we\u2019ve also begun to question the greatest absolutism of the last half-century: the supremacy of the market. It\u2019s become clear, as <a href=\"human%20activities%20themselves%20are%20sold%20and%20bought\">Rowan Williams</a> said to me, that \u201cthe so-called \u2018market state\u2019 is lethally ill-equipped to cope with large-scale collective crisis\u201d. The minimum wages of essential workers, the failure of supply and demand for medical equipment and the sheer cruelty of comments suggesting that the vulnerable could be sacrificed to keep the economy going \u2013 all have revealed the pickpocketing of the market\u2019s \u201chidden hand\u201d and the steepness of its \u201clevel playing field\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s as if the sacred \u201cmarket\u201d has, like a hated dictator, finally been toppled. Instead of our society having a market, we\u2019re realising that the market had our society. Jonathan Rowson, the philosopher and director of the Perspectiva research institute, wrote recently that \u201cthe state\u201d, instead of \u201csocialising and humanising the economy\u201d, had allowed \u201cmarkets to gradually economise and dehumanise society\u201d. Even the <em>Financial Times</em> has been advocating Keynesian, collectivist financial packages. We\u2019re rehabilitating those heretics who have long lamented neo-liberalism\u2019s corrosive effects. The great social theorist Steven Lukes is blunt: \u201cmarket fundamentalism\u201d, he told me, has created \u201cdevastation and unbridled inequalities\u201d.</p> <p>Globalisation has been a large part of the market\u2019s supremacy. The idealistic telling of globalisation was that it was an equitable trading free-for-all which could enrich the poor. The reality, though, has been incessant outsourcing so that our consumables remain as cheap as chips. We\u2019ve come to expect all produce, at all times, in all seasons. Globalisation has been a race to the bottom, which has created semi-slavery at the harsh end of very long supply chains. It has eradicated businesses and jobs close to home and shred local networks of trust and kinship. Like the globe-trotting money, we\u2019ve become frenetically mobile and rootless.</p> <p>But the most naked truth of this crisis is that we can no longer remain in denial about finitude, not just our own as we see mortality close up, but also our planet\u2019s. The Quaker economist Kenneth E Boulding once (allegedly) said: \u201cAnyone who believes in infinite growth on a finite planet is either mad or an economist.\u201d It\u2019s so obvious it\u2019s been ignored for decades. But if this Covid crisis is a dress rehearsal for the climate one, we have seen some of the costs and consequences. \u201cThe case for post-growth economics,\u201d Rowson says, \u201cjust became stronger. We need economies that make sense of 8 billion or so human beings living together in a planetary system as a whole, not the extraction of profit to achieve abstract aggregate targets like GDP.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s long been one of the truisms of modern life that we suffer mythic deprivation. We tell stories, but are never enveloped in one. There has been no belonging and thus no community, no heroes and no quests. Suddenly we have all the above. But it\u2019s not entirely like a film where the heroes would be the medics dying to save us (125 in Italyat the time of writing) and the quest would be the global race to find a vaccine. They\u2019re just a part of this story. Heroism for the rest of us is much subtler and quieter: it\u2019s about restraint and retreat, solitude and stillness. And our quest is perhaps even harder: to discern the common good and look for enlightenment in this darkness.</p> <p><em>Tobias Jones </em><em>is the author of A Place of Refuge</em></p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt ousting of two veteran watchdogs has prompted fears the scandal-prone US president is purging people from government who have oversight of fraud, waste and abuse.</p> <p>The moves also come at a time when a global pandemic and resulting mass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/us-unemployment-filings-coronavirus\">unemployment crisis</a> has prompted a multitrillion-dollar economic rescue effort, much of which is aimed at helping some of America\u2019s largest companies.</p> <p>Ex-watchdogs \u2013 dubbed inspectors general \u2013 plus top Democrats have voiced alarm at Trump\u2019s removal last week of an acting IG at the Pentagon slated to lead a new oversight panel for the $2.2tn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">coronavirus relief law</a>.

Days before, Trump had used the signing statement for the law to blunt two newly created IG posts, suggesting he would decide what information Congress receives about the aid package.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s sudden oustings of the two well-respected watchdogs, Michael Atkinson, the IG for the intelligence community, and Glenn Fine, the acting IG for the Pentagon, sparked special concerns given their timing and apparent political motivations.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s ousting of Fine, who was recently picked by his fellow IGs to run a critical oversight panel for the $2.2tn law, is seen as a broad slap at any oversight on the president and his administration since it rendered Fine ineligible to lead the watchdog panel.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s motives in firing Atkinson prompted other worries. After initially saying he had simply lost confidence in Atkinson, Trump used a pandemic press briefing the next day to unleash an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint, slamming him as not \u201ca big Trump fan\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s antipathy to IG watchdogs was displayed again at a pandemic briefing last week when he was asked about a report by the health and human services IG revealing that hospitals faced \u201cwidespread\u201d shortages of face masks, and \u201csevere\u201d test shortages.</p> <p>Providing no evidence, Trump dismissed the report as \u201cjust wrong\u201d, and the next day labeled it \u201canother fake dossier\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e/0_126_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>IGs were created in 1978 to ferret out executive agency waste, fraud and abuse.

Horowitz has also vowed that \u201caggressive, independent oversight\u201d would continue after the firing.</p> <p>Former officials say Trump mistreated Atkinson.</p> <p>\u201cIt is troubling to see that the president \u2013 apparently based on political grievances \u2013 has removed Michael Atkinson, a talented and capable inspector general who was doing exactly what his job requires,\u201d said Mary McCord, a former chief of the DoJ\u2019s national security section where Atkinson once worked.</p> <p>Atkinson himself concurred.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard not to think that the president\u2019s loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General, and from my commitment to continue to do so,\u201d Atkinson said in a statement on Sunday.</p> <p>Other criticism of Trump erupted when he selected the White House lawyer Brian Miller as a special IG for a $500bn business chunk of the $2.2tn law.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who currently works in the White House counsel\u2019s office, serving a president who has tried to silence other inspector generals and announced his intention to silence this one, is not independent,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance panel, said in a statement.</p> <p>In Bromwich\u2019s eyes, Trump \u201chas rejected all forms of oversight by congressional committees, and has now turned his opposition to oversight to the IG community\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Gavin Newsom this week declared himself the leader of a \u201cnation-state\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/1247698364063518720\">Speaking on MSNBC</a>, the California governor on Tuesday announced his state would be amassing more than 200m medical-grade masks per month for health workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. After weeks of competing with other states for critical medical equipment, in the absence of strategy and coordination from the federal government, Newsom said he had had enough. So he harnessed the bulk purchasing power of \u201cthe state of California as a nation-state\u201d to spend nearly $1bn to work with non-profits and manufacturers to deliver masks for his constituents, and possibly other states.</p> <p>The next morning, as <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article241860561.html\">#PresidentNewsom trended</a> on Twitter, Newsom once again presented the state he leads as a global power. \u201cWe need to coordinate and organize our nation-state status,\u201d he told reporters at his daily Covid-19 press briefing. California \u201chas been a catalyst to increase supply that will not only avail itself to the state of California but more broadly across this country and potentially in other parts of the globe\u201d, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-california-waiting-test-results-backlog-quest-diagnostics\">Why is California still waiting for nearly 60,000 coronavirus test results?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state \u2013 which, Newsom often likes to point out, would have the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, if it were a sovereign nation \u2013 the governor has often cast himself as a foil to Donald Trump. As the president and the governor bickered, critics in California have lamented that the governor often promised more than he could deliver, and was at times counterproductive by trying to appease too many groups at once. But amid the federal government\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis, Newsom is getting both local and national recognition for stepping into a leadership vacuum.</p> <p>After identifying its first cases of Covid-19 in late February, California became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">first US state to issue</a> a widespread stay-at-home order on 19 March. Since then, the state has seen more than 20,000 coronavirus cases and 570 deaths \u2013 but the death toll appears to be rising more slowly than in hard-hit New York and New Jersey. Public health experts have credited the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-31/coronavirus-social-distancing-west-coast-california-new-york-covid\">state\u2019s foresight</a> in enforcing social distancing. The Trump administration\u2019s response meanwhile, has lagged behind, with the president denying the crisis and delaying action even as the national death toll climbed.</p> <p>Newsom moved into the governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, replacing Jerry Brown \u2013 a prominent figure who had dominated California politics since the 1970s. At 52, he has already had a long career in politics and weathered a fair share of scandal. More than 15 years ago, as San Francisco mayor, he made headlines after he defied national law to marry same-sex couples in California. He made national headlines again in 2007 after it was revealed he had an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/us/02newsom.html\">affair with a subordinate</a>, who was also the wife of his chief campaign adviser. At the time, Newsom was separated from Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 now an adviser to the president, and the partner of his son Donald Trump Jr.</p> <p>Newsom has tried to cast himself as a young, fresh and progressive leader \u2013 whose Silicon Valley-chic contrasts with Brown\u2019s suits and ties. He has also presented himself as the governor of \u201cthe most un-Trump state in America\u201d \u2013 loudly challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the environment, immigration, healthcare and gun rights \u2013 often on the president\u2019s favorite platform: Twitter. Trump, meanwhile, has relished taunting Newsom as an \u201cincompetent governor\u201d, and obsessing over narrow policies that disproportionately affect California.</p> <p>But amid the coronavirus crisis, rather than fighting the president, Newsom has opted to show him up, in some cases delivering on the president\u2019s empty promises. As Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007026448/trump-coronavirus.html\">blithely reassured</a>, \u201cJust stay calm. It will go away,\u201d Newsom earned praise from public health experts around the country for enforcing strict, early distancing orders. While Trump beat back pleas from governors to send more of the ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients, Newsom shipped <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/newsletter/ca-feds-500-ventilators-national-stockpile-new-york/\">500 ventilators</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1247655661120315393\">seven states</a>. And when the federal government sent <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-29/california-broken-ventilators-silicon-valley-newsom\">faulty equipment</a>, Newsom harnessed the state\u2019s outsized tech industry to quickly fix them.</p> <p>As the federal government stepped back from the crisis, governors including Newsom, Andrew Cuomo in New York and Jay Inslee in Washington found a national audience of Americans looking for steady administration amid chaos.</p> <p>Governors across the country have stepped up, said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political strategist who has worked for former president Bill Clinton and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People look for heroes in times of crisis.

This is all in the spirit of all of us stepping into this moment and doing what we can.\u201d</p> <p>While Cuomo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK23nfdEVDk\">open, emotional briefings</a> have captivated national broadcasters, Newsom\u2019s shewed, steady strategy through the crisis could pay off, said Amanda Renteria, who was the national political director for the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 and a primary challenger to Newsom in 2018. Newsom made \u201ca big statement\u201d when he made California the first US state to order all residents to stay home, Renteria told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an after-review of how those actions made a difference,\u201d she noted.</p> <p>Already, public health officials are praising Newsom\u2019s early action. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, has repeatedly held up California as a success story to highlight the effectiveness of distancing measures to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d.

The governor said he \u201cowns\u201d the issues with testing, and has developed a taskforce to correct course.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare that elected leaders get real-time feedback on how well they led,\u201d Renteria noted. \u201cBut now people are getting to know their leaders, and paying attention to what they do in that moment of truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2020 because California issued a stay-at-home order on 19 March, not on 10 March as an earlier version said.

Central and eastern European governments panicked knowing that their health systems, under-funded and stuck in the 90s, simply could not cope, hence their extremely strict lockdown measures. The crisis is also laying bare the effect of the brain drain from east to west. The EU cannot continue to neglect this problem. If Germany\u2019s success in handling the pandemic is partly down to an army of migrant doctors and nurses, it should not be to the detriment of central and eastern Europe.</p> \n<p>Free movement of labour has also, paradoxically, led to the return home of millions of eastern Europeans. About 200,000 Bulgarians who lost jobs in western Europe have returned home since the beginning of March. Of a working population of 3 million, that is a significant proportion (imagine 5 million Germans suddenly appearing on the labour market or applying for unemployment benefit). Apart from the suspicion that they are importing the disease, the returnees may become a longer-term preoccupation \u2013 and the EU may want to think about common labour insurance system.</p> \n<p>A new Marshall Plan to rebuild post-pandemic Europe could help its economy to bounce back.

  "<p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r broke cover a few days ago, appearing on Sky Sports to tell his pal Gary Neville that once the pandemic is over Manchester United are hoping to be able to exploit any unexpected transfer market opportunities caused by clubs being forced into financial difficulties through lack of income during the long layoff.</p> <p>That was how the conversation was reported in most newspapers, anyway. The United manager did not choose the word exploit, and though Neville subsequently conceded his question might have been more diplomatically phrased, it is a little late now to be sparing the feelings of clubs struggling through real hardship. The clear message coming out of Old Trafford is that United are riding the storm and once football is back to normal they anticipate being able to turn a market-leading position into an advantage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/11/julian-knight-rishi-sunak-furlough-furore-premier-league-ignores-aim-protect-jobs\">Furlough furore over Premier League clubs ignores aim of protecting jobs | David Conn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without much else going on in the game that means everyone from Jack Grealish to Jadon Sancho is being lined up for a move \u2013 people are already trying to work out if it would be possible to fit Grealish and James Maddison into the same team. Yet, while Solskj\u00e6r may be indulging in a spot of wishful thinking if he imagines the game\u2019s brightest young talents are about to form an orderly queue outside his office, his reasoning is not purely pie in the sky.</p> <p>It certainly seems to be the case, for instance, that United find themselves better insulated than most against loss of gate and matchday income, because for some time they have been working to become less reliant on that particular source of revenue. Anyone who has seen the armies of corporate and hospitality staff that descend on Old Trafford on match days will appreciate that United make more money than most from maximising their entertainment and merchandising opportunities, though the club have also led the way \u2013 often to the point of ridicule \u2013 in cutting lucrative deals away from the pitch and stadium. Yes, we are talking global business sponsors here, noodle partners if you like, the tie-ins with mattress makers and coffee producers that have made the executive vice\u2011chairman, Ed Woodward, a figure of fun.</p> <p>At the last count, although counting is often difficult because there are various tiers of sponsorship and new names are still being added, United had 26 main global partners. Supporters have generally found this annoying because they would rather the club devoted a similar amount of effort to buying a new centre-half or reclaiming a place in the Champions League, while fans of rival clubs have regarded it as a comedy gift. What sort of football follower, after all, would rather see results achieved on the balance sheet than the pitch? Who in their right mind would prefer an accumulation of partners to league points?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3bcc9a4e9e31c0730d9bda5d4b8fd40e792e3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3bcc9a4e9e31c0730d9bda5d4b8fd40e792e3a5/0_235_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United fans display banners in the away end at Goodison Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United fans display banners in the away end at Goodison Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The available evidence suggests Woodward would (though he would obviously favour a rise in playing standards, too), and for the past few years he has been mercilessly depicted as a money-grabbing know\u2011nothing, an accountant unwisely appointed to run a famous football name.

And now, at a time when results on the pitch can no longer be seen and league points are suddenly unavailable, Woodward could be on the verge of being congratulated for his foresight in making sure United\u2019s revenue streams are sufficiently diverse to survive football itself being forcibly removed from the agenda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/11/carry-on-barcelona-the-comic-tale-of-tragedy-and-drama-that-keeps-on-giving\">Carry on Barcelona: the comic tale of tragedy and drama that keeps on giving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even before Solskj\u00e6r made his remarks there must have been a few other clubs wishing they had cast-iron guarantees of continuing income from sources unaffected by coronavirus closures. At an early stage in the discussion about wage cuts and furloughs United were able to make it clear they could afford to take the hit. Woodward said much the same thing a year ago when responding with a shrug to a question about the spectacular blip on the balance sheet occasioned by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s decision to recruit Alexis S\u00e1nchez. United may not be getting everything right, then or now, but any business able to grin and bear a S\u00e1nchez-sized salary must be in fairly robust shape.</p> <p>Which is exactly what the next few weeks and months could prove. Solskj\u00e6r will probably not end up with Grealish, Sancho and Maddison all at the same time, but United will most likely be in a position to end up with someone. No one quite knows how and when this will all end, but it is reasonable to suppose the business-as-usual sign will go up at Old Trafford earlier than at most other clubs.</p> <p>The CEO who began the season as a clown may yet end it considered a visionary. Truly we are living through strange times. Once the lockdown is over, United\u2019s ultras might have to make another house call, this time to say sorry.</p>",

Every frame carries a sense of foreboding, leading up to Ayrton Senna\u2019s fatal accident at Imola; one throwaway clip from Brazilian TV feels particularly gut-wrenching in the wider context. We also get a driver\u2019s-eye-view of his ferocious rivalry with Alain Prost and his battles with the sport\u2019s governing bodies over safety. Amid all this we never lose sight of Senna\u2019s talent on the track, with clips of his greatest victories demonstrating why he rose to almost god-like status in his home country. <strong>NM </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost\">Read the full review.</a></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Available on Netflix</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Bodyline</h2> <p>It is a scary 36 years since this six-part dramatisation was first broadcast in the UK, in which time the two young actors who got their big breaks in the series \u2013 Hugo Weaving, who played a villainous Douglas Jardine, and Gary Sweet, who played a heroic Don Bradman \u2013 have become beloved stalwarts of the Australian film industry. It is, predictably, a little dated and not exactly fault-free \u2013 it starts, for example, with a lengthy and slightly dreary monologue from Heather Mitchell, as Jardine\u2019s fictional girlfriend Edith Clarke \u2013 but it swiftly repays a bit of perseverance. I was 10 when it was first shown on the BBC in 1985 and the legend of cricket\u2019s most infamous series as well as some individual scenes (mostly involving Jim Holt\u2019s Harold Larwood, for some reason) have lodged themselves for ever in my memory. <strong>SB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4qJbqsTGoY\">Watch Bodyline on YouTube</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Hillsborough</h2> <p>Within ESPN\u2019s 30 for 30 series of documentaries, you\u2019ll find everything from Pablo Escobar\u2019s grip on Colombian football, to the epic Tour de France battle between Greg LeMond and Bernard Hinault. OJ: Made in America also sits within this groundbreaking series, but if you only watch one film from its archive, make it this one. Daniel Gordon\u2019s unflinching work is perhaps the definitive work on the horrific events of 15 April 1989. From an intriguing introduction, the grim story of the Hillsborough disaster and cover-up is meticulously charted. Eyewitness testimony from survivors, victims\u2019 families and police officers on the ground that day make this an often uncomfortable, but essential, viewing experience. <strong>NM</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Watch Hillsborough via ESPN Player (outside UK) or on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_PA7YlJAHY&amp;t=4s\">YouTube</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>An Impossible Job</h2> <p>Probably the most widely quoted and discussed sports documentary in the history of British broadcasting, Channel 4\u2019s feature on Graham Taylor\u2019s doomed spell in charge of England remains brilliantly, horribly compelling. For any English football fan of a certain age the dramatic high point, as England try to grasp their final rational chance of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in Holland, is surely the most painful 10 minutes in the history of sports broadcasting. The soundtrack to the final credits, composed of Fleet Street\u2019s finest dictating Taylor\u2019s sporting obituaries to their desks on the night their elimination was confirmed, is heartbreaking. <strong>SB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"729da7f479f9f82498748833f0bdbd0c1f168bf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/729da7f479f9f82498748833f0bdbd0c1f168bf0/87_86_7019_5374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lawrie McMenemy comforts Graham Taylor after the final whistle after the Netherlands\u2019 2-0 victory that all but ensured England missed out on qualifying for the 1994 World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lawrie McMenemy comforts Graham Taylor after the Netherlands\u2019 2-0 victory that all but ensured England missed out on qualifying for the 1994 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvd25og42Fs\">Watch An Impossible Job on YouTube</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Andy Murray: Resurfacing</h2> <p>The two-times Wimbledon champion\u2019s comeback from injury has been stalled by the global shutdown in tennis, although the break may benefit Murray in the long run.

In that one word, delivered with Freeman\u2019s usual deadpan finesse, we are gifted an insight into a loving couple striving, with a shared wit and worldview, against filthy circumstance. Two against nature, indeed, whether it\u2019s school or bumptious parents or heart-scream tragedy or, as it often is, their own bloody children, too-tender Luke and too-bubbly Ava. Writers Simon Blackwell, Chris Addison and Freeman himself have given us not only a couple we can honestly believe in but also a drama for modern times; not sure, in fact, whether it should even qualify as \u201ccomedy\u201d, though \u201cdramedy\u201d sounds like being force-fed a sour-bourbon medicine. Yet dramatic indeed: I can still feel in my bones that <em>crump</em> that vaulted Michael high over an anonymous suburban street. At the time of writing there are, astonishingly, no plans for a follow-up series: remedy, or even (if you must) dramedy, that omission prontissimo, if you will.</p> <p>Similarly, there are no apparent plans for furtherance of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000h3mf\">Alma\u2019s Not Normal</a></strong>, the one-off pilot of which landed rather triumphantly midweek.

As it might, coming from Sophie Willan, the first recipient of the Caroline Aherne writing bursary, who also stars as ever-hopeful, ever-hopeless Alma. Much was made of this being \u201conly\u201d a pilot, yet I wholly suspect it\u2019ll be commissioned for an entire series \u2013 not because of the sainted Aherne link, but because it\u2019s truly quality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"14fecd91c417f29401ecfa4e7bd9b81a19ce0415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14fecd91c417f29401ecfa4e7bd9b81a19ce0415/0_0_4284_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lorraine Ashbourne, Sophie Willan, Siobhan Finneran and Nicolas Ashbury in Willan\u2019s \u2018truly sharp\u2019 new comedy Alma\u2019s Not Normal. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorraine Ashbourne, Sophie Willan, Siobhan Finneran and Nicolas Ashbury in Willan\u2019s \u2018truly sharp\u2019 new comedy Alma\u2019s Not Normal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Expectation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Siobhan Finneran is a revelation as Alma\u2019s mother, an ex-punk morphed and morphined into a recovering addict, false toothed and snotty, roots growing out the colour of an unhealthily bruised sky.

Where to start? The antagonists, Joe Exotic and the \u201cbig cat rescuer\u201d Carole Baskin, who bought animals just to keep them roiling and broiling in cages, each as bad as the other, though only one is going to end (spoiler alert) his life in jail? The cult of the parks, employees fed past-sell-by Walmart meat along with the animals and returning eagerly to have another limb removed? The sex-pest cult, with gay, gun-toting, mulleted Joe marrying two straight, damaged, young weirdos? The well-timed, dodgy death of Carole\u2019s first husband; her even dodgier love of ersatz tigerprint? The eternal gulls of social media?

I suspect some whose worldview is that Trump is behind All Evil might have stayed with it to the end, to revel fully in all the shit-kicker madness, the parade of demeaned (often limb-shorn) grotesques. I stayed with it, because that\u2019s my job, but felt by the last there was little to garner and might as well have spent the time ironing my hair. The one high emotion I was left with was that, in the end, the very end, despite a decade\u2019s wrangling, both cage-based and literal and by wet-lipped lawyers and figurative, the animals were not one spit better off.</p> <p>And, as if America didn\u2019t have enough of a global PR problem at the moment, were I head of the Oklahoma Tourist Board, I\u2019d be walking even now into a starving, thin-ribbed tiger\u2019s cage, wrapped in a Maccy D bun and slathered in catsup.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B084NSK3YB/ref=dvm_uk_sl_tit%7Cc_430184960348_m_103564269721300033009560-dc_s_\">Tales From the Loop</a></strong> is also quite unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before.

To say it\u2019s a science fiction series utterly belies its drip-slow gifts. No whooshy rockets or whizzbang alienettes; just a steady, low-booming, ethereal sense of unease, unsteadiness, crossed somehow with memories, none of which any of us have, of Soviet-era satellite braincamps where young scientists were bred and raised as something thrummed underground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htuNZp82Ck\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1htuNZp82Ck?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htuNZp82Ck&amp;feature=emb_title\">Watch a trailer for Tales from the Loop.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art might best be described as haughty steampunk.

It was from his mother\u2019s example, he says, that he learned how to forgive. Jayakody now teaches younger children at Sunday school and hopes to become an engineer in honour of his mother.</p> <p>But the wider environment is challenging. In the immediate aftermath, some Muslim businesses were boycotted by Sinhala or Buddhist customers \u2013 until leaders came together through local inter-religious committees, reinforcing messages of harmony and emphasising the right of all to live and work in Negombo.</p> <p>When refugees faced physical attacks after the bombings, human rights activists like Ruki Fernando<em> </em>stepped in to protect them.</p> <p>\u201cIn the context of large numbers of dead, injured and the magnitude of the tragedy, refugees didn\u2019t receive much attention and support from the government, media, religious leaders and overall, Sri Lankan society. But some politicians and government officials were sympathetic and mindful of their duties,\u201d he says, remembering how the Negombo police station sheltered a large number of refugees at the height of unrest, despite being overstretched.</p> <p>Harassment of Muslims had happened before, but the problem increased after the attacks. As some landlords and hosts were pressured to evict them, human rights groups worked with communities to support those at risk, opening their doors and providing food and medicine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now with the current fears and <a href=\"https://www.cpalanka.org/brief-guide-i-evolving-legal-issues-in-the-context-of-covid-19/\">restrictions</a>, Fernando is worried about vulnerable communities such as refugees, prisoners, the poor and minorities.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing both racism and authoritarianism raising their ugly heads in the middle of the fight against Covid,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at Colombo\u2019s Centre for Alternative Policies thinktank, is also concerned.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is extremely worrying.

  "<p>When I was three years old, my father, badly stricken with the mumps, was hospitalised. Refusing to be stretchered out, he insisted on walking to the ambulance instead, wrapped in the brown blanket my sister and I used to saddle up the back of the sofa with, riding imaginary horses to the theme tune of <em>The</em> <em>High </em><em>Chaparral</em>.</p> <p>One of the ambulance men gave me a pacifying box of Smarties to which I clung, as I watched my dad go. Moments later I would ask for a chair to be pulled over to the sink, and washed the Smarties clean of their colour, lining them up neatly, now white and orderly, along the ridges of the draining board. Like all traumas, the memory is set and unchanging. (My dad came back and lived another 47 years.)</p> <p>No chocolate can fully heal the hurts of today, but there are many fantastic, small chocolate manufacturers that need trade right now, and it is these that I shall be focusing on in the next weeks. The chocolate I\u2019ve been returning to these last few days is <strong>Chocolarder</strong>\u2019s 55% Milk Gingerbread (\u00a35.50, 70g, <a href=\"https://www.chocolarder.com/product/gingerbread-55-milk/\" title=\"\">chocolarder.com</a>). It reminds me of the warming spices of Christmas and, staying in at the moment, with the world quiet outside, it reminds me of a bizarre yuletide. Except it\u2019s spring. Aptly, it\u2019s a seasonal chocolate, only available twice a year: Christmas and Easter.</p> <p>For all those baking bread, if you can shape your dough into a baguette (go you!), laying some pieces of your favourite chocolate along the middle length gives each tear of the bread a nice surprise.</p> <p>And don\u2019t we all need those right now?</p>",
  "<p>At the time of the February cabinet reshuffle, eight weeks and an eternity ago, I was talking to a senior Tory about the power structure of the government. He remarked: \u201cBoris is not primus inter pares. He is first without equals. He is president, he is lord of all he surveys. The cabinet are just nodding dogs.\u201d As if to illustrate this, President Johnson let TV cameras into the cabinet room to film his <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-nhs-campaign-lies-cabinet-meeting-ministers-hospitals-a9250011.html\">ministers performing</a> a ridiculous nursery school call and response about their manifesto promises.</p> <p>The \u201clord of all he surveys\u201d is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-uk-live-boris-johnson-still-in-hospital-as-public-urged-to-stay-home-for-easter?page=with:block-5e9092728f08db3109f20560#block-5e9092728f08db3109f20560\">confined to hospital</a> by the coronavirus and the \u201cnodding dogs\u201d must do their best to prove that they do not deserve that derogatory label. A structure designed to concentrate the maximum amount of power at Number 10 must adapt to operating without a fully functional prime minister.</p> <p>His enforced absence coincides with an especially testing stretch of the crisis. What is crudely characterised as the \u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d argument is becoming sharper. There is a mounting debate within government about when and to what extent the lockdown might be relaxed. This is, paradoxically, a testament to its general success. Thus far, it has worked more effectively than government modelling anticipated when the prime minister reluctantly placed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">closed-for-business sign</a> over most of Britain. Some doltish police officers have overstepped, a giant dunce\u2019s cap being awarded to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-52228475\">chief constable of Northamptonshire</a> for threatening that his coppers would check shopping trolleys for \u201cnon-essential\u201d items. A recalcitrant minority of the public are behaving stupidly. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. There is both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/11/test-of-resolve-britons-warned-to-stay-at-home-as-temperatures-set-to-hit-26c\">extensive compliance</a> with and wide support for the lockdown.</p> <p>The initial anxiety within Number 10 that the citizenry would rapidly become rebellious has not been justified. I detect a tentative confidence among ministers and their scientific advisers that the lockdown is having the desired effect of preventing the outcome that petrified them most. The fear three weeks ago was that the NHS would be engulfed by many more cases than it could possibly handle, leading to huge numbers of avoidable deaths. Public horror would have been swiftly followed by public disgust with the leaders who allowed such a catastrophe to happen, irreparably shattering the Johnson government\u2019s authority and credibility. One senior Tory remarked to me at the end of last week: \u201cI take a big gulp before I say this because I know I am tempting fate, but the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/07/how-to-build-a-hospital-in-nine-days-emergency-architecture-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-outbreak\">London Nightingale</a> is not full at the moment is grounds for optimism.\u201d</p> <p>The other side of the coin is the terrible cost being inflicted on businesses and jobs by imposing a hard stop on the economy. Ministers knew it would be dreadful, but didn\u2019t anticipate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">just how atrocious</a>. The Treasury is now expecting a whopping 9m applications for the job retention scheme that subsidises the wages of furloughed employees, three times the number budgeted for when Rishi Sunak launched his emergency measures. So we have indications that the most diabolical scenarios for deaths may be avoided while the economic penalties are becoming increasingly stark and that combination is reshaping the politics of the crisis. There are rising demands from the headline-hungry media, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/labour-will-keep-you-safe-says-new-shadow-home-secretary\">an attention-seeking opposition</a> and stricken businesses for the government to start outlining an exit strategy.</p> <p>Ministers are hugely reluctant to do this for two main reasons. One is their anxiety that any talk about an exit from lockdown will dilute the \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d messaging. The other reason ministers don\u2019t want to talk about an exit strategy is that they don\u2019t have an agreed one. As a figure at the heart of decision-making puts it: \u201cThere is no get-out-of-jail-free card from this crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The most assured way back to normality is mass vaccination, but it is generally thought that a vaccine is a year to 18 months away. The assumption in government is that you can\u2019t keep a modern economy in an induced coma for that long and expect to have many businesses and jobs still breathing by the end of it. Absent a vaccine, all sorts of notions for a phased easing of the lockdown are floating around Whitehall. Many of them shrivel under scrutiny. One suggestion is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">partial relaxation based on age</a>, so that twentysomethings could return to work. There would be problems with policing that successfully: \u201cYou don\u2019t look younger than 30 to me, sir. Show me some ID.\u201d And most enterprises do not depend on just one age group. Another notion floated is that the severity of the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/06/government-urged-consider-regional-approach-ending-uk-coronavirus/\">lockdown might be varied</a> from region to region. There are some difficulties with that. If the pubs were reopened in London, but remained shut in Manchester, how would Mancunians react to TV footage of Londoners flocking back to their boozers? \u201cThe worst of all worlds,\u201d says the city\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get a riot,\u201d remarks a former Tory cabinet minister.</p> <p>The great hope among the politicians is that science will rescue them from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-culture-war-lockdown-economy\">\u201clives versus livelihoods\u201d</a> dilemma. There was a period when the government became excited about the idea that we could find out who has had the disease by using antibody tests. That was hailed as \u201ca game-changer\u201d by Mr Johnson before he was incapacitated. Millions of kits were <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/uk-says-millions-coronavirus-test-kits-bought-china-unreliable-most-patients-1496506\">ordered from China</a> only for them to be found unreliable. There is a decent chance of eventually securing an accurate antibody test. It would be valuable to be able to tell NHS staff and other key employees that they had immunity and were safe to work. But it doesn\u2019t solve the problem with the general population. The latest guesstimate from the government\u2019s scientific advisers is that no more than 10% of us have had the virus. Even if you could identify them, this leaves 90% exposed to the risk of infection. That is not a route out of lockdown.</p> <p>When the histories of this crisis are written, it is likely that they will conclude that the colossal misjudgment initially made in Europe and America was to think this threat was similar to that from pandemic flu. Asian countries, battle-readied by earlier encounters with coronaviruses, treated the menace like Sars and Mers. South Korea has never had more than eight deaths on any one day and has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html\">achieved this feat</a> without a national lockdown. </p> <p>That is generally attributed to their comprehensive programme of community testing and contact tracing. A similar strategy may become feasible for Britain if the government can make good on <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/91/uk-science-research-and-technology-capability-and-influence-in-global-disease-outbreaks/publications/\">Matt Hancock\u2019s bravura promise</a> to get up to 100,000 tests a day. But it is no panacea. The South Korean formula requires the redeployment of vast numbers of local and central government officials and wouldn\u2019t work without near universal public trust and co-operation. </p> <p>Many in the cabinet are aghast at the crushing of the economy and the prospect of a contraction sharper than anything since the 1930s. They will seize on any apparently better news to argue for the earliest possible relief from lockdown. This faction is not being very noisy while bulletins report around a thousand UK fatalities a day. It will be when the casualty rate is on a downward trend that the put-the-economy-first lobby will start to apply serious pressure. Others in government are worried that passing the peak will be the most perilous phase of the crisis because it will be accompanied by a clamour for an end to restrictions. One senior adviser warns: \u201cTo suddenly switch from \u2018we\u2019ve got it under control\u2019 to \u2018release all measures\u2019 would be a terrible mistake.\u201d</p> <p>This won\u2019t be like the end of prohibition in America. There won\u2019t be an overnight flip from suppression to freedom to live life to the full again. What we will likely see is experimental relaxations of some restrictions. If the government gets it wrong, there will be a risk of a second wave of infections that forces them to reimpose a lockdown.</p> <p>When this crisis broke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/faced-with-coronavirus-covid-19-boris-johnston-must-stop-playing-invisible-man\">I suggested</a> that ministers would be faced with hideously difficult tradeoffs between curbing the menace to life posed by the disease and the damage wreaked by widespread bankruptcies, mass unemployment and the implications for Britain\u2019s future ability to finance public services, all of which will have effects on mortality. </p> <p>This is the sort of decision-making that prime ministers are elected to lead. When members of the cabinet wish a speedy recovery for Boris Johnson, it is not just because they want to express sympathy with a poorly boss. It is because they know that the toughest choices of this crisis have yet to be made.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>Though fans will hope and trust that a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s <em>Normal People</em> would not shy from the novel\u2019s sexual intimacies, it keeps us waiting a while \u2013 it is not until the second episode that undercover teenage lovers Connell and Marianne get under the covers for the first time. For a few seconds, it all seems to be going comically wrong, as her arms and her ponytail flail above her head, trapped in her pull-off bra. But then her face emerges, shiny with trust and desire, and the fireworks begin. \u201cI love that scene,\u201d says Daisy Edgar-Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s so awkward. For me, it is the most representative love scene I\u2019ve ever seen. Connell is so kind and giving and safe with her that it\u2019s a very healthy depiction of what first-time sex can look like.\u201d</p> <p>This might make it sound a bit PG, but as her co-star Paul Mescal quickly chips in: \u201cIt\u2019s not clinical. It\u2019s loving and romantic and sexy because you see two minds coming together.\u201d To describe the adaptation as hotly anticipated is an understatement. Rooney herself has co-scripted six of the episodes in collaboration with award-winning playwright and story editor on series two of HBO\u2019s <em>Succession</em> Alice Birch, who recalls \u201choovering up\u201d the novel in a jetlagged blur and immediately emailing her agent to say she was desperate to adapt it. \u201cI felt very emotional about those two people. I don\u2019t often have this feeling. In our industry, we can be quite quick to enjoy a book and then immediately think about how to hack it to bits for the screen.\u201d</p> <p>Birch is in good company. Practically as soon as Rooney hit the literary world with her debut novel <em>Conversations </em><em>With Friends</em> in 2017, she became a calling card for anyone who aspired to be seen as culturally attuned. Her novels were Instagrammed alongside chai lattes atop piles of on-trend books. She was name-dropped on Twitter by actors Lena Dunham and Sarah Jessica Parker, was featured in Florence + the Machine\u2019s fan book club, and was ranked high in books of the year charts by British <em>Vogue</em> and <em>O, The Oprah</em> <em>Magazine</em>. But she was also recognised as a writer\u2019s writer. \u201cIt is a long time since I cared so much about two characters on a page,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\">wrote author Anne Enright</a><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\"> in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/it-is-time-to-take-a-sharp-inhale-people-sally-rooney-s-normal-people-is-superb-1.3608184\">Irish Times</a>,</em> when <em>Normal People</em> was published a year later.</p> <p>Novelist and playwright Sebastian Barry, who took over from Enright as laureate for Irish fiction, says: \u201cThere is a uniqueness in Sally Rooney, not only in her absolutely crystal clear style, but also in her universal success. It is difficult to identify a comparable moment in Irish writing, both in its breadth and its immediacy, unless you can go back to the impact that the novel, and more particularly the film, of Roddy Doyle\u2019s <em>The Commitments</em> had in the early 1990s. There are other equally radiant careers, more conventionally spread over decades, like Anne Enright\u2019s, or Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s, but the suddenness of Sally Rooney, the almost abrupt arrival, reminds me more of a figure like Martin McDonagh in the theatre. There is a time before Sally Rooney and a time after.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p5yY0qdsWg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4p5yY0qdsWg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p5yY0qdsWg&amp;feature=emb_logo\">Watch a trailer for Normal People.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The sales figures are huge for a literary novel, with <em>Normal People</em> running through seven editions, selling nearly 500,000 copies in the UK and 76,000 in Ireland, according to industry analysts Nielsen Bookscan. Translation rights have been sold into 41 languages. No pressure, then, on Edgar-Jones and Mescal, who are well aware that they are playing two of the most coveted TV roles in the world for their peers right now.</p> <p>Marianne and Connell are a couple striving to find each other through a fog of class, social status and their own failures to communicate. Connell\u2019s mother cleans Marianne\u2019s house. At their secondary school in Sligo, he is a popular sporting hero, while she is the scratchy school swot. Their attraction is as much intellectual as it is sexual, as they learn when they rediscover each other at university in Dublin, by which time their status has reversed: in this rarefied new ambience, she is the cool beauty, while he is the bristly outsider.</p> <p>The series marks the screen debut of Mescal, the 24-year-old son of a garda and a schoolteacher from County Kildare, who made his first professional appearance as an earlier charismatic outsider, Jay Gatsby, at Dublin\u2019s Gate theatre. He was appearing at another Dublin theatre, the Abbey, when he heard <em>Normal People</em> was being cast. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those parts that you know quickly will be big.

She overheard a friend auditioning for the part at her kitchen table. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018Hmm, that sounds good.\u2019 Then I got the book and I just fell in love with it.

They have clearly become good friends. \u201cWhen Daisy walked into the room for the chemistry read, I immediately thought: \u2018That\u2019s who I imagined Marianne to look like,\u201d says Mescal.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Paul and thought: \u2018I know everything about you!\u2019 Which is stupid, because he\u2019s not Connell,\u201d adds Edgar-Jones.</p> <p>The fact that this instant recognition was the product of such a painstaking selection process seems entirely in keeping with the Rooney project: for all that her novels have been hailed as an emanation of the zeitgeist, they are also steeped in classic protocols. \u201c<em>Normal People</em> has the engine of a 19th-century novel,\u201d wrote Enright. \u201cThere is an encompassing sense of authority in the voice that makes it more terrible when the characters\u2019 lives start to slip away from them\u2026 Rooney is completely in control.\u201d There\u2019s a streak of DH Lawrence in the interraction of hunky sports jock Connell and poor little rich girl Marianne, just as there\u2019s a daub of Doris Lessing\u2019s <em>The Golden Notebook</em> in their determination to find their own political and erotic space (though true to Rooney\u2019s adversarial intelligence as a former debating champion, it\u2019s Connell who precociously name-drops the novel, rather than Marianne).</p> <p>The drama unfolds over four years \u2013 sweeping the lovers from school through university to the brink of their adult lives. One might have expected it to be adapted into a lush feature film, but instead it arrives in 12 half-hour TV episodes. The Oscar-nominated Irish film-maker Lenny Abrahamson, who co-directs the series, continues the story. \u201cIt used to be that only sitcoms were half an hour and if you wanted to tell a dramatic story, it had to be an hour. But we really liked the idea of short episodes, because it allows you to be single-focused,\u201d he explains, citing that first climactic sex scene: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had that density of focus over an hour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25c12230f8a8281a23318e453b6991b1d646cc4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c12230f8a8281a23318e453b6991b1d646cc4b/0_32_6000_3602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daisy Edgar-Jones as Marianne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enda Bowe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I hear the phrase \u2018sex scene\u2019, I think about a dialogue scene,\u201d Rooney told one interviewer. \u201cWhat do these characters want to say to each other? I won\u2019t just write a scene where two characters say words to each other randomly. Similarly, sex scenes have to actually play some dramatic role.\u201d <em>Irish Times</em> columnist and author Fintan O\u2019Toole picks up her point, saying: \u201cActually she reminds me of Chekhov in the acute, subtle and nonjudgmental way she calibrates human desires and foibles and self-delusions. She\u2019s not solipsistic \u2013 big things are going on underneath the intimacies: social class, money, gender, power. I think she\u2019s hit a nerve right now because we\u2019re in a moment when there\u2019s a heightened awareness that desire and sex cannot be extricated from all of these things. She\u2019s creating love stories for a post-romantic age.\u201d</p> <p>But the representation of those love stories is inevitably different in a novel, which deals in words, and on film, where articulacy lies in the manipulation of the human body. \u201cThe sex was a big challenge and we took it really seriously from the beginning,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cWhat we would aim to show, but also literally how we would do the sex in a way that was positive, safe and healthy for everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera.\u201d</p> <p>Not least of the challenges was the issue of asymmetry \u2013 of both gender and status \u2013 which has cast such a shadow over the media world in the era of #MeToo. The theatre, film and TV director Hettie Macdonald is responsible for six of the episodes. \u201cI wanted to make it a more gender-balanced crew right from the start,\u201d says Abrahamson. \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that crews are very male-dominated, especially in the camera department, and I\u2019m beginning to see that there\u2019s less and less reason for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the biggest thing for me,\u201dhe adds. \u201cI\u2019m in my 50s and as far as the young actors are concerned, I\u2019m successful. My worry would be \u2013 because I\u2019m squeamish about ever doing anything uncomfortable for them \u2013 that they would feel under pressure to do what I wanted, and my fear of that would stop me from asking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e138133738e7b331c28167406eff21811e585a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e138133738e7b331c28167406eff21811e585a65/0_52_769_461/500..jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes on the shoot.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Behind the scenes on the shoot, with Lenny Abrahamson second from left and cinematographer Suzie Lavelle second from right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The breakthrough was the decision to hire the services of \u201cintimacy co-ordinator\u201d Ita O\u2019Brien. \u201cI was anxious to start with because I thought the most subtle and important moments would be between me and the actors,\u201d admits Abrahamson. \u201cBut what\u2019s brilliant is that she would come in and talk to the whole crew and production about simple things like not using euphemisms, about getting explicit consent every time you\u2019re about to do something and finding a language to talk about lovemaking, and the shapes and moods of it, that is empowering for the people involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the go-to,\u201d agrees Mescal. \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cThe sex scenes were a joy to us because it was her job to worry about how it would work and we just turned up, did the choreography and carried on. We just had to think about the emotional beats.\u201d</p> <p>For Edgar-Jones, this sensitivity extends importantly to the use of nudity. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really happy with is that there\u2019s an equal representation of both our bodies. Paul is equally exposed. When we\u2019re in a scene and topless, it\u2019s different for Paul than it is for me, so that it\u2019s nice that there are shots where we are both fully nude! It means that there\u2019s more of a balance, gender-wise.\u201d One of the puzzling features of the intense identification of readers with Connell and Marianne is that they inhabit a pretty rarefied cultural niche, with its own intellectual and political snobberies. They discuss critical theory and <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> and despise fellow students who don\u2019t put in the reading. At school, Marianne turns her loneliness into an arrogant aloofness which is part of her appeal to Connell, making more popular girls seem dull and samey. Rooney herself has said she had expected the novels only to appeal to \u201cpeople who share my ideology or have a similarly jaundiced view of social systems.\u201d</p> <p>How does this aspect of the story connect with its young stars? \u201cI definitely related to Marianne at school in some ways, particularly the perception she thinks other people have of her, and playing with whether she can change that,\u201d says Edgar-Jones. \u201cI went to a very small school [the independent Mount school for girls in north London]. You grow so much as a person from 11 to 16, and by the end I felt I was fundamentally different to who I was when I began, but my friends only ever saw how I was when I was 11. When I did my first course at the National Youth Theatre at 15, suddenly, there were loads of people who were passionate about the same things, so I was able to colour in the shape I had grown into.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd0a21378b69ba54d5db9a77169507fc313b6ad7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0a21378b69ba54d5db9a77169507fc313b6ad7/0_595_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Rooney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I hear the phrase \u201csex scene\u201d, I think about a dialogue scene\u2019: Sally Rooney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Buchan/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mescal, like Connell in the film, was an academically bright Gaelic football star, who decided to veer off in an unexpected direction \u2013 in his case by taking himself off to the Lir Academy, a drama school attached to Trinity College Dublin. \u201cThat stepping out can make you feel quite naked for a while. I had no prior conception of what drama school, or a life in acting, was going to look like,\u201d he says. The university social scene is treated with a particular disdain by Rooney as a place of privileged poseurs. \u201cI was off-campus on the Conservatoire side of training, but when you venture on campus and you go to house parties, you definitely feel that degree of performance that we see at those house parties in the book. The social class performance\u2026 Sally really captures that,\u201d says Mescal.</p> <p>But in one respect the characters are quite separate from their generation. \u201cIt is funny because this has been called a millennial novel but they don\u2019t meet over a dating app,\u201d points out Edgar-Jones. \u201cThey meet in real life and they have real conversations. They don\u2019t do that much texting, they talk. That\u2019s healthy and exciting and important to show that it does still happen. We\u2019re not all chatting over Facebook Messenger, we do still have intimate, face-to-face relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Rooney herself has said she\u2019s more involved with social media than Connell and Marianne, though she abandoned her pugnacious Twitter account in 2019 with a parting line that would do Marianne proud: \u201cjust for clarity, I continue to agree with all your good opinions and disagree with your bad ones (of which I\u2019m sad to say there are many)\u201d.</p> <p>Mescal admits: \u201cMy experience of myself and my peers is that Connell and Marianne are in the minority. I do think intimacy and intimate relationships are more difficult in general because of social media and dating apps. I find that slightly depressing and scary because you\u2019re constantly aware of presenting yourself, and then your human contact with people becomes very different. I think Connell and Marianne are exemplary examples of not doing that. We shouldn\u2019t forget that sometimes the best place to meet somebody is at a bar rather than over a phone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0196b03f253d098f360d32a325933dadcb1bfbbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0196b03f253d098f360d32a325933dadcb1bfbbc/0_284_4284_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Mescal as Connell, who plays Gaelic football.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Mescal as Connell, who plays Gaelic football.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Element/Enda Bowe/PA Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings us to the question of anxiety, to which both lovers are prone. \u201cI do feel like anxiety is more prevalent among young people,\u201d admits Edgar-Jones. \u201cI feel more pressure to be living a life according to what I\u2019m exposed to, what I see on social media \u2013 a perfect, positive life. I sometimes feel stressed when I see all my friends hanging out, for example if I\u2019m self-employed and at home with nothing to do. But in a positive way, I\u2019m really grateful to social media and what it\u2019s done to exposing us to different ways of life and different views, allowing us to have bigger dialogues.\u201d</p> <p>Mescal adds: \u201cI think there\u2019s a greater financial pressure on people our age. There\u2019s a likelihood that we will be renting for the vast majority, if not all, of our life. That\u2019s just a shift in society that does lend itself a kind of\u2026 what\u2019s it called? A durability. As millennials, we have built up a durability to just take what comes and make the best of it. We\u2019ve known no different in that sense.\u201d</p> <p>The interview is taking place in London, where both actors are now based, just as social distancing is coming into force. How do they think their generation are going to cope? \u201cI think we are well-equipped \u2013 as well as one can be \u2013 to deal with something like coronavirus because we are constantly used to adapting and compensating and compromising,\u201d says Mescal. \u201cIf anything positive has come out of it for me, looking at everyone back home in Ireland, there\u2019s the opportunity for a strong sense of global community and reflecting on everything that\u2019s difficult together. That\u2019s quite uplifting, because we can become quite isolated and alienated and disenfranchised within our own communities.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that is going to bring many people together is the 12 episodes of <em>Normal People,</em> though such is the devotion to Rooney\u2019s characters that appraisal is likely to devolve to the level of: \u201cWhy does Marianne have a fringe?\u201d The actors agree. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fit everybody\u2019s idea of them. The only thing that we do have control over is emotionally interrogating them as you would any other character. But we do love Connell and Marianne.\u201d</p> <p><em>The full series of Normal People </em><em>is available on BBC Three from 26<sup> </sup>April. The US Hulu release is on 29 April</em></p>",
  "<p>Members of the Church of England are not noted for their resistance to authority. But during Holy Week, the most significant time in the Christian calendar, its leaders have faced mounting objections to its edict that all churches must close - even to their own clergy.</p> <p>Some prominent Anglicans have taken to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngelaTilby/status/1248188837051973632\">social media</a> and <a href=\"https://viamedia.news/2020/04/08/whos-caring-for-our-nations-spiritual-health/\">blogs</a> this Easter to argue that churches must remain open, and that to lock their doors is to risk people\u2019s spiritual health. Even Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London \u2013 a former nurse, and number three in the C of E\u2019s hierarchy \u2013 suggested in a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/06/vicars-told-ignore-guidelines-banning-churches-ahead-easter/\">letter to parishes</a> that vicars could live-stream services from their church buildings\u2026 before <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bishopSarahM/status/1247277875998404608\">correcting herself on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, was forced to restate the reasons for church closures in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY44A6FlhkI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Facebook video</a> last week.

  "<p>Rishi Sunak avoided calling the Bank of England last week to beg for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\" title=\"\">an extension of the Treasury\u2019s overdraft facility</a> to meet his Covid-19 spending commitments.</p> <p>The chancellor was saved that job by Andrew Bailey, the central bank\u2019s governor, who saw the red flashing signs on the side of the Treasury\u2019s headquarters from his Threadneedle Street offices almost three miles away. In a joint statement, the Treasury and the Bank said they had agreed to extend the use of the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2020/april/hmt-and-boe-announce-temporary-extension-to-ways-and-means-facility\" title=\"\">\u201cways and means\u201d facility</a> as a temporary measure during the disruption caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>At the moment the Treasury has a standing facility of \u00a3400m that can be drawn on instantly and without discussion. What the total will be in a year\u2019s time is not known, but analysts who have attempted to estimate the UK\u2019s likely spending shortfall have settled on \u00a3200bn, give or take \u00a350bn.</p> <p>Bailey has strenuously denied that the central bank is now the Treasury\u2019s slave after adding the overdraft facility to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/bank-of-englands-qe-programme-is-bigger-than-the-city-expected\" title=\"\">a \u00a3200bn quantitative easing boost announced last month</a>, insisting that temporary means temporary. He is certainly right to say that there is a precedent for the Bank providing instant cash. Back in 2008 it extended almost \u00a320bn to the then Labour chancellor, Alistair Darling, via the ways and means facility as he battled to save the financial services industry from going bust.</p> <p>An extra \u00a3200bn of debts \u2013 no matter how they are apportioned by the Bank \u2013 would frighten most people, and there are some officials in the Treasury who are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the UK\u2019s expected 2020 borrowing. Sunak, though, is understood to be reconciled to running up the largest debt mountain in peacetime.</p> <p>Yet Bailey and Sunak cannot argue that such a large debt can in any way be considered temporary. Whether the loan sits inside the ways and means facility or is more obviously added to the Bank\u2019s quantitative-easing lending scheme, which has accumulated \u00a3435bn of government debt, it will be too large to pay down in a matter of months, years, or even decades.</p> <p>In 2005 the national debt stood at \u00a3500bn. By 2010 it was \u00a31 trillion and it now stands at just over \u00a31.8tn. The economy has grown in that time, but not by much. From a debt-to-GDP ratio in 2005 below 40%, the ratio is now around 86%.</p> <p>So the question must then be: does the UK face another long period of austerity, as it did after the first and second world wars and following the 2008 financial crisis, or does something else happen to the loans made by the Bank of England, and government debt more generally?</p> <p>Sunak was keen to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020\" title=\"\">point out in his March budget</a> that the ups and downs of Britain\u2019s debts have made little difference to the tumbling cost of financing them. In the year after the second world war finished, debt payments accounted for more than 14% of government spending. Last year that figure was below 4%.</p> <p>Everyone with money, it seems, wants to play safe by lending their savings to governments with a strong record of paying the interest on their debts. </p> <p>In this environment, when large numbers of investors are content with receiving interest of less than 1%, the Bank and the government can work together to finance huge debts without diverting funds from the public purse.</p> <p>Temporary debts can become permanent, and a new era of monetary financing \u2013 where the Bank prints new money for the government to spend \u2013 dawns. The sooner we admit this and plot a course of action, the better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6251ad42c4f9e3513b4f7053c2081176b671255d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6251ad42c4f9e3513b4f7053c2081176b671255d/820_871_4152_2491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Austerity is out of the question: the wealthiest must help to pay</h2> <p>The coronavirus pandemic is a humbling, once-in-a-century phenomenon that has drawn historical comparisons with societies under the siege of war. It could also be an event that triggers an economic levelling on a global scale too, just as developed nations experienced a radical reduction in inequality after the second world war.</p> <p>For now, it is a case of watching the damage being wrought. The long-term scarring to national economies is already in evidence, with more than 16 million unemployed in the US, 1.2 million applications for universal credit in the UK and Germany widely forecast to be entering a deep recession.</p> <p>But then will come the healing. The repairs to developed economies, which are already building up ballooning deficits, will be costly. Trillions of dollars will have been spent by governments on furlough schemes, emergency lending programmes and extra health funding. The bill will have to be met.</p> <p>The options to pay for this will fall between well-drawn policy lines: austerity, or higher taxes. The political calculus in many countries \u2013 the UK included \u2013 will probably be that more austerity is unsustainable because no electorate will tolerate it. Which leaves the spotlight on taxes \u2013 and the rich.</p> <p>The reaction of the world\u2019s most notable billionaires has so far been commendable: $100m from the world\u2019s richest man, Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, to American food banks; $1bn from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey towards battling the pandemic; and $100m from Bill and Melinda Gates towards vaccines.</p> <p>The world\u2019s 2,153 billionaires hold <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/worlds-billionaires-have-more-wealth-46-billion-people\" title=\"\">more wealth than 4.6 billion of their fellows on Earth</a>, according to Oxfam. If that imbalance seemed intolerable before, it cannot be borne now. With a global economy on its knees, meaningful redistribution is going to be on the agenda.</p> <h2>Corporate Britain now showing No 10 why businesses matter</h2> <p>When the coronavirus crisis finally abates, will any prime-ministerial hopeful ever again utter the phrase \u201cFuck business\u201d?</p> <p>Those were the words that Boris Johnson allegedly used in 2018 as a retort to the alarm among business leaders about how the Brexit process was unfolding. Johnson\u2019s government subsequently showed that it would not rush to the aid of companies in distress, letting the likes of Thomas Cook and Flybe go to the wall.</p> <p>Now, though, the business community is helping to keep the country on its feet through unprecedented turmoil. Of course there are exceptions \u2013 firms that have dragged their feet protecting staff, or banks proving slow to lend to those in need. But for the most part, UK plc has shown its best side.</p> <p>Manufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce are deploying their collective power to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/ventilator-crisis-lands-britains-manufacturers-with-greatest-test\" title=\"\">churn out medical ventilators</a>; they would have made greater progress by now if the government had not been slow to give the order. Fashion firms including Burberry are making protective gear for the NHS amid severe shortages. Restaurants such as Leon and Honest Burger are dishing out free meals to NHS staff. Chemicals firm Ineos may not be everyone\u2019s idea of a cuddly corporate, but it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/uk-chemicals-firm-plans-to-build-two-hand-sanitiser-factories-in-10-days\" title=\"\">built factories to manufacture hand sanitiser</a>. The supermarkets are keeping the nation fed.</p> <p>Of course, business is simultaneously being helped by the government in ways always previously thought impossible \u2013 with tax holidays, grants, the picking-up of staff wages and myriad other offers. The fact that some initiatives are working too slowly is largely down to the speed with which they were developed.</p> <p>Politicians, of course, must never shy away from taking on corporate interests. But when all of this is over, the government may want to reassess its side of the social contract with business.</p>",
  "<p>It was always going to get worse before it got better. But three weeks after Britain went into lockdown, the official death toll, certainly an underestimate, is unbearably bleak: the daily toll is nudging a thousand; total deaths stand at almost 10,000. That is 10,000 people who have had their lives cut short; 10,000 people who have left behind grieving partners, parents, siblings, children, most of whom would not have even been able to be there with them when they died. The scale of it is hard to comprehend.</p> <p>There are early signs that three weeks of stringent social distancing measures may be starting to slow the growth in infection rates, a testament to the fact that the vast majority of the public have done as they were asked. Thanks to the superhuman efforts of frontline medical staff and a concerted push to expand critical care capacity, the NHS has not been overwhelmed to the point where the critically ill are being turned away from intensive care.</p> <p>But the death toll at this point is surely higher than it needed to be. Why, when we had longer to prepare than countries such as Spain and Italy, are our daily tolls higher than the figures at what looks to be their peak \u2013 even though we are still thought to be at least two weeks away from ours? Why was the government so slow to introduce the social distancing restrictions that we know save lives and to procure ventilators and testing capacity? Why are so many frontline staff in hospitals and care settings working without the personal protective equipment they need, putting themselves, their families and the health service at unnecessary risk?</p> <p>There is a disconcerting juxtaposition in the rising death toll and the blazing bank holiday sunshine, in the relief that the prime minister is recovering well and the briefing by government sources that the public has, to the detriment of the economy, followed social distancing rules more closely than expected. There are clearly those in government \u2013 who should know better \u2013 who believe that the benefit of the lives that will be saved by the social distancing of the past three weeks will be outweighed by the economic and health impacts of the lockdown and are making their views known anonymously, without sharing any of the evidence or modelling on which they are based, so that they can be critically assessed.</p> <p>It is hard to overstate just how feckless this is. The World Health Organization rightly warned last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/trump-pushes-to-reopen-coronavirus-hit-us-economy-as-approval-ratings-fall\">a premature lifting</a> of restrictions risks a deadly resurgence of coronavirus cases. For government sources to suggest that the public has, if anything, followed the rules too closely, undermines critical government messaging at a time of national crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an interconnected world, any successful exit strategy will be global, not national</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There must, however, be an open debate about the government\u2019s plans for eventually loosening the lockdown. There are no easy answers - countries around the world are struggling with this question. The ultimate lockdown exit strategy is obviously the mass production of a vaccine, but that is thought to be at least 12 to 18 months away. Until then, there are two reliable routes to reducing the need for social distancing: investing in the discovery of new treatments that could reduce the risk of hospital admissions, and developing a robust system of widespread testing and contact tracing \u2013 along the lines of what the South Korean government has implemented \u2013 that could halt the spread of future outbreaks once we are past the peak of this one.</p> <p>Testing is critical, yet, like so much of the government\u2019s pandemic response, the approach to testing has been far too mixed and hampered by a lack of urgency. There is a lack of detail about exactly how the government intends to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/a-glimmer-of-hope-but-little-detail-experts-react-to-hancocks-test-plan\">its target</a> of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month \u2013 already reduced from a 250,000 a day pledge \u2013 and it looks to be at risk after a bulk order of antibody tests has been found to be <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/04/government-s-game-changer-antibody-tests-are-inaccurate-what-next\">ineffective</a>.</p> <p>The government deserves credit for pledging \u00a3510m towards international efforts to develop a vaccine, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/26/uk-worlds-biggest-coronavirus-vaccine-donor-210000000-pledge-12461332/\">one of the larger pledges</a> from countries around the world. But there still remains an $8bn (\u00a36.25bn) <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/coronavirus-covid-19\">funding gap </a>for vaccine development and production and the development and testing of effective treatments. Moreover, there is a real risk that a lack of global leadership means that the co-ordination needed to ensure equitable access to a vaccine does not happen. That could result in second and third waves of the virus bouncing back to countries that thought they had contained it. In an interconnected world, any successful exit strategy will be global, not national.</p> <p>The lockdown inevitably comes at huge economic cost and will have an effect on the nation\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing. But this can be minimised. In the moment of crisis, the government has broadly responded in the right way: an eye-wateringly large economic rescue package and targeted support for at-risk groups such as vulnerable children and domestic violence victims that must be further extended. But just as big a test is how it will act in the future. Will it take a similar approach to that of Conservative governments over the past decade: paying down the debt by cutting back vital public services and support for low-income families, while delivering expensive tax cuts for affluent individuals and highly profitable businesses? That will cost lives too, but those lives lost will be the result of a political choice, not an inevitability. They must not be used to make the case for relaxing social distancing at the cost of countless lives in the here and now.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope: social distancing is working and the public remains supportive. But this support cannot cast away the shadows of these dark times. Thousands of families are mourning the loss of loved ones this Easter weekend; thousands more will do so in the weeks to come. In time, there will be scope to reduce the costly restrictions on our everyday lives, but for now, it remains as important as ever to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.</p>",

Most still don\u2019t have access to gloves, masks or hand sanitizer. They don\u2019t get paid sick leave, not even at stores where employees have contracted the virus.</p> <p>Musk initially dismissed sheltering as \u201cdumb\u201d and defied a sheriff\u2019s order to shelter-in-place by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/19/elon-musk-coronavirus-tesla-factory-california\">keeping open Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, California</a>, telling employees the factory was an \u201cessential\u201d business.</p> <p>The third way conspicuous philanthropy is self-serving is by suggesting that government shouldn\u2019t demand more from the super-rich, even in a national emergency. As Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal editorial page put it, if we had a wealth tax like Elizabeth Warren proposed, \u201cit\u2019s unlikely [Bill Gates] would have the capacity to act this boldly.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s absurd. Warren\u2019s tax would have cost Gates about $6bn a year, roughly his annual income from <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/bill-gates-net-worth-wealth-since-microsoft-cascade-investment-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-1481482\">his $100bn</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why should we believe that Gates or any other billionaire\u2019s 'boldness' necessarily reflects society\u2019s values and needs?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Besides, all the billionaire charity combined is a tiny fraction of the trillions the government has already spent on the coronavirus crisis. How does the Journal<em> </em>believe we\u2019re going to pay down this added national debt if the wealthiest among us don\u2019t pay more taxes? Even when this nightmare is over, most Americans will be hard pressed.</p> <p>And why should we believe that Gates or any other billionaire\u2019s \u201cboldness\u201d necessarily reflects society\u2019s values and needs? Oligarchies aren\u2019t the same as democracies.</p> <p>The worst fear of the billionaire class is that the government\u2019s response to the pandemic will lead to a permanently larger social safety net.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the virus is conquered \u2013 and it will be \u2013 the biggest risk will be the political campaign to expand government control over far more of American economic life,\u201d warns Murdoch\u2019s Journal<em>.</em></p> <p>After all, the Great Depression of the 1930s spawned social security and the minimum wage, as well as a widespread conviction that government should guarantee a minimum standard of living. The second world war yielded the GI Bill and then the National Defense Education Act, enshrining the government\u2019s role as a financier of higher education.</p> <p>Even programs that don\u2019t enjoy wide popularity when first introduced, such as the Affordable Care Act, enlarge the nation\u2019s sense of what is reasonable for the government to do for its citizens. The ACA lives on, more popular than ever, notwithstanding the GOP\u2019s determination to repeal it and Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine it.</p> <p>As the pandemic challenges the security and safety of all Americans, some conservative politicians are proposing things that would have been unthinkable \u2013 certainly unspeakable \u2013 only months ago.</p> <p>The Missouri Republican senator Josh Hawley is calling for the federal government to \u201ccover 80% of wages for workers at any US business, up to the national median wage\u201d until the crisis is over.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers will benefit from the steady paycheck and the knowledge their jobs are safe,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Indeed. Hawley\u2019s logic would as easily justify national paid sick leave and universal basic income, permanently.</p> <p>If the pandemic has revealed anything, it\u2019s that America\u2019s current social safety net and healthcare system does not protect the majority of Americans in a national emergency. We are the outlier among the world\u2019s advanced nations in subjecting our citizens to perpetual insecurity.</p> <p>We are also the outlier in possessing a billionaire class that, in controlling much of our politics, has kept such proposals off the public agenda.</p> <p>At least until now.</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Capitalism-Many-Not-Few/dp/0345806220\">Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052552049X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\">The Common Good</a>.

  "<p>For a while when the coronavirus first hit Australia, the main concern was apparently for professional sport. Footy might die, was the summation from the suits in charge. Footy could mean any code, take your pick. In a country shut down, the empty streets meant empty grandstands, empty changerooms, empty training fields. Any game that ceased its frantic treadmill would cease to exist. Forget planning for the other side of the crisis, there was no other side to reach.</p> <p>It\u2019s April now and in the south the weather has started to turn, interspersing an hour of sun on yellow maple leaves or early wattle blossom with the first cold fronts lashing the Victorian coast. My mind and my year should be turning to football, deep enough into the season to start worrying about an early trend, a half-back\u2019s ankle, a road trip coming up.</p> <p>I\u2019m not thinking about it at all, though. Except for this moment of thinking about what I\u2019m not thinking about. I\u2019m thinking about friends cooped up and going mad, about creative fervour, about depressive dead ends, about the chasm between safe and unsafe shelter, about using the internet to make a sparse few people smile. I\u2019m thinking about loving New York City, and about how it\u2019s a ghost town now in every sense. I\u2019m thinking about the cigarettes and plazas of Spain and Italy, and what came of them. I\u2019m thinking about the placid blank of China\u2019s information firewall, and the futility of reporting numbers from India when millions of its residents don\u2019t have their existence acknowledged at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-shutdown-has-left-a-hollowness-in-the-life-of-this-afl-fan\">Coronavirus shutdown has left a hollowness in the life of this AFL fan | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those not facing eviction or infection, with enough space that isolation isn\u2019t a prison, the quietness has its good side. There\u2019s no anxiety about whether three wins in a row means my team is bound to crash, or three losses in a row means we\u2019re so behind we can\u2019t get back. If footy were here we would be saturated with it, life and death on the talkback line, breathless punditry about the Doggies\u2019 defence and which Instagram post was disrespectful and which coach would be first sacked, before debating some attention-seeking deadshittery from a former player whose new job description is to be an attention-seeking deadshit. I don\u2019t look out my window at the sun on the foliage and think that my world is missing football. I look out the window and feel still.</p> <p>Perhaps more of us than expected aren\u2019t missing it that much. Perhaps football is habit, ceaselessly reinforced by those whose lives are devoted to pushing it. A mate in Ballarat messaged me while contemplating its main oval. \u201cThe amount of man hours that go into it is astonishing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHuge amounts of money and fertiliser. Endless gazing and discussion.\u201d He wondered what custodians across the world would do with a long-term chance to tend their battered turf.

Not just those whose jobs are gone, those for whom sport forms a more central part of their life or sense of self. But the pro leagues that demand all the attention are not the major loss. All social sport is cancelled, every clubhouse empty, every ledger heading closer to oblivion. Losing this hurts more: all the people for whom their local club is one of the points that life coheres around, whether as players or members. Their chance to see friendly faces, swap stories, be part of something that is at once safely familiar but sufficiently bigger than themselves.</p> <p>If this loss were to continue through the Australian winter, into the next spring, the sense of sadness would grow alongside. All the in-built brick barbecues abandoned as the weather swings upward, the grounds trod fleetingly by a few runners for their police-approved daily exercise. The small cricket clubs toppling after the footy clubs.</p> <p>Whatever happens on the far side, professional sport can\u2019t come back pretending it\u2019s as important as when it left. We\u2019ve seen a world without it. Premier League clubs that have sacked their staff and taken public money can\u2019t throw around transfer bonuses when the grift-mill starts again. Clubs in a global recession can\u2019t pay a defensive midfielder \u00a3300,000 a week. Australian codes can\u2019t pretend that the season is sacrosanct, that the One Day in September or the opening round or the State of Origin may not be trifled with. Nature doesn\u2019t give a fuck about Wally Lewis.</p> <p>To be clear, though, when the administrators say that their sport might die, they really mean their administrations might die. That\u2019s their worry. When you look around the sporting landscape, you wonder if that would be such a bad thing after all. Most of the organisations right now are exactly as they were.

His office said he was improving and was back on his feet although his recovery was still at an early stage. <br><br>Britain imposed a lockdown three weeks ago in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and the government has come under increasing pressure to detail how long the strict measures on movements would last, with people forced to stay at home and many businesses unable to operate. <br><br>Ministers have said Britain needed to pass the peak of the outbreak before changes could be made, and Hancock said although the number of hospital admissions had started to flatten out, there was not enough evidence yet to have confidence they were past the worst. <br><br>\u201cOur judgement is we\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we\u2019ve reached the peak,\u201d he told BBC radio. <br><br>Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Hancock said \u201cnobody knows\u201d when it would be. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of suggestions. Their job is to make their best estimate and advise us and we have a whole load of different pieces of advice from different scientists,\u201d he said. <br><br>The death rate is also expected to increase over the next few days, health officials have cautioned, but they say they are hopeful that the lockdown will mean that the overall number of deaths will be below 20,000. <br><br>Initially Johnson took a more modest response to the outbreak than other European leaders but changed tack when projections suggested a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. <br><br>The government has come under fire for its initial response and a lack of preparedness, and there was criticism on Saturday from doctors and nurses who said they were having to treat patients without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. <br><br>Among those to have died after testing positive for COVID-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e917c4b8f08db3109f20a5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T08:15:35.026Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello all.
