For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around 10 days later.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days.

It is something of cliche to suggest sportspeople of his level are out of touch with reality and, in Stenson\u2019s case, completely unfair.

Anyone who lives paycheque to paycheque is going to feel this. Everyone will to a degree but it feels corny if I am going to complain when people are losing their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cThey say you might have no or very mild symptoms but who wants to roll the dice on that? I\u2019ve had normal flu three times and felt like garbage by a multiple of 10. Once was before the 2014 Masters, I was in bed for nine days with a high fever. On a hot first day at Augusta, I almost fell into Rae\u2019s Creek walking off the 13th green. My caddie had to steer me by the arm towards the tee. Another time I was in an emergency room, convinced I was going to die. If you can feel even worse from this, it won\u2019t be a fun ride at all. People are in grave danger.

  "<p>\u201cThere are no words,\u201d says Kely Nascimento-DeLuca, the eldest daughter of Pel\u00e9, when I ask about her journey from women\u2019s football novice to documentary maker on the subject. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very into football.

Hundreds of thousands of people bought it, but you cannot fathom a cheeky slogan you could make up to get people to go and watch this movie, which is really not just about sport but is about passion?\u2019 It\u2019s people\u2019s stories. It\u2019s women\u2019s stories \u2013 which is problematic because people aren\u2019t used to that. My favourite stories in the world are about women, but they are men\u2019s stories about women.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve had a profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pel\u00e9 in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are some huge names in the film. US women\u2019s national team players past and present such as Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach, tennis and equality hero Billie Jean King, England\u2019s Nikita Parris, as well as the Brazil superstars Marta, Formiga and Neymar are all interviewed. But at thedocumentary\u2019s heart, is the story of the Brazilian Lais Araujo, now 24, who was spotted in a favela eight years ago by Wilson Egidio, Nascimento-DeLuca\u2019s brother-in-law and coach of Manhattan Soccer Club, a youth side based in New York.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s this girl who I just saw, Kely, we have to try and get her here,\u201d said Egidio in a text to Nascimento-DeLuca on his return to the city. \u201cThere\u2019s no future for her there, she was playing with all the boys, she\u2019s super skinny, she\u2019s 16, she was playing with no shoes on and she\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be90d14301e7f4e0caf4150c67cbddb7c7732e49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be90d14301e7f4e0caf4150c67cbddb7c7732e49/0_277_3413_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lais Araujo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lais Araujo, right, the star of Warriors of a Beautiful Game, in action for Adelaide United last season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Brake/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nascimento-DeLuca wanted to help but was also hesitant given she worked as a creative director and, her father aside, had no connection with football. But then while working on a series of T-shirts for a fledgling brand, which included tops with images of Pel\u00e9 on them, she had an idea. \u201cListen, I want to shoot this on a girl player,\u201d she pitched to the CEO of the company. \u201cI think we need to change the narrative a little and I know the girl.\u201d</p> <p>It marked the beginnings of a relationship in which Nascimento-DeLuca would grow as much as Araujo. \u201cI have four kids and a job and so our conversations were very much on the side,\u201d says Nascimento\u2011DeLuca of the early period of their contact after the t-shirt shoot. \u201cShe would send me a WhatsApp message excited because she had heard that in a month a scout from the national team would be coming to her town and she was going to work extra hard. In the two years we chatted it happened several times and they never came, ever. Those things started to lodge themselves in the back of my head.\u201d</p> <p>Then, however, Araujo\u2019s life began to change. She got to the US, invested in a good camera phone and with the help of friends made a showreel. It worked \u2013 she was soon in the orbit of the University of Florida, having impressed at junior college level, and after impressing for them she caught the eye of those in charge of selecting players for Brazil\u2019s under-20s team. By 2016, she was her country\u2019s No 10 at the U20s World Cup in Papua New Guinea, playing alongside four players who are now senior Brazil internationals.</p> <p>As Nascimento-DeLuca followed Araujo\u2019s journey, her eyes were opened to the struggles of women footballers. \u201cI thought that this was a) an amazing story and b) truly fucked up. That this girl comes from a country that literally breeds talent and had to go through this journey to get to our U20 national team.\u201d</p> <p>That led to Nascimento-DeLuca researching women\u2019s football. \u201cI was really shocked by so many things. I knew nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily shocked at the systemic sexism, because I\u2019m South American, and a woman, and alive. But I was shocked at some of the statements that were being made in 2015 by those in charge of promoting the team and sport in Brazil.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c9e27117019bddc4c40febd9280b54e448724d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c9e27117019bddc4c40febd9280b54e448724d1/0_1057_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marta being interviewed for the documentary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Kely Nascimento-DeLuca</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For someone who has grown up with a global superstar as a father, Nascimento-DeLuca\u2019s social consciousness is striking. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pel\u00e9 in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil. I was always very aware that everywhere we went nobody looked like me, and definitely not my father.</p> <p>\u201cIt was interesting because my father is the type of person who treats everyone that works for him like family. I don\u2019t mean altruistically, I mean that he doesn\u2019t know how to have staff. That sounds horrible, I don\u2019t mean to sound uppity, he just doesn\u2019t make that distinction. If you\u2019re standing there and I\u2019m eating? Sit down. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t know how to be wealthy.</p> <p>\u201cYou become very aware that if it wasn\u2019t for one magical bit of genius, your life could be completely different because of the way you look. That\u2019s huge. There were many painful things about moving to the US at that time. There was no FaceTime. It was like moving to Mars. But they put us in the United Nations school, so we weren\u2019t aliens. And they moved us to a city where no one gave a fuck. Like truly.

But it certainly helped as she sought to make her documentary. It took a year to raise the money required for Warriors of a Beautiful Game to become a reality, with the first investor being St\u00e9phane Mbia, the former Cameroon international who Nascimento-DeLuca met at a Paris Saint-Germain game.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is any time when using his name is justified and should be encouraged I think it is to do something like this. For many reasons,\u201d she says. \u201cHis [Pel\u00e9\u2019s] career \u2013 I mean, he was a genius \u2013 and his longevity is a great juxtaposition to any woman\u2019s, like Marta\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see that it\u2019s all the same emotions, it\u2019s all the same strings it pulls on. And yet one has been allowed to thrive and been allowed to reach incredible parts of society and culture and the other one hasn\u2019t to nearly the same extent.\u201d</p> <p>For Araujo, it has not been easy. She graduated in 2018 and went to Norway, then to Adelaide. Now she is back in Brazil having fallen off the radar after she prioritised her diploma over the NWSL draft and staying in the pool for the under-20s team. For Nascimento-DeLuca, the hope is that she has done her story justice.</p> <p>\u201cI feel a lot of pressure to make the women in the film proud and to tell the story that they want told. I want it to be a love letter to the sport that makes other people fall in love with it.\u201d</p> <p>And perhaps a rather obvious question \u2013 has Pel\u00e9 seen the documentary? \u201cHe\u2019s seen the teaser. He said it\u2019s good,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cBut he\u2019s always like: \u2018I\u2019ll reserve my judgment, let\u2019s see the whole thing first\u2019.\u201d</p>",

This week he will almost certainly acquire dictatorial powers.

The decision as to when the current emergency is over will be in the hands of Mr Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz MPs. A compliant parliament may eventually choose to make permanent some of the arrangements introduced in the context of a global health crisis. \u201cEmergency\u201d measures introduced in 2016 to restrict the rights of asylum seekers are still in place.</p> <p>Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic requires harsh measures which curtail individual freedoms. Mr Orb\u00e1n is not the only autocratic leader to have spotted the chance for a power grab. Azerbaijan\u2019s strongman, Ilham Aliyev, has <a href=\"https://atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/azerbaijans-strongman-senses-opportunity-in-coronavirus-pandemic/\" title=\"\">stepped</a> up the harassment of opposition groups. Israel\u2019s beleaguered PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-18/israel-coronavirus-netanyahu\" title=\"\">used an emergency decree</a> to delay the start of his trial on corruption charges, marginalised parliament and moved to enact unprecedented surveillance measures. It now seems possible that a national unity government will be formed with Mr Netanyahu\u2019s main political rival, Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party.

I haven\u2019t picked it up for years.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing the plague brought to our town was exile ... It was undoubtedly the feeling of exile \u2013 that sensation of a void within which never left us ... they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.\u201d</p> <p>We are bracing ourselves for the full force of a once-in-a-century pandemic that will hit us like a tsunami in the coming weeks. We are watching the trailer with the devastating images from hospitals in Italy and emptied streets in Madrid, London and New York. The daily death tolls on our morning social media feeds haunt us like a shadow all day.</p> <p>To keep each other safe, we are preparing to pay an unprecedented economic cost, closing entire sectors of the economy, wiping billions off our super and stocks, putting tens or even hundreds of thousands of people out of work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/albert-camus-novel-the-plague-la-peste-pestilence-fiction-coronavirus-lockdown\">Albert Camus novel The Plague leads surge of pestilence fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I\u2019m concerned that over the coming weeks we fall into the trap of kidding ourselves this <em>is</em> the crisis, that the preparations and changes to our normal routines represent the full impact of this cruel virus.</p> <p>Because this exile is not the crisis \u2013 it is the beginning of the crisis. We may have moved to higher ground, but the wave of illness and death is yet to hit. And when it comes, many of our fellow Australians will die alone or in crowded hospitals.</p> <p>As we mobilise for action on these fronts, I am concerned we are not preparing for the wave of grief that will have to be expressed alone, in ways totally foreign to our natural instinct to come together and physically embrace each other.</p> <p>How will someone mourn the passing of their parent if they can\u2019t sit with them in their final hours? How will we mark the loss of friends and colleagues when we aren\u2019t allowed the time and space to honour them? How will local communities cope when loved health workers die?</p> <p>How do we prepare for the sadness that will be thrust upon us?</p> <p>We must prepare to rediscover the art of lament.</p> <p>Lament is a one of those words that seems to have lost its meaning. Lament is not a label to put on a person or a situation \u2013 it\u2019s the communal sharing of this grief, an act of solidarity that ensures no one needs to grieve alone, despite our physical distance.</p> <p>If we are going to find a way to lament through the coming months, we need to start now by actively participating in our shared sense of exile. As Camus reminds us, it is about giving wandering shadows substance by rooting ourselves in the solid earth of our distress.</p> <p>Sharing exile can take many forms, but it starts with developing common rituals \u2013 whether it is joining in online church services or choral events freely available, lighting a candle with friends across a Zoom meeting, clapping our valiant health workers on our doorstep at 8pm each evening or singing from balconies like the Lombards.</p> <p>It\u2019s also about meditating on what we are grateful for \u2013 family, friends, a room with a view \u2013 even in quarantine we need to find meaning in our lives, to know we are seen, that our pain is validated by others and to know we are loved.</p> <p>At these times of lament, charities have always filled an important role \u2013 to organise the collective support for the one in need, anchored in a common benevolent love of humanity.</p> <p>But even here the virus challenges us. Many of our charities are facing their own crises, first in the largely older volunteer force who do the work and, inevitably, facing a reduction in the amount of money people can afford to donate to support their work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/buy-a-nurse-a-coffee-ways-australians-can-help-others-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Buy a nurse a coffee: ways Australians can help others during the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of these institutions may not survive, others will need to fundamentally rethink their delivery models, but what will remain constant is the need for the act of charity, that benevolent love of humanity, to sustain us.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the nation\u2019s major charities are coming together to create a \u201cCharities Cabinet\u201d to advise the government on ways we can deliver all our citizens the basics of a roof, a meal, a sense of human connection and a reminder that in the midst of global mayhem every individual matters. Charities exist to prioritise the needs of the vulnerable; whether they have insecure housing, or no housing. All indeed matter. Charity is the old English word for inclusive love.</p> <p>This is a moment in our shared humanity when we don\u2019t know what happens next, but I suspect that we will need more than just an economic stimulus; we will need a stimulus in civility, in community and in charity that can only be generated from within, as we lament and then renew ourselves together.</p> <p>In the words of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the 19th century maverick Australian poet and politician: \u201cLife is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone.

  "<p>\u2018Growing up,\u201d says Kayleigh Llewellyn, \u201cmy mum had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/what-is-bipolar-disorder-google\">bipolar disorder</a> type one. So quite severe. The love you have for your mother or father is so deep-seated, there\u2019s a contradiction: you love the person, but you also feel ashamed of them, because you\u2019re a teenager and you don\u2019t know any better.\u201d</p> <p>Llewellyn has poured this experience into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06myb3d\">In My Skin</a>, an emotional rollercoaster of a TV drama about Bethan, a Welsh teenager coming of age and living a double life as she negotiates mental illness, friendships and her sexuality. Bethan\u2019s mother Trina has bipolar disorder and is sectioned in a psychiatric ward. In an early episode, Trina says something so horrible to Bethan that I gasped out loud in my living room. At other times, the sympathy I feel for her has me weeping. But there are plenty of laughs along the way.</p> <p>Bethan shoulders much of the burden of her mother\u2019s illness alone, although her gran and a kindly but interfering PE teacher do try to help. She\u2019s ambitious and dreams of being a writer, while trying to survive in a hostile and homophobic school. She also desperately wants to impress popular girl Poppy, on whom she has a crush, lying about her home life even to her closest friends, portraying it as secure and middle class.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in fear that kids in my school would find out my mum was frequently being sectioned,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cI thought they would make fun of me, ostracise me \u2013 or even worse, make fun of my mum.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15e785ddacd2ce4d655c500ab90d238be34401d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e785ddacd2ce4d655c500ab90d238be34401d5/0_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I just could not afford to live any more\u2019 \u2026 Llewellyn.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I just could not afford to live any more\u2019 \u2026 Llewellyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karla Gowlett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Llewellyn initially trained as an actor and didn\u2019t start writing until she was 27. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know any actors, and I certainly didn\u2019t know any writers. I didn\u2019t know writing was a job.\u201d It was only when she started acting and realised that the words were what really drew her that she began to write.</p> <p>Another script, co-written with a friend, won the <a href=\"http://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/rocliffe\">Bafta Rocliffe New Writing</a> comedy award in 2012 and helped her secure an agent. \u201cFor once in my life I got really bloody lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cI went from not being a writer at all to having a commission for a primetime BBC One show.\u201d</p> <p>That series didn\u2019t happen in the end: Llewellyn is keen to point out that her screenwriting journey hasn\u2019t been an entirely easy one, even if she does now find herself in the writers\u2019 room for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/killing-eve\">Killing Eve</a>. \u201cAbout three years ago, I was so broke.

They paid my rent for a few months, gave me subsistence.\u201d</p> <p>In late 2017, after another failed project, Llewellyn rattled off a one-page treatment based on her childhood experiences of caring for her mother \u2013 and emailed it to several producers. \u201cWithin about an hour, I had that feeling of regret, thinking: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve exposed myself so much\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Seven out of 10 wanted to option it. Within a week, producer Nerys Evans \u2013 who is also Welsh with a working-class background \u2013 had persuaded the BBC to commission the pilot, which won two <a href=\"http://www.bafta.org/wales/awards\">Bafta Cymru awards</a> including best TV drama. The show was then greenlit for a full series.</p> <p>In My Skin was shot in Cardiff, a few streets from where Llewellyn grew up. How does it feel to see her life played out on screen? Was it necessary to keep a bit of distance? \u201cTo a degree, I did have to,\u201d she says, \u201cso that I felt free to tell a good story.\u201d She decided it would be too strange to film in her old school, and she made Bethan an only child. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/11/jo-hartley-favourite-tv\">Jo Hartley</a>, who plays Trina, and I made a choice that she would never meet my mum.

It was such a responsibility. It was about visualisation, breath work, and lots and lots of research, and I was able to use emotional recall from personal experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Hartley watched videos of people with hypomania, and had in-depth chats with Llewellyn and others who had experience of bipolar disorder. On set, she was isolated from most of the cast and crew and didn\u2019t wash her hair, staying in character for the duration. \u201cWe came up with a scale of one to five,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cBipolar has stages\u2013 you\u2019re not just hypomanic all time. So Jo could be given <em>this</em> number for the level of her mania. And then we had an amazing doctor based in Cardiff who specialises in bipolar patients, who read all of our scripts and gave advice.\u201d</p> <p>Llewellyn\u2019s sister also read all the scripts and gave her blessing, but her mother was very ill when they were shooting the pilot, and did not watch it until two weeks after it was first shown on BBC Three. \u201cShe was in Wales and I was in London and I was on the edge of my seat feeling sick waiting for the phone to ring. Eventually she called and said, \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Was there a temptation to dial down some of the more shocking things Trina says, to give a more sympathetic portrayal? Llewellyn says not. \u201cI want people to have the takeaway that Trina is a kind woman and a good mother who\u2019s very ill. I hope I struck that balance. But to give an accurate representation of what it is to care for someone who\u2019s mentally ill, you have to show it warts and all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We wanted to recreate the Wales we knew: you can be on a grotty street, but the vista around you is beautiful hills</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe all know there is something we can each say to our mother, our sister, our partner, that would cripple them, but of course you love them, you don\u2019t want to hurt them.

It works in that those non-emergency cases and routine things can be done. If necessary we could use different parts of the stadium as well to do different activities. There are four separate stands and all of those can be used in one form or another. It is easy to think football is just a game but it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s part of people\u2019s lives, routines and it\u2019s important from a social aspect.

  "<p>Aberdeen is one of the few cities in the world where your taxi driver is almost guaranteed to know the global market price for oil.</p> <p>It is the second week of March in the capital of the North Sea oil and gas industry and Aberdonians have witnessed one of the sharpest oil price slumps in a generation. The Granite City is still one week away from a market collapse even deeper than the 2016 price crash.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a real worry so soon after the last downturn,\u201d one taxi driver says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long for people to lose their jobs if the oil price is under $35 [\u00a328] a barrel. Within three or four months of low oil prices contract workers can be out of work. It\u2019s always quicker than you\u2019d think.\u201d</p> <p>A week later oil is trading at about $25 a barrel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/saudi-arabia-price-war-wipes-billions-from-value-of-major-oil-firms-royal-dutch-shell-bp\">wiping billions from the market value of UK oil companies</a>, and an industry report warns that the North Sea oil and gas industry is in a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d position. Oil companies are expected to axe their spending plans to weather the latest market rout, which threatens to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/19/north-sea-oil-gas-prices-plunge-market-collapse-uk-economic-crisis\">halve the revenue from the barrels of oil they produce this year</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDuring the last oil price crash Aberdeen was not ready at all,\u201d says one North Sea veteran. \u201cThe city itself completely changed within the space of a few months. Around 150,000 people in the UK lost their jobs, and Aberdeen bore the brunt.\u201d</p> <p>He asks not to be named because after more than 20 years working in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies\">the North Sea oil and gas industry</a> he is struggling to find work. In recent days a verbal job offer from one North Sea firm was rescinded and an interview with another cancelled. Employers have brought in hiring freezes across the city and recruiters have scrapped their meeting schedules for the next few weeks.</p> <p>This disquiet is still fresh in the city\u2019s collective memory. The last oil market downturn was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/oil-prices-crash-to-11-year-low\">deeper and longer than any oil market rout in history</a>, lasting from late 2014 to its nadir at $28 a barrel in the first weeks of 2016. It was punctuated by about 150 North Sea job losses a day and a string of bankruptcies. At its depths property prices in Aberdeen plummeted and mortgage arrears spiralled to double the national level.</p> <p>\u201cThe last downturn was a tough one for the city,\u201d says Derek Leith, a senior partner at EY\u2019s Aberdeen office. \u201cBut what it meant was that Aberdeen began to think very seriously about the fact that eventually the era of oil and gas will come to an end and the city needs to be famous for doing something else.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of effort to change the trajectory to make Aberdeen a centre for energy, rather than of oil and gas. The idea is to use the city\u2019s existing skills and pivot towards renewables and other clean energy sources,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-29T13:47:32/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Brent crude graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-29T13:47:32/embed.html\">Brent crude graph</a> </figure>  <p>As the UK moves towards a net-zero carbon future many have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/26/oil-regulator-to-revise-remit-to-address-climate-crisis\">questioned whether there can still be a place for the UK\u2019s ageing oil industry</a>. Now, a green future might be Aberdeen\u2019s best bet for a long-term future.</p> <p>\u201cIf you were to ask a dyed-in-the-wool Aberdonian who has worked in the oil industry for the last 20, 30 years whether they are interested in climate action they would probably only go along with it as long as it didn\u2019t impact their livelihoods,\u201d the North Sea veteran says. \u201cThese same people are realising that renewables might just save them.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Ian Wood is one such convert. During the North Sea\u2019s boom years in the 1970s and 80s the billionaire oil tycoon used the UK\u2019s lead in offshore oil and gas to transform his modest family firm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/woodgroupjohn\">Wood Group</a>, into one of the world\u2019s largest oil engineering companies. Today, he believes the city that ignited the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels believes it may hold the answer to tackling its consequences.</p> <p>Wood set up Opportunity North East as oil prices tumbled in 2015. His threefold plan to rebalance the region\u2019s economy recasts the offshore heritage and engineering legacy of the north-east of Scotland as a vital advantage in building a greener economy.</p> <p>First, accelerate the offshore wind boom, including a new generation of floating wind farms. Next, use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/offshore-windfarms-can-provide-more-electricity-than-the-world-needs\">this abundant clean energy</a> to siphon off the carbon from hydrocarbon gas, in a process known as steam methane reforming, to produce clean-burning hydrogen for transport fuels and industry. Finally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/20/north-sea-oilfields-could-help-contain-climate-change-says-report\">store the leftover carbon \u201cwaste\u201d from this process beneath the seabed</a> to prevent it contributing to rising global temperatures.</p> <p>\u201cThis all sounds very glib,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIt will take, in my opinion, 10 to 15 years to get this right. Once we have it, we will be able to sequester quite a lot of carbon emissions.\u201d</p> <p>Getting it right would also secure a route to market for North Sea gas and a place for Aberdeen at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/21/is-hydrogen-the-solution-to-net-zero-home-heating\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/21/is-hydrogen-the-solution-to-net-zero-home-heating\">centre of the UK\u2019s hydrogen economy</a>. The city has already taken steps to lay claim to a green future, including the establishment of the Net Zero Solution Centre, a hub of green tech innovation within the Oil and Gas Technology Centre (OGTC), which could one day export low-carbon energy solutions globally.</p> <p>Colette Cohen, the chief executive of the OGTC, says leading oil companies are beginning to take meaningful steps towards complying with the UK\u2019s legally binding climate targets, but the oil price collapse has raised doubts.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were first set up three years ago the industry was still struggling against the last oil market downturn,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were talking about what their carbon footprint would look like in the next decade, companies were saying: \u2018I may not exist then, it\u2019s really financially challenging right now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the last year, there has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/bp-sets-net-zero-carbon-target-for-2050\">a palpable shift within the industry</a>, she says, but the latest market crash \u201chas to be a concern\u201d for future green investments. \u201cEverything around net zero costs money. If oil companies are backed into survival mode their ability to spend any spare cash on future-proofing their operations becomes more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Leith believes the latest crash may be enough to convince companies that investing in clean energy alternatives and \u201csurvival mode\u201d are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p>\u201cThere are always some who would prefer to batten down the hatches and hope for an upturn in oil prices so that they can go back to what they regard as normal. If anyone is still under that misconception then the last few weeks should have put that to bed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020.

  "<p><br>Thank goodness that, in this time of crisis, it is now spring. In the northern hemisphere, at least, we can say hello to green shoots, flowers, bumblebees and butterflies. Finally, the clocks have gone back to British Summer Time. We\u2019ve lost an hour of sleep, but hello, light.</p> <p>The greatest hope for the new season this year is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">better weather will start to make </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">it harder for coronavirus</a> to spread. And for those lucky enough to still have their health, spring can provide other consolations. Its strong sense of a new beginning nudges our outlook and actions in welcome ways. Katherine Milkman, a behavioural scientist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the phenomenon and found that there is more to spring cleaning than the sunlight suddenly showing up cobwebs and window smears. \u201cThe start of spring generally makes us feel more motivated \u2013 it\u2019s a so-called \u2018fresh start date\u2019,\u201d she says. As such, it makes us feel less connected to the past. \u201cThat disconnect gives us a sense that whatever we messed up on previously, we can get right now. Maybe the old you failed to quit smoking or start a lasting exercise routine, but the new you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>These moments, she says, also tend \u201cto promote bigger-picture thinking, which gets us focused on our goals\u201d. Whether facing health, financial or professional worries, newly working from home or home schooling, or being suddenly at a loss for something to do, Milkman says this effect can stretch \u201cacross all of our goal-oriented activities. We\u2019ve seen that it affects everything from decisions about exercise to retirement savings.\u201d</p> <p>Spring can also fortify us with the relief it brings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/30/sad-winter-depression-seasonal-affective-disorder\">seasonal affective disorder</a> (Sad). Even if you do not have a clinical case of it, says Hugh Selsick, chair of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep\">sleep</a> working group at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, \u201cmost people will experience some degree of lifting of mood in the summer months\u201d. Studies looking at populations in North America have illustrated this neatly, according to Selsick. \u201cThe further north you go, the worse our mood gets in the winter, because of that lack of light. For us [in the north] the payoff is that we also get these really nice bright long, spring and summer days.</p> <p>\u201cAs humans, we evolved in a tropical place, where there was a lot more light,\u201d Selsick says. This means our brains have evolved to expect a certain amount of it. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why we are so susceptible to changes in light,\u201d he says. And why the gloomier months can negatively affect sleep patterns and mood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bc064788ce5ef127c161ef8f2febc0ce808e485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc064788ce5ef127c161ef8f2febc0ce808e485/0_0_5671_3780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman looking through a window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breathe deep ... our brains have evolved to expect more light than we get in winter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: martin-dm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sad symptoms that spring might alleviate include low mood, tiredness, sleeping longer than normal and, says Selsick, cravings of carbohydrates in particular. So feel free to harness this knowledge to fuel a new effort to start exceeding your five a day.</p> <p>Now that most of us are only allowed out once a day, for exercise, the greatest gains in terms of making the most of spring light are to be had from stepping out first thing in the morning. Not only will getting up and out help avoid the crowds of joggers, but morning light is the most crucial for setting our circadian rhythms. \u201cIt\u2019s much better at synchronising our body clocks and getting us back into sync with the outside world,\u201d says Selsick.</p> <p>When it\u2019s dark, we produce melatonin, which acts as a time signal to the body, telling it we should be sleepy. \u201cThat first bit of light in the morning,\u201d says Selsick, \u201cis very effective at switching that melatonin off, which then tells the brain and the rest of the body it\u2019s now time to be awake and active.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a special set of receptors in our eyes which communicate directly with the body clock in the brain,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly sensitive to blue-green light, which on a [sunny] day like today is the colour of the sky. So that sort of bright sunlight, that outdoor light is what our brains are particularly sensitive to.\u201d Exposure to this in the morning helps us to wake up and shake off bleary-eyed grumpiness. \u201cAnd it helps to regulate our sleep. If your body knows when the day is starting, it\u2019s easier for it to also know at what time it needs to start winding down and getting ready for sleep.\u201d And of course sleeping well has the positive knock-on effect of giving you a better shot at feeling content and having good overall health.</p> <p>The big danger with being locked down, warns Selsick, is \u201callowing your whole rhythm to drift\u201d. Even if a temporary break from commuting allows you to sleep in a little, keep your waking-up time consistent to reap the benefits of the spring sunshine. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting that first dose of light at a different time every morning, your body has no idea where it is in time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially jet-lagging your body by having a different rising time every day.\u201d Setting regular meal times helps keep our daily rhythms in sync, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s essential that we make the most of opportunities to be outside, whether it\u2019s that one permitted outing, or additional gardening, or spending some time on the balcony. \u201cThe more outdoors you can get the better, without getting in close contact with people,\u201d says Selsick.</p> <p>Getting some sun can fill our heads with new ideas, too. In 2005, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01602.x\">psychologists at the University of Michigan</a> found that half an hour out in the sun boosted not only mood, but also memory and creativity. To test the latter, they assessed changes in what they call cognitive broadening \u2013 \u201ca style of thinking in which people become more creative and which is hypothesised to be an adaptive shift in cognition that leads to behavioral flexibility and exploration\u201d, write the authors.</p> <p>Late-evening light may be less likely to have an impact on circadian rhythms than morning rays, but, says Selsick, \u201cpeople do generally report a better quality of life if they have some light in the evening\u201d. Indeed. A 2016 study by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716306553\">researchers at Brigham Young University in Utah</a> looked at six years of data from more than 16,000 adults and found that seasonal increases in hours of sunshine correlated with decreased mental health distress.</p> <p>Longer days also seem to extend the amount of use we get from waking hours. When it\u2019s light in the evenings, it feels like daytime for longer. Staying up to batch cook, bake bread or, in the current climate, have beers with friends over Zoom, will seem appealing all of a sudden. \u201cLight does to some extent push sleep away a little bit,\u201d says Selsick. \u201cAnd people do often feel more alert when there\u2019s bright light.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ed444914f683c827e0bc6f5d1d9bc85b9bc0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ed444914f683c827e0bc6f5d1d9bc85b9bc0cd/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gardening time with my daddyYoung man and his son taking care of their plants on the balcony of loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Have balcony, will garden ... a spot of seasonal potting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AleksandarNakic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And of course, with spring, light and warmth comes nature.

In 2019, data from 20,000 British people crunched by researchers at the same university showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/13/two-hour-dose-nature-weekly-boosts-health-study-finds\">the more time spent enjoying nature, the greater life satisfaction reported</a>.</p> <p>This is why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/aug/26/ecotherapy-plants-treatment-depression-anxiety\">GPs have been prescribing gardening as therapy</a>. So plant some seeds and watch them grow, whether that\u2019s in a flowerbed or a window-sill or balcony pot. Get a bird feeder \u2013 ensuring it\u2019s inaccessible to squirrels, which are bird\u2019s nest predators. Dig out your binoculars and indulge in some twitching, or figure out (with some online help) which song belongs to which bird. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">Will spring slow spread of coronavirus in northern hemisphere?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The green shoots of a new chapter in our lives provide opportunities to do better, says Milkman. \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis is inaugurating a new era and shaking up our routines.

  "<p>Moles are daring to clamber above ground to hunt for worms, oystercatchers are nesting on deserted beaches, and overlooked plants such as ivy-leaved toadflax are gaining new friends.</p> <p>The shutdown of modern life as we know it is liberating British wildlife to enjoy newly depopulated landscapes.

Ever since it became an entrep\u00f4t of the British empire, Mumbai has been optimised to keep things moving \u2013 both labour and capital. Over the last fortnight, its citizens have been retreating from public premises. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/28/slum-loaded-term-homegrown-neighbourhoods-mumbai-dharavi\">majority</a> are now confined to one- or two-room tenement housing, often with dividing walls made of tin and tarpaulin. These stand cheek-by-jowl with shops, restaurants and crowded medical clinics. Isolation is for people who live in homes with attached toilets.</p> <p>The numbers aren\u2019t yet staggering. Unlike New York City, which currently accounts for nearly 10% of the world\u2019s known Covid-19 cases, <a href=\"https://howindialives.com/gram/coronadistricts/\">Mumbai counts 74</a> as of this writing. Unlike London, authorities here initiated shutdowns before India\u2019s government passed orders for a national lockdown.</p> <p>The novel coronavirus was first detected here, as elsewhere, among wealthy international travellers, but last week it made its <a href=\"https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/wily-virus-moves-into-slum-chawls/articleshow/74819907.cms\">first appearance</a> in Mumbai\u2019s informal settlements, where unchecked spread would be devastating. Under these circumstances, the extreme measure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/indias-13bn-population-locked-down-to-beat-coronavirus\">quarantining 1.3 billion people</a> may have looked like a sensible decision to stave off tragedy. Yet on the first morning after lockdown, it was immediately clear that another tragedy was already under way.</p> <p>Television news programmes showed long lines of migrant labourers leaving big cities, starting the long walk, on empty stomachs and in blistering heat, to their homes in rural India. With industry and construction at a standstill, daily wagers found themselves out of jobs, instantly unable to afford food or shelter. Without buses and trains, they were out of transport. From Mumbai, 300 workers were found <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-lockdown-300-rajasthan-workers-found-travelling-in-truck-containers-from-telangana-2201303\">stowing away</a> in stifling container trucks.

Independent India\u2019s welfare state evolved precisely in response to its depredations under empire: its core job has always been to feed the hungry. We have a powerful central government led by the country\u2019s most popular politician, Narendra Modi. Since February, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1227536939479228417\">opposition politicians</a> have been warning of the approaching risks. The southern state of Kerala, the first to start widespread testing and quarantine measures, has prevented uncontrolled outbreak within its borders for several weeks.</p> <p>So, at least in principle, this country should not have gone from bracing for an epidemic to expecting twin catastrophes of contagion and starvation. But we have. As every country in the world faces up to the mistakes it has made in confronting this disease, it\u2019s hard not to feel that India is emblematic of how unprepared the world was for Covid-19. What else was going to happen in a country that has more billionaires than anywhere save China and the US, but still has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_in_India\">world\u2019s highest incidence of tuberculosis</a>? </p> <p>Indian epidemiologists already <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/956932/interview-suppression-wont-work-in-india-slow-down-the-coronavirus-this-will-be-a-long-haul\">knew</a> that total lockdown wouldn\u2019t work in India the way it does in Europe: the infrastructure to ensure basic necessities at every doorstep doesn\u2019t exist, which is why many essential services, from grocery delivery to agricultural work, are exempt from curfews.</p> <p>The infectious diseases expert <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-outbreak-its-a-long-road-to-normal-says-leading-epidemiologist-j-muliyil\">Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil</a> advised us to devise various forms of community participation in controlling the disease instead: discouraging large gatherings and preparing to practice social distancing for months at a time. India\u2019s only option was to \u201cmitigate\u201d, he told the digital publication Scroll \u2013 not \u201cmilitate\u201d.</p> <p>This was oblique, but prescient.

  "<p>Saudi Arabia appears to be exploiting weaknesses in the global mobile telecoms network to track its citizens as they travel around the US, according to a whistleblower who has shown the Guardian millions of alleged secret tracking requests.</p> <p>Data revealed by the whistleblower, who is seeking to expose vulnerabilities in a global messaging system called SS7, appears to suggest a systematic spying campaign by the kingdom, according to experts.</p> <p>The data suggests that millions of secret tracking requests emanated from Saudi Arabia over a four-month period beginning in November 2019.</p> <p>The tracking requests, which sought to establish the US location of Saudi\u2013registered phones, appeared to originate from Saudi\u2019s three biggest mobile phone companies.</p> <p>The whistleblower said they were unable to find any legitimate reason for the high volume of the requests for location information. \u201cThere is no other explanation, no other technical reason to do this. Saudi Arabia is weaponising mobile technologies,\u201d the whistleblower claimed.</p> <p>The data leaked by the whistleblower was also seen by telecommunications and security experts, who confirmed they too believed it was indicative of a surveillance campaign by Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The data shows requests for mobile phone location data that were routed through the decades-old SS7 global messaging system, which allows mobile operators to connect users around the world. For example, a mobile user from the US travelling in Germany and seeking to make a call back to the US is connected through the SS7 network.</p> <p>The SS7 system also enables tracking of phones, which has been a cause for concern by security experts. When a US carrier \u2013 such as Verizon, T-Mobile or AT&amp;T \u2013 receives what is known as a Provide Subscriber Information SS7 message (or PSI) from a foreign mobile phone operator, they are getting, in effect, a tracking request.</p> <p>Such requests are legitimately used to help foreign operators register roaming charges. But excessive use of such messages is known in the mobile telecoms industry to be indicative of location tracking.</p> <p>Experts expressed alarm at the tracking request data because of the apparently persistent high frequency of the requests that appeared to be emanating from Saudi operators seeking to locate their subscribers once they entered the US.</p> <p>It is not known whether the Saudi mobile operators that were requesting large amounts of location tracking data about their subscribers were knowingly complicit in any government\u2013run surveillance programme.</p> <p>However, it has already been widely reported that the Saudi government uses cyberweapons to hack dissidents and critics of the kingdom\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. In January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince\">the Guardian revealed</a> that the Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos\u2019s mobile phone was \u201chacked\u201d in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of Prince Mohammed.</p> <p>One Middle East expert, Andrew Miller, a former member of Barack Obama\u2019s national security council, said surveillance was part of the kingdom\u2019s modus operandi. \u201cI think they are surveilling not only those they know are dissidents, but those they fear may deviate from the Saudi leadership,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey are particularly worried about what Saudi nationals will do when they are in western countries.\u201d</p> <p>The whistleblower\u2019s data appears to show PSI requests from Saudi Arabia that pinged a major US mobile phone operator. It suggests that the three largest Saudi mobile operators \u2013 Saudi Telecom, Mobily and Zain \u2013 sent the US mobile phone operator a combined average of 2.3m tracking requests per month from 1 November 2019 to 1 March 2020.</p> <p>The data appears to suggest the Saudi mobile phones were being tracked as they travelled through the US as often as two to 13 times per hour. Expert said that frequency suggests users could probably have been tracked on a map to within hundreds of metres of accuracy in a city.</p> <p>The data seen by the Guardian did not identify the individual Saudi mobile users who were being tracked.</p> <p>The Saudi embassies in Washington and London did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Neither did Saudi Telecom, Zain or Mobily.</p> <p>Sid Rao, a security and privacy researcher and technologist at Nokia Bell Labs, said he believed the data indicated it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that the Saudis were engaged in a surveillance campaign, based on the magnitude of the location requests.</p> <p>Rao said it could be difficult to determine how many PSI messages might be considered normal, but additional data provided by the whistleblower made him very confident that the requests were not legitimate.</p> <p>For example, one of the Saudi operators also apparently sent separate location requests \u2013 known as PSL, or Provide Subscriber Location, requests \u2013 that were blocked by US mobile operators, indicating a high level of suspicious activity.</p> <p>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the Munk school at the University of Toronto, said the data seen by the Guardian appeared to show foreign agents \u201cflagrantly abusing\u201d the US cellular network to track people moving around the country.</p> <p>\u201cIn this moment of crisis, phone companies, regulators and the Department of Justice should step up to prevent foreign powers from tracking us through our phones,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Guardian requested comments from the three largest US mobile operators \u2013 T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon \u2013 and asked the companies whether they allowed PSI tracking requests to be sent for location tracking purposes.</p> <p>T-Mobile and Verizon did not comment. AT&amp;T said: \u201cWe have security controls to block location-tracking messages from roaming partners.\u201d</p> <p>Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon on the Senate intelligence committee, has previously said in a letter to the US telecoms regulator that \u201cmalicious attackers\u201d were exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities. He alleged that the Federal Communications Commission had failed to act on such warnings, and blamed the FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, for not regulating US carriers.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Wyden said: \u201cBecause of [Pai\u2019s] inaction, if this report is true, an authoritarian government may be reaching into American wireless networks to track people inside our country.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>John Lennon <em>by Julian Lennon</em></h2> <p>A lot of the happy memories of my father are from the late 1960s at Kenwood, the old Tudor house we had in Surrey, when I was a little boy. Without knowing it, I probably saw some of the greatest musicians in the world come and go through that house.</p> <p>I remember sitting on the roof of that house with my dad making a balsawood aeroplane. There was a great view from up there. As a kid, I thought my dad was pretty happy \u2013 with the family, the family home and his place in the world. Who could have predicted that everything was about to change?</p> <p>The Beatles had just released <em>Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. At the time, my dad had his famous psychedelic Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which I adored because it had a record player in the back. We also had a Honda Monkey bike, a mini motorcycle we used to ride around on. Ringo [Starr] lived down the road and my dad would take me to see him on the bike. </p> <p>At Kenwood, my father and I were close. So close, in fact, that though my first name is also John, I started to get called Julian or Jules since when my mum would shout, \u201cJohn, your dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d both my dad and I would react.</p> <p>Then suddenly my dad literally disappeared off the face of the planet. At least, that\u2019s how it seemed to me. He and Yoko Ono were deeply and publicly in love. And I felt as if my mum and I had been cast aside. Not everyone forgot about us, though. Paul wrote Hey Jules after dropping in to check how my mum and I were doing. (Obviously, the title of the song changed to Hey Jude).</p> <p>Maybe 10 years passed during which my dad and I barely spoke. I was very angry about how he left the family. It was thanks to my mum that we started having conversations again. She was such a gentle soul, never vindictive in any way, shape or form. She always wanted me to have a relationship with him.</p> <p>I was scared the first time I went to visit him in the US after my parents\u2019 divorce. I was becoming more aware of the magnitude of this man. Much to my relief, the visit was a success. My dad was charming and funny and warm. From that trip on, I remember us getting along better. </p> <p>I hesitated to enter the music business because of who Dad was. I would send him the odd cassette of me playing live, or song ideas I had recorded on a little Sony Walkman he had given me.</p> <p>He warmly encouraged me to continue playing, but sadly, he never really got to see my career unfold, as he passed when I was just 17. When I did finally become a professional musician a few years later, I felt like I understood him better.</p> <p>I try to remember my dad as fondly as possible. I strive for forgiveness and understanding in that area of my life, for the difficult times he put my mum and me through. I loved her more than anything and can\u2019t forget how poorly he treated her. But our relationship was getting better before he died. He was in a happier place. He wanted to reconnect, not just with me but with the rest of his family. He never got a chance to do so. Even now, almost 40 years after he died, I hold my father\u2019s memory dear.</p> <p><em>Julian Lennon is a musician and photographer and the founder of the <a href=\"https://whitefeatherfoundation.com/\" title=\"\">White Feather Foundation</a></em></p> <h2>Caitlyn Jenner <em>by Brandon Jenner</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee89c32158f97ee16af9a0beb5fef852ab19d03d/0_120_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Jenner with baby son Brandon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Now, we\u2019re making up for lost time\u2019: Bruce Jenner (as she then was) with baby Brandon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father spent the first 65 years of her life trying to avoid answering the question \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And because of that, she didn\u2019t ask it often, either. And, though, I understand that she avoided the question because the answer would have laid bare too many struggles, it made my relationship with her challenging. People connect with each other through vulnerability, and you can only get someone to open up to you if you are willing to be vulnerable yourself. Because she was shielding something so important from herself, Dad remained distant for much of my life.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have many memories from before my parents split up and my father moved out. I was four at the time. They got divorced because my dad had decided to start transitioning to female. I, of course, was too young then to have any idea what was behind their decision.</p> <p>I do, however, remember a few details from my early childhood that only made sense much later. For instance, when I was very young, I used to love to fiddle with people\u2019s ears. Once when I reached out to touch my dad\u2019s ears, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t do that. I just had surgery.\u201d He pointed to a thin line of small black stitches behind his ear, grinned, and said: \u201cThey took my ear off, peeled my face back, and then stitched it back on.\u201d </p> <p>For the first few years after their divorce, my parents were amicable. Mom started dating David Foster, whom she later married. I never called him dad, but he was the one who lived with us, who told me to pick up my clothes and turn off the lights \u2013 all the typical dad things. So even though this is about Caitlyn, I could write just as easily about David. He was a wonderful father figure.</p> <p>A few years after my parents divorced, Dad apparently decided that it wasn\u2019t the right time to transition and had many of his surgeries reversed. After that, his relationship with my mother grew more hostile. She had worked hard to accept that the reason he couldn\u2019t be with her was because he was working towards transitioning. When he started dating Kris Jenner, whom he would go on to marry, that line of reasoning fell apart. It was tremendously painful. The effect of my parents\u2019 souring relationship was that I didn\u2019t see my father more than half a dozen times between ages eight and 25.</p> <p>Because of this, most of the memories I have of my dad are from the narrow slice of time before I was eight. I remember him betting my brother Brody and me $20 that he could beat us to the top of these insanely high giant sand dunes in Malibu and then just smoking us. He ran a flat-out decathlete sprint. He didn\u2019t even pretend to let us win.</p> <p>After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn\u2019t want to be a part of their dynamic. When I was in my 20s and his daughters with Kris \u2013 Kendall and Kylie \u2013 were teenagers, Dad and I began to re-establish a relationship. He wasn\u2019t as needed around the house and, I think, was looking for someone to talk to. Although, to be honest, instead of talking, we did things. We worked on my car or flew radio-controlled planes in the park near his house. But even then, it always seemed Dad had his guard up.</p> <p>Once he decided to go through with the transition, I was the first of her children she confided in. As soon as Dad said it herself, I was so happy for her.</p> <p>As her son, I wish my dad had been able to transition sooner, not only because I think she would have been happier, but because I think we could have built a stronger relationship earlier. Now, I\u2019m making up for lost time. I speak to my dad almost every day, and every time, she asks me, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p> <p><em>Brandon Jenner is a singer and songwriter</em> </p> <h2>Jeff Bridges <em>by Isabelle Bridges Boesch</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ef5380327e347eac14124fcdfb48626518b7c4e/0_0_3157_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bridges poses for a portrait after being nominated in the Best Actor category for the 82nd Academy Awards for his role in \u201cCrazy Heart\u201d in Los Angeles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was like having the most imaginative friend in the world\u2019: Isabelle Bridges Boesch on her dad Jeff Bridges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My dad came from a family of actors. His father, Lloyd, was an actor. His mother, Dorothy, was an actor. His brother Beau is an actor, too. He knows firsthand how weird and challenging it could be to have an actor as a parent, which means he is very good at being a famous actor father.</p> <p>When I was growing up, my dad was really hitting his stride. He made many of his greatest films, from <em>The Fabulous Baker Boys</em> to <em>The Fisher King</em> to <em>Fearless</em>, before I was 10 years old. He was often away shooting for weeks at a time, leaving my mother to look after me and my two sisters. She likes to say she takes care of the empire \u2013 and she does.</p> <p>But when my dad was at home, it was like having the greatest, most imaginative friend in the world. What makes him such a wonderful actor is the same thing that makes him a wonderful playmate: he\u2019s a great pretender. He relished opening up his rich inner life to share with me and my sisters, and he was always happy to be part of ours, too. My sisters and I loved to dress him up, put flowers in his hair \u2013 he\u2019s always had a nice head of hair \u2013 and decorate his face with makeup. When Dad was around, we\u2019d draw or paint or just play pretend for hours. He has such a playful spirit. The only time he ever brought his work home with him was the day he returned from shooting Blown Away still in makeup, his face appearing all bloodied and bruised. I think he wanted to scare us, but we just loved peeling off the stretchy plastic fake blood from his face. It was really satisfying.</p> <p>But, of course, he couldn\u2019t always be at home. When he was away, Dad made sure we stayed connected. He\u2019d call every night. He\u2019d say something like, \u201cIsabelle, when you\u2019re asleep tonight, you\u2019ll see a building. Go through the front door and climb up to the attic. What do you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see the branch of an oak tree by the window,\u201d I\u2019d reply. Then he\u2019d ask, \u201cDo you see the tree house nestled in the crook of the branch?\u201d I\u2019d laugh and say I did. \u201cLet\u2019s meet there tonight,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll jump on our horses and ride to the mountains.\u201d \u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he\u2019d say. In the morning, he\u2019d call again, and we\u2019d go over the adventures we\u2019d had in our dreams the night before.</p> <p>I always knew my father was loving and sweet and playful, but it\u2019s still funny to me that he\u2019s become so closely identified with the Dude. By the time <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers\">The Big Lebowski</a></em> came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father\u2019s work. (I still haven\u2019t seen some of his films from that period.) What I remember most is that around that time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They\u2019re one of the most well-known parts of his costume, but they were actually my dad\u2019s own shoes. Anyway, my sister and I were so embarrassed by those godawful jellies, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they\u2019d probably be worth a lot of money.</p> <p>Another funny thing about people conflating Dad with the Dude is that he\u2019s not really a laid-back guy. He gets anxious. He experiences stress. Before he goes onstage, he always says he doesn\u2019t want to do it, and afterward, he is critical of himself. Though he describes himself as \u201cBuddhish\u201d, he doesn\u2019t project Zen calm. He is, however, extremely present. Even more so now that he\u2019s older and a grandfather. I have two kids of my own, and he is very focused on being in their lives. We live in Oakland, but he and my mom visit often. And when he\u2019s not able to be with his grandkids, he calls to plan dream meetings with them, too.</p> <p><em>Daddy Daughter Day by Isabelle Bridges Boesch and Jeff Bridges (Penguin Random House) is due to be published in October</em></p> <h2>Samuel L Jackson <em>by Zoe Jackson</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c54b7c4d4bc823f3091e7cca1dea64cbd5158fe/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel L.

He is completely different from his cool-guy persona. When I was 10 we would go to the comic store every week religiously. They even kept a pull box for my dad (the store pulls the new comics on a customer\u2019s list and keeps them behind the counter). Dad\u2019s pull box was full of weird and really violent comics that I wasn\u2019t allowed to read. He and I didn\u2019t start exchanging comic books until I got to college, and when I was there, whenever I went to the comic book store alone, I was sad. I wanted my dad to be there.</p> <p>Though I was largely shielded from it at as a child, my dad was struggling with addiction during much of my childhood. When I was eight, he entered rehab. He was gone for 60 days, which was a confusing time for me. I had no idea anything was wrong. I never saw him drunk that I know of. I just thought he was a dude who slept a lot.</p> <p>We moved to Los Angeles for my mum, LaTanya Richardson: she got a role in a shortlived TV series. But soon my dad\u2019s career really took off, and my mum stopped working as much to take care of me. It\u2019s funny that my father is the better-known actor, because my mum was the one who pushed him to act in the first place. They met in a teacher\u2019s office (They went to different colleges but the teacher taught at both places.) Mum was doing some makeup work. She said, \u201cYou need to be in my play. Do you act?\u201d Dad said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t,\u201d and my mum replied, \u201cWell, you do now.\u201d And that\u2019s how it went, and how it has gone ever since. My mum turns the key and sends Dad out into the world.</p> <p>I do think it was very hard for my mum to give up her career to raise me for as long as she did, though. She\u2019s happy for my dad, of course, but it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s a sadness there.</p> <p>I was 12 years old when <em>Pulp Fiction</em> came out. After that, my dad became cool. Or, he thought he did. And though much of the world agrees, he\u2019s still just a big nerd to me. He goes through phases. Once, he gave me a sweatshirt he got from working on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/17/django-unchained-review\">Django Unchained</a></em>. He said, \u201cI signed it for you!\u201d I was like, \u201cDad, thanks. Now I can\u2019t wear it!\u201d It\u2019s up to my mum and me to pull him back down to earth.

He named me after Ethan Edwards, his character in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-searchers\" title=\"\">The Searchers</a></em>, which many consider to be his best role. </p> <p>My father was tough, but very loving. He was old school. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. He didn\u2019t talk much, but he could make his few words very, very impactful and meaningful. Other actors fight for lines; my dad tried to remove as many words as possible. His friends called him Duke, his childhood nickname. It was the name of his dog, an Airedale. Dad used to deliver papers with Duke. The local firemen called the pair Big Duke and Little Duke. The name stuck. He told me, \u201cNow when someone calls me John, I don\u2019t even turn my head.\u201d</p> <p>In his free time, his life was centred on the ocean. We had a converted Second World War minesweeper called Wild Goose and every summer, we would sail up to British Columbia and Alaska. Every winter, we would take it down to Mexico.</p> <p>When he wasn\u2019t on the boat, Dad was working. So I was raised on movie sets. They were rugged in those days. Our family would stay either in a small rented house or in a little motel. I had a tutor three hours a day, but I learned a lot from my father, too. He never told me \u201cdo this\u201d or \u201cdo that\u201d, but led by example. You never wanted to disappoint him. </p> <p>Once when we were at a friend\u2019s ranch, he asked me to drive to the house in an old pick-up truck and grab some things for him. I was 12. I got the truck stuck and I had to go tell him. He was in the middle of a card game. He didn\u2019t get up or offer to help. It was clear that I was expected to figure out how to get the truck out on my own.</p> <p>Some of my proudest moments came from living up to my father\u2019s straight-ahead toughness. When we were in Cabo or La Paz, Mexico, we\u2019d anchor the boat far from the shore and swim in. It was about a 25-minute swim. I remember once, when I was seven or eight, swimming into a bunch of sea snakes and saying, \u201cHoly crap. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/snorkelling-grandmothers-uncover-large-population-of-venomous-sea-snakes-in-noumea\" title=\"\">sea snakes</a> here, Dad!\u201d He replied, \u201cYeah, just keep swimming, kid.\u201d</p> <p>Once we made it to shore, we walked around until our clothes dried. He gave me a big hug and said, \u201cGood job, Big Stuff.\u201d I was just so proud to have made it through, proud to be my father\u2019s son.</p> <p>My father died on 11 June 1979. I was 17. At the time, it was just him and me alone in the house; my mother had moved out. That day, he said he wasn\u2019t feeling well, so I drove him to the hospital. As we pulled up, there was a crowd of photographers waiting for him so we had to go through the back. I was worried, but I was also a naive teenager and thought he was going to be OK. He just always got through things. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but that was the last ride I would ever take with my dad.</p> <p><em>Ethan Wayne is the chairman of the <a href=\"https://johnwayne.org/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Cancer Foundation</a> and president of <a href=\"https://www.johnwayne.com/\" title=\"\">John Wayne Enterprises</a></em></p> <h2>Miles Davis <em>by Erin Davis</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a95b407e9c640e9c1fc17622582223e7657971/0_58_612_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis with son Erin.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play on: Miles Davis with son Erin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Erin Davis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People think of my dad as the prince of darkness (the name of his 1967 album), a moody performer who turned his back on the audience out of disregard for them. That wasn\u2019t him at all. But this wasn\u2019t something I truly realised until I stood onstage with him as part of his legendary band: Dad wasn\u2019t turning away from the audience; he was turning toward the band. It wasn\u2019t a sign of disrespect for those there to hear him; it was a sign of respect for those there to play. And I was lucky enough to be there to play.</p> <p>I knew he was a famous musician, but didn\u2019t quite understand how famous. As a kid, I was always telling him I wanted to be a musician. Finally, when I was 14, he asked if I wanted to go on the road with him in the summer. Of course, I said yes.</p> <p>I learned a lot, not only about music, but about my father, during those summer tours. As I stood in the wings, I saw that playing the music live was the most important thing to him. </p> <p>Those tours were the first sustained amount of time I spent with my father. What I discovered about him was how he could break down what was going on in any musical performance \u2013 and find something to take away from it. I remember once watching a heavy metal show on MTV, and when Slayer came on, I thought, \u201cDad\u2019s going to hate this.\u201d He watched for a bit and then said, \u201cHuh. That drummer is really laying it down, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Then he just walked away.</p> <p>He finally asked me onstage for a tour in 1990. He was giving me a chance and I was terrified of blowing it. I played electronic percussion, which was a genre my dad kind of invented. I didn\u2019t even get any rehearsals. I watched the guy who did it before me for a couple of shows, then I was just kind of on it, in the seat. It was nerve-racking for me, but at the same time, it felt wonderful to have my father turn toward me, to listen to me and to play with me as an equal.</p> <p><em>Erin Davis, along with his sister and cousin, is an executor of the Miles Davis estate</em></p> <p><em>To Me, He Was Just Dad by Joshua David Stein is published by Artisan at \u00a317.99.

Across the world, numerous industries have entered a state of suspended animation, imposing a sharp and involuntary brake on the working lives of millions of people.</p> <p>This week, having moved my psychoanalytic practice online, I\u2019ve sat in an empty consulting room talking to patients via video-conference, many of them struggling to process what life in the shadow of Covid-19 might mean in the short- and longer-term. Some are lamenting the lost sense of belonging they derive from their workplaces, as well as the claustrophobia of being shut in with partners and children.</p> <p>For others, the fear is more immediate: oneself or a loved one becoming ill and unable to work, the demise of a business, the contraction or total erosion of a livelihood. And lurking behind all these grim prospects, ensuring I\u2019m not immune from this rapid contagion of anxiety, is the possibility that my psychoanalytic practice may be sacrificed to this grim new financial reality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beyond survival, work shapes our sense of self. The thought of being without it induces existential terror</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My interest in the question of how to live without work lead me to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/not-working-9781783782062.html\">write a book</a> on the topic. I discussed clinical cases, as well as lives of major artists and thinkers, that spoke to the importance of renewing contact with our neglected inner lives and letting our minds roam without the imperatives of productivity or purpose dogging every moment. I asked how we could loosen the grip of the centuries-old ethic that ties our sense of self so inextricably to our work.</p> <p>In thinking about a world without work, I had in mind a future of automation and AI, rather than the unthinkable shock of a global pandemic. I followed Oscar Wilde in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-soul-of-man-under-socialism-and-selected-critical-prose-9780140433876.html\">The Soul of Man Under Socialism</a> and tried to imagine life unburdened by the yoke of necessity. Now, Wilde\u2019s vision of a society freed by automation to realise its creative potential is a painful contrast to the workless reality being foisted on millions.</p> <p>Under very different conditions, we could imagine a period of life without work as the most precious of gifts \u2013 the chance to live at our own pace and rediscover the pleasures and possibilities of free, aimless time. But this can only be the case when work ceases to be a matter of survival and when its loss doesn\u2019t plague us with anxiety, depression and sleeplessness. The virus, in other words, is throwing into stark relief an obvious yet suddenly treacherous fact of life today: we depend on work.</p> <p>This dependence is partly a matter of survival; nothing is more liable to arouse a sense of helplessness than the threat of poverty or hunger. But beyond survival, work shapes our sense of self. The thought of being without it induces existential terror. \u201cI\u2019m scared of the loss of income, for sure,\u201d a woman with a suddenly precarious job in the arts said to me recently, \u201cand obviously my health. But I\u2019m more scared of losing myself.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a fear many will share. With the lockdown, it seems we\u2019ve lost the routines that give substance to our lives. Need this mean losing ourselves? I\u2019d like to believe that this period could help us discover new creative resources within ourselves, a thought that takes me to the unlikely figure of Xavier de Maistre, a French aristocrat who in 1790 spent 42 days under house arrest in Turin, Italy, for duelling with an officer.</p> <p>De Maistre whiled away the hours of solitude by writing a journal of his confinement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/04/journey-around-my-room-review\">A Journey Around My Room</a>, which takes us on a strange journey across the walls and floor of his bedroom. He envisioned this motionless travel as a kind of radically democratic tourism, requiring no disposable income or gratuitous effort. In words that take on an eerily hopeful resonance at this moment, De Maistre insists that the Turin authorities \u201cmay have forbidden me to travel through a city, one place, but they left me the entire universe: infinity and eternity are at my command\u201d.</p> <p>But in these times, even the most insulated of us can\u2019t be De Maistre. Even if we enjoyed similar financial privilege, we lack the comfort that the world we return to when our own house arrest is over will be as it was when we left it. And, of course, most of us enjoy no such privilege. Our reveries in front of our bedroom walls are bound to be disturbed by fears for the future \u2013 both ours and the world\u2019s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/08/not-working-why-we-have-to-stop-by-josh-cohen-review\">Not Working: Why We Have to Stop by Josh Cohen \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What if those fears and concerns for others could help fuel a different kind of imaginative transformation? If we can\u2019t, like De Maistre, withdraw into the peaceful cell of our own daydreams, we can (assuming we\u2019re well enough) channel our creativity into refreshing our neglected social and emotional bonds.</p> <p>Think of those offers of help being popped into neighbours\u2019 letterboxes, those helping at food banks, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/astonishing-170000-people-sign-up-to-be-nhs-volunteers-in-15-hours-coronavirus\">thousands of NHS volunteers</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.thehelphub.co.uk/volunteer/\">Help Hub psychotherapy project</a>, originating in Oxford and now offering free online sessions to those in need of human contact and solidarity.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser.</p> <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.</p> <p>The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election.</p> <p>Boyd said the government was aware of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644968/UK_National_Risk_Register_2017.pdf\">many risks</a> with low likelihoods but potentially very high impacts on the nation, such as pandemics, severe storms and power blackouts. But he said these were assessed independently from one another, underplaying the total risk, which itself was rising due to climate change, population growth and the globalisation of travel.</p> <p>Looked at alone, a pandemic had appeared unlikely, he said. \u201cAs a result, getting sufficient resource just to write a decent biosecurity strategy was tough. Getting resource to properly underpin implementation of what it said was impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd added: \u201cThe middle of a crisis may not be the best time to suggest why we should learn lessons \u2026 But many people are more likely to listen now. Certainly, nothing should distract us from getting ahead of Covid-19. My concern is that we should come out of this much wiser.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS is reported to have failed a government test of its ability to handle a pandemic, though the finding were not made public. Exercise Cygnus, a three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016, examined how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronavirus.</p> <p>According to the Sunday Telegraph, ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment.</p> <p>Boyd said politicians found it tough to deliver large-scale preventive policies to a public unconcerned about major risks. \u201c[They] often talk the talk but find it hard to walk the walk of the changes needed. As they are currently structured, governments are hopelessly underpowered to implement the about-turn needed on policy.\u201d</p> <p>The 2018 biological security strategy, the UK\u2019s first, stated: \u201cThe UK is globally renowned for the quality of our preparedness planning [for] significant biological risks.\u201d It noted that the UK spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, these efforts have not always been as well coordinated as they could have been and we have sometimes failed to approach these issues with an international as well as a domestic perspective,\u201d it said. As a result, \u201cwe may also fail to maximise the impact of our activities or to tackle issues as quickly as we need to\u201d.</p> <p>The strategy said the UK maintained \u201cappropriate stockpiles of clinical countermeasures for diseases of concern\u201d, made it a priority \u201cto protect first responders through ensuring that they are equipped and trained properly\u201d and had \u201ca strong public communications capability to ensure we are able to engage swiftly and clearly with the public about any action they might need to take\u201d.</p> <p>As well as committing to improving government coordination and data sharing, and the communication of risk to the public, the strategy said: \u201cWe will develop a UK government response plan for major international diseases to ensure that the government is fully prepared to respond as quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The UK was ranked second in the world in 2019 by the <a href=\"https://www.ghsindex.org/\">Global Health Security (GHS) Index</a>, with the US first. The independent GHS Index assessed the capability to prevent and mitigate pandemics in 195 countries.</p> <p>In July 2019 the House of Commons joint committee on the national security strategy <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/inquiries/parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health-inquiry-17-19/\">launched an inquiry</a> into preparing for emerging infectious diseases. However, its <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news-parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health1-evidence-19-20/\">first evidence session in October</a> was postponed due to debates on Brexit and the calling of a general election. The December election meant the inquiry was cancelled.</p> <p>Catherine Rhodes, the head of the centre for the study of existential risk at Cambridge University, had been scheduled to give evidence to the MPs\u2019 inquiry. She said the UK had had fairly good pandemic planning in place.</p> <p>\u201cThere does, however, seem to have been a significant gap between recognition of the risk and planning, and action on preparedness,\u201d she said. \u201cIn particular, there could have been much better public communication in advance of the outbreak about the sort of measures that might be necessary in such a situation, and surge capacity in the NHS could have been substantially improved.\u201d</p> <p>Opi Outhwaite, at St Mary\u2019s law school in London, who was also scheduled to give evidence to the inquiry, said: \u2018I think broadly that any government would likely have been overwhelmed by this outbreak.\u201d</p> <p>But she said: \u201cThe risk of an outbreak of this type has been known for some time, while the biological security strategy seemed to have stalled. The response aspect of the strategy focuses a lot on deployment of expertise to other parts of the world. To me this emphasises the idea that we needed to be preparing to respond to outbreaks overseas, with less emphasis on what we would do once an outbreak crossed into the UK.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that we had to experience a pandemic here first-hand to shift the thinking. It\u2019s very noticeable now hypothetical everything [in the strategy] appears.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe UK has well-established and world-leading capabilities for dealing with disease outbreaks and pandemics. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-evidence-base-underpinning-the-uk-influenza-pandemic-preparedness-strategy\">UK influenza pandemic preparedness strategy</a><em> </em>reflects experience and lessons learned from previous pandemics and was used in developing the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan\">coronavirus action plan</a>, guided by clinical and scientific advice.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd said: \u201cIf there is a legacy of Covid-19, it might be that it is enough of a warning shot to enough people that it creates the political headroom for serious action.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In a family photograph taken by his father in 1903, nine-year-old Jacques Henri Lartigue stands on a path in the Bois de Boulogne, in front of his mother and grandmother. He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.</p> <p>Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.</p> <p>When the celebrated American photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Richard Avedon</a> saw Jacques Henri Lartigue\u2019s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2563\">show in 1963</a>, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: \u201cIt was one of the most moving experiences of my life\u2026 You brought me into your world and isn\u2019t that, after all, the purpose of art?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8fd5cd5dd535cdb7e4348d860eaac65b5990ef68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fd5cd5dd535cdb7e4348d860eaac65b5990ef68/0_0_1384_1762/785.jpg\" alt=\"Lartigue\u2019s older brother Zissou in the pool at Rouzat, 1911.\" width=\"785\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s older brother Zissou in the pool at Rouzat, 1911.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri\u2019s offspring amused. He once said: \u201cI have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Lartigue\u2019s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.</p> <p>In her new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lartigue.html\">The Boy and the Belle \u00c9poque</a>, </em>Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue\u2019s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle \u00e9poque.</p> <p>Lartigue\u2019s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e10816ae48017ce8a9b62abfc9b3d35e667affd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e10816ae48017ce8a9b62abfc9b3d35e667affd5/0_0_1831_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Roussel, Rouzat, 1913.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s cousin Simone Roussel, Rouzat, 1913.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.</p> <p>More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family\u2019s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was \u201ca sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator\u201d.</p> <p>Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue\u2019s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/15/-sp-garry-winogrand-genius-american-street-photography\">Garry Winogrand</a> and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls \u201ca new visual language of the 20th century\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2583594184712ee3d37a83efbd4f35421201be96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2583594184712ee3d37a83efbd4f35421201be96/0_0_4134_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna la Pradvina, Bois de Boulogne, 1911 by Lartigue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna la Pradvina, Bois de Boulogne, 1911.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was \u201cto photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats\u201d. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the All\u00e9e des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and \u201cgrand cocottes\u201d \u2013 courtesans like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liane_de_Pougy\">Liane de Pougy</a>, a friend of the novelist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colette\">Colette</a>, and \u00c9milienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII\u2019s lover.</p> <p>Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, \u201cset the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season\u201d. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera\u2019s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another diversion in, as Colette scathingly put it, \u201cthe bustling lives of people with nothing to do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a93409d618715692f65be05fb0e0d9c3db88bef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a93409d618715692f65be05fb0e0d9c3db88bef/0_0_1831_1292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lartigue\u2019s bedroom, 40 Rue Cortambert, 1906.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lartigue\u2019s bedroom, 40 Rue Cortambert, 1906.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture \u2013 France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle \u00e9poque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large \u2013 and even more exotic looking \u2013 in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.</p> <p>Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Bl\u00e9riot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e2ce336b46beb6b1a4d56cd149bfd41cb213e68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e2ce336b46beb6b1a4d56cd149bfd41cb213e68/0_0_9449_6506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The French Grand Prix, Circuit de Dieppe, Normandy, 1912.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The French Grand Prix, Circuit de Dieppe, Normandy, 1912.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: All photographs by Jacques Henri Lartigue \u00a9 2020 Ministe\u0300re de la Culture France/AAJ HL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere. As France ordered general mobilisation, he retreated with his family from Paris to the Auvergne and the sanctuary that was Chateau Rouzat.</p> <p>\u201cThe war inevitably made us unhappy,\u201d he wrote in a secret diary, \u201cbut it was happy all the same\u2026 I played sports and we still amused ourselves.\u201d There is a single image in the book that suggests the unfolding horror: a platoon of marching soldiers silhouetted against a grey sky as a spindly aeroplane flies overhead. The war inevitably curtailed his carefree life, writes Baring, but \u201cLartigue emerged intact, plunging into life with the passions of a child, refusing ever to grow up\u201d. That childlike optimism would fuel his life and his photography for decades to come.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Lartigue: The Boy and the Belle \u00c9poque </em>by Louise Baring is out on 16 April (Thames &amp; Hudson, \u00a328).

  "<p>Life is filled with memorable summers and among my first was that of 1990. I was nine at the time and for the past year or so a Liverpool supporter. But that was as far as my love of football went \u2013 they were the only team I cared about, the only team I wanted to watch, and games that did not involve men in red shirts with Candy across the middle didn\u2019t interest me much. That, however, was about to change.</p> <p>On Friday 8 June 1990 to be precise, when I sat down in front of the living-room television to watch Argentina versus Cameroon in the opening fixture of the World Cup.</p> <p>Diego Maradona was key to my decision to do so. I had heard of him, how he was the best player of his generation and probably of all time, and here he was \u2013 on show at the start of a global tournament taking place across an entire month. I was intrigued by what lay ahead and there was to be no disappointment, thanks in large part not to Maradona but rather to the team with lions on their chests and stardust in their boots.</p> <p>Cameroon\u2019s World Cup campaign was magnificent and no more so than on day one when in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6uIUg9ovP0\" title=\"\">beating Argentina 1-0 at San Siro</a> they pulled off arguably the greatest upset in World Cup history and one that put African football on the map. Before then teams from the continent had been dismissed and derided, with Zaire\u2019s farcical display at the 1974 tournament, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYDXkVGpMpc\" title=\"\">particularly at free-kicks</a>, doing much to shape opinions. Cameroon were not expected to change that given they arrived in Italy as a squad largely made up of journeymen from France\u2019s lower leagues who were in poor form and riven by division. There was no doubt \u2013 they were going to be blown away, and especially so by the reigning champions. But on a warm Milan evening, Cameroon torched the odds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0170aaaabb5be444ca243330624d09c83665a075\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0170aaaabb5be444ca243330624d09c83665a075/0_354_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Argentina\u2019s captain Diego Maradona leads his team out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Argentina\u2019s captain Diego Maradona leads his team out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Francotte/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was not a great game but it was a memorable one because of two moments: Fran\u00e7ois Omam-Biyik\u2019s goal on 67 minutes \u2013 a towering but weak header that somehow squirmed through the grasp of Nery Pumpido and ultimately decided the contest \u2013 and then, two minutes from time, Benjamin Massing\u2019s foul on Claudio Caniggia.</p> <p>Caniggia had evaded two Cameroon tackles as he went on a counterattacking surge but stood no chance of evading Massing\u2019s given it was less a tackle and more an assault, waist-high and so strong that it sent Massing\u2019s right boot flying in the air. The referee, Michel Vautrot, had no option but to dismiss Massing, having already sent off his teammate Andr\u00e9 Kana-Biyik for a far less heinous offence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwW1ryuGOtU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gwW1ryuGOtU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Massing\u2019s foul on Caniggia is one of those things that lives with you and ever since it is what has come to mind whenever I\u2019ve thought about wildly brutal attacks. Roy Keane on Alf-Inge Haaland \u2013 Benjamin Massing. Ben Thatcher on Pedro Mendes \u2013 Benjamin Massing. The 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2013 Benjamin Massing.</p> <p>To an extent it characterised Cameroon\u2019s approach to this game, yet it would be wrong to suggest Valeri Nepomniachi\u2019s men only beat Argentina because they kicked them off the pitch. Cameroon were rugged and uncompromising (so much so that they kept Maradona quiet throughout) but they also performed with skill and ambition. As David Lacey put it in the Guardian: \u201cThe better team won\u201d. That they did so with nine men only added to the scale of the achievement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"My favourite game\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">My favourite game</a> </figure>  <p>Cameroon would go on to reach the quarter-finals, where they were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz3o6cnjy5k\" title=\"\">narrowly beaten by England</a>, and returned home as heroes, no one more so than Roger Milla, their 38-year-old, snake-hipped striker who epitomised the wonder of that side. And for nine-year-old me what they did against Argentina was the hook. My imagination had been caught by the drama and spectacle of it all and now I wanted as much football as I could get. And that summer I got plenty; Matth\u00e4us\u2019s piledriver, O\u2019Leary\u2019s penalty, Schillaci\u2019s eyes \u2026 Gazza\u2019s tears.

The campaign was working with the government, which had been inundated with offers of inadequate equipment at inflated prices from private companies.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is why we raised the capital ourselves and hope to help government distribute these supplies in best possible way,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The doctors say in their appeal: \u201cUnfortunately current hospital supplies are not sufficient and while we are reassured the government is doing everything it can, healthcare workers on the frontline are risking themselves daily without adequate protection to care for sick patients.

The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle.

Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days.</p> \n  <p>And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke.</p> \n  <p>Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses.</p> \n  <p>People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills.<br>Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords.<br>A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem.<br><br>After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers.</p> \n  <p>This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works.</p> \n  <p>Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done.</p> \n  <p>On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew.</p> \n  <p>And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t.</p> \n  <p>Yes, these are hard problems to solve.

  "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LamornaAsh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lamorna Ash</a> has a hunch about seasickness: a conviction that there could be more than one reason why a person might feel suddenly queasy up on deck. \u201cA fisherman told me that his cousin never used to suffer from seasickness at all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then he had kids, and suddenly he did. I thought this was fascinating. It made me wonder whether seasickness isn\u2019t somehow connected to things that tie you to the land. Could it be that the more of those things there are, the more likely you are to suffer from it? Perhaps it functions a bit like homesickness in that way.\u201d Struck by her own fancifulness, she flashes me a smile. \u201cWell, anyway\u2026 I like that as a way of thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>When she was 22 and studying for a master\u2019s degree in social anthropology at University College London, seasickness was briefly Ash\u2019s closest companion. Having decided to devote her thesis to the way that fishing shapes a community, she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall \u2013 which is where she met Don, the skipper of a rusty old trawler called the Filadelfia. Would Don consider taking her out in his boat, so that she might stand, as it were, in \u201cthe same wellies\u201d as his crew? Somewhat to her amazement \u2013 women are supposed to bring bad luck at sea \u2013 he said that he would, and so it was that one evening in 2017 she found herself rounding Land\u2019s End just as the sun was about to set, her stomach a tight knot of nerves, her eyes already red from the salt-licked wind. \u201cI\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t think too hard about things before I do them,\u201d she says. \u201cI seem not to be very cautious; I get overexcited. But that day, yes, I was nervous. I was very scared of seasickness. Not so much of being sick itself, but of it being so bad that I would be useless and they would have to take me home. I didn\u2019t want to do anything to jeopardise their trip; I knew that would cost them a lot of money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1be8a8b0e114b9bc24f5606c1fd633a65fe0a2c1/0_2509_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"don the skipper of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don, skipper of the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, she was sick, but only once. \u201cYou start yawning,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re going to go, and you don\u2019t want the men to see because it\u2019s such a sign of weakness.\u201d Most of the time, however, she was able to manage her constant, raging nausea with a combination of seasickness pills and hard work; among other things, she learned to gut every kind of fish, holding the gasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands even as she struggled properly to stand upright. Life on a trawler is hard, the days long and tough and extremely cold, and thanks to this she found that she was always hungry for the vast meals the crew cooked and ate down below, sickness or no sickness.</p> <p>As for the things that tied <em>her</em> to the land \u2013 her parents, her friends \u2013 she learned not to think of them. It embarrasses her now to remember the moment when, not long after they had set sail, she asked Don for the Filadelfia\u2019s wifi code. (\u201cDo you know how much that costs at sea?\u201d he told her, with a laugh.) Her phone useless in the pocket of her oilskins, she found that time deepened at sea. She learned to speak a new language, one at once both more reticent than the English spoken on land and yet, in some ways, more open, too. In the wheelhouse, talking to Don or one of the other men while they were on watch \u2013 on a trawler, you\u2019re potentially only ever seconds from catastrophe; hit an old anchor or some submarine cables, and the vessel can easily capsize \u2013 she learned to listen to the long, meditative gaps between sentences, spaces that allowed words to \u201cexpand and drift\u201d in ways that rendered them altogether more meaningful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8230c988221e5362fe8654a67e167d6447659fc2/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"lamorna ash on board the newlyn trawler\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filadelfia freedom: Lamorna Ash on board the Newlyn trawler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did the world of the Filadelfia feel very male? Was it unnerving to sleep in her bunk \u2013 its size and shape made her think of a coffin \u2013 alongside all those snoring, hairy, briny men? \u201cI didn\u2019t especially experience it like that, no,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were older than me; they\u2019re family guys, and their women are very strong. The biggest fishing family in Newlyn, the Stevensons, has a matriarch at the head of it. I never felt unsafe, though now and then I would ask one of them: <em>would you say that to a man? </em>But I did want to prove myself a bit. I was never going just to sit there and make notes and take photographs.\u201d Ash studied English at Oxford, and Don made her think of Singleton, the old sailor on Joseph Conrad\u2019s Narcissus: the men who could understand Singleton\u2019s silences were, she recalled, those mariners who \u201cknew how to exist beyond the pale of life\u201d. Staring out into the blue-black, she realised on that first night aboard the Filadelfia that she and its crew had now themselves moved beyond the pale: a confined, almost monastic existence, and yet an unencumbered, roaming one, too \u2013 and so began what she thinks of today as the richest and most vast experience of her life so far.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s eight-day stint on the Filadelfia forms the spine of her first book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dark-salt-clear-9781526600011.html\">Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town</a></em>; artfully, she returns to it again and again, to the point where you come to believe she must always have known she would one day put the experience between hard covers. But this was, she insists, never her plan. Her thesis complete, she was interning at the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> when a publisher spotted a piece she had written about a trip she took on another trawler, the Crystal Sea \u2013 that publisher asked to meet her, and duly gave her a book deal (she now works for an educational charity). And in person, it\u2019s impossible not to take her at her word. I\u2019m amazed and slightly shocked when she reveals that she spent, in total, just three and a half months in Newlyn; something about her book \u2013 the intimacy of the encounters it describes; the epic quality of her account of life on the Filadelfia \u2013 leads you to imagine that she must have lived there for a year at least, and possibly much longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6504536601f017d1f867c4c60f86fdf6a3a5ba6f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"catch of the day on the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catch of the day on the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She and I meet in Penzance. She has been in Newlyn all weekend, seeing old friends and mooching around, and when I get off the train on a bright Monday afternoon, she pitches up in a long coat and with a ravishing new pixie haircut looking like someone who is slightly drunk on fresh air. For both of us, London and Covid-19 suddenly seem very far away. We can breathe. St Michael\u2019s Mount casts its usual spell out in the bay (24 hours later, the National Trust will announce that it is now closed to the public). <a href=\"https://jubileepool.co.uk/\">The Jubilee Pool</a>, Penzance\u2019s celebrated art deco saltwater lido, looks strangely inviting even in mid-March. The people, mostly retired, that we pass as we walk along the promenade are unhurried and smiling.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s important not to take things at face value. Ash has a family connection to this part of Cornwall; she spent her childhood holidays in Lelant, near St Ives, where her mother\u2019s side of the family has lived for generations. But if those times were idyllic \u2013 her mother, a former actor who once appeared in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark\">Poldark</a></em>, was always encouraging her to let her imagination run wild as they walked on the beach \u2013 Cornwall has, of course, a darker side: chiaroscuro shades that she learned to see (\u201canother way of looking\u201d) more clearly during her time in Newlyn.</p> <p>Though the town is one of the most profitable fishing ports in Britain, it is also poor. In 2015, the mean gross annual salary in Penzance, of which Newlyn is a part (the two merge almost seamlessly together nowadays), was \u00a326,788, compared with \u00a334,265 in the rest of the country. Penzance is literally the end of the line, as anyone who has travelled there by train will know, and Newlyn sits at the far side of a county that in 2017 had the 10th highest numbers of homeless people in the country, and the third highest suicide rate in the UK. Cornwall is the only county poor enough to have qualified for EU emergency funding \u2013 a sad fact that did very little to change its implacable determination to vote for Brexit (the <a href=\"https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/brexit/\">leave vote in the county</a> was 56.5%).</p> <p>In Newlyn, Ash carefully points out the sights to me. Here is the fish market, where she once spent a morning unpacking catch after catch, her fingers so cold she could not feel them (stored in ice, the lemon sole were the hardest to break apart); here is the Swordfish Inn, AKA the Swordy, where she used to drink with her new fishermen friends (it was once ranked second in a TV documentary entitled <em>The Toughest Pubs in Britain</em>); and here is the little house where she lodged with a couple she came to think of as her guardian angels, Denise and Lofty (Denise worked in a fishmongers; Lofty is a ship chandler). Finally, we go past Newlyn\u2019s lifeboat station and out on to the pontoons in the harbour to look at the boats. The creaking Filadelfia has, she says, finally given up the ghost, but there are two trawlers here that look just like it: rough, industrial vessels with huge derricks from which their nets drag. In her book, she likens these boats to prehistoric birds with skeletal wings, and as we gaze at them, clanking and inhospitable, it isn\u2019t hard to see why.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd714045c9f1d5c66c86f123a013e6770242672/0_0_6500_4338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the swordfish inn at newlyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Swordfish Inn, Newlyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Hawkins Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newlyn has the largest number of vessels in its administration of any port in the UK, 88% of which are \u201c10 metres and under\u201d inshore fishing boats \u2013 and the harbour looks busy to me, if not exactly bustling. And yet, as Ash writes in <em>Dark, Salt, Clear</em>, over the years \u201cthe pontoons\u2019 leaves have become sparser \u2013 a deciduous tree living a perpetual winter\u201d. The number of fishing vessels nationally has fallen by 29% since 1996. The money needed to buy and maintain a boat, and the cost of fuel, grows ever higher; combined with expensive struggles over quotas, these things have worked to put off a new generation from following their parents into the industry (though a trawler man can earn a good living, depending on the type of boat he has, and how good the fishing is in his waters). Does she feel Newlyn could survive a future without fishing? She shakes her head. \u201cYou know what they say: for every man at sea, there are three people [connected to the industry] on land. The guys I was with in the pub last night: one was a filleter, one works at the auctions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The men take a misanthropic pleasure in telling you how awful it is.

A lot don\u2019t. There is a sense of it being a hard life, but there\u2019s also sadness when a boat that has been in a family for generations suddenly isn\u2019t any more. It can be heart-wrenching [for a young person] to say: I can\u2019t live here, I can\u2019t do what my dad did, my education will take me elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI met a guy who, when he was 12, used to run off on a boat. \u2018See you in a week, Mum,\u2019 he would say, once it was too late for her to do anything about it. It was a brilliant escape, a rite of passage. The older men were heroes for him, and he wanted to be like them. Fishing comes with many frustrations. The men hate throwing fish off the boat [to stay within EU quotas], and there have been low points when there was very little money in it. It\u2019s very precarious. What if you can\u2019t go out? You\u2019re dependent on the weather, especially if you\u2019re a small boat: a crabber, say. But on the other hand, there are not many industries where you can rise up so high.\u201d Is being a skipper a bit like being a king? Or a God? She laughs. \u201cYes, maybe it is.\u201d</p> <p>Brexit is mentioned only rarely in her book; its politics are deliberately oblique. But the subject came up a lot while she was in Newlyn. The first trawler she went on, the Crystal Sea, was part of the Brexit flotilla that sailed into London in 2016 (organised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/15/no-deal-brexit-buccaneers-make-waves-on-the-tyne-nigel-farage\">Fishing for Leave</a>, it sailed from Ramsgate to Westminster, demanding that Britain take back control of its waters; under the common fisheries policy, European fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds up to 12 nautical miles from the coasts of member states). \u201cIts crew spoke about \u2018our seas\u2019, which always felt bonkers to me. Fish migrate, and when you\u2019re out there\u2026 the sea is vast. It feels as though it belongs to everyone. But we had good debates. They were kind of vital for me. They made me see that arguments about waters are very complicated; I stopped assuming that a certain point of view was right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d3f002a81b17fbd769f00cc8b558f370327d8eb/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"seaview from the deck of the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the deck\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the fishermen aren\u2019t dumb; they\u2019re not, by her telling, particularly hopeful that Brexit, even now it is agreed, will necessarily work to their benefit. After all, the fishing industry makes up only about 0.05% of the UK\u2019s GDP, and employs fewer than 12,000 people. \u201cI think they\u2019re preparing for disappointment,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the sense that they are always sold down the river. Politicians use them for a cause, and then they drop them. It\u2019s a long way [from London] down here, and you feel that rage a lot: their awareness that the debate is never about their place.\u201d What about the money the EU has long pumped into Cornwall? (It received some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/13/cornwall-council-eu-cornish-embassy-brussels-brexit\">\u00a380m a year in EU funding</a>, money that went into jobs, training and local infrastructure.) Did she ever point this out to them? \u201cYes, but they just ignore certain things. It\u2019s territorial for them.\u201d</p> <p>And what about her? In what ways did her experiences at sea change her? She isn\u2019t, she says, a particularly squeamish person; apart from when she was dealing with rays, a fish that seemed to be somehow more fiercely alive than the sole and the monkfish, and which could only be killed with a stab to the heart, she didn\u2019t mind the gutting and the filleting. She was learning new skills, and there was something so unexpectedly beautiful, she thinks, even about their arrabbiata-sauce coloured insides: \u201cThe brilliant thing is that every time I have fish now, I think about the supply chain. It has made me more appreciative, knowing that men are out there, risking their lives.\u201d Most people are, she thinks, very distant from their shrink-wrapped food: far <em>too</em> distant: \u201cI have the sense, living in London, of so rarely being involved in <em>real</em> things.\u201d</p> <p>Her time in Newlyn also taught her to think, both as a city person and one determined to be more green, in a more nuanced way about the environmental issues around fishing. \u201cPeople say we have got to get rid of the trawlers, because of the damage they do to the seabed. But I know that doing so will affect the lives of a whole community \u2013 though it\u2019s a relief when you hear about the smaller boats: there is a future that could be greener.\u201d British people need to start eating more hake, she thinks: \u201cWe catch so much of it.\u201d (The fishermen of St Ives, incidentally, refer to themselves as Hakes, while the Newlyn men, with whom they are fiercely rivalrous, like to call the north coasters the Scaly Backs.)</p> <p>But she does not want to romanticise. As her book makes plain, fishing takes its effects on mental health; some men come to have issues with alcohol (though it is strictly forbidden at sea), and depression is a problem, too. \u201cI hope that I show the limits of close community, as well as its benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own problems with depression in the past, and it was good to talk to the fishermen about their mental health. I recognised the disassociation they sometimes felt \u2013 it\u2019s how they survive \u2013 and how scary it can sometimes be.\u201d A fisherman\u2019s life is one of extremes: his sense of jeopardy swiftly replaced by one of celebration when he arrives home safely and hits the pub. As one of the men, Nathan, once told her: when a fisherman is at home, he\u2019s always counting the days until he leaves; and when he\u2019s at sea, he\u2019s always counting the days until he\u2019ll be back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b52a42a434efc60157ecd40aed91f5a1cc097e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"on board the filadelfia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On board the Filadelfia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lamorna Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On her last night on the Filadelfia, Don cooked (how on earth did he do it?) one of the best meals she has ever eaten \u2013 a huge roast dinner of potatoes, mashed swede, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, parsnips and beef \u2013 after which the crew, in spite of their bloated bellies, landed the best catch of their trip, the derricks moaning loudly as they pulled up the immense haul of prized turbot and cuttlefish (\u201clike waiting for lottery numbers to come up,\u201d Ash thought, as she waited to see what the nets had brought). But after this, the mood changed. No one slept much on that last night.</p> <p>Fishermen call it \u201cchannelling\u201d: when thoughts of home, and all the people in it, swim through your mind all night, waking you repeatedly. One of the men tells her that the term is drawn from the word \u201cchannel\u201d in its spiritual sense: the conveying of a spirit from another world to this one. (The link between these two worlds is the boat.) And she came to understand that it\u2019s a necessary process. The next morning, as the Filadelfia approached the harbour and a mobile phone signal was once again possible, the boat became simply another place of work rather than, as it was just moments before, the only world that mattered. And now it was the land that seemed suddenly mysterious: a single, unbroken entity she had found herself unable to imagine while she was at sea. Arrival was at once both exhilarating, and anticlimactic. Only when she came face to face with Lofty again did she realise how rancid she smelled \u2013 and how little her stench had mattered to her until that moment.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s book comes into the world garlanded with praise. William Dalrymple has called her a new star of nonfiction: \u201cprecise, perceptive, humane and sensitive\u201d. What will she do next? Does she have a plan? What, for her, could ever top Newlyn? \u201cI always have lots of plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to go to Texas for a year, and write about my family on my father\u2019s side: my grandfather was from Dallas, and after the war he set up the Marxist Leninist Society of London. For me, Cornwall is very blue, and I want to look at redness\u2026\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cOr perhaps I\u2019ll do a PhD about coastal communities. I need to wait for the pull.\u201d In the meantime, though, of one thing she is certain: that she must go back to using an old-fashioned \u201cbrick\u201d phone. \u201cI enjoyed listening to the men at sea. Out there, I realised how our phones are stopping us from listening, and I want to get back really to listening to people.\u201d Her eyes, which today are precisely the same colour as the English channel, meet my own, and hold them for a long minute.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town </em>is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99).

  "<p>The show is on, but not open. The masterpiece hangs unseen. The museum is as silent as the isolation in which the artist tries to work, uncertain of any future as the virus rages without vaccine. Art now waits upon science.</p> <p>The four Tates closed first. \u201cIt is strange and sad to think of them occupied by art, but empty of the audiences they serve,\u201d reflects Frances Morris, the director of Tate Modern. \u201cTo shut such recently opened shows as Warhol and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/16/steve-mcqueen-tate-modern-review\" title=\"\">McQueen</a> is distressing; so much work had gone into Tate Modern\u2019s 20th anniversary.\u201d The National Gallery\u2019s Titian, years in the planning, closed after just a few days. The exhibition reunited what director Gabriele Finaldi calls \u201cpossibly the most important cycle of pictures ever painted\u201d, adding: \u201cBut how can we think of that, before humanity?\u201d</p> <p>Art\u2019s cyclical certainties are over too. Next year\u2019s Venice Biennale hangs in the balance. Its lively homespun equivalent in <a href=\"https://glasgowinternational.org/postponed-glasgow-international-2020/\" title=\"\">Glasgow</a>, just about to open, is now delayed for a year. At least the artists\u2019 contracts are being honoured, as they are in our public galleries. In New York, some staff at the Guggenheim <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-workers-pace-gallery-guggenheim-museum-coronavirus-1202681760/\" title=\"\">have expressed fear</a><a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-workers-pace-gallery-guggenheim-museum-coronavirus-1202681760/\" title=\"\">s </a><a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-workers-pace-gallery-guggenheim-museum-coronavirus-1202681760/\" title=\"\">they will not be paid</a> and the Metropolitan Museum has told staff it can only guarantee pay until April.</p> <p>The earliest effects of Covid-19 predictably centred on money, not art. The great selling shop of Art Basel Hong Kong was instantly cancelled, and replaced with online viewing rooms. As with Asos, customers could consult their smartphones then buy their Georg Baselitz from the dealer. Nobody rushed. The market was quiet, possibly chastened. And so it remains, collectors truly home alone now with their costly purchases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5e2ae6e452bfd97ccc4061401938c1ca434e2d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5e2ae6e452bfd97ccc4061401938c1ca434e2d0/0_357_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guggenheim Museum in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guggenheim Museum in New York closed on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ben Luke, of the<em> Art Newspaper</em>, thinks the whole gallery system is under threat. He says: \u201cIt is not going to look anything like it did before the pandemic. The ecosystem was already fragile, with small but influential galleries showing really interesting artists, who are then swallowed up by mega-galleries. Anything very much smaller than Gagosian, etc, may now struggle.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really want to talk about blessings at this moment but maybe there will be a lot less bling. Lately we have had so much awful, overblown art. On the other hand, artists who live hand to mouth already, or who make work that isn\u2019t saleable \u2013 performance, installation, conceptual art \u2013 may have to stop. The precariousness of the freelance community that underpins so much of the art world is a massive concern. We might lose the really interesting emergent art, the stuff of the future, if we are not careful.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.galleriesnow.net/shows/tim-stoner/\" title=\"\">Tim Stoner</a>, a Beck\u2019s Futures winner, had just opened a show of marvellous semi-figurative landscapes at Modern Art, in London, when the virus hit. He says: \u201cIt was four years\u2019 work, I wanted to make a museum-sized statement and, ironically, the gallery delayed it a few months so it would get a longer slot. I\u2019m gutted it closed, but I spoke to my neighbour who is a postman, and his situation is infinitely worse. I\u2019ve spent years learning how to survive as an artist and, to be honest, I feel like I have been in isolation for decades.\u201d</p> <p>Every contemporary gallery with the money has pulled together an online experience, where you\u2019re invited to tour and roam. There are 3D models of sculptures; augmented reality experiences; an ocean of high-resolution images. But everything is miniaturised and flattened behind our glowing screens. Similarly, Royal College of Art students are understandably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/24/students-criticise-royal-college-of-arts-plan-to-hold-degree-show-online\" title=\"\">protesting</a> at plans to assess their degree shows online. Morris says: \u201cMy final view as I left Tate Modern last week was of Kara Walker\u2019s monumental Hyundai Commission <em>Fons American</em><em>us</em>, emptied of water in a Turbine Hall emptied of people. For me, no amount of digital content can ever compensate for the thrill of walking into that vast space and seeing art with the public.\u201d</p> <p>Still, we should not disdain the internet, which now allows us to wander St Petersburg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49YeFsx1rIw&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Hermitage</a> museum for more than five hours, to see the magnified brushstrokes of a Van Gogh that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye, or to learn painting from scratch with Keith Tyson, a Turner Prize winner, on his invigorating <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/isolationartschool/\" title=\"\">isolationartschool</a> on Instagram.

What\u2019s needed is a vanguard of modern Medicis commissioning artists for their own pleasure. And while the Arts Council last week announced a \u00a3160m bailout for institutions, it will take far more to rescue individual artists. Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery, believes galleries must take the lead. He says: \u201cIt will be our collective role to support artists at this time. When we avail our platforms to artists, the direst problems of the world can be understood with honesty and hope. I think we have to look at Roosevelt\u2019s Public Works of Art Project, which was aimed at providing work for artists during the depression.\u201d</p> <p>The Serpentine is relaunching Do It, in which artists\u2019 instructions for making art can be interpreted by others anywhere at any time. Obrist says: \u201cSo many museums are live streaming, it seems important to do things offline too, so anyone can realise a sculpture by Franz West or follow Louise Bourgeois\u2019s instructions to smile at a stranger.\u201d</p> <p>The landscape of art will alter. The cost of city living was already prohibitive; some artists will move. Others may change the kind of work they do. Stoner says he will draw more; the artist Henry Ward is now making kitchen-table sculptures and giving lessons on how to sculpt at home, on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7c66551157d7b9c66f195a55dc79badd43b44aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c66551157d7b9c66f195a55dc79badd43b44aa/0_22_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tai Shani\u2019s Turner-prize-shortlisted artwork DC Semiramis.

Almost \u00a39m has already been generated in the first week.</p> <p>Nobody knows what the art world will look like when the disaster passes, but a spirit of hope survives. Art museums in <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/china-south-korea-museums-coronavirus-1803831\" title=\"\">China and South Korea</a> have already reopened.

Other galleries are following the Serpentine\u2019s \u201cSlow Programming\u201d model, which commissions art for a long time in the future.</p> <p>And, at the National Gallery, scholarship, conservation and plans for great exhibitions are forging ahead. Finaldi says: \u201cThe second world war was the last time we had to do what we\u2019re doing now, and all our catalogues have their origins in that quietude. What this time tells us is what we value, who we think we are. This collection is a communal effort by the British over two centuries and when the virus ends, I believe there will be a mad rush back to art.\u201d</p> <p><em>Laura Cumming is the Observer\u2019s art critic</em></p>",
  "<p>When Hollie Pearne-Webb was growing up, she had an indoor pastime that drove her mum potty. She had fallen hard for hockey from her very first session, as an eight-year-old, at the club near her Derbyshire home. Now she hated to be without a stick in her hand. \u201cI was always knocking around a ball inside the house, hitting things,\u201d says Pearne-Webb with a laugh.</p> <p>The schoolgirl Hollie never imagined herself playing for the British women\u2019s hockey team, much less <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/gb-women-hockey-historic-gold-shootout-final-olympics\">scoring the winning penalty in an Olympic final.</a> But she would, at least, recognise the game Pearne-Webb has been playing on her living room carpet recently.

She was expecting it \u2013 everyone in her team was. That didn\u2019t make the disappointment any less acute. \u201cEvery part of our life is geared towards going to the Olympic Games,\u201d says Pearne-Webb, \u201cso having that moved changes so much.\u201d</p> <p>For athletes who have been mentally and physically readying themselves for peak performance in August, a 12-month delay can be a career-ender. \u201cThere are probably a few girls in the team wondering: \u2018Can I do this for another year?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5f6e654cd6522511afa6c521cd4a35da79df112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f6e654cd6522511afa6c521cd4a35da79df112/0_6_1386_832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hollie Pearne-Webb\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hollie Pearne-Webb in action for England in the EuroHockey World Championships in Antwerp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phanie Lecocq/EPA-EFE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andthen there\u2019s the prospect of no hockey for months. The longest an international player usually goes between games is two or three weeks: the current hiatus is likely to be \u201cmuch, much longer\u201d. Happily, the team remains fully funded until next March, but Pearne-Webb still has to find a way to captain a 25-strong squad who can\u2019t be near each other. Even her long-time mentor, Kate Richardson-Walsh, who led the team to their gold medal at the last Olympics, hasn\u2019t any experience in remote captaincy.</p> <p>Like any good leader, Pearne-Webb has already identified some positives. The delayed Games gives her and the coach, Mark Hager, another year to develop a young squad of players who have stuttered since Rio. After the retirements of the power couple Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh, Pearne-Webb\u2019s England team were knocked out in the quarter-finals of their home World Cup in 2018.</p> <p>Last year, their coach in Rio, Danny Kerry, moved to oversee the men\u2019s side and under Hager England were routed 8-0 by Holland in a record defeat in their EuroHockey semi. Back-to-back wins against Chile last autumn, to qualify finally for Tokyo, came as a considerable relief.</p> <p>So Pearne-Webb knows the bonding power of adversity. \u201cThese sort of things do gel you, going through tougher times. I know we\u2019ve felt that on the pitch throughout the last four years, which have been a bit of a rollercoaster. So although we\u2019re not together, team dynamics are pretty good and we\u2019re pulling each other along.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2c9615b6aba1dd02602d717832f6ea679581dd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2c9615b6aba1dd02602d717832f6ea679581dd5/0_0_5192_3461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Britain captain Hollie Pearne-Webb holds a scroll reading \u2018Welcome to Tokyo 2020\u201d after their victory over Chile Women in November 2019 meant they qualifued for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pearne-Webb holds a scroll reading \u2018Welcome to Tokyo 2020\u201d after their victory over Chile Women in November 2019 meant they qualifued for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 29-year-old has always seen herself as a temporary captain, caretaking the team until the return of her good friend Alex Danson. On a holiday in Kenya two years ago, a freak accident left Danson with mild brain trauma. That life-changing injury, combined with her sister, Claire, being paralysed after a cycling accident, finally<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/great-britain-hockey-captain-alex-danson-announces-retirement\"> caused Danson to retire from the sport</a> in February. \u201cIt was only then it sunk in that I would be captaining the team to the Olympics,\u201d says Pearne-Webb. \u201cThen I started worrying: \u2018Am I doing what I should be? Am I doing a good job?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her self-doubts have been helped, she says, by listening to interviews given by Richardson-Walsh (\u201cI heard her saying she only felt she got the captaincy right within the last year\u201d) but those around her have no difficulty identifying her inspirational qualities. Pearne-Webb\u2019s never-say-die attitude was key to her side\u2019s Rio triumph, not least in their final match, where Great Britain spent most of the time against the Netherlands defending their hearts out. It was her ice-cool composure, taking the final penalty shuffle, that gave them victory.</p> <p>So Pearne-Webb knows a bit about staying calm in a crisis. She\u2019s also an economics graduate and a part-time management accountant, working two days a week for the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs, where her role includes risk assessment and financial planning. \u201cAs someone who likes to know what\u2019s going on, the current situation is a challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m breaking it down on a daily and weekly basis, what can I do right now.<em> </em>I like structure and routine, so I\u2019ve been filling my calendar every night \u2013 work, study, training, lunch and a fresh-air slot where I go out for a ride on my road bike.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/28/england-cricket-captain-heather-knight-signs-up-for-nhs-volunteer-scheme\">England captain Heather Knight signs up for NHS volunteer scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While she finds the economic implications of the pandemic \u201creally quite scary\u201d, she has taken some comfort in the way it has inspired people to think about their physical activity. \u201cGoing outside once a day you see more people running than ever. I\u2019m hoping one of the things to come out of this is people finding a little bit more time for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Gender equality is another of Pearne-Webb\u2019s concerns \u2013 hockey is a rare team sport in which male and female internationals are paid the same. In January she joined the Women\u2019s Sport Trust\u2019s Unlock campaign, aimed at breaking down the barriers that still remain for women\u2019s sport. She foresees a real danger that recent improvements in its funding and profile could suffer in an economic downturn. \u201cIt is a worry that all the hard work and the years it\u2019s taken to get to this point could be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Before then, however, there are some more immediate priorities. These include redecorating her hallway (she finds DIY therapeutic) and gym sessions with her ready-made training partner \u2013 her husband, Tom, who secretly wishes he was a professional athlete himself. And if the BBC does respond to requests to replay past Olympic triumphs to boost the nation\u2019s spirits, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get to see Pearne-Webb in action again. \u201cIt would be great if they replayed the Rio final,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually seen it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Strange things happen in a crisis. For one, it can dawn on Mike Ashley that pretending that a sports shop is an essential public service is absurd. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/sports-direct-mike-ashley-apologises-for-poor-covid-19-actions\" title=\"\">Friday\u2019s apology from the Sports Direct founder</a> seemed to be more about communication \u2013 \u201cill-judged and poorly timed\u201d emails to overworked government ministers \u2013 than his original ludicrous attempt to keep his shops open, but it was still an uncharacteristic climbdown.</p> <p>Even JD Wetherspoon\u2019s Tim Martin, who has never previously appeared to give a damn what anyone thinks, paused to consider he may have made a mistake. Having announced staff would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/24/wetherspoons-denies-abandoning-staff-in-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">only be paid until the moment the pubs were shut</a>, he then said they would get their wages at the next payroll date provided the government agreed a reimbursement scheme in time.</p> <p>Can anything be read into these examples? Perhaps not. It is possible that freewheeling entrepreneurs, and British business in general, will revert to pre-crisis ways when the coronavirus emergency passes. There will, after all, be huge pressure from investors to recover lost revenues and restore battered share prices in the recovery phase.</p> <p>But, equally, this period of intense public scrutiny of business behaviour \u2013 where companies have been divided into heroes and villains \u2013 may produce lasting changes. One can speculate on a few.</p> <p>First, tolerance for corporate tax minimisation tactics will be roughly zero. The government will be facing a towering increase in public debt, plus a demand that more cash be spent on the NHS. It will need money from somewhere and could feel emboldened to chase perceived underpayers and financial engineers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07620e0e9e366caff937ef5b839c0838859ea28a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07620e0e9e366caff937ef5b839c0838859ea28a/0_68_4567_2740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Martin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Martin: given pause.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So look out, private equity: a tactic of loading companies with debt to minimise tax payments may no longer be tolerated. Corporate Britain has been running too lightly on its shock absorbers. A tax system that rewards well-capitalised firms that can withstand a crisis would be an obvious improvement.</p> <p>Second, appetite for state interventions will increase. Train operating companies\u2019 franchises have been suspended for six months, but one doubts that rotten system will ever be restored. There is a strong case for seeing what the state can achieve instead. Privatised social care also looks ripe for a state takeover.</p> <p>Third, the balance of power could shift in the eternal battle over pay differentials. Will it still be considered acceptable for a chief executive to collect 100 times what the median worker in a firm is paid? Bosses at some firms have already volunteered for salary cuts during the crisis phase. Pressure to re-set pay arrangements permanently will be intense. Unions in the supermarket sector, for instance, would be well-advised to use the crisis to press for more for their members.</p> <p>Fourth, big companies\u2019 treatment of suppliers may come under the microscope. The crisis has exposed the fragile position of small firms that trade with the giants of their industry. Supermarkets have generally behaved honourably by accelerating payments, but Wetherspoons\u2019 refusal to pay suppliers until pubs reopen was as shocking as its approach to staff. The government now has an opportunity to change the rules of the payments game.</p> <p>Finally, the big unknown is how, or if, consumers\u2019 behaviour will change. Cheap trainers and cheap beer have perennial appeal, so it\u2019s probably fanciful to think that Sports Direct and Wetherspoons will suffer a backlash that causes them real difficulty.</p> <p>All the same, shoppers have had a rapid education in how companies behave when it matters most. Ethical radars have become more finely tuned. Companies that treat their workers and suppliers well should shout about it. They may find they are rewarded.</p> <h2>In future, state aid must only go to firms making green commitments<br></h2> <p>The economic contagion of the Covid-19 virus threatens to claim green investment as another casualty. Disruption to the environmental agenda is inevitable; the key question is whether the outbreak will slow the pace of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy\" title=\"\">clean energy</a> developers for a few months only, or whether the renewable energy industry \u2013 and general progress towards green goals such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\" title=\"\">Paris agreement</a> \u2013 will be derailed for years.</p> <p>Last year was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-fall-for-seventh-year-in-a-row\" title=\"\">a record year for</a>Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-fall-for-seventh-year-in-a-row\" title=\"\">renewable energy generation</a> in Britain: the UK\u2019s wind turbines, solar panels and bioenergy plants contributed more than a third of the nation\u2019s electricity. But if records are to continue being set in the UK, and across the world, then global leaders will need to make explicitly green policy choices.</p> <p>At the most basic level, the clean energy industry will face the same hurdles as many other sectors in the wake of the pandemic: a reduced workforce; a reliance on vulnerable, concentrated manufacturing hubs; and a greater struggle to access finance. But even as restrictions ease, deeper challenges will remain. The companies that the world relies on to meet our green ambitions will be financially battered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">this sudden crash</a> and the collapse of commodity prices. Governments too will be stretched by demands for bailouts to keep economies afloat.</p> <p>The answer must be to incentivise the progress of the clean energy industry by offering government support only to companies which promise to meet green targets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/24/uk-airlines-and-airports-told-not-to-expect-industry-wide-covid-19-bailout\" title=\"\">Airlines</a> could commit to emissions reductions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-every-major-uk-and-european-carmaker-to-stop-or-cut-production\" title=\"\">carmakers</a> to accelerating the shift to electric vehicles, and all companies should be sourcing at least some of their electricity from renewable generators.</p> <p>No company should be offered access to taxpayer life-support without proof that they can help find the green shoots in the rubble of the global economy.</p> <h2>More US jobs will be lost if employers can\u2019t trust the White House<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">The shocking US unemployment figures</a> reported last week only look like getting worse as March draws to a close. Jobless claims surged to almost 3.3 million in the week ending 21 March. This week, the workers who could not previously contact state agencies to register for unemployment will join those more recently laid off, potentially pushing the increase nearer to 6 million or 7 million.</p> <p>The prospect of several months out of work will leave scars on a country where workers are expected to fund their skills training and education as much as their healthcare and housing.</p> <p>A $2 trillion bailout agreed by Congress that includes $250bn of cash to be paid directly to households is expected to limit the economic impact of Covid-19. It may also restrict the growth in unemployment if companies cut wages in the light of the government handout in order to keep staff on the payroll.</p> <p>What it won\u2019t do is leave workers in a position to simply pick up where they left off whenever the lockdown is lifted. Their employers may no longer exist. Their credit bills might have skyrocketed.</p> <p>That is especially true when businesses are receiving mixed messages from local, state and federal officials. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow says a rebound in the US economy in the second half of the year is possible, once counties with only a few virus victims end their lockdowns. This analysis defies what we know about the virus and how it works.</p> <p>Kudlow seems to believe the virus stops being transmitted when people cross county lines. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, grappling with a major outbreak of Covid-19, would beg to differ.</p> <p>It is a message that must change before too many business owners, increasingly sceptical of the advice from federal government, lay off staff at an even faster rate. If the US fails to stage a solid recovery, the rest of the world will struggle to mend itself.</p>",
  "<p>I met Matthew Macfadyen on one of those days in ancient history, a couple of weeks ago, when we were still not quite sure whether to make silly jokes about elbow-touching greetings, or to fear for civilisation\u2019s immediate future. In many ways, Macfadyen is the archetypal actor for this kind of moment, a master of shifting and ambiguous tone, whose frequent bursts of laughter often threaten to turn hollow. One of the many joys of his portrayal of the bullied and bullying son-in-law Tom Wambsgans in the HBO show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\">Succession</a></em> \u2013 arguably the defining contribution to the defining TV drama of our times \u2013 is his winning ability to switch from empathy to psychopathy in a heartbeat.</p> <p>Next month, Macfadyen will bring all of that gift for nuance to the three-part ITV drama <em>Quiz</em>, in which he plays <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ingram\">Major Charles Ingram</a>, the \u201ccoughing major\u201d who was convicted of cheating his way to the top prize on <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> in 2001. The show, an adaptation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/12/quiz-review-exploration-of-the-thin-line-between-courtroom-and-showbusiness\">West End play by James Graham</a>, has been directed for television by Stephen Frears. Macfadyen\u2019s major takes the hot seat across from Michael Sheen, who adds Chris Tarrant to his repertoire of uncanny impersonations.</p> <p>If I\u2019m honest I hadn\u2019t really expected to enjoy the miniseries, which I watched in preview. I felt I knew the story of the major, who was eventually convicted of the deception, along with his wife Diana and their coughing accomplice Tecwen Whittock, in a widely publicised court case, but I was wrong. Graham\u2019s script and Frears\u2019s direction \u2013 but above all Macfadyen\u2019s characterisation \u2013 brings unexpected humanity as well as fabulous observational comedy to the events. It takes you back to a curious time when the whole nation was in thrall to the quiz show \u2013 audience figures peaked at 19 million \u2013 which was the first of a string of British TV formats to be sold to the American networks. Major Ingram emerges as a fall guy to the feverish obsessions of a different era. His million-pound appearance came the day before 9/11.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHRXtJoNL28\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHRXtJoNL28?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHRXtJoNL28\">Watch a trailer for ITV miniseries Quiz</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Macfadyen was sent the script when he was filming the last episode of the second season of <em>Succession</em> onboard a superyacht off the coast of Croatia. \u201cI\u2019d known about the story,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I thought I knew more about it than I did. And I knew that Sian Clifford was playing the wife \u2013 and I was a big fan of hers from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/fleabag\">Fleabag</a></em> \u2013 and Stephen Frears, of course, and it was quite different from Tom Wambsgans so I immediately said yes.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things that makes the drama so watchable is that it maintains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami\">some reasonable doubt</a> about the scam itself right to the end.</p> <p>Even Macfadyen wasn\u2019t quite sure what to think. \u201cSian and I kept sort of grabbing each other during filming going: \u2018They did it! Guilty! Yeah.\u2019 Then, five minutes later: \u2018No, no, no, they didn\u2019t!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In some senses, I suggest, Ingram adds to Macfadyen\u2019s gift for playing that kind of contemporary everyman who finds himself suddenly in the midst of events way beyond his control.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think we all are like that, really.

He and the producers and Frears knew they had to persuade Macfadyen to take the role. \u201cComing from the theatre, I\u2019d known Matthew as one of our great stage actors, but vastly underappreciated,\u201d Graham says. \u201cBut then like everyone else, seeing him appear, or emerge, in <em>Succession</em> was a revelation. That is the most extraordinary performance, both buffoonish and terrifying simultaneously.\u201d</p> <p>Macfadyen finds a way to play the major as both a quite conventional military man and a genuine enigma. \u201cThe real Ingram has been lampooned to a degree that I think is out of proportion to his alleged crime,\u201d Graham says. \u201cI think Matthew is perfect because he does have this dashing aura of a Hollywood star, but also looks and feels incredibly nice. You just like him, everyone does.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting talking with Macfadyen it is hard to disagree with that impression. Nothing he says is quite in earnest, and he has a habit of laughing at your lamest joke. You can\u2019t help thinking some of this is performance, but then feel guilty for doubting his sincerity.</p> <p>Macfadyen is married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/17/keeley-hawes-we-all-need-to-be-more-positive-thriller-suspense-traitors\">Keeley Hawes</a>, who he met when they made <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/spooks\">Spooks</a></em> together. They have two children in their teens, along with a 19-year-old son from Hawes\u2019s first marriage. The thought of actors off stage and at home, particularly when they are married to other actors, is always intriguing. Both he and Hawes can convincingly inhabit any shade of emotion. How do their arguments go?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ingram is a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He laughs. \u201cI am really not good without a script. I\u2019m an absolutely hopeless fibber in real life. But even when I\u2019m acting I never feel I am inhabiting any emotion. You are just doing what the character does.\u201d</p> <p>He insists that he and Hawes are not competitive with each other, but both of them are in a rich run of TV success: Hawes with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/07/the-durrells-review-corfu-brits-keeley-hawes-final-series\">The Durrells</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/23/it-makes-you-go-oh-my-god-how-line-of-duty-broke-the-laws-of-police-shows\">Line of Duty</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/26/bodyguard-review-jed-mercurios-latest-thriller-is-as-dark-and-moreish-as-we-hoped\">The Bodyguard</a></em>, he with <em>Any Human Heart</em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/oct/14/ripper-street-a-ridiculously-underrated-victorian-thriller\">Ripper Street</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/04/howards-end-review-no-rollicking-finale-just-wit-and-humanity\">Howards End</a></em>, as well as <em>Succession</em>.</p> <p>He puts it down mostly to a determination to keep working.</p> <p>\u201cI think the trick is keep doing good work while you wait for those roles where everything comes together,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Keeley had that with <em>Line of Duty</em>.

I mean, if you\u2019re lucky enough to get sent things and they sort of blow your hair back then, great. Quite often though my immediate thought is \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t cast myself as this\u2019. Or, you know, \u2018Why didn\u2019t they ask Damian Lewis?\u2019 But then there are some parts you think: \u2018Yeah I know what makes him tick.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And that was the case with Charles Ingram?</p> <p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a very particular kind of Englishman, self-effacing and traditional, a wearer of slacks.\u201d</p> <p>And apparently fantastically corruptible?</p> <p>\u201cWell that\u2019s the thing, was he? The tabloid narrative was that Diana, his wife, was the sort of controller, the Lady Macbeth, but who knows? A posh cheat? We rush to know and we rush to condemn. But maybe we always need to look a bit harder.\u201d</p> <p>Macfadyen did not find it hard to remain agnostic. \u201cYou are just playing incremental moments, so you can\u2019t add a wash of guilt or innocence anyway. Now and again Stephen would say, \u2018Let\u2019s turn the dial a bit one way on their culpability and then not so much\u2019 \u2013 just so he had options in the cutting room.\u201d</p> <p>It is a tribute to Macfadyen\u2019s skills that he could make every gradation of those reactions believable. I asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/lucy-prebble-interview-litvinenko-very-expensive-poison-old-vic-enron-succession\">Lucy Prebble</a>, one of the scriptwriting team on <em>Succession</em>, what it was like to write with his character in mind. \u201cI remember once half-joking [to Matthew] on set about a particular take: \u2018Yes, but Tom would feel 7% less shame,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe next take, on the monitor, there it was, not eight, not six, but 7% less shame. And completely true. It is the most exciting thing for a writer, because it gives you a completely open field in creating. It\u2019s what they mean when they say of an actor that there\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t do. There is nothing Matthew can\u2019t do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1002979be6226f4614b3a46d1377e820ab2720f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1002979be6226f4614b3a46d1377e820ab2720f/0_0_3456_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Tom and Nicholas Braun as cousin Greg in Succession.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Tom and Nicholas Braun as cousin Greg in Succession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Macfadyen discovered he might have that talent quite early. His mother trained as an actor and later taught drama. They did a bit of am-dram together, including <em>Oh! What a Lovely War</em>, and whenever there was mention of a school play, he recalls, \u201cmy heart was immediately banging away\u201d.</p> <p>His upbringing also supplied those elements of dislocation and hyper-observation that seem at the heart of his best performances. Macfadyen\u2019s father was a physicist who became an engineer in the oil industry. They lived in places as varied as Great Yarmouth, Aberdeen, London and Jakarta. \u201cThere was a lot of me standing next to a teacher announcing \u2018Say hello to Matthew, children\u2019,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He saw it as an adventure rather than any kind of trauma. \u201cMum and Dad were always excited by new places, so my brother and I were excited too,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He was something of a prodigy, accepted at Rada at 17, and then into Declan Donnellan\u2019s acclaimed Cheek By Jowl touring company at 21. He credits the latter in particular with opening his eyes to that magic potential of \u201creally standing in someone else\u2019s shoes\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDeclan is a big proponent of the idea that everything that feeds you as an actor comes from outside,\u201d he says. \u201cThe audience pays not for you to feel things, but for you to see things. You are not summoning emotions, it is all out there in front of you.\u201d</p> <p>He and Donnellan have remained friends.

Matthew always understood that.\u201d</p> <p>He stresses one other thing that has always struck him as unusual in his experience. \u201cMatthew always had an extraordinarily close relationship with his parents, both father and mother. They were around, somehow, when we were in Rio one time. I remember once we were rehearsing and his dad came and they sat in the cafe at the next table and I was so impressed by how easy they were with each other. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d</p> <p>Donnellan is, like everyone, addicted to <em>Succession</em>. \u201cWhat is really wonderful about the series, is how they all are about the vacuousness of all that wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes you want to go down on your knees and thank God that you are not rich.\u201d</p> <p>It seems a telling coincidence that the cast of <em>Succession</em> did their first read-through of the script on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. It felt something like an omen, for their tale of power and its discontents. \u201cEveryone, all the Americans, kept telling us, you know, the election will be fine, he can\u2019t win,\u201d Macfadyen recalls. \u201cThen we went to the producer Adam McKay\u2019s apartment that evening to watch the results come in. There was that truly terrible moment when it became clear what was going to happen. And everyone went a bit quiet and disappeared into their phones.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l9TKHvvaMfE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TKHvvaMfE\">Watch a trailer for the second series of Succession</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Since that night, it has often appeared that something of the barely credible character of Trump\u2019s America has been feeding directly into the two seasons of <em>Succession</em> almost by osmosis. No comic excess or private humiliation seems beyond either drama. \u201cI hope so,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThere does sometimes seem some feedback. Like a horrible loop of shit, you might say.\u201d</p> <p>The Roy family in the drama seem most directly based on the Murdoch dynasty, but in the nastier moments of their familial struggles they also seem to reference Trump and his dreadful sons.

Critics of the series suggest that it is hard to sympathise with any of the characters. The genius of it, it seems to me, is that however loathsome and cynical they are, you can still sympathise with all of them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Macfadyen says. \u201cThe Roy children are all terrified.

The pair of them have become a kind of contemporary Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, tragically unsure of their roles, but scheming like everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, however badly they behave,\u201d Macfadyen says, \u201cthey still think they are heroic, or doing their best under very difficult circumstances. Like all of us, Tom is in a film of his own making called Tom Wambsgans, his trials and tribulations.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the collective angst comes from the way the series is filmed.</p> <p>\u201cWe shoot these great long scenes, often with three cameras. And you are never sure whether the camera is on you. It feels like a play and it is liberating because you are forced to listen all the time, like you would in real life.

It was a disciplined portrayal that gradually thawed as the episodes went by, taking Quinn from stern, focused operative to questioning outlier. The series introduced Macfadyen to his wife, Keeley Hawes: they\u2019ve been married since 2004.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvHX_jOS-6w\">In My Father\u2019s Den (Brad McGann, 2004)</a><br></strong>Not enough people saw New Zealander Brad McGann\u2019s heartfelt family tragedy, which gave Macfadyen his first big-screen lead and earned him a British independent film award nomination for best actor. It\u2019s a classic prodigal son role: a feted war photographer returning to his Kiwi homeland following his father\u2019s death, uncovering dark family secrets. The script spirals into melodrama, but Macfadyen gives it a quiet, humane and emotional core.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Afx8MGg00g\">Pride and Prejudice (Joe Wright, 2005)</a><br></strong>Many think of Colin Firth as the quintessential screen Mr Darcy, but Macfadyen was at least his equal: a more broodingly sensual take on the character, teeming with interior emotional conflict, which fits well with the unbuttoned realism of director Joe Wright\u2019s interpretation. Costumed and styled with a scruffy dishevelment that was equal parts rakish and little-boy-lost, his performance didn\u2019t please all die-hard Austenites, but younger viewers swooned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8004817a2795bfc97b5abfd4c5780f3164cb64c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8004817a2795bfc97b5abfd4c5780f3164cb64c/0_70_3072_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen as Oblonsky in Joe Wright\u2019s Anna Karenina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as Oblonsky in Joe Wright\u2019s Anna Karenina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Working Title Films/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnzblqTGNnk\">Anna Karenina (Joe Wright, 2012)</a><br></strong>Joe Wright has been good to Macfadyen. The actor may not be as prominently featured in this whirring, theatrical, hyper-stylised adaptation of the Tolstoy novel, but in a film of wildly variable performances, his feckless, faithless Oblonsky \u2013 brother rather than lover of Keira Knightley\u2019s heroine this time \u2013 is one of the very best things in it. He\u2019s a cool, dry breeze of comic relief in otherwise hot, heavy surroundings.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/succession\">Succession, HBO (2018-)</a><br></strong>Following a career heavy on polite British period pieces, the role of Tom Wambsgans in Jesse Armstrong\u2019s critically adored US television drama is a wildly against-type opportunity that the actor palpably relishes. As the ambitious, obsequious third husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-inspired heiress, Macfadyen wittily plays him as both repulsive and queasily sympathetic: a hungry add-on to the Roy family who, as much as he plays their game, will never quite have their respect.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHRXtJoNL28\">Quiz, ITV (2020)</a><br></strong>Macfadyen returns to British TV next month as the <em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em> fraudster Major Charles Ingram in Stephen Frears\u2019s miniseries. It\u2019s a morally and psychologically complex part well suited to the actor\u2019s blend of vulnerability and very English propriety: his tragicomic performance is integral to making the series more than just a snarky take on a tabloid scandal. You may wind up thinking of Ingram a bit differently. <strong>Guy Lodge</strong></p>",
  "<p>In one of the creepiest episodes of the vintage American TV series <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, residents of the apparently idyllic Peaksville find themselves cut off from the rest of the world, terrorised by the petulant yet godlike mind of a small child. Adapted from a story by Jerome Bixby, the episode (ironically entitled It\u2019s a Good Life) struck a chilling chord with audiences in 1961, watching from behind their picket fences, mesmerised by its darkly comic vision of a world in which failing to think happy thoughts was punishable by death, or worse.</p> <p>You can see a trace of It\u2019s a Good Life (which has continued to resonate through popular culture) in <em>Vivarium</em>, the second feature from director Lorcan Finnegan and writer Garret Shanley, a paranoid fable in which the aspiration of acquiring a dream home turns into an increasingly surreal nightmare of imprisonment. Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots (who recently co-starred in Riley Stearns\u2019s <em>The Art of Self Defen</em><em>se</em>) are Tom and Gemma, the young couple searching for a place of their own. She\u2019s a teacher, he\u2019s a tree surgeon; together, they have been urged to get on the property ladder. But finding the perfect place is proving tricky.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One minute Tom and Gemma are happy-go-lucky young lovers, the next they\u2019re terrified, exhausted wrecks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When they meet creepy estate agent Martin, whose awkward unearthly smile wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a David Lynch remake of <em>Galaxy Quest</em>, the couple\u2019s instinct is to bolt. Instead (presumably driven by their desperation to become homeowners) they follow Martin to Yonder, a Stepford-style development outside the city (\u201cnear enough, and far enough \u2013 just the right distance\u201d). Here, they promptly become trapped in a maze of little boxes \u2013 endlessly reproduced rows of identical houses, all the same shade of sickly green, all with the same surgical strip of grass out front. And all eerily empty\u2026</p> <p>The title <em>Vivarium</em> (a container for observing small animals in a re-creation of their natural environment) provides a signpost for where this is going. Suffice to say that Tom and Gemma find themselves in a pastel-coloured simulacrum of suburban hell, raising a monstrous child whose arrival is prefigured by a horrifying opening sequence of a cuckoo invading a nest, screaming to be fed by its bewildered surrogate mother. \u201cThat\u2019s nature,\u201d Gemma tells one of her young charges, \u201cthat\u2019s just the way things are,\u201d adding forlornly that \u201cit\u2019s only horrible <em>sometimes</em>\u201d.</p> <p>As with all such <em>Twilight Zone</em>-style fantasies, it\u2019s the details we recognise that make the unimaginable seem immediate. While Yonder looks less like a set from <em>The Truman Show</em> than an infernal version of <a href=\"https://teletubbies.fandom.com/wiki/Teletubbyland?file=TtlVoiceTrumpet.jpg\" title=\"\">Teletubbyland</a> (the digital landscapes and barrage-balloon clouds are appropriately artificial), the gradual disintegration of our central couple remains skin-crawlingly close to home. From their initial in-car bickering about who gets to drive (\u201cGive me a go,\u201d \u201cWhat are you, <em>six</em>?\u201d) to their chippy despair as entrapment sinks in, Tom and Gemma\u2019s relationship fractures along all too familiar lines. One minute they\u2019re happy-go-lucky young lovers, looking forward to a life filled with possibilities; the next, they\u2019re terrified, exhausted wrecks, held hostage by the shrieking demands of an alien child who mimics their every word and gesture, living in a dream-world neither of them wanted, each blaming the other for their predicament. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLa0FX_xi08\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vLa0FX_xi08?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLa0FX_xi08\">Watch a trailer for Vivarium.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In his director statement, Finnegan (who reportedly drew tonal inspiration from Hiroshi Teshigahara\u2019s 1964 classic <em><a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/826-woman-in-the-dunes\" title=\"\">Woman in the Dunes</a></em>) describes <em>Vivarium</em> as addressing the \u201cfantasy version of reality that we strive towards\u201d in world where \u201cconsumerism is consuming us\u201d, and in which the promise of ideal living is \u201cthe bait that leads many into a trap\u201d\u2019. There\u2019s an element of Cronenbergian revulsion in the tasteless, plasticated food parcels that keep Tom and Gemma alive, while the echoes of horror movies \u2013 from <em>Village of the Damned</em> to <em>Poltergeist</em> \u2013 increase as the satire turns ever more sinister. Yet even in its most overtly chilling moments (a third-act descent into hell recalls a memorably hallucinogenic sequence from Terry Gilliam\u2019s <em>Brazil</em>), <em>Vivarium</em> keeps its tongue placed firmly in its cheek, reminding me somewhat of the absurdist, smiling tone of Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe\u2019s recent picket-fence parody <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyOvQfgQhKQ\" title=\"\">Greener Grass</a></em>.</p> <p>You can see the seeds of <em>Vivarium</em> in the ghost estates of Finnegan and Shanley\u2019s chilling 2012 short <em>Foxes</em>, and there are times this feels like a single idea stretched to feature length. But there\u2019s enough visual and thematic invention to keep viewers gripped and unsettled, particularly in these unprecedented, isolated times.</p> <p><em>Vivarium is available to stream on all major platforms</em></p>",
  "<p>For the British those old black and white <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing_comedies\">Ealing comedies</a>, which BBC2 is to screen every afternoon for a week from 6 April, are a bit like Dickens\u2019 novels. We feel we know them pretty well, and we certainly believe we are familiar with the postwar, spirit-rousing world they come from. But there\u2019s always at least one film that has slipped the memory. For me, it is <em>The Titfield Thunderbolt</em>.

This is what makes them worth watching.</p> <p>After a major global event, when the game changes for good, questions of social morality are foregrounded.

Does science always help us out? Are trade unions ever a brake on progress? Do criminals flourish without guilt?</p> <p>If this season whets the appetite, look elsewhere for the first film, <em>Hue and Cry</em>, about children defeating evil in the rubble of bombed London, or for the scintillating and darkly droll <em>Kind Hearts and Coronets</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2020 because an earlier version misnamed the film <em>Whisky Galore!</em> as <em>Whiskey Galore!</em></p>",

  "<p>Nine women who made complaints of sexual offences against Alex Salmond have urged other women to \u201cbe brave, be loud, be heard\u201d in the face of bullying, sexual harassment and assault, in a powerful rebuke to those who have accused them of conspiring against the former Scottish National party leader.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/alex-salmond-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-sexual-assault-trial\">a jury at the high court in Edinburgh</a> found the former first minister not guilty of 12 sexual assaults, including one attempted rape. It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was \u201cnot proven\u201d, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict, but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law.</p> <p>All verdicts were by majority, following an 11-day trial. Salmond was formally acquitted of one sexual assault charge midway through the court case after it was withdrawn by the prosecution.</p> <p>The nine different women, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and who included Scottish government officials and SNP employees, described in court alleged assaults, many of which they claimed took place late at night in the private rooms of the first minister\u2019s official residence, Bute House.</p> <p>Salmond denied all their allegations, describing them variously as \u201creinterpretations\u201d, \u201cexaggerations\u201d, and \u201cdeliberate fabrications for political purposes\u201d.</p> <p>In a highly unusual move, reflecting the frustration the complainants feel at being characterised as co-conspirators, the women have set out their response to the verdicts, which they describe as \u201cdevastating\u201d.</p> <p>In a joint statement signed jointly by all nine women who testified against Salmond, they write: \u201cWe remain firm in our belief that coming forward to report our experiences and concerns was the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>The women insist that they are still not in direct contact with each other, and that they do not know the identities of all their fellow complainers. The statement was released by Rape Crisis Scotland.</p> <p>Describing the trial as \u201ca traumatic process\u201d, the statement continues: \u201cAs politicians, commentators and society reflect on this case, we would ask you to consider whether behaviour which is so often merely described as \u2018inappropriate\u2019 or is tolerated by society, is acceptable towards your daughters, granddaughters, sisters, wives, friends, and colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>During and since the trial, the women have faced an onslaught of abuse online and have been issued with personal alarms by the police. They add: \u201cWe would also request that as you debate, you conduct it respectfully and stay mindful of the many women in Scotland who may have had traumatic experiences and are considering whether or not Scotland is a country in which they can come forward to seek help and support.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately after the verdict, Salmond\u2019s allies called for prominent officials in Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s office and the Scottish National party to be fired after text messages and emails came to light that Salmond argues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/salmonds-victory-in-court-leaves-questions-over-role-of-snp\">raises serious questions about their role in the case</a>, and their handling of allegations against him, including the botched Scottish government internal inquiry into complaints of sexual misconduct brought against him by two civil servants in 2018. Salmond is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/24/alex-salmond-allies-say-he-plans-to-sue-the-scottish-government\">expected to sue</a> the Scottish government and wants to put his case to the Holyrood inquiry into the handling of the initial allegations.</p> <p>Salmond\u2019s defence was that the allegations had been orchestrated by one of the complainers, witness A, a senior official in the Scottish government, while others had been exaggerated. Giving evidence, Salmond admitted with hindsight he wished he had been \u201cmore careful with people\u2019s personal space\u201d, while his defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC described his behaviour as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d during cross-examination. Since the verdict, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-alex-salmond-a-battle-ends-a-battle-begins\">Salmond\u2019s own former speechwriter described his defence </a>as \u201cI\u2019m sleazy but not criminal\u201d.</p> <p>The women write: \u201cIn defending Alex Salmond, Gordon Jackson quoted Woman H and said his client should have been a \u2018better man\u2019. He said behaviour which others described as demeaning, intimidating and humiliating, was \u2018trivial\u2019. The behaviours that Alex Salmond and his defence team admitted to in evidence were not and are not trivial\u201d. Today we want to send a strong and indisputable message that such behaviours should not be tolerated \u2013 by any person, in any position, under any circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Thanking Police Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service \u201cfor taking our experiences seriously and for allowing our voices to be heard\u201d, they assert: \u201cMany of us did speak up at the time of our incidents but were faced with procedures that could not deal with complaints against such a powerful figure. Others were silenced by fear of repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>The trial raised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/salmonds-victory-in-court-leaves-questions-over-role-of-snp\">serious questions about the way the civil service and the SNP dealt with complaints</a>. In their evidence, some of the women said they feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or that the matter would be \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d.</p> <p>The court also heard from a number of witnesses who said that Salmond\u2019s behaviour led to an unofficial ban on him working alone with female civil servants at Bute House late at night. After a junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 \u2013 a charge Salmond denied, stating instead that the pair had \u201ca sleepy cuddle\u201d \u2013 the jury heard that instead of an investigation, civil service officials and Salmond\u2019s most senior aide brokered a private apology from the first minister.</p> <p>The women\u2019s statement argues that \u201cfor too long, women have been let down by organisational structures which should exist to protect them\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should all seek to create an environment in which people can challenge and report behaviours without hesitation or fear of retribution.\u201d</p> <p> Their statement concludes: \u201cWhile we are devastated by the verdict, we will not let it define us. We hope through shining a light on our experiences, it will serve to protect and empower women in the future.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Over the past few weeks, as Chinese health officials reported new \u201cimported\u201d coronavirus cases almost every day, foreigners living in the country have noticed a change. They have been turned away from restaurants, shops, gyms and hotels, subjected to further screening, yelled at by locals and avoided in public spaces.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m walking past someone, then they see my blue eyes and jump a foot back,\u201d said Andrew Hoban, 33, who is originally from Ireland and lives in Shanghai.</p> <p>Experiences range from socially awkward to xenophobic. An American walking with a group of foreigners in a park in Beijing saw a woman grab her child and run the other way. Others have described being called \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmozur/status/1243162904788008962\">foreign trash</a>\u201d. A <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8PbJjsRueJllEt9t3tzO1g\">recent online article</a>, under an image of ship stacked with refuse being pushed away from China\u2019s coast, was headlined: \u201cBeware of a second outbreak started by foreign garbage.\u201d</p> <p>As China moves towards getting back to normal after months of paralysis, authorities are focused on avoiding a second wave of infections from overseas.</p> <p>In the last seven days, China has reported only six locally transmitted cases but dozens arriving from abroad. By last Thursday, officials had reported a total of 595 imported cases since the outbreak began, the main source being the UK. Observers say the focus on imported cases has led to an increase in anti-foreign sentiment, which according to some has been on the rise for years.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an effect when state media are reporting this is a foreign virus,\u201d said Jeremiah Jenne, an American historian living in Beijing. \u201cIt is a new variation of a familiar theme: don\u2019t trust foreigners. If there is another flare-up in China, the blame will fall on people coming from outside.\u201d</p> <p>Last Saturday, the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-live-news-update-world-lockdown-global-deaths-india-uk-us-australia-china-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e7cd30e8f0878a2a48aacdc\">temporarily closed its borders to all foreign arrivals</a>. Officials have also ordered local airlines to maintain only one route per country per week.</p> <p>Some say the focus on foreigners \u2013 surprising given that 90% of imported cases were Chinese passport holders, according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry \u2013 is the leadership\u2019s attempt to shore up its image.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is an opportunity to make themselves look strong, competent and legitimate by capitalising on public anxiety, they\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Mike Gow, a lecturer at Coventry University\u2019s School of Strategy and Leadership. \u201cIf that happens to stoke xenophobia, so be it.\u201d</p> <p>Several foreign residents stressed, however, that their experiences were not akin to those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-us-asian-americans-racism\">Asians in the US and elsewhere, who have been beaten and subjected to racial slurs</a>.</p> <p>Bill Aitchison, 49, who is originally from the UK and lives between Xiamen and Nanjing, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t been attacked and haven\u2019t heard of any foreigners being attacked\u2026 but the virus has unleashed some ugly sentiments. When borders close and walls go up, it seems people everywhere are apt to see the virus in those who are unfamiliar.\u201d </p> <p>But some foreign communities are experiencing more harassment. An African couple in Beijing were <a href=\"https://blacklivitychina.com/2020/03/22/making-our-money-do-the-talking-and-other-responses-to-racism-in-china/\">made to wait for two hours</a> at a restaurant before a worker let slip that they were not supposed to allow in <em>heiren \u2013 </em>\u201cblack people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe combination of pre-existing attitudes to race and Africans, plus this new wave of fear of foreigners, is making things worse,\u201d said Runako Celina, co-founder of<a href=\"https://blacklivitychina.com/\"> Black Livity China</a>, which documents experiences of Africans and people of African descent in China. \u201cDespite us doing this work steadily throughout the years, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a single period of time when we\u2019ve had as many racism [or] discrimination-related incidents from different people and provinces.\u201d</p> <p>Others describe more scrutiny and wariness. American David Alexander, 32, who lives in the southern province of Jiangsu, said his Chinese co-workers had been advised to stay away from foreigners. In a shop last week, a couple waited until he had left before entering. \u201cThere is a sense of fear around foreigners,\u201d he said.</p> <p> A British-Canadian software engineer living in Shenzhen described being stopped several times by police and asked for her papers, something that did not happen before.</p> <p>The issue is being replicated across Asia. In Vietnam, hostility toward foreigners has reached such a level that the Vietnamese ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement calling for it to stop.</p> <p>\u201cIt is our hope that the spirit of humanitarianism, equality and non-discrimination will be upheld by the entire international community, so that citizens from all countries and territories can enjoy security, safety and healthcare,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>In Thailand, a since-deleted Twitter account operated by the country\u2019s health minister reportedly <a href=\"https://www.thaiexaminer.com/thai-news-foreigners/2020/03/13/minister-anutin-white-western-foreigners-tourists-public-face-masks/\">said the country had to be \u201cmore careful of westerners than Asians\u201d</a> because they \u201cnever shower\u201d or wear masks. <a href=\"https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/politics/health-minister-denies-racist-tweet\">He later denied writing the tweets.</a> In Taiwan, some restaurants have reportedly said they will <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thefeast/status/1242693206333984769\">not serve foreign diners</a>.</p> <p>But several foreign residents in China said they did not feel unsafe, with the minor incidents they experienced not enough to make them reconsider living in China. Others said being treated like a pariah after having lived in the country for years was mostly disheartening.</p> <p>Chris Lemos, 29, an American living in Shanghai, said he took a seat on the metro last week and a woman abruptly moved to the other side of the carriage. </p> <p>Lemos, who had been in the city for three months, hunkering down at home to avoid falling ill or infecting others, had hoped for some solidarity. \u201cI was in the trenches with them, so to speak,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>When the camera follows a young woman as she staggers around a bar, slurring her words, she is conventionally marked out as a victim. A judgmental film director might even indicate she is deserving of scorn. But what if this vulnerable target is actually the one deciding who really deserves what \u2013 and then meting out her own brutal form of justice? This is the subversive premise of the directorial debut from the British actress, screenwriter and author Emerald Fennell.</p> <p>Her film, <em>Promising Young Woman</em>, is released next month and opens with scenes that show Cassie Thomas, a medical school dropout played by Carey Mulligan, apparently indulging in just the sort of self-destructive alcoholic behaviour seen recently from other modern anti-heroines, such as Rachel in <em>The Girl on the Train</em>, or the eponymous Daphne in the admired off-beat British film of 2017. The difference this time is that Cassie has been weaponised by a damaging experience in her past. And although she is clinging on to a job in a coffee shop and still living with her parents at 30, she is no longer anyone\u2019s victim. The result, according to the <em>Telegraph</em>\u2019s Robbie Collin is a \u201cwild and righteous provocation\u201d of a film.</p> <p>As an actress Fennell will already be familiar to fans of either <em>The Crown</em> or <em>Call the Midwife</em>, where she has played, respectively, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Patsy the closet lesbian. But for this film she has not just stepped behind the camera as director, but also re-worked an existing screenplay to reflect contemporary attitudes and to puncture some common assumptions. At the Sundance film festival, where <em>Promising Young Woman</em> premiered this January, critics were ambushed by its unusual, dark tone. An editorial in the spring edition of the film magazine<em> Little White Lies</em> celebrated what several pundits have admired in the director\u2019s voice: \u201cFennell\u2019s pitch-black comedy is hard to stomach at times, but a piercing, vital addition to the growing canon of films that allow women to speak for themselves rather than through the gaze of men.\u201d</p> <p>If the film\u2019s violent twist works with audiences, as many reviewers have been slightly surprised to admit, it could be because Fennell has made sure that her story does more than just chime with a worthy Times Up message. While other upcoming feminist offerings, such as the Weinstein-inspired drama <em>The Assistant</em>, starring Julia Garner and Matthew Macfadyen, are also set to give us leading women who are prepared to fight back, Fennell\u2019s debut feels like a more focused correction to some of the wicked fun she recently had working as the show-runner and lead writer on the second series of the wildly successful television show <em>Killing Eve</em>.</p> <p>Born in London and educated at the exclusive Marlborough College and then at Oxford, Fennell was selected by Phoebe Waller-Bridge to take over the drama developed from Luke Jennings\u2019s novelas. It was an honour, in the light of the global impact of the show, and a demonstration of faith in another young female writer. In the end, Fennell\u2019s handling of the tale of the hitwoman and the obsessive sleuth hunting her down proved not quite as popular as the first series, but it continued to deliver a succession of stylishly amoral assassinations. Now, in Cassie, Fennell has found another violent leading lady, but one on a less random and more ethically nuanced mission to punish mankind. Not all men are guilty here, and appearances can deceive.</p> <p>As the Guardian critic who saw <em>Promising Young Woman </em>at the film festival in Utah noted: \u201cOne of the film\u2019s aces is showing us that sexual assault can come in an innocuous package, from an Oxford shirt-wearing, soft-speaking \u2018nice\u2019 guy who can quickly flip into a destructive mode when he thinks the power is in his hands.\u201d</p> <p>Since Sundance the title of the film has been applied to Fennell herself several times. And if she still \u201cpromises\u201d much, she is clearly set to fulfil public expectation this year. \u201cFrom her work on <em>Killing Eve </em>to her short film <em>Careful How You Go</em>, Fennell has always demonstrated a fascination with the grey spaces of morality, and her debut feature is no exception \u2013 it\u2019s a meticulous, candy-coloured fairy tale with a blistering central performance from Carey Mulligan that\u2019s quite unlike anything she\u2019s done before. Provocative and recalcitrant, it\u2019s sure to spark plenty of debate, but also resonate with anyone who has seen their life (or, indeed, the life of someone they love) changed forever by rape,\u201d wrote film critic Hannah Woodhead.</p> <p>Others, including the <em>Hollywood News </em>reviewer, have been less convinced by Mulligan as a malignant siren but are still intrigued by Fennell\u2019s film. \u201cLike everything here,\u201d the magazine declared, \u201c[Mulligan\u2019s] turn is skilful, entertaining and challenging, even when the eccentric method obscures the precise message.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e7f5a2064183658af4fc4971afd27d35358d89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e7f5a2064183658af4fc4971afd27d35358d89e/306_238_2351_1411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carey Mulligan in a bar scene from Promising Young Woman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carey Mulligan in a bar scene from Promising Young Woman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what exactly is this first time director\u2019s message? Well, it is clear Fennell loves to shock. That was an essential for the <em>Killing Eve</em> job, but also evident in the series of scary books she has written for children, starting with the spooky <em>Shiverton Hall</em> in 2013, and then in the mordant grimness of her 2015 novel <em>Monsters</em>, set in Cornwall. This adult book tells of two odd children who encounter a smattering of murders in beautiful Fowey. The acclaimed writer William Boyd was impressed when he reviewed if for the <em>New Statesman</em>. \u201cEmerald Fennell\u2019s <em>Monsters</em> is a tremendous, destabilising work of fiction, infusing the mundane with eerie and unsettling darkness it is written, moreover, in a remarkable tone of voice,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Yet in person Fennell\u2019s jolly manner and upper crust vowels, to say nothing of her close association with <em>Call the Midwife</em>, might also qualify her as a favourite for the title of \u201cthe next Miranda Hart\u201d.</p> <p>And, rather like Hart, Fennell has been tweeting during the current lockdown in an attempt to distract and amuse her followers. Back in her family home, the entertainment has fairly been thin on the ground, she has suggested. A selection of gratuitous eBay purchases have sent her falling back on her lurid teenage library of romances and ghost stories.</p> <p>Last week, on \u201cDay 3 of self-isolation\u201d in her childhood bedroom she wondered: \u201cIs this how our civilisation ends? Wearing moisturiser that expired in 2008, the dregs of a bottle of Gucci Envy and fcuk t-shirt?\u201d</p> <p>Fennell comes from a family she once colourfully described as full of wizards and circus performers but the financial anchor is father Theo Fennell, a multi-millionaire jeweller and maker of prestigious trophies, such as those handed out to Lewis Hamilton on the Formula One podium.</p> <p>The world inhabited by Camilla Parker Bowles, n\u00e9e Shand, may not be Fennell\u2019s own, but it is probably closer than that of the midwife Patsy she played in <em>Call the Midwife</em>. She has spoken in the past of adoring the chance to work with the young babies who were cast as the newborns in the series.</p> <p>The actress-writer-turned-director is also a huge fan of Roald Dahl\u2019s work, so let\u2019s hope there are a several volumes there still to divert her in her old bedroom tonight. Failing that, Fennell can perhaps download a few Britney songs to listen to. She is a devoted admirer of the performer and remembers crying with emotion as a young girl when the star burst onto the scene in sequins and spangles.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>You can learn a lot about yourself in times of crisis, but you learn a hell of a lot more about the person you weather said crisis with. Best to strap in and bite your tongue. A lifetime of three weeks ago, my clever, rational other half and I went on a holiday to <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-colombia/in-battle-against-coronavirus-colombia-transforms-military-hospital-idUKKBN21A3IT?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=scienceNews\">Colombia</a>.

Then in full-blown Technicolor as <a href=\"https://colombiareports.com/three-women-murdered-on-first-day-of-colombias-coronavirus-lockdown/\">Cartagena</a> went into lockdown, with face masks being dealt out on street corners and a strict curfew enforced by police.</p> <p>\u201cTrust you to be stuck in a jungle in the middle of a global pandemic,\u201d messaged one friend.

  "<p>The closure of schools across the UK has left many parents and carers in the sudden, unexpected position of being home-school teachers.

Here are 20 apps that may get parents off to a good start.

  "<p>Capitalist orthodoxies fail in the face of \u201ca crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity\u201d, writes Andrew Rawnsley (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-crisis-ignites-bonfire-of-conservative-orthodoxies\" title=\"\">Comment</a>). Precisely, and this is why a similar approach is needed to confront the climate emergency \u2013 and why rightwing governments will fail to do so unless they adopt a leftwing approach that does not prioritise market and profit and instead sees the merits of massive state intervention. And the coronavirus crisis rather pointedly undermines Philip Cerny\u2019s remark that the nation state cannot have a key role in this (\u201cMy solution to the climate crisis\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/letters-give-boris-johnson-his-moment-for-now\" title=\"\">Letters</a>). What we are learning now is the importance, yes, of individual responsibility and local initiatives but also of decisive governmental action to enforce the suspension of business as usual, and of international cooperation. The only other essential element is a recognition that the climate emergency is just as pressing and very much more of a mortal threat than even the current pandemic.<br><strong>Jem Whiteley</strong><br>Oxford<br></p> <p>I read with interest the interview with Professor Tim Lang with its important messages and mention of Covid-19 (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis\" title=\"\">Why our food supply system doesn\u2019t work</a>\u201d, Focus). I too am concerned about the UK\u2019s food supply chains, given it imports at least half of its food. If imports of food, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables, decline because countries like Spain and Italy are going to struggle to feed themselves because of this pandemic, this would affect the diet of the UK\u2019s population, particularly the elderly, young and disadvantaged. It would be reassuring to know what the UK government\u2019s contingency plans are.</p> <p>Furthermore, given the likely longer-term nature of the pandemic, we should also instigate the free distribution of these foods and vitamins for the elderly in our care homes and similar institutions throughout the UK, as a matter of urgency. Vulnerable elderly people have been told to self-isolate, possibly for many months, which will reduce their exposure to sunshine, which is essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin D. <br><strong>Dr Laurence Harbige</strong><br>London E4<br></p> <p>Your Sport section detailed two sums of \u00a350,000 being donated by each of Manchester\u2019s richest clubs, United and City, to their local food bank (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/united-and-city-donate-combined-100000-to-manchester-food-banks\" title=\"\">United and City donate combined \u00a3100,000 to Manchester food banks</a>\u201d).

  "<p>Last week brought the tragic news of the first medical professionals to fall victim to Britain\u2019s coronavirus epidemic. Dr Habib Zaidi was a community GP in Essex who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-52040991\">died from suspected Covid-19</a> symptoms last Wednesday. Dr <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52064450\">Adil El Tayar<del>lar</del></a> was a London-based organ transplant surgeon who believed he contracted the illness while working in hospitals in the West Midlands. There will very likely be more doctors, nurses and support staff who also lose their lives as a result of their critical work in treating patients with the virus. It is an appalling reminder that, every day, NHS and social care staff are putting their own lives at risk in order to save the lives of others.</p> <p>In recent days, the effort to ramp up the NHS\u2019s critical care capacity has been incredible. Work is well under way to build a new hospital at London\u2019s Excel centre: from next week, <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/new-nhs-nightingale-hospital-to-fight-coronavirus/\">NHS Nightingale</a> will provide 500 beds, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/excel-coronavirus-hospital-will-be-by-far-the-largest-in-the-uk\">space to expand to 4,000</a>; an incredible 27-fold increase in the capital\u2019s critical care beds. Similar hospital expansion programmes are getting under way in Birmingham and Manchester.</p> <p>It will, however, take an immense human effort from doctors, nurses and support staff to keep the NHS on its feet. Medical professionals will be drafted in from around the country to staff these extra beds; many will live on site and work physically and emotionally exhausting shifts in barely tolerable conditions. Up and down the country, doctors and nurses have said goodbye to their nearest and dearest, moving out of their family homes, or are sending children to live with relatives, potentially for months, in order to avoid putting them at risk. It is utterly awe-inspiring, and we salute their dedication to service. It will not be forgotten.</p> <p>But the dedication of medical professionals contrasts sharply with the lack of government preparedness \u2013 for example in procuring extra stocks of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and virus testing kits. It should have been clear from the evidence coming out of China from February onwards that the risks of a global pandemic, requiring significant additional medical resources, were very high indeed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A health system driven to the absolute limits of its capacity will inevitably be less resilient</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet it was only two weeks ago that the health minister, Matt Hancock, issued a public call for companies to contact the government and assist in ventilator production. Since then, extremely worrying details have emerged that suggest there was a lack of procurement competence within the government. Britain has not taken part in an EU joint procurement scheme for ventilators, which could have used the bloc\u2019s collective purchasing power to increase the stock of ventilators that the NHS has access to.</p> <p>At first, government sources claimed the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">decided not to participate because we are no longer a member of the EU</a>, and that the UK was \u201cmaking its own efforts\u201d to source extra ventilators. Then we were told that the government had accidentally missed the deadline; this was put down to \u201can initial communication problem\u201d. But Brussels publicly announced plans for a joint procurement process \u2013 widely reported in the press \u2013 weeks ago, and it has made clear that UK representatives were present at meetings where joint procurement was discussed.</p> <p>This oversight does nothing to allay fears that the government may have passed up on the opportunity to take part in an EU initiative to procure life-saving equipment for ideological reasons. Moreover, existing ventilator manufacturers in the UK say that, despite contacting the government with offers to ramp up their production, they have had little response. One company, Direct Access, contacted the Department for Business after sourcing 5,000 ventilators but heard nothing back, and after a few days the supplies were directed elsewhere. Another supplier, MEC Medical, also said the government failed to respond to its offers to expand ventilator production.</p> <p>There are also issues over the availability of PPE. Last week it emerged that in 2016 the Department of Health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/advice-on-protective-gear-for-nhs-staff-was-rejected-owing-to-cost\">rejected expert advice</a> to increase PPE stockpiles against the risk of an influenza pandemic on the grounds of cost. This decision has had consequences: medical professionals continue to report that there are still shortages of equipment at the frontline. Some NHS trusts have been asking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/25/schools-asked-donate-science-goggles-nhs-use-face-shields\">schools to donate science goggles</a>; and some doctors report that they have sourced and paid for their own protective masks. Staff remain concerned that the reason that the UK advice on protective equipment diverges from that of the World Health Organization in some instances is to preserve limited supplies, rather than set out best practice.</p> <p>This is the sign of a health system that has been put under extreme pressure by inadequate levels of funding since 2010. A pandemic of this sort would always place intolerable strain on the NHS. But its impact will be worse as a result of a decade of underfunding that has left hospital bed occupancy rates regularly exceeding safe levels; elective operations cancelled due to capacity issues; critical care capacity at lower levels than most European countries; and a staffing crisis that has depleted the morale of frontline staff.</p> <p>A health system driven to the absolute limits of its capacity will inevitably be less resilient to this sort of extraordinary crisis than one that has a little breathing room. There will be unnecessary and avoidable deaths as a result. Today, we should applaud the extraordinary efforts being made by many across government to ready the NHS for the tsunami that is about to hit it. But the time will come to hold accountable those politicians who were so keen to wield unnecessary budget cuts as a badge of their Conservative credentials, while paying little heed to the consequences of their actions.</p>",

Canal staff must navigate ships through and the ministry had previously said that doing so would endanger staff.</p> <p>Dozens of symptom-free passengers were moved across from the Zaandam to its sister ship, the Rotterdam. Holland America Line said on Saturday night: \u201cWe are aware of reported permission for both Zaandam and Rotterdam to transit the Panama Canal in the near future. We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew. This remains a dynamic situation, and we continue to work with the Panamanian authorities to finalise details.\u201d</p> <p>While passengers and family members of people on board welcomed the news that the cruise liner would be allowed to pass through the canal, some warned that more passengers would die if better medical attention was not given to those remaining.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really surreal,\u201d said Jih-Hao Jim Cheng, a southern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> resident, whose father was sick with a fever onboard the ship. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary for my parents and everyone onboard.\u201d</p> <p>He said his mother had been trying to call the ship staff to get medicine or help but no one was responding. \u201cThe cruise line doesn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that they are getting the well on to another ship. But unless they have a strategy for the sick, more people are going to die soon.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global death toll reaches 30,000</h2> <p>The number of coronavirus deaths around the world has reached 30,652, with confirmed cases passing 660,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University. To date, 139,415 have recovered.</p> <h2>Spain: all non-essential workers must stay home</h2> <p>The Spanish government has ordered all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/covid-19-may-be-peaking-in-parts-of-spain-says-official\">non-essential workers to stay at home</a> for the next two weeks in an attempt to lower the spread of the coronavirus and reduce the pressure on the country\u2019s healthcare system. It came after the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies said that the country might be close to peaking in the number of cases of coronavirus.</p> <h2>Panama allows stranded cruise to pass</h2> <p>Panama\u2019s government has said it will allow the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/very-scary-pleas-for-safe-harbour-from-stranded-cruise-ship-near-panama\">Zaandam cruise ship</a> to pass through the Panama Canal. The cruise ship has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. Previously, Panama\u2019s authorities had not given approval to let the ship pass through the canal, leaving passengers stuck on board. No one from the ship will be allowed to disembark in Panama, but the passage will allow the ship to attempt to dock in Florida.</p> <h2>Northern Ireland to get tougher restrictions</h2> <p>Northern Ireland has announced a series of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-52079959\">restrictive measures</a> aimed at reducing the spread of coronavirus. Gatherings of more than two people have been banned, and anyone who can work from home must do so. The regulations also give the authorities the power to close certain premises and prohibit anyone from leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Authorities will have the power to enforce the measures, which came into force at 11pm GMT on Saturday.</p> <h2>French death toll passes 2,000</h2> <p>The coronavirus death toll in France has reached 2,317, with more than 38,000 cases. The official death tally is expected to jump next week, when authorities begin to include deaths in retirement homes, as well as just hospitals.</p> <h2>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s prison leave extended</h2> <p>The British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/28/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-coronavirus-leave-iran-prison-extended-two-weeks\">prison leave extended</a> and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife\u2019s father had been told that her temporary release from Evin prison in Tehran would now continue until 18 April. The leave was originally granted in response to the spread of coronavirus in Tehran, with Zaghari-Ratcliffe reportedly suffering from symptoms of Covid-19 before her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/09/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-health-improves-despite-coronavirus-fears\">recovery</a> earlier this month.</p>"
