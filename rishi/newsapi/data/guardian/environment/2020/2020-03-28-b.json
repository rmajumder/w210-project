  "<p>As I walk across the hospital complex and pause to look at the London tower blocks in the near distance, life could not be further removed from the green benches of parliament, a mere 45 minutes walk away. Covid-19 has changed everything. In mental health services, in the central London epicentre of Britain\u2019s outbreak, we are used to caring for people who have severe mental illness, but we have been confronted with a new reality of caring for people who are also infected with coronavirus.</p> <p>Hundreds of healthcare colleagues are already off sick.

We have not faced a global public health emergency on this scale for 100 years. Perhaps the national lockdown should have started earlier, and there will come a time for postmortems, but that time is not in the heat of the battle. In my view, the prime minister has made sound evidence-based decisions. Putting his libertarian instincts aside cannot have been easy, but he is making the right choices.</p> <p>Very soon, we should see the benefits of lockdown, social distancing, and the self-isolation of the vulnerable and elderly, as lives are protected and saved. The emergency economic measures including nationalisation of some industries are driven by practicality not ideology, and we can all be proud of the speed and efficiency with which the British military has responded in opening new hospitals such as NHS Nightingale.</p> <p>Where the government has been less surefooted is in understanding the practical challenges facing frontline NHS staff. Many of my colleagues are afraid for themselves and their families, but we turn up to work because we have a moral duty to use our skills to help care for people at this time of unprecedented national crisis.</p> <p>I am fortunate that at my NHS hospital we have a strong senior leadership team who are looking out for the best interests of staff and who were preparing for the pandemic well in advance. As a result, we are luckier than most in that we have recently gained access to essential personal protective equipment. However, this is not the experience for many staff in nearby hospitals.</p> <p>Similarly, a lack of testing kits for NHS staff has resulted in many of my colleagues self-isolating for seven or 14 days. NHS staff sickness levels are already high, and they are only going to increase as the outbreak intensifies. Many of us are also worried that we may be infected, yet showing no symptoms and could be a potential risk to patients, colleagues and families. That is the last thing that we would want, but we simply do not know. Widespread NHS staff testing would be a game changer and would help NHS clinicians to protect our patients and return to the frontline faster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I am pleased that the government is now taking urgent action to address these issues, but both the national need for personal protective clothing for frontline NHS staff and the need to test NHS staff for the virus could have been foreseen many weeks ago.</p> <p>When the government has got so much right in this crisis, it almost seems wrong to voice concerns, but I believe these equipment and virus testing kit challenges could have been avoided if there was a stronger clinical voice to inject a little more realism into the response and planning process. We have many such clinicians already in senior leadership roles in hospitals throughout the country. It\u2019s time to better utilise their knowledge and experience in the fight.</p> <p>Let me be clear. I believe the government overall has done very well in incredibly difficult circumstances that have created unprecedented challenges. The excellent central leadership team of scientists and epidemiologists has helped to develop a public health strategy that will save many lives. But as we move further into the clinical phase of the fight against Covid-19 we need more experienced and battle-hardened senior NHS veterans with lived experience from the frontline to add a stronger dose of clinical reality to the government\u2019s strategy.</p> <p><em>Dr Dan Poulter MP is a practising NHS psychiatrist and a former health minister (2012-15)</em></p>",

The numbers of people this week applying for Newstart this week are unprecedented (though not unanticipated) and Westpac economists now predict our unemployment rate will hit 11% by June.</p> <p>Were that to happen the unemployment rate would have risen six percentage points in four months. The previous biggest four-month jump was in 1982 when unemployment rose 2.4 percentage points, from 7% to 9.4%.</p> <p>The Great Depression was as bad as it was because economies around the world went backwards for three to four years. Australia\u2019s GDP per capita in 1931 was 20% below what it was in 1928; in the US it fell 31% from 1929 to 1933.</p> <p>Were our GDP per capita to fall by 20% that would take us back to 2001 levels \u2013 20 years of growth wiped away.</p> <p>Fortunately, things are a bit different now from the 30s.</p> <p>Firstly, the world is not on the gold standard as it was in the 20s and 30s, so central banks have been able to engage in an extremely strong monetary policy response.</p> <p>And secondly, John Maynard Keynes has already written his General Theory, so we know that fiscal expansion, not austerity, is the best response.</p> <p>This, of course, is a different economic crisis \u2013 people are unemployed because the government has in effect mandated that their workplaces close. And so the hope is that when the crisis is over everything snaps back into place.</p> <p>But generally it takes longer to recover than it does to fall.</p> <p>It took two years of the Great Depression to lose 20% of GDP per capita and five years to make it back. During the 90s recession it took three years for the level of employment to fall from 59.6% to 55.5% and more than seven years to get back to the pre-recession level.</p> <p>And in this instance we need to consider the virus and the response of governments around the world. The global economy is only as strong as the weakest link. And right now the US, led by Donald Trump, is in a pitiful state.</p> <p>Until it is safe to return to normal business \u2013 and crucially until we <em>feel</em> safe \u2013 we will not see much recovery. But importantly, until we can say the same about other major nations, we will not see the global economy recover.</p> <p>It may feel as though Trump\u2019s incompetence does not affect us but it very much does.</p> <p>All facets of our economy are affected \u2013 almost beyond comprehension.

  "<p>When Mary Beard\u2019s new BBC documentary series <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000f1t4\" title=\"\">Shock of the Nude</a></em> began last month, I had high hopes. A new censoriousness is abroad both in the art world, and in our wider culture, and I hoped that she might have something to say about this: something clear, clever and non-prurient. But alas, it was not to be. I disliked her approach to marble fig leaves and the male gaze, and in the <em>New Statesman</em>, where I am the television critic, I said so, calling the series out for what I regarded as its superficiality and modish solipsism. \u201cShe is the star,\u201d I wrote. \u201cAnd Michaelangelo, Courbet and all the rest of them can go hang.\u201d</p> <p>I did not expect her to like this, but neither did I expect to <em>hear</em> that she didn\u2019t like it. Beard, a Cambridge don, is smart and successful. I assumed she would rise above it; given that I once gave a book of hers a rave review, she would know, moreover, that it wasn\u2019t personal. But again, I was wrong. A few days later, Beard <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\">devoted the blog she writes for the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\">Times Literary Supplement</a></em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\"> to TV criticism</a>, having taken exception not only to my review, but to several others too. In it, she ticked each of us off individually. (Had I, she wanted to know, ever considered how few TV minutes in the past had been devoted to Zoffany\u2019s <em>Tribuna</em>?) She then called for a total rethink of TV criticism. It seems that Beard wants new, better TV critics, who will take a new, better approach to television. The inference is that what she really wants are TV critics who will universally praise everything that she does.</p> <p>Beard\u2019s blog infuriated me, not for anything she had to say about my review (she\u2019s entitled to disagree with me), but for the suggestion \u2013 one she appeared to reiterate later on social media \u2013 that I do not take TV seriously. This, of course, is a perennial problem for critics, particularly those who try to write entertainingly; the criticised seem unaccountably to feel that if the critic has the temerity to make light of anything at all, they\u2019re unworthy of the job, and idiotic to boot. In my case, however, the accusation could not be further from the truth. If I love television now \u2013 and I do \u2013 this is as nothing compared to how I felt about it when I was younger. Growing up, it was the principal means, apart from novels borrowed from the library, by which I educated myself: about art, culture, science, nature and, yes, human behaviour. I believe that those who discount television, who are patronising or snobbish about it, are telling you far more about themselves than they are about the medium itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83d2452c48d0d4a7e9366f1fc92cd87e53b69e26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83d2452c48d0d4a7e9366f1fc92cd87e53b69e26/129_0_2383_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Beard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Beard: \u2018she doesn\u2019t have the kind of groupies who go in for trolling\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helena Hunt/BBC/Lion TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are several things that qualify someone to be a critic. They require some expertise; they must be able to write; they should have taste (reviews have everything to do with taste \u2013 and nothing). But the most vital qualification is that they should love whatever it is that they write about. As the late AA Gill put it: \u201cIf you don\u2019t love it, why will you care if somebody does it badly?\u201d What I felt most of all when I watched Beard\u2019s show was a sense of amazement that she and the BBC had together used our money, in the form of the licence fee, to make something so inert, so contentless, so strangely (for a programme about art) unbeautiful and ordinary. And so, like the boy in the fairy tale, I pointed at what I was watching \u2013 in this case, not a naked emperor, but a naked professor of classics (I mean this both literally and metaphorically, since Beard posed for a life drawing in the series) \u2013 and I laughed. Personally, I don\u2019t believe you have to agree with me to think that I was right to do so. What is the point of a critic if not to tell the truth as they see it? </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I\u2019ve written about Beard not to stir a feud, but because it illustrates so perfectly the current moment when it comes to criticism. In the 21st century, critics write in an environment where those who disagree with them, whether makers or consumers, can respond immediately and directly. Artists now quite often use social media to encourage their fans to diss the so-called experts, urging them on by telling them that they are right, not the critic. Beard doesn\u2019t have the kind of groupies \u2013 assuming she has groupies at all \u2013 who go in for trolling, but many artists do, and when stirred, whether the incitement is deliberate or not, things can get out of control pretty quickly. Think of Samuel L Jackson, who in 2012 asked his Twitter followers if they could help the film critic AO Scott to find a new job, \u201cone he can actually do\u201d (Scott, of the <em>New York Times</em>, had been disobliging about <em>Avengers Assemble</em>, in which Jackson stars). Or think of Lana Del Rey, who last year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/events/1169745989697036288?lang=en\" title=\"\">tweeted her displeasure at Ann Powers\u2019s review of her new album to her 9.5 million followers</a>. The subsequent pile-on included calls for Del Rey to \u201cend\u201d Powers.</p> <p>You have to be quite tough \u2013 or at any rate, cool-headed \u2013 to put up with this kind of thing. But then, to be a critic, you have to be tough generally these days. Jobs are thin on the ground. For the past decade, newspapers, their budgets under threat and their determination to build online traffic driving their priorities in terms of copy, have been laying off large numbers of critics. Who will forget the day, in 2013, that the ill-fated <em>Independent on Sunday</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/29/independent-titles-cut-back-arts-coverage\" title=\"\">sacked its entire team</a>? Some art forms have been affected by this situation more than others: as Alex Ross, the <em>New Yorker</em>\u2019s music writer, pointed out in a melancholy piece in 2017, fewer than a dozen American newspapers now have a full-time classical critic. And the realms of film and theatre are hardly immune. To take one example, in 2019, the <em>Evening Standard</em>, a newspaper cited \u201cnecessary cost-cutting\u201d when laying off both of its long-standing theatre critics in favour of two writers with other roles on the paper.</p> <p>It being hard to make ends meet, the critical ecosystem grows ever more fragile. Many book critics, for instance, rely more and more on chairing events and running literary festivals for income, something that can \u2013 and does \u2013 take its effect on their reviews. Who is going to be negative about a book by a writer with whom they\u2019ll shortly share a green room? Writers do tend to know one another; their air kisses have long graced the literary pages. But the muffled sound of punches being pulled now emanates not only from, say, novelists who occasionally review, but from jobbing writers who make the majority of their income from criticism. Hatchet jobs still get written. These days, however, you\u2019re more likely to find a perfectly ordinary book acclaimed as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. Critical inflation is rife, and pity the innocent reader, about to rush out and buy a new hardback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"72bd5dc8a306c4a85d8b338ccb7622d2af55bf9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72bd5dc8a306c4a85d8b338ccb7622d2af55bf9a/0_0_6064_4082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An English National Opera production of Verdi\u2019s Luisa Miller at the Coliseum, where critics were recently stripped of their plus-ones in order to make more room for bloggers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An English National Opera production of Verdi\u2019s Luisa Miller at the Coliseum, where critics were recently stripped of their plus-ones in order to make more room for bloggers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there is the pressure that comes from places it shouldn\u2019t. Editors who insist not only on star ratings, but who prefer one-star or five-star reviews (Mark Shenton, former theatre critic of the <em>Sunday Express</em>, claimed that he was once asked to \u201camend\u201d his). Publishers and publicists who bear a grudge (a negative review for one writer may mean that you will not be given, say, an interview with another one from the same stable, irrespective of your enthusiasm for their work). Individuals who attempt what we might call news management (<em>Time Out</em>\u2019s arts editor, Eddy Frankel, recently revealed that one artist would not provide the magazine with images <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eddyfrankel/status/1222561191786172416\" title=\"\">unless he or she was given copy approval of a review prior to publication</a>). Organisations that have decided to go along with the notion that expertise counts for nothing. (Last year, English National Opera stopped giving critics a second ticket for performances in order to make more seats available to novice bloggers: \u201cOpera can be seen as a closed art form, and we think people should be able to review it more emotionally... The question is: did it make you cry, did it make you happy?\u201d said its chief executive, Stuart Murphy, of this decision.) How to work in such an environment, let alone to make a living? How to remain independent and free-thinking, passionate and engaged? It\u2019s enough to make even the best of us give up.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>That, though, is the last thing we should do \u2013 give up, I mean. Criticism is important, and the critic has a vital role to play in our culture. Some things never change. We will always need something to push against. As Julian Barnes, once the TV critic of the <em>Observer,</em> puts it: \u201cApart from anything else, criticism is a standard against which to judge our own ideas.\u201d But given the general din, the assumption that everyone is a critic now, the flummery and fake news, the sheer <em>speed</em> at which our world moves, perhaps the work of the critic is becoming more important than ever. The hot-take economy is blithely indifferent to lasting value, to working out what a work of art means, and what it might tell us about ourselves. \u201cTo me, the work of criticism is the work of close reading,\u201d says Simran Hans, the <em>Observer</em> film critic, and a writer young enough to have come of age online. For her, as for me, criticism isn\u2019t just an opinion. It\u2019s a historical document: a record of a time, a place, a particular sensibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think art exists in a vacuum,\u201d she says. \u201cI think criticism should be a work of record that is able to distil what an artwork is saying about the world in which it was made. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/the-most-powerful-piece-of-film-criticism-ever-written/359996/\" title=\"\">James Baldwin\u2019s The Devil Finds Work</a> [a 1976 critique of the racial politics of American cinema] is my gold standard for this.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t agree with those who assert that critics are simply those who can\u2019t write a book, shoot a film, or paint a picture themselves, and that this therefore disqualifies them from the job (the singer Lizzo once claimed only musicians should be allowed to review albums). Yes, there are dance critics who used to be members of a ballet corps, and architecture critics who were trained to design buildings; these people bring reserves of knowledge and experience. But when I published a book after years of having written about other people\u2019s, it didn\u2019t make me a better critic, nor even a more sympathetic one (in fact, I\u2019m less tolerant now than before of books that are lazy or glib). Not being able to do something oneself is no guide at all to a person\u2019s skills as a critic; to their ability to notice what matters. \u201cA critic is a man who knows the way, but can\u2019t drive the car,\u201d as the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s great theatre critic, Kenneth Tynan, once put it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9eb8906d0f0b0b002d096f80c7822162a6bbbd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9eb8906d0f0b0b002d096f80c7822162a6bbbd4/94_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taika Waititi in Jojo Rabbit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taika Waititi\u2019s film Jojo Rabbit recently divided audiences and critics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Searchlight</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor do I think it matters if the critics and the public disagree \u2013 as happened with Taika Waititi\u2019s Oscar-winning second world war story, <em>Jojo Rabbit</em> (the critics mainly loathed it; the public absolutely loved it). Consensus is a growing problem in our culture. It is inescapably the case that some artists, like some kinds of art, are deemed to be beyond criticism \u2013 something that, in my view, stifles debate every bit as much as cancel culture (it also makes life very bland and boring). Lone voices, if their disagreement is based on knowledge and insight, are crucial, and when you hear such a cry in the dark, it\u2019s often with a sense of relief. I felt this recently when I read the only review of the late Deborah Orr\u2019s memoir <em>Mother</em><em>well</em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/01/deborah-orr-s-motherwell-memoir-family-insights-and-dark-asides\" title=\"\">by the journalist Janice Turner</a> \u2013 that expressed any reservation at all about it (Turner pointed out that Orr\u2019s obsession in the book with narcissism is completely bewildering unless you know \u2013 and how could you know? \u2013 that she is really writing about her ex-husband, Will Self).</p> <p>You will say that I have a vested interest in all this, and it\u2019s true: I do. But there are lots of people, not only readers, but artists, too, who would miss critics if they were to disappear. \u201cIt completes the circle,\u201d says Richard Eyre, the theatre and film director. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a dialogue between the work and a person who is assessing it. That is valuable.\u201d When he ran the National Theatre in the 90s, he had to read a pile of cuttings every day. How much anxiety did this cause him? \u201cA lot,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was quite painful.\u201d Did a review ever make him change his mind? \u201cI think so, yes. The ones who write and argue in the context of what you\u2019ve tried to do \u2013 you do listen, and sometimes you think: \u2018Yes, of course; I hadn\u2019t realised it could be seen like that, but I do now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>David Eldridge, the playwright, agrees. \u201cI do read reviews. It would seem perverse not to. After all the work of writing the play, the love and the thought, and then the company pulling it together, it would be odd to avoid what people are saying about it. At their best, the critics can really share something of an evening in the theatre with their readers \u2013 and they can keep artists honest. But I tend to think reviews are most useful months after the play has closed, when you can be more reflective and thoughtful. I think they\u2019re good at picking up something being amiss, even if their diagnosis as to the cause is wrong.\u201d Reviews have made a real difference to his career \u2013 in both directions. Jack Tinker in the <em>Daily Mail</em> turned his first play, <em>Serving </em><em>It Up</em>, into a hot ticket; the <em>New York Times</em> helped to close <em>Festen</em> on Broadway after only four weeks when it \u201cpoured a cup of cold sick\u201d over it: \u201cI felt very hurt.\u201d But a writer\u2019s relationship with critics can be about more than bums on seats. He believes that the best critics helped to inform his \u201csense of self as a writer and artist\u201d by spotting his early promise and then, later, suggesting that he\u2019d fulfilled it.</p> <p>Richard Eyre grew up reading, in the <em>Observer,</em> the film critic Penelope Gilliatt, and Ken Tynan \u2013 \u201cYou had to see what their view was, because it mattered\u201d \u2013 and he believes that, at its highest level, criticism can be a work of art in its own right. Which brings us back to where we started: with my jokes about Mary Beard and her nudes. In the end, it\u2019s the job of the critic not only to inform, to challenge, to try to put something down for posterity, but to entertain; to use words to dazzle the reader with a sense of exactitude; to cause a feeling of rightness and sudden conviction to fall on them like \u2013 to pinch from Philip Larkin \u2013 an enormous yes (Larkin, by the way, was a brilliant critic). Criticism that can do these things is not disposable. It\u2019s as timeless, sometimes, as the thing it describes.</p> <p>When I finish talking to Eyre, I carry out a small experiment, opening at random a copy of <em>Tynan Left &amp; Right</em>, a collection of his work from 1967. The first thing I see is a review of a play that was, until recently, on at the Almeida theatre in London: <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em> by John Webster. Naturally, the actors who were then appearing in it at the Aldwych \u2013 Peggy Ashcroft and Eric Porter \u2013 are both long dead; his thoughts about their performances don\u2019t really interest me. But every word of what he says about Webster \u2013 to which he devotes most of his review \u2013 is so thrillingly veracious as to be almost preposterous. (\u201cIdeally, one feels, he would have had all his characters drowned in a sea of cold sweat,\u201d Tynan writes of the playwright\u2019s horrible way with his own creations.) Here was a review that felt brand new: as alive to me in 2020 as it must have been to the subeditor who received it late one night in 1960 and, realising in an instant it was pure gold, treated himself to another cigarette.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Rachel Cooke is a feature writer and book critic for the Observer</em></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Number of cases globally passes 640,000</h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has reached 640,589, with 29,848 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. So far, 137,270 people are confirmed to have recovered. However, the true number of infections is likely to be much higher, as many of those with symptoms not have been tested for the virus.</p> <h2>Trump warns of US quarantine</h2> <p>The US president, Donald Trump, has warned that it may be necessary to enforce a short-term quarantine of about two weeks in states including New York. However, the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said that he not been told of any plans to introduce a quarantine, adding: \u201cI haven\u2019t had those conversations, I don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d He also announced that he was postponing the state\u2019s 28 April presidential primary to 23 June.</p> <h2><strong>Italian death toll passes 10,000</strong></h2> <p>In Italy, 10,023 people have now died from coronavirus, after the death toll rose by 889 since Friday. The number of confirmed cases in the country increased to 92,472 from 86,498.</p> <h2>UK death toll reaches 1,000</h2> <p>The number of people killed by coronavirus in the UK has reached 1,021, with 17,301 confirmed cases. The latest total is 34% higher than the equivalent figure yesterday, marking the biggest day-on-day percentage increase since 18 March, when the jump was 46%.</p> <h2>Spain\u2019s coronavirus outbreak \u2018may be peaking\u2019</h2> <p>The coronavirus outbreak may be peaking in areas of Spain, the country\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday. The statement came after it recorded 832 deaths in one day \u2013 the highest number yet. The number of cases increased from 64,059 on Friday to 72,248 on Saturday, and a total of 5,812 people have now died from Covid-19, according to John Hopkins University.</p> <h2>Russia to close borders</h2> <p>Russia will close its borders on Monday, a government order published on Saturday said. The measure will apply to all vehicle, rail and pedestrian checkpoints, as well as maritime borders\u200b. Russia has already stopped all international flights. Russian diplomats and drivers of freight trucks, among others, will be exempt. The country has so far reported 1,264 coronavirus cases.</p> <h2>EU grants \u20ac250m aid to Tunisia</h2> <p>The E\u200bU\u200b has granted Tunisia \u20ac250m\u200b in aid to help it cope with the economic and social effects of the coronavirus outbreak, EU ambassador \u200bPatrice Bergamini\u200b said in a tweet.</p> <p>Tunisia has limited healthcare infrastructure, leading to concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Currently, the country has 227 confirmed cases and six deaths.</p>",
  "<p>Where did the virus causing the current pandemic come from? How did it get to a food market in Wuhan, China, from where it is thought to have spilled over into humans? The answers to these questions are gradually being pieced together, and the story they tell makes for uncomfortable reading.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start at the beginning. As of 17 March, we know that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (a member of the coronavirus family that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19) is the product of natural evolution. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">A study of its genetic s</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">equence</a>, conducted by infectious disease expert Kristian G Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and colleagues, rules out the possibility that it could have been manufactured in a lab or otherwise engineered. Puff go the conspiracy theories.</p> <p>The next step is a little less certain, but it seems likely that the original animal reservoir for the virus was bats. Andersen\u2019s team showed \u2013 like the Chinese before them \u2013that the sequence of Sars-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that infect bats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since other bat coronaviruses have transited to humans via an intermediate animal host, it seems likely that this one did too. That animal was probably one that some Chinese people like to eat, and that is therefore sold in \u201cwet\u201d markets (those that sell fresh meat, fish, seafood and other produce). This animal may have been the scaly mammal called a pangolin. That can\u2019t be conclusively proved, but several groups have found sequence similarities between Sars-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that infect pangolins.</p> <p>If this is indeed the route the virus took to humans, it has two critical interfaces: one between us and the intermediate host, possibly a pangolin, and one between that host and bats. Most of the attention so far has been focused on the interface between humans and the intermediate host, with fingers of blame being pointed at Chinese wet markets and eating habits, but both interfaces were required for the pandemic to ignite. So where and how did the spillover from the bat to the pangolin \u2013 or other wild or semi-wild intermediate host \u2013 occur?</p> <p>\u201cOur study does not directly shed light on the geographical origin of the virus,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cHowever, all the available evidence shows that it was inside China.\u201d</p> <p>Case closed then, and President Trump is right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">call S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">ars-CoV-2 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d</a>. Well, no, because if you want to understand why this pandemic happened now and not, say, 20 years ago \u2013 since Chinese people\u2019s taste for what we in the west consider exotic fare is not new \u2013 you have to include a number of other factors. \u201cWe can blame the object \u2013 the virus, the cultural practice \u2013 but causality extends out into the relationships between people and ecology,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace of the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps in St Paul, Minnesota.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af1a5624e7aad3f184147d07b18c1f58af9f6e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af1a5624e7aad3f184147d07b18c1f58af9f6e76/0_185_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province, in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province, in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starting in the 1990s, as part of its economic transformation, China ramped up its food production systems to industrial scale. One side effect of this, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\">as anthropologists </a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\">Lyle Fearnley and Christos Lynteris</a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\"> have documented</a>, was that smallholding farmers were undercut and pushed out of the livestock industry. Searching for a new way to earn a living, some of them turned to farming \u201cwild\u201d species that had previously been eaten for subsistence only. Wild food was formalised as a sector, and was increasingly branded as a luxury product. But the smallholders weren\u2019t only pushed out economically. As industrial farming concerns took up more and more land, these small-scale farmers were pushed out geographically too \u2013 closer to uncultivable zones. Closer to the edge of the forest, that is, where bats and the viruses that infect them lurk. The density and frequency of contacts at that first interface increased, and hence, so did the risk of a spillover.</p> <p>It\u2019s true, in other words, that an expanding human population pushing into previously undisturbed ecosystems has contributed to the increasing number of zoonoses \u2013 human infections of animal origin \u2013 in recent decades. That has been documented for Ebola and HIV, for example. But behind that shift has been another, in the way food is produced. Modern models of agribusiness are contributing to the emergence of zoonoses.</p> <p><br>Take flu, a disease that is considered to have high pandemic potential, having caused an estimated 15 pandemics in the past 500 years. \u201cThere is clearly a link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and intensified poultry production systems,\u201d says spatial epidemiologist Marius Gilbert of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0573688276e584fe1409eb5358e14f24d95fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0573688276e584fe1409eb5358e14f24d95fff/0_41_3008_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pangolin, the scaly mammal thought to be a possible intermediate host for the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pangolin, the scaly mammal thought to be a possible intermediate host for the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: N/A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reasons, many of which were documented in Wallace\u2019s 2016 book <em><a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781583675892/big-farms-make-big-flu/\">Big Farms Make Big Flu</a></em>, include the density with which chickens, turkeys or other poultry are packed into factory farms, and the fact that the birds in a given farm tend to be near genetic clones of one another \u2013 having been selected over decades for desirable traits such as lean meat. If a virus gets introduced into such a flock, it can race through it without meeting any resistance in the form of genetic variants that prevent its spread. Both experimental manipulations and observations in the real world have demonstrated that this process can result in a ratcheting up of the virus\u2019s virulence. If it then spills over into humans, we are potentially in trouble.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00084/full\">a paper published in 2018</a>, Gilbert\u2019s group reviewed historical \u201cconversion events\u201d, as they call them \u2013 when a not-very-pathogenic avian flu strain became much more dangerous, and found that most of them had occurred in commercial poultry systems, and more frequently in wealthy countries. Europe, Australia and the US had generated more of them than China.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t let China off the hook. Two highly pathogenic forms of avian flu \u2013 H5N1 and H7N9 \u2013 have emerged in that country in recent decades. Both infect humans, though not easily (yet). The first human cases of H7N9 were reported in 2013, and there were small annual outbreaks thereafter. But, says Gilbert, \u201cnothing was done until the virus turned out to be pathogenic for chickens as well. Then it became an important economic issue and China started to mass-vaccinate its poultry against H7N9, and that ended the transmission to humans.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48b0309e695838ee46c8ce80a8107f492bff522\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48b0309e695838ee46c8ce80a8107f492bff522/0_24_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner reading \u201cWe are all pangolins\u201d hangs on a balcony in Bordeaux, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner reading \u2018We are all pangolins\u2019 hangs on a balcony in Bordeaux, France. The entire country has been on coronavirus lockdown since 16 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China is one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.worldstopexports.com/chicken-exports-by-country/\">major exporters of poultry</a>, but its poultry industry is not wholly Chinese-owned. After the recession of 2008, for example, New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs diversified its holdings and <a href=\"https://thepoultrysite.com/news/2008/08/goldman-sachs-buys-chinese-poultry-farms\">moved into Chinese poultry farms</a>. So if China has its share of responsibility for spillover events, it isn\u2019t alone. That is why Wallace insists on talking about relational geographies rather than absolute geographies, when it comes to identifying the causes of disease. Or as he puts it: \u201cFollow the money.\u201d</p> <p>Not everybody sees a straightforward link between factory farming and new and dangerous forms of flu. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, points out that before they were brought into factory farms, poultry were kept outside. The factory model may ramp up virulence, he says, but it probably protects a flock from being infected by a virus in the first place.</p> <p>Still, Worobey doesn\u2019t doubt that farming and other human-animal interactions have shaped our disease ecology. His group collects the sequences of flu viruses from a range of animal hosts, including humans, and plots them on a family treeto try to understand how flu has evolved over time. Flu is constantly mutating \u2013 that\u2019s the reason the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year \u2013 but it mutates at different rates in different hosts, which means that his flu family tree is informative both about the parentage and intermediate host of each strain and about the approximate timing of past spillover events.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible \u2013 though by no means certain \u2013 that flu first became a disease of humans after the Chinese domesticated ducks about 4,000 years ago \u2013 drawing that animal reservoir into human communities for the first time. But humans can also catch flu from, and give flu to, pigs \u2013 another animal we have lived alongside for millennia. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531761\">A few years ago, Worobey suggested</a> \u2013 controversially \u2013 that birds might not always have been the main intermediate host for human flu viruses. Until about a century ago, he reported, people may have caught flu from horses. Around the time that motor vehicles supplanted horses as transport, poultry farming was expanding in the western hemisphere, and it\u2019s possible, Worobey argued, that birds then took over as the main intermediate host of flu for humans.</p> <p>Not everyone buys that scenario. Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London, says that if horses were once the main intermediate host for flu, \u201cmost avian viruses would contain the mammalian adaptation\u201d, and they don\u2019t. David Morens of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, thinks that it is more likely that the horse was a temporary detour, and that the main intermediate host of flu for humans has always been birds \u2013 especially wild ones. But all agree that humans have shaped these host-pathogen relationships, through our use of land and other animal species. And as Worobey points out, the sheer size of the human population today means that in the 21st century, we are doing so on an unprecedented scale. He estimates, for example, that domesticated ducks probably outnumber wild ones by now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77547b476425077b6dfa0119ca40c060471263b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77547b476425077b6dfa0119ca40c060471263b8/0_276_4356_2614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders selling bat meat at a market in Tomohon City, Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders selling bat meat at a market in Tomohon City, Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronny Adolof Buol/Sijori Images via Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And we\u2019re not just talking about birds. Gilbert believes a ratcheting up of viral virulence is happening in pig herds, too. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a disease of pigs that was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9545131\">first described in the US in the </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9545131\">late 1980s</a>, has since spread to herds across the worldand strains detected recently in China are more virulent than the early American ones. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7696\">A </a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7696\">2015</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7696\"> study</a> carried out by Martha Nelson of the US National Institutes of Health and colleagues mapped the genetic sequences of swine flu viruses and found that Europe and the US \u2013 the largest global exporters of pigs \u2013 are also the largest exporters of swine flu.</p> <p>There have been claims on social media, sometimes posted by vegans, that if we ate less meat there would have been no Covid-19. Interestingly, some of these have been <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/03/18/coronavirus-fact-check-covid-19-caused-eating-animals/5073094002/\">blocked by mainstream news organisations</a> as \u201cpartly false\u201d. But the claims are also partly true. Though the links they draw are too simplistic, the evidence is now strong that the way meat is produced \u2013 and not just in China \u2013 contributed to Covid-19.</p> <p>It is clear that to prevent or at least slow the emergence of new zoonoses, as Fearnley and Lynteris have argued, China\u2019s wet markets will need to be better regulated. But we also need to look behind those markets, at how our food is produced globally.</p> <p>Though it may not feel like it now, Wallace says, we have been lucky with Sars-CoV-2. It appears to be far less lethal that either H7N9 \u2013 which kills around a third of those it infects \u2013 or H5N1, which kills even more. This gives us an opportunity, he says, to question our lifestyle choices \u2013 because chicken isn\u2019t cheap if it costs a million lives \u2013 and vote for politicians who hold agribusiness to higher standards of ecological, social and epidemiological sustainability. \u201cHopefully,\u201d he says, \u201cthis will change our notions about agricultural production, land use and conservation.\u201d</p>",

A week later Johnson ordered the police to implement a partial lockdown to combat the virus, telling people they \u201cmust stay at home\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have had a fair amount of people looking at it and they are sceptical,\u201d says Tegnell. \u201cThey think Imperial chose a number of variables that gave a prognosis that was quite pessimistic, and that you could just as easily have chosen other variables that gave you another outcome. It\u2019s not a peer-reviewed paper. It might be right, but it might also be terribly wrong.

  "<p>Charter flights to bring in agricultural workers from eastern Europe are needed as a matter of urgency, otherwise fruit and vegetables will be left unpicked in Britain\u2019s fields, the government is being warned.</p> <p>Some large farms have already been chartering planes to bring in labour from eastern Europe. But farming organisations and recruitment agencies say that, in the face of massive disruption to the agricultural sector caused by the spread of the coronavirus, the government needs to step in and help organise more flights.</p> <p>Some 90,000 positions need to be filled, many in just a few weeks\u2019 time. One leading supplier, the charity <a href=\"https://www.concordiavolunteers.org.uk/\">Concordia</a>, was looking to bring in around 10,000 labourers \u2013 half from the EU and the rest from Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Barbados. But all of the non-EU countries are closed. On Wednesday, in a big setback, Ukraine extended its lockdown from 2 April until 23 April.</p> <p>Stephanie Maurel, Concordia\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur recruitment outside the EU is stalled which leaves us with Lithuania, which has closed borders, Romania with no airplanes, and Bulgaria which is our little beacon.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Although Bulgaria is on countrywide lockdown, farm workers are classed as key workers and can move around the country. But most airlines that operate in Bulgaria \u2013 including EasyJet \u2013 are grounded. A Wizz Air flight bringing in 450 people landed a week ago on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about chartering planes to bring workers in,\u201d Maurel said. \u201cIt costs around \u00a310,000 for an hour\u2019s flight carrying 229 people \u2013 that\u2019s \u20ac45,000 Sofia to London, or around \u20ac250 per person.\u201d</p> <p>Maurel, who said the plan was being actively discussed by both the National Farmers\u2019 Union and the Association of Labour Providers, called on the government to help provide urgent clarity.</p> <p>\u201cIf I put up reserves and guarantees [to secure a charter flight], I need to know it can take off.\u201d</p> <p>Some farms were struggling even before the crisis hit. A tightening of the labour market, a combination of Brexit and the booming domestic economies of eastern Europe proving more attractive to seasonal workers, had seen a decline in the number of fruit and vegetable pickers coming to the UK.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the tightening of labour, we had already lost a percentage of farms,\u201d Maurel said. \u201cThis will finish others off. You won\u2019t have fruit and veg in shops. Asparagus and beans start in a couple of weeks, cucumbers early April, tomatoes are all year round; in May it\u2019s soft fruits \u2013 strawberries, raspberries; lettuces have been in the ground since December.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Marston, the chairman of British Summer Fruits, which represents soft fruit growers, acknowledged that his industry was \u201centering an unprecedented time\u201d.</p> <p>Last year, 98% of fruit pickers \u2013 now classed as \u201ckey workers\u201d \u2013 came from outside the UK, the vast majority from Bulgaria and Romania.</p> <p>British growers have been contacting companies in the hospitality sector to recruit laid-off staff.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.britishsummerfruits.co.uk/jobs\">British Summer Fruits website</a> carries an interactive map showing the locations of farms around the UK and the jobs on offer.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very optimistic about the ability of UK residents to come out and help us,\u201d Marston said. \u201cThey may be people from eastern Europe who were working here in the hospitality sector, who are relatively young and don\u2019t have that many ties and want a job paying reasonable pay in reasonable conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The environment secretary, George Eustice said: \u201cOur farmers are doing a fantastic job of feeding the nation during this immensely challenging time. I have been speaking with industry about the critically important issue of seasonal workers, who usually come from Europe to pick fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to mobilise the British workforce to fill that gap and make sure our excellent fruit and vegetables are on people\u2019s plates over the summer months. There are already brilliant recruitment efforts underway by industry and I would encourage as many people as possible to sign up.</p> <p>\u201cWe will also be looking at other ways to make sure farmers have support they need ahead of the busy harvest months, while also keeping workers safe and protected.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For the non-key workers among us, as trips outside are limited to daily exercise and infrequent shopping for essential items only (and yes, I judged myself when I put a six-pack of McCoy\u2019s and a bag of Twirl Bites in the basket), a make-do-and-mend ethos is already creeping into our daily lives. At least it is in my flat, where I suspect we are only one inspirational YouTube tutorial away from learning how to crochet vegetable scraps into reusable cloths.</p> <p>That same DIY spirit is spreading across the entertainment world faster than rich people are finding private tests for Covid-19. Those who work in the creative industries are having to figure out how to keep the spirit of their work alive, in lieu of having an actual stable source of income from it.</p> <p>Many TV productions have been suspended or delayed, especially the ones you were most looking forward to, which means we are likely to run out of new shows to gobble up in quarantine, leaving us with nothing but an endless loop of the news and <em>This Morning</em>, as our eyes are propped open with matchsticks. However, Jodie Whittaker rolled up her sleeves and produced what surely counts as a mini, DIY episode of <em>Doctor Who</em>. From the safety of what appears to have been a wardrobe, Whittaker, as the Doctor, delivered a beautiful little speech aimed at reassuring children, but which may have managed to reassure a few older viewers, too.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, I think somebody, somewhere, might be a little bit worried,\u201d she began, urging kids to talk, tell jokes and be kind to each other, while remembering that darkness never prevails. In trying to soothe her younger viewers, Whittaker reversed the show\u2019s decades-long dedication to scaring the bejesus out of them. Plus, the fact that she\u2019s got her costume at home, is, well, lovely.</p> <p>This is the kind of content we need from famous people. In a video interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Courteney Cox revealed that the filming of the much-hyped <em>Friends</em> reunion has been postponed. To pass the time, however, she has been binge-watching... <em>Friends</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI just started season one,\u201d she said, explaining that she was always asked about it but remembered very little. Her verdict? \u201cIt\u2019s really good!\u201d In the same video, she showed Kimmel her kitchen cupboard, in which everything was organised by jar.

  "<p>More than 35,000 badgers were killed during last year\u2019s cull, according to long overdue figures slipped out by the government on Friday at the height of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The total has dismayed animal rights campaigners, who claim that for the first time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/11/badger-cull-england-extended\">since the cull was introduced in 2013</a>, more badgers were shot last year than cattle were slaughtered because they have bovine-TB.</p> <p>Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cThe government licensed the killing of 35,034 badgers in 2019 in 40 culling zones stretching from Cornwall to Cumbria in the largest destruction of a protected species in living memory.\u201d</p> <p>More than 70% of the badgers (24,645) were killed as a result of controlled shooting.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/30/covert-footage-reveals-cruelty-of-badger-culls\">method of killing</a> which is condemned by the British Veterinary Association as inhumane as it can result in badgers taking more than five minutes to die from multiple bullet wounds, blood loss and organ failure,\u201d Dyer said.</p> <p>Only 149 (0.6%) of the total 35,034 badgers killed were monitored to establish that they were dispatched humanely.</p> <p>The total number of badgers killed since the cull policy started now stands at 102,349. It has been estimated that the cull has cost the taxpayer more than \u00a360m.</p> <p>The figures were supposed to have been published months ago but were delayed as the efficacy of the government\u2019s policy came in for criticism.</p> <p>\u201cBadgers are now being slaughtered at such a rate across England that they could face local extinction in areas of the country which they have inhabited since the Ice Age,\u201d Dyer said.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this mass destruction of a protected species, the government has failed to produce any reliable evidence to prove that the culling of badgers is making any significant impact on lowering bovine-TB in cattle in or around the cull zones.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">'Seismic shift\u2019: ministers signal end of badger cull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response to an independent review into its TB policy, the government recently acknowledged that the mass slaughter of badgers was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">not a long-term solution</a> to reducing bovine-TB.

The <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/sectors/animal-health/animal-health-rh-panel/bovine-tb/\">National Farmers Union</a> has expressed frustration that culling and badger vaccination are being given a \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d. The NFU said vaccination had never been demonstrated to reduce bovine-TB with the same efficacy as culling.</p> <p>Following the change in government policy, the NFU deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said: \u201cIn areas where TB in badgers is endemic, we must retain culling as a vital tool enabling industry to get on top of the disease quickly and reduce further transmission.\u201d</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cBovine TB leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers as they suffer the loss of highly prized animals and valued herds. As independent research has shown, the badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease but no one wants to continue the cull of this protected species forever.

  "<p>As we wait for the tsunami, the mood becomes increasingly apocalyptic. This is right and proper, but not for the reason you might think. The <em>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</em> tells us that \u201capocalypse\u201d actually means \u201crevelation\u201d and that sounds spot-on to me.</p> <p>In his magisterial book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Epidemics-Society-Black-Present-Courses-ebook/dp/B07YLQJWWG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=OFGLCI4CRJ7A&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=epidemics+and+society&amp;qid=1585146528&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=epidemics+and+%2Caps%2C128&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><em>Epidemics and Society</em></a>, the historian Frank Snowden examined ways in which disease outbreaks have altered the societies through which they have spread. \u201cEpidemics,\u201d he said in a recent interview, are \u201ca category of disease that seem to hold up the mirror to human beings as to who we really are. That is to say, they obviously have everything to do with our relationship to our mortality, to death, to our lives. They also ... show the moral relationships that we have toward each other as people, and we\u2019re seeing that today.\u201d They are, in other words, revelations.</p> <p>Two recent episodes illustrate that point nicely. Waiting to check out at Aldi one day, I noticed that a box of hand sanitisers near the till was empty, and mentioned it to the cashier. He said that they sold out every time they put up a new box. Being a soap-and-water man, I was unperturbed, but on arriving home I logged onto amazon.co.uk to see how matters stood online. There were pages and pages of hand-sanitiser gel, though relatively few with the 60%+ of alcohol content recommended for the coronavirus. But I found one for \u00a36.99 with free delivery and so put it in my basket, only to discover that the \u201cfree\u201d delivery would only get it to me a month hence. On the other hand, I could get it in a week if I opted to pay. Q: how much was delivery? A: \u00a348. The polite term for this is price-gouging.</p> <p>Exhibit B is a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/technology/coronavirus-purell-wipes-amazon-sellers.html\" title=\"\"><em>New York Times </em>story<em> </em></a>from across the pond. According to the newspaper, on 1 March, the day after the first coronavirus death in the US, two Tennessee brothers, Matt and Noah Colvin, went to every store in their home town and cleaned it out of hand sanitiser. Over the next three days, Noah embarked on a 1,300-mile road trip across Tennessee and into Kentucky, filling a rented truck with thousands of bottles of the stuff and thousands of packs of antibacterial wipes.</p> <p>Having cornered the market, the Colvins then set about selling their wares on Amazon. Initially they sold 300 bottles for between $8 and $70 each, and presumably started laughing all the way to the bank. The glee was short-lived, however, for the next day Amazon pulled their items and thousands of other listings for sanitiser, wipes and face masks. The company also suspended some of the sellers behind the listings and warned many others that if they kept increasing prices, they\u2019d lose their accounts. In this way, the Colvin boys found themselves with 17,700 bottles of sanitiser and nowhere to sell them. (In the end they donated two-thirds of them to charity; the remaining third were confiscated by the Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office, which had launched an investigation.)</p> <p>These two stories demonstrate how a pandemic reveals aspects of human nature that we\u2019d prefer not to think about. But they also reveal an important truth about our economies, namely the extent to which Amazon has become so central \u2013 and so powerful. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/the-us-of-amazon-how-the-coronavirus-has-created-a-governance-vacuum-the-tech-giant-is-quickly-filling%0D\" title=\"\">as Julia Carrie Wong pointed out the other day</a>, Amazon in the US is beginning to behave more like a government than is the Trump administration. Wong likens the hiring of 100,000 staff and a $2-an-hour pay rise to a 21st-century version of FDR\u2019s famous Works Progress Administration (WPA). The company\u2019s sudden support for small businesses around its Seattle HQ (so that they might live to serve Amazonians another day) is, she says, akin to a government stimulus package. And its decision to stop accepting non-essential products from third-party sellers who use its warehouses essentially amounts to government-style market regulation.</p> <p>This pandemic will radically transform the industrial and commercial landscape of western societies. Lots of companies \u2013 large and small \u2013 will go to the wall, no matter how fervent government promises of support are. But when the smoke clears and some kind of normality returns, a small number of corporations \u2013 ones that have played a central role in keeping things going \u2013 will emerge strengthened and more dominant. And chief among them will be Jeff Bezos\u2019s everything store.</p> <p>What we will then have to come to terms with is that Amazon is becoming part of the critical infrastructure of western states. So too perhaps are Google and Microsoft. (Apple is more like a luxury good \u2013 nice but not essential, and the only reason for keeping Facebook is WhatsApp.) In which case, one of the big questions to be answered as societies rebuild once the virus has finally been tamed will be a really difficult one: how should Amazon be regulated?</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading </h2> <p><strong>Tipping point </strong><br>\u201cThe last global crisis didn\u2019t change the world.

  "<p>The global impact of the coronavirus pandemic poses a fundamental question: is this one of those historic moments when the world changes permanently, when the balance of political and economic power shifts decisively, and when, for most people, in most countries, life is never quite the same again?</p> <p>Put more simply, is this the end of the world as we know it? And, equally, could the crisis mark a new beginning?</p> <p>Genuinely pivotal global moments, watersheds or turning points (pick your own terminology) are actually quite rare. Yet if the premise is correct \u2013 that there can be no return to the pre-Covid-19 era \u2013 then it poses many unsettling questions about the nature of the change, and whether it will be for better or worse.</p> <p>For countless individuals and families, normal life has already been upended in previously unimaginable ways. But how will the pandemic influence the future behaviour of nation states, governments and leaders \u2013 and their often dysfunctional relationships? Will they work together more closely, or will this shared trauma further divide them?</p> <p>Some analysts see grounds for optimism, for example in beneficial environmental effects in northern Italy and China. Countries hitherto at odds, such as Iran and the UAE, are cooperating, at least temporarily. In the Philippines, the crisis prompted a ceasefire with Communist rebels. Global interdependence and the importance of collective, multilateral approaches have been vividly underscored.</p> <p>But there is also a more pessimistic view, typified by Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard University. \u201cThe pandemic will strengthen the state and reinforce nationalism. Governments of all types will adopt emergency measures to manage the crisis, and many will be loath to relinquish these new powers when the crisis is over,\u201d he wrote in <em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\">Foreign Policy</a></em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\"> </a>magazine.</p> <p>Walt continued: \u201cCovid-19 will also accelerate the shift in power and influence from west to east. The response in Europe and America has been slow and haphazard by comparison [with China, South Korea and Singapore], further tarnishing the aura of the western \u2018brand\u2019\u2026 We will see a further retreat from hyper-globalisation, as citizens look to national governments to protect them and as states and firms seek to reduce future vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, Covid-19 will create a world that is less open, less prosperous and less free.\u201d</p> <p>Is Walt right? The cop-out answer is only time will tell. Yet the outcome is not preordained. The responses of everybody, from presidents and prime ministers to ordinary citizens, to the myriad challenges and upheavals arising from the pandemic will help determine what happens next.</p> <p>It\u2019s a chance to reset both global and personal landscapes. Notwithstanding present feelings of powerlessness, there are choices to be made about what kind of future awaits. After Covid-19, everything could be up for grabs.</p> <h2>Balance of power</h2> <p>After early blunders, China\u2019s government is working hard to turn Covid-19, first detected in Wuhan in November, into a national success story. It claims draconian measures to suppress the disease have largely worked. Now, by offering assistance to Italy and other badly affected countries, China is reinforcing its credentials as a global leader. The virus has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/china-prepares-to-seal-itself-off-from-the-world-to-stem-imported-coronavirus-cases\">soft power tool</a> to overtake its superpower rival, the US.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules</p> <footer> <cite>Mira Rapp-Hooper, US Council on Foreign Relations</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA critical part of this narrative is Beijing\u2019s supposed success in battling the virus. A steady stream of propaganda articles, tweets and public messaging, in a wide variety of languages, touts China\u2019s achievements and highlights the effectiveness of its model of domestic governance,\u201d wrote commentators Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi in <em><a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order\">Foreign Affairs</a></em> magazine.</p> <p>In contrast, Donald Trump is struggling to dispel a widespread perception of gross incompetence. \u201cThe US government\u2019s pandemic leadership has been its own special brand of catastrophe\u2026. [It] has placed its own citizens in unnecessary peril, while sidelining itself from acting as a global crisis leader,\u201d wrote Mira Rapp-Hooper of the US Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\u201cThis domestic and international governance crisis could change the nature of the international order in several ways \u2026. If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules according to its own global governance vision,\u201d she continued.</p> <h2>Authoritarianism and democracy</h2> <p>China\u2019s challenge to US hegemony was already strengthening on many fronts before the Covid-19 crisis erupted. The pandemic may accelerate this shift. For US-allied democracies that value open governance, civil rights and free speech, this is a worrying prospect.</p> <p>The trend towards centralised, authoritarian rule evident in countries such as India, Brazil and Turkey, and typified by China and Russia, has coincided with the rise of rightwing nationalist-populist governments and parties in Europe. Some are now following China\u2019s lead in attempting to weaponise the virus for political ends.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic unquestionably presents an era-defining challenge to public health and the global economy [but] its political consequences are less well-understood,\u201d the independent monitor, International Crisis Group, warned last week. \u201cUnscrupulous leaders may exploit the pandemic to advance their objectives in ways that exacerbate domestic or international crises \u2013 cracking down on dissent at home or escalating conflicts with rival states \u2013 on the assumption that they will get away with it while the world is otherwise occupied,\u201d the ICG said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64/0_316_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, may be tempted to use the pandemic to keep his country in a state of emergency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isopix/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One example cited by the report was Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent attempt to indefinitely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/putin-criminal-incompetent-president-enemy-of-his-own-people-russia\">extend his presidency</a> in Russia (although the virus has since forced him to postpone a vote that could have allowed him to stay in power until 2036). Another was a bid by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s nationalist leader, to renew a state of emergency \u201cthat prescribes five-year prison sentences for those disseminating false information or obstructing the state\u2019s crisis response.\u201d </p> <p>Governments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/egypt-forces-guardian-journalist-leave-coronavirus-story-ruth-michaelson\">Egypt</a>\u2019s have followed China\u2019s example in expelling foreign journalists, restricting media access and curtailing public discussion. Like Boris Johnson and many European leaders, Trump has also assumed emergency powers. From Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and Iraq to the US, UK and France, elections have been postponed, parliaments suspended, and lockdowns and curfews imposed.</p> <p>Most people may support such measures in the short term. But what if the crisis is protracted, with a \u201csecond wave\u201d running into next year? And what if the new controls are not relaxed or withdrawn after it ends? This is what Harvard\u2019s Stephen Walt meant about the danger of \u201cless free\u201d post-pandemic societies.</p> <h2>Globalisation and multilateralism</h2> <p>Unprecedented government aid packages for businesses and workers, intended to mitigate the disease\u2019s economic and financial impact, have led some analysts to suggest \u201cthe state is back\u201d \u2013 and that the limits of the postwar neoliberal, free market model have finally been reached.</p> <p>What the crisis has shown, it is argued, is that when the challenge is truly existential, only the state can offer holistic and equitable solutions. A natural corollary is that the high-water mark of globalisation has arrived. These are radical paradigm shifts. Will they endure?</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalisation,\u201d wrote Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank. The architecture of global economic governance established in the 20th century was at risk, he warned, raising the prospect that political leaders may \u201cretreat into overt geopolitical competition\u201d.</p> <p>For Robert Kaplan of the Eurasia Group, \u201ccoronavirus is the historical marker between the first phase of globalisation and the second \u2026. Globalisation 2.0 is about separating the globe into great-power blocs with their own burgeoning militaries and separate supply chains, about the rise of autocracies, and about social and class divides that have engendered nativism and populism \u2026. In sum, it is a story about <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-20/coronavirus-ushers-in-the-globalization-we-were-afraid-of?srnd=opinion\">new and re-emerging global divisions</a>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them</p> <footer> <cite>David Miliband, International Rescue Committee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If that\u2019s true, few will mourn the passing of the globalisation era. And support for Kaplan\u2019s theory may be found in increased post-pandemic protectionism if, as some predict, countries attempt to limit future exposure to global threats. The UN warned last week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">worldwide food shortages</a> caused by lack of workers, tougher immigration controls, sanctions and tariffs \u2013 and called for a new, more open approach.</p> <p>The weakening of multilateral forums and institutions, evident before the crisis, is another sign of a shrinking world. Trying to revive their collective clout, the wealthy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/g20-hold-emergency-video-summit-discuss-coronavirus\">G20 countries belatedly pledged</a> last week to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to fight the virus. But it remains largely unclear what that entails in practice, and who will take the lead.</p> <h2>Fragile world</h2> <p>The pandemic and its aftermath could be a game-changer for poorer countries with limited resources and means of recovery, and for refugees and people in conflict zones \u2013 but probably not in a good way.</p> <p>The ICG report is blunt: \u201cThe global outbreak has the potential to wreak havoc in fragile states [and] trigger widespread unrest \u2026. If the disease spreads in densely packed urban centres, it may be virtually impossible to control.\u201d This is precisely the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-cases-africa-pass-amid-fears-health-services-south-who\">fear stalking South Africa\u2019s townships</a> right now.</p> <p>The report said the dramatic global economic slowdown would disrupt trade flows and create unemployment in commodity-exporting poorer countries. \u201cIts implications are especially serious for those caught in the midst of conflict if, as seems likely, the disease disrupts humanitarian aid flows, limits peace operations, and postpones diplomacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0190375cc052fc870ba3abadb496e02bb8a77caa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0190375cc052fc870ba3abadb496e02bb8a77caa/0_212_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Displaced Syrians wait for hot meal in Idlib, Syria, last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Displaced Syrians wait for hot meal in Idlib, Syria, last month. The pandemic and global economic slowdown will make life in conflict zones even harder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burak Kara/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>War-afflicted Syrians, Afghans, Somalis, South Sudanese and Yemenis could be especially badly affected. That\u2019s why the UN last week launched an appeal for $2bn in humanitarian aid. Its secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wants trillions more in global financial stimulus to prevent \u201cmillions\u201d of deaths. \u201cCovid-19 is threatening the whole of humanity and the whole of humanity must fight back,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them,\u201d said David Miliband, who heads the International Rescue Committee. \u201cCoronavirus is not just a problem for rich countries. We are only as strong as our weakest health system.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the international community heeds this and similar calls will be a key test.</p> <h2>Resilience and paranoia</h2> <p>The crisis has exposed an endemic lack of resilience, symbolised by chronically under-resourced healthcare systems in even better-off countries. The decision of many governments to call in the armed forces to help with logistics and manpower partly reflects fears that weakening social cohesion may lead to disorder on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cIf governments have to resort to using paramilitary or military forces to quell, for example, riots or attacks on property, societies could begin to disintegrate. Thus the main, perhaps even the sole objective of economic policy today [rather than supporting financial markets] should be to prevent social breakdown,\u201d wrote Branko Milanovi\u0107, a professor at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>Yet, looked at differently, this kind of national mobilisation can be seen as a positive development rather than a threat to civil liberties \u2013 and as a more beneficial use of military power. In Britain as elsewhere, the call to arms has created new legions of NHS volunteers. This renewed sense of national sharing and identity is a much-needed antidote to the regressive nationalism of recent years.</p> <p>\u201cLooking ahead, governments will have to decide whether to support more cooperative approaches to handling the crisis, not only in global public health terms but also as a political and security challenge,\u201d the ICG said. \u201cAll leaders face pressure to focus on domestic priorities, and in particular to ignore conflict risks in weak states \u2026. But there will be a day after.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's possible that, over the longer term, democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic internationalism</p> <footer> <cite>John Ikenberry, Princeton University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While there is concern the pandemic could deepen divisions between countries and, for example, exacerbate anti-migrant sentiment, there is a fighting chance it will boost international cooperation, support for the UN, and a willingness to pursue dialogue rather than military and economic confrontation. The future need not be a globally debilitating US-China fight for supremacy.</p> <p>Elisabeth Braw of the Royal United Services Institute warns of a moment of extreme geopolitical vulnerability. \u201cThe coronavirus is a perfect opportunity for the west\u2019s adversaries to watch how countries cope \u2013 or don\u2019t cope \u2013 with a major crisis,\u201d she wrote. But John Ikenberry, professor of international affairs at Princeton University, is less fearful, pointing to the US-led recovery after the 1930s Depression.</p> <p>Intensifying great power rivalry in a fractured, damaged, poorer world might indeed be the future that awaits, Ikenberry suggested. But it was equally possible that, \u201cover the longer term, the democracies will come out of their shells to find a new type of pragmatic and protective internationalism\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, after the nightmare, a fresh start.</p> <h2>Five events that changed the modern world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dd28d22659352ae446b264ee8bef0556f913bbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dd28d22659352ae446b264ee8bef0556f913bbf/0_129_4065_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The installation of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London in 2014 that marked the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never again: Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London that marked the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Versailles peace conference<br></strong>The 1919-20 conference that followed the first world war was a historic turning point. It marked the formal demise of the German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, the advance of democratic, representative governance in Europe, and the start of what came to be known as the American or transatlantic century.</p> <p><strong>The Great Depression<br></strong>The Great Depression, the biggest worldwide economic calamity of the 20th century, began in the US in 1929 after the Wall Street crash. In the ensuing three years, global GDP fell by about 15% (compared with under 1% in the 2008-09 Great Recession). Things did not really pick up again until the second world war \u2013 a drastic remedy.</p> <p><strong>The battle of Stalingrad<br></strong>Fought on the banks of the Volga in southern Russia in 1942-43, the close to seven-month battle, the biggest in history, proved to be a pivotal moment in the second world war in Europe. For the first time, Hitler\u2019s armies were halted and beaten, and the myth of German invincibility destroyed. About 2 million combatants died.</p> <p><strong>The fall of the Berlin Wall<br></strong>The peaceful fall in 1989 of the Berlin Wall, the actual and symbolic dividing line between the Soviet bloc and the west, in effect ended the 44-year-long cold war. The ensuing implosion of the Soviet Union triggered the collapse of Russian-backed regimes around the world, leading the US to proclaim itself the sole global superpower.</p> <p><strong>The 9/11 attacks<br></strong>The attacks launched by al-Qaida on New York and Washington DC in September 2001 punctured American illusions of invulnerability and prompted George W Bush to declare a \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d. This led directly to the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the ensuing expansion of anti-western jihadism typified by Islamic State.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

  "<p>The increasing privatisation of children\u2019s care homes is \u201cplaying into the hands of abusers\u201d and putting children in danger of exploitation, according to a new report, seen by the <em>Observer</em>. </p> <p>Market forces are being allowed to dictate the housing and care of vulnerable children over their best interests, the study concludes, putting them at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/how-did-childrens-homes-become-centres-of-profit-making-and-abuse\">greater risk</a> from \u201ccounty lines\u201d drug gangs that are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/05/county-lines-drug-gangs-blackmailing-tracking-children-social-media\">known to target homes.</a></p> <p>The intervention comes from the <a href=\"https://howardleague.org/\">Howard League for Penal Reform,</a> which spoke to hundreds of people involved in children\u2019s residential care as well as police, homeowners, staff, social workers and children.</p> <p>The report reveals that companies that own homes in the increasingly privatised sector are placing them in poorer, more disadvantaged areas, so more children are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/councils-unwittingly-helping-drug-gangs-recruit-children-inquiry-says\">moved </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/councils-unwittingly-helping-drug-gangs-recruit-children-inquiry-says\"> from their support networks. </a>Three-quarters of homes in England are now private.</p> <p>It also finds that local authorities facing increasing pressure to place children are being charged huge fees by private providers without guarantees about how money is spent. Costs sometimes exceed \u00a3200,000 a year for a single placement.</p> <p>The Howard League warns that councils are struggling to take on large providers after a series of major mergers in the sector. The six largest independent providers of children\u2019s social care services made \u00a3215m profit in 2019. </p> <p>Children in care are known to be targeted by county lines gangs, who groom them to move drugs up and down the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe current residential children\u2019s homes structure is playing into the hands of abusers and contributing to the growth and geographical spread of the problem,\u201d the report states. \u201cWith the primary focus on profits this means that children\u2019s homes are usually situated in less expensive parts of the country and frequently in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>\u201cToo often children are placed wherever a bed can be found. The lack of places for children in care has led to what one police officer described as children being \u2018dumped\u2019 in emergency placements, sometimes into environments where people who are already exploiting children are operating and which puts them in danger.\u201d </p> <p>There are now calls for the government to look at the childcare home market as part of a promised review of the care system. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League, said: \u201cThe whole business model of \u2018county lines\u2019 has particularly thrived in the residential care market because children in residential care in England in particular are being moved around at the mercy of market forces, not their best interests.\u201d </p> <p>Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, said provision from independent companies would continue to be important, but warned that although councils tried to place children in homes near their family, soaring demand was creating problems. </p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cLocal authorities are required by law to ensure that accommodation for children in care is of high-quality and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 that it is safe. </p> <p>\u201cWe continue to work with the police, courts and care settings to keep these children safe and in education.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Decades ago, Prince sported high-cut, leather-look women\u2019s briefs on stage, and Rod Stewart borrowed satin knickers from his then girlfriend, Britt Ekland, to wear under tight trousers while performing. Now, ranges of male lingerie are being launched for the man on the street to buy \u2013 raising the question: will it catch on?</p> <p>One man thinks so. Jules Parker, 54, is a full-time metalworker who has set up Moot Lingerie, which combines traditional male underwear shapes with non-traditional lingerie flourishes and fabrics.</p> <p>\u201cIf I wanted anything more beautiful than daggy old boxer shorts there was nowhere to go, even online,\u201d Parker explains. \u201cWomen have a myriad shops or online outlets to find any kind of underwear they could wish for but the only items of lingerie made for men were cheap, tacky, novelty stuff.\u201d</p> <p>On the Moot site there are a number of envelope-pushing designs, from the Parisian (frilly knickers but sculptured for a man) to the Stardust (a thong with heritage lace pouch). </p> <p>He says that, when designing the pieces, he \u201cwanted to keep the language of typical lingerie but tailor it to fit the male form\u201d. To begin the process, he says that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t just take the shapes and sizes of boxer shorts and convert them. We went back to basics\u201d.</p> <p>Parker acknowledges that the idea of \u201clingerie for men\u201d is a controversial one. \u201cMen have not had this option before, it\u2019s not been considered acceptable to want to decorate yourself with this particular material,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been utterly taboo.

  "<p>In 1939, in <a href=\"https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/lewiscs-transposition/lewiscs-transposition-00-h.html\" title=\"\">a sermon</a> preached at Oxford University in the midst of a different global crisis, CS Lewis made a distinction that\u2019s worth revisiting today. It wasn\u2019t the case, he pointed out, that the outbreak of war had rendered human life suddenly fragile; rather, it was that people were suddenly realising it always had been. \u201cThe war creates no absolutely new situation,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice\u2026 We are mistaken when we compare war with \u2018normal life\u2019. Life has never been normal.\u201d</p> <p>In this time of acute collective anxiety, this sort of insight might not bring much peace of mind on its own. But it is a crucial first step, because it suggests that something about our gut-churning feelings of helplessness \u2013 the sense that we\u2019re facing an absolutely horrible, unprecedented emergency, which we\u2019ll surely lack the personal resilience to cope with \u2013 isn\u2019t wholly accurate. And it implies that we might be much better than we think at dealing with radical uncertainty \u2013 because in fact, every hour of every day, we already do.</p> <p>The special trouble with uncertainty is that it\u2019s a doorway to infinity. When you\u2019ve no idea what tomorrow will bring, it\u2019s easy to fill that gap with fantasy, and the world of fantasy knows no bounds. It\u2019s possible to imagine things getting limitlessly bad. (Most of us are vulnerable to what the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbg-pwEfu90\" title=\"\">psychotherapist Bruce Tift</a> calls \u201cannihilatory panic\u201d: the unconscious belief that there are certain feelings that would literally destroy us if we had to feel them.) Unsurprisingly, this feeds the destructive and self-perpetuating thought pattern that cognitive therapists call \u201ccatastrophising\u201d: taking every morsel of bad news as evidence that things are going to be globally, absolutely and eternally terrible. By contrast, when even extremely bad things happen, the situation, however dire, remains finite. An event occurs; it\u2019s over; then the people directly affected can begin to reconfigure their lives.</p> <p>One overarching strategy for dealing with the experience of intense uncertainty is to do whatever you can to bring yourself back to the world of the finite \u2013 to things as they actually are in your own concrete world, and the concrete things you can control. As a first step, try not to see anxious feelings as something you\u2019ve got to get rid of. <a href=\"https://www.lisamarchiano.com/\" title=\"\">Lisa Marchiano</a>, a therapist and writer based in Philadelphia, suggests making it your mission \u201cto tolerate uncertainty, rather than having to make it go away. That creates a different frame for thinking about things: all you have to do is tolerate it. Of course, that may be very difficult \u2013 but it can get us out of this place where we\u2019re spinning our wheels, trying to fix something it isn\u2019t within our power to fix.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I recommend the \u2018shaking practice\u2019 which has the added benefit of being so ridiculous as to be incompatible with misery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many of the most fruitful techniques for coping with uncertainty involve a similar move: they are ways to refocus your attention away from your runaway fantasies. If you\u2019re confined to your home at the moment, giving yourself some structure by drawing up an approximate schedule can reconnect you to the texture of the day. (\u201cEven if we hate our jobs, having somewhere to be at 9am is very containing, psychologically,\u201d Marchiano says.) You\u2019ll get a related \u201cgrounding\u201d effect by returning to the body through virtually any form of physical exercise. (As a specific antidote to anxious feelings, I highly recommend the \u201cshaking practice\u201d demonstrated by the coach Deepika Sheleff <a href=\"http://www.deeperintolife.com/videos.html\" title=\"\">on her website</a>, which is what it sounds like \u2013 and has the added benefit of being so ridiculous as to be incompatible with total misery.)</p> <p>There\u2019s no harm in a little distraction, if you can manage it. But one of the most intriguing insights of Buddhist psychology is that focusing on discomfort is even more effective. In another demonstration of the power of returning to concrete reality, if you spend a few moments paying attention as closely as possible to the physical sensations you\u2019re experiencing at this very moment, you\u2019ll probably find them much easier to tolerate. The meditation teacher <a href=\"https://kennethfolkdharma.com/\" title=\"\">Kenneth Folk</a> frames this as a matter of \u201cattentional bandwidth\u201d: your capacity to pay attention is strictly limited \u2013 and so the more of it you manage to dedicate to the experience you\u2019re having, the less remains available for dwelling on how unpleasant it is. (Complement this with the powerfully calming <a href=\"https://www.drweil.com/videos-features/videos/breathing-exercises-4-7-8-breath/\" title=\"\">4-7-8 breathing technique</a>: breathe in through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of seven, then exhale through your mouth, emptying the lungs as fully as possible, for a count of eight.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, as your to-do list isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 depending on your situation, it may just have become unfeasibly longer \u2013 you\u2019ll need a way to get things done in the presence of uncertainty, and here, too, a short-range, down-to-earth, finitude-focused approach is likely to the most effective. Even at the best of times, it\u2019s a good idea to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/05/how-to-tackle-your-to-do-lists-oliver-burkeman\" title=\"\">limit the number of tasks</a> you\u2019re working on at any given moment to three or four, seeing them through to completion before embarking on others; and in times of high stress, it may be worth reducing that limit to one. Pick a task, write it on a Post-it, position it somewhere prominent, then do that task; for that moment, it\u2019s the only goal you need to worry about accomplishing. Then repeat. Soon, you\u2019ll accumulate a pleasing number of Post-its, a testament to all the constructive stuff you\u2019ve managed to get done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/17/silver-linings-how-to-stay-positive-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Silver linings: how to stay positive during the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the anxiety abates a little, it may even become possible to glimpse the profound truth that, as Marchiano puts it, \u201ca crisis can heighten the opportunity to find meaning, to get clear about what matters most\u201d.

Don\u2019t be around people, and [for] people that are in recovery, that\u2019s like a recipe for disaster,\u201d said Denny Kolsch, a licensed mental health counselor, who is in recovery, and founded a mental health and addiction <a href=\"https://peace.club/\">treatment facility in Florida</a>.</p> <p>Although it\u2019s only been a few weeks since local and state governments in the United States started taking drastic measures to limit the spread of the virus, health professionals have already seen relapses or near-relapses as people experience more urges and cravings to use drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>Kolsch said one person relapsed on fentanyl and heroin after losing their new job when their workplace suddenly shuttered. And in every group therapy session over the last two weeks, the conversation has turned to Covid-19 \u2013 \u201cEvery single one of \u2019em,\u201d Kolsch said.</p> <p>Elie G Aoun, <a href=\"https://www.eliegaounmd.com/\">a psychiatrist</a> who serves as vice-chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s council on addiction psychiatry, was surprised to discover that one of his patients had filled a prescription for oxycodone even as he was prescribing a treatment for addiction to the drug.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that this is because of the coronavirus crisis, but the social distancing and the isolation that this person was experiencing is what he used as an excuse to justify why he did that,\u201d Aoun said.</p> <p>On the flip side, mental health professionals feared that people would be forced into abstinence because of supply chain disruptions, potentially suffering lethal withdrawals or overdosing when they use again.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, Americans dealing with addiction rely heavily on their community and routine for support when they decide to get sober. But now, there\u2019s no gym, no coffees with friends or sponsors, and few in-person gatherings.</p> <p>Workers, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/us-unemployment-coronavirus-hospitality-food-industries-claims\">are getting laid off in droves</a>, and some people are spending most of their day cooped up with their significant others, sometimes while fighting or experiencing abuse.</p> <p>Others are completely on their own. One of Aoun\u2019s patients, who is sitting at home not talking to anyone, is feeling more and more depressed, a major trigger for his alcohol use and gambling, Aoun said.</p> <p>Andrea St Clair, a mental health and substance use disorder professional at an outpatient program in Seattle, worried about people who may be missing even the most mundane interactions such as handshakes or hugs.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a time where people are subject to having more thoughts, more triggers, more urges,\u201d St Clair said.</p> <p>The excessive downtime right now \u201cis not helping,\u201d said Jimmy Hamm, who owns a <a href=\"https://www.thebridgenyc.net/\">sober living home in New York City</a>.

With social distancing and self-isolation, support groups, meetings and mental health professionals have mostly moved online.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to acknowledge how hard this moment is, but we also want to encourage people to take advantage of the <a href=\"https://twloha.com/self-care/support-groups/\">resources and solutions</a> that are still available,\u201d said Jamie Tworkowski, founder of <a href=\"https://twloha.com/\">To Write Love on Her Arms</a>, a not-for-profit that in part helps people struggling with addiction. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to think, \u2018Oh, I just can\u2019t get any help right now because I\u2019m alone in my house.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The jury\u2019s still out on whether telehealth and online recovery resources on such a massive scale can effectively replace in-person contact for addiction treatment. At least two patients have told Aoun that they don\u2019t want to use his new online platform, and even if people do seek care or support, some of them may have additional screens in view, pulling their attention from the group they\u2019ve joined virtually, St Clair said.</p> <p>Some of Hamm\u2019s clients are tuning out during the virtual meetings, he said. Others seem to enjoy them. Regardless, Hamm didn\u2019t know what people would be doing without that lifeline.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, to be honest, I have a mixed bag about it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only option we have.\u201d</p>",

Democrats must use the occasion to press home the fundamental wrongheadedness of the Republican worldview before they inevitably reverse course and pretend that nothing has changed.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with stimulus. I remember early 2009, when the economy was melting under the weight of home foreclosures and bankruptcies that led to what is now called the Great Recession, the second worst economic downturn in history after the Great Depression.</p> <p>Conservative economists opposed fiscal stimulus for various reasons. They said it would not work because the deficit took out of the economy whatever the stimulus put in, making it a wash, economically. They said that any government stimulus would delay the necessary economic readjustment and sow the seeds of the next recession. The deficit was already too large and stimulus would only make it worse; fiscal prudence would do more to revive the economy than make-work jobs and such, many argued.</p> <p>Implicitly, Republicans favored a do-nothing policy. I don\u2019t recall any meaningful alternative stimulus program. Indeed, I still recall some saying government spending should be slashed to reduce the burden of government, which would be the best stimulus. None seemed to be aware that this is exactly what Franklin Roosevelt did in 1937 and it quickly led to a <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession_of_1937_38\">sharp economic downturn</a>.</p> <p>Republicans also decried bailouts for private businesses, especially those carried out under <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/Pages/default.aspx\">Tarp</a>, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Subsequently, Republicans universally blamed Barack Obama for any problems with this program even though it was proposed, enacted and signed into law by George W Bush.</p> <p>A few conservative academic economists resisted the do-nothing approach, rightly fearing a replay of the Great Depression, which only got so bad because of Herbert Hoover\u2019s do-nothing policies in 1929-1933. But they also argued that fiscal stimulus was unnecessary and counterproductive. Rather, they said that the Federal Reserve could fix the problem easily with no need to expand government.</p> <p>Such economists, such as <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/infrastructure-spending-grow\">Anna J Schwartz</a> and Robert Lucas, harkened back to the work of Milton Friedman, who died in 2006. He had <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/books/frie65-1\">argued</a> that the Great Depression was due solely to the Fed\u2019s mistake in allowing the money supply to shrink by a third, which created deflation. This came about because when banks went under in those days depositors lost everything; their money, which was mostly in the form of checking accounts, literally disappeared.</p> <p>Friedman said that the Fed could have countered this deflation by buying vast amounts of Treasury securities and creating the money out of thin air to do so. Indeed, that is the Fed\u2019s standard operating procedure to this day, which is called an <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/a-closer-look-at-open-market-operations\">open-market operation</a>. It increases the money supply and leads to economic expansion \u2013 and inflation, eventually. Conversely, when the Fed sells securities from its portfolio the money supply shrinks and inflationary pressure diminishes.</p> <p>As it happened, the chairman of the Fed at that time was a Republican economist named Ben Bernanke, who had previously served as George W Bush\u2019s principal economic adviser. Bernanke was also extremely familiar with Friedman\u2019s work, having devoted his academic career to studying it. Bernanke implemented exactly the policies Friedman would have advocated and it successfully kept the banking system from imploding as it did during the Great Depression.</p> <p>Rather than praise Bernanke, however, conservative economists largely turned against him. So opposed were they to any stimulus whatsoever they even opposed what Friedman advocated. By 2010, they were predicting hyperinflation from Bernanke\u2019s policies and he was urged to <a href=\"https://economics21.org/html/open-letter-ben-bernanke-287.html\">reverse them as soon as possible</a>.</p> <p>Now, of course, all these conservative ideas have gone out the window. Republicans are pushing a $2tn stimulus, even though just a few weeks ago the $1tn Green New Deal to save the planet itself was deemed too expensive. A huge chunk of the stimulus is in the form of bailouts for big businesses. Opposition to such bailouts led to creation of the Tea Party in 2009. Where are they today? (Sound of crickets chirping.)</p> <p>The chairman of the Fed, Republican Jay Powell, appointed by Donald Trump, is pumping up the money supply with his foot all the way down on the accelerator. (Disclosure: Powell and I worked together at the treasury department.) Yet Trump and his staff continually berate him for not being even more aggressive. No letters from conservative economists warning of hyperinflation are anywhere in sight.</p> <p>The hypocrisy is so thick you can choke on it, but at least for now we need fiscal stimulus, easy money and maybe some bailouts too for the same reasons we needed them back in 2009, when virtually every Republican in Congress voted against Obama\u2019s $800bn stimulus, much more modest than Trump\u2019s.</p> <p>However, Republicans\u2019 propensity to lie and reverse course when it suits them means they will inevitably become born-again deficit hawks warning about the evil Fed and its hyperinflationary policies one minute after Joe Biden is elected. I have warned about this before in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/20/republican-tax-cuts-democrats\">the Guardian</a>. Just as Bill Clinton wasted most of his first year getting a budget deal passed, I expect that Republicans and their allies on Wall Street will do the same to Biden.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bruce Bartlett is an economist who has worked on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and at the treasury department. He was deeply involved in Republican economic policymaking from 1976 until 2005, when changing economic circumstances led him away from the policies he had previously supported.

  "<p>Video conferences from a basement, glitchy internet and bouts of restlessness. Joe Biden, like the rest of America, is working from home.</p> <p>The former vice-president\u2019s confinement began abruptly on 10 March, when he touched down in Cleveland for a primary-night campaign event only to learn that the state\u2019s governor had called for all major indoor events to be canceled as the nation slowly grasped the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>That night, one of the most consequential of the Democratic primary, he delivered a victory speech from a nearly empty room in Philadelphia, near where his campaign is headquartered. It was his last traditional event on a campaign trail that has now changed beyond recognition. </p> <p>Since then Biden, a retail politician who enjoys rope lines and now-forbidden handshakes, has become an unwilling pioneer in presidential campaigning in the age of the coronavirus as the pandemic has thrown the Democratic race \u2013 and all US politics \u2013 into confusion.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no playbook for what a former vice-president should be doing or saying in the middle of a global pandemic,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who helped catapult the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg from obscurity to contention in the Democratic primary. \u201cWe are in uncharted waters here.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign has converted fundraising events to virtual ones and his podium is a room in his basement in his Wilmington, Delaware, home. His public appearances are usually once-a-day televised critiques of whatever Donald Trump\u2019s administration is doing to combat the virus. His campaign has cautiously been exploring new ways to keep supporters active.</p> <p>But the Democratic frontrunner is still grappling with how to adapt to the new challenges. His first live-streamed town hall, on 13 March, was hampered by audio and technical difficulties. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,\u201d Biden said, his irritation evident.</p> <p>He then seemed to fade from the national stage, eclipsed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Trump\u2019s daily White House coronavirus briefings</a> and by governors including Andrew Cuomo, whose daily updates on the toll of the crisis in New York have become must-watch TV for many Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/democrats-woman-vice-president-joe-biden-running-mate\">\u2018Opening a door that was closed too long\u2019: the hunt for a female vice-president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden\u2019s absence inspired the Twitter hashtag #whereisJoe, which was promoted and shared by supporters of his Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, before being picked up by the Trump campaign.</p> <p>On a fundraising call last weekend, a Biden donor noted that Americans watch Trump every day at his briefings, events that his critics say increasingly resemble \u2013 in tone and length \u2013 the campaign rallies he has been forced to abandon.</p> <p>\u201cI would just love to see you more,\u201d the donor said of the Democrat. \u201cLike how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?\u201d</p> <p>Biden assured the donor that he was raring for a comeback: his team had installed high-speed internet and built a TV studio in his basement. Soon Biden was pushing out his message. In a matter of days the question would be: where isn\u2019t Biden?</p> <p>He began the week with an address from the newly outfitted recreation room, books, a lamp and memorabilia from his decades in public life behind him. The speech was followed by back-to-back TV appearances, roundtables, a virtual happy hour with young voters, the launch of a newsletter, a podcast in the works and a CNN town hall.</p> <p>The former vice-president has also enlisted an advisory board to counsel the campaign on the coronavirus that includes Ron Klain, who coordinated the Obama White House\u2019s Ebola response. An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1241416531684331526\">explainer video featuring </a>Klain and a white board has already racked up millions of views.</p> <p>\u201cThe new technologies are quite effective,\u201d Biden mused to reporters on Wednesday, noting that a recent address was not carried by the national TV networks but received 3.8m views online.</p> <p>Yet even with the ramped-up online schedule, it can still be difficult for Biden to break through as he is overshadowed by other figures actually fighting on the frontlines. On Monday, he delivered his speech an hour earlier than advertised; it would otherwise have conflicted with a Cuomo press briefing. His interview with The View on Wednesday was pre-empted by another Cuomo briefing and a press conference with the Washington DC mayor, Muriel Bowser.</p> <p>After serving more than 30 years in the Senate and eight years as vice-president, Biden acknowledged the difficulty of watching his former colleagues \u2013 and presidential rivals \u2013 confront the pandemic while he watched from the sidelines as a private citizen with nothing but a bully pulpit at his disposal.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m chomping at the bit. I wish I were still in the Senate, you know, being able to impact on some things,\u201d Biden told reporters on video conference press call hosted by Zoom. \u201cBut I am where I am.\u201d</p> <p>But critics still aren\u2019t convinced that Biden is doing enough to prove that he is ready to take on Trump in November.</p> <p>\u201cI think that he needs to lead,\u201d Larry Cohen, the chairman of the pro-Sanders Our Revolution organization, said. \u201cHe could collaborate with Bernie, who\u2019s doing plenty, and they could lead together on an issue that unites all Democrats.

His campaign allowed the nearly two dozen other candidates in the primary to have their moments in the sun before imploding. But now that low-key approach might work against him.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic hit, Democrats worried about being able to match the Trump re-election campaign\u2019s financial war chest. Biden, throughout the primary campaign, has been out-raised by his rivals. Campaigning from afar during a pandemic isn\u2019t going to make raising cash any easier \u2013 especially with a team not noted for its digital prowess.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/trump-facebook-ads-immigrants-coronavirus\">Trump's deluge of Facebook ads have a curious absence: coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFundraising has been a challenge for Joe Biden since he started running for president 500 years ago,\u201d quipped Connor Farrell, a veteran Democratic fundraiser. \u201cThis cycle in particular has been no exception.

In particular, his online fundraising hasn\u2019t been as good as other candidates and that\u2019s going to become much more important now that you can\u2019t do in-person fundraisers, where he shakes down executive and wealthy donors for checks in person.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell added that Biden \u201cis going to have to rely on telephone calls and digital fundraising. There\u2019s no other way around it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a great sign that their first fundraiser via Zoom was rescheduled due to technical difficulties,\u201d Farrell added. \u201cThis is a skill that the campaign needs to learn yesterday for the future of the country.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign has pivoted from taunting Biden over his absence on the national stage to mocking his re-emergence. An email blast from the Republican National Committee accused the former vice-president of attempting a \u201csorry interpretation of a president\u201d.</p> <p>Biden has been critical of Trump\u2019s response, but he has also insisted he doesn\u2019t want to engage Trump in a \u201cpolitical fight\u201d with so much at stake for the American people.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus is not his fault, but the lack of speed with which to respond to it has to move much faster,\u201d he said on The View. \u201cThis is not about Democrat or Republican.

Despite consecutive weeks of victories, and an all-but insurmountable delegate lead, Sanders has shown no signs of leaving the race any time soon.</p> <p>Instead, the Vermont senator has turned his campaign into a pandemic response operation, hosting expert roundtables and leveraging his vast network of donors to raise money for organizations helping to alleviate the economic impact of the crisis. And this week his campaign called for yet another Democratic primary debate.</p> <p>But, with a long time to go until November, and the whole world in flux, Biden and his time still have ample time to make a difference.</p> <p>Mo Eilethee, a former Democratic communications strategist and the executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said offering a radically different vision of leadership during moments of national crisis was a \u201cliving, breathing example of why Biden got into the race in the first place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe can use these opportunities to speak to Americans\u2019 fears, spell out a different approach or set the record straight,\u201d Eilethee said. \u201cNow the real question is: how much does he seek these opportunities?\u201d</p>",

There have been reports a peak is expected in hospitals on 10 April, but these reports were not true, <strong>Paul Kelly</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I want to also address the issue of intensive care beds and hospital beds. And this question that keeps coming to us from various places: is Australia ready? Is the healthcare system ready? </p> \n   <p>Well, I can really assure people that the healthcare system in Australia is very adaptable. And it is absolutely ready for this matter. In terms of intensive care, we have doubled the capacity ... and there are beds available right now with the ventilators right now to deal with people if they require it. [Intensive care] is a very small component of those now 3,400 cases in Australia, as I mentioned. Only 30 in total. And less than that currently. </p> \n   <p>We will not be seeing a peak on the 10 April, as has been reported in some places. That is not the case. The other matter I would refer to, just in terms of cruise ships, there is an emerging issue off the coast of Western Australia at the moment in relation to several cruise ships, two in particular.<br></p> \n   <p>One is a local ship, the Vasco Da Gama. The other is the Artania, which mainly has people from Germany. There are people with Covid-19 on that ship and we are working as a federal government with the WA government very closely, as well as with the German government, to repatriate anyone who is fit to fly back to Germany and other places in Europe tomorrow. So these matters are very much in hand and will be developing through the day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T04:26:29.546Z\">at 4.26am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7ecd178f081e5eda238673\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T04:08:37.093Z\">4.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The deputy medical chief medical officer, <strong>Prof Paul Kelly, said isolation of returned travellers combined with physical distancing, and tracing contacts of known Covid-19 cases, are the key measures being focused on. </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We really need to get on top of the people who have returned from overseas ... from countries that had a much wider and worse epidemic of Covid-19 than we currently do here in Australia.

  "<p>Government responses to climate breakdown and to the challenges of poverty and inequality must be changed permanently after the coronavirus has been dealt with, leading scientists have urged, as the actions taken to suppress the spread of the virus have revealed what measures are possible in an emergency.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis has revealed what governments are capable of doing and shone a new light on the motivation for past policies and their outcomes, said Sir Michael Marmot, professor of epidemiology and public health at University College London, and chair of the commission of the social determinants of health at the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe overriding objective [of governments for the last decade] has been austerity, and life expectancy for the worst-off has declined,\u201d he told journalists at a virtual meeting organised by Plan B and Extinction Rebellion. \u201cHealth tells us something fundamental about the nature of our society. What the government was pursuing was a worse society \u2013 that may not have been the objective, but it was what came out.\u201d</p> <p>But what had happened in response to coronavirus revealed a new way of operating for governments. \u201cWith Covid-19, everything [on austerity] went out of the window. It turns out austerity was a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government can spend anything [in the context of the coronavirus crisis], and they have socialised the economy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-mapped-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus mapped: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The urgency with which the government had acted showed that the response to an emergency could be swift and decisive, he said. But the climate crisis has been viewed as a \u201cslow-burn\u201d issue and had not elicited such a response. \u201cCoronavirus exposes that we can do things differently,\u201d Marmot said. \u201cWe must not go back to the status quo ante.\u201d</p> <p>Marmot, who led the <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/health-equity-in-england-the-marmot-review-10-years-on?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-vK_kf666AIVWoXVCh3AOQYGEAAYASAAEgK69_D_BwE\">Marmot review of life expectancy</a>, which earlier this year was found to have<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century\"> stalled for the first time in a century</a> after the austerity policies of the last decade, urged ministers in the UK and other countries to put health equity \u201cat the heart of all policymaking\u201d, as it would lead to better outcomes across a range of issues. \u201cIt would lead to better environmental policy, it would lead to better social policy, it would lead to better healthcare policy and better politics.\u201d</p> <p>Sir David King, who was chief scientific adviser from 2000 to 2008, a period that included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/27/footandmouth5\">foot-and-mouth epidemic</a> that devastated farming in 2001, said governments were quick to forget about dangers in their quest to save money and must learn lessons from coronavirus.</p> <p>He pointed to his own work on flood defences while chief scientific adviser.

The result was that over the following decade flooding got worse, as scientists had predicted, but many more people suffered and had their homes and livelihoods put at risk because resources were withdrawn.</p> <p>King also said the government had been warned in 2016 of the dangers of a viral pandemic and should have been better prepared. \u201cIn 2016, a report indicated that our hospitals would not be ready for an epidemic of this kind. But that report has not been made public.\u201d</p> <p>The climate emergency represented a real risk but was being treated too lightly, he warned. \u201cI think the climate emergency is much more serious than people think.\u201d</p> <p>King served as special representative for climate change to the government after leaving his post as chief scientific adviser, and was one of the experts who pushed for the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\"> Paris agreement in 2015</a>. He warned that the Paris agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C or 2C was probably too weak, however, to save the world from the impacts of climate breakdown. \u201cWe need to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere,\u201d he warned.</p> <p>He pointed to the economic recovery plans after the second world war, and said that after the coronavirus crisis has passed, governments should consider similar plans to redevelop the global economy to adjust to a fossil fuel-free world.</p> <p>Some people have pointed out that the response to the current crisis has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-big-drop-air-pollution\">reduced emissions and air pollution</a> in the short term. But Jason Hickel, lecturer in economic anthropology at Goldsmiths University, warned of taking too many lessons from that.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you scale down energy use and industrial production, it does have these ecological benefits but the crucial thing to observe is that this is happening in an unplanned, chaotic way which is hurting people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would never advocate such a thing. What we need is a planned approach to reducing unnecessary industrial activity that has no connection to human welfare and that disproportionately benefits already wealthy people as opposed to ordinary people. There are much more equitable, just and carefully planned ways to approach this kind of problem.\u201d</p> <p>A group of leading economists and global health experts including four Nobel prize-winners has urged the leaders of the G20 countries to devote trillions to helping poor countries out of the coronavirus crisis, or face a continuing crisis of migration, recurring global Covid-19 outbreaks, and social breakdown in the developing world.</p> <p>The experts said: \u201cDeveloping countries are facing an unprecedented collective threat to human life, social cohesion and economic devastation. Massive economic losses will be incurred as countries desperately try to cope; people will migrate out of fear as the epidemic takes hold, leading to social disruption, violence and security issues.\u201d</p> <p>Erik Berglof, director of the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics and an organiser of the letter, told the Guardian: \u201cIf it will take more than $2tn (\u00a31.6bn), perhaps as much as $6tn, to fix the US, we are not going to fix the rest of the world for less. To attach a specific number now is almost meaningless. What we need are new and creative ways of using global financial muscle to back up existing international financial institutions.\u201d</p> <p>He said that some measures, such as providing emergency resources and medical help, could be taken quickly, but it was important to manage the process with a long-term view as well, using and expanding existing international institutions and programmes. \u201cYou cannot sprinkle money from helicopters in these economies because it would never reach the intended receivers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need carefully managed programmes and projects that can help these countries through this extremely difficult period.\u201d</p> <p>Infrastructure investment would take longer, but would be vital to ensure that countries can recover from an economic shock that economists say will be greater than that following the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>In providing this help, the developed world would also be benefiting its own citizens, as if efforts to control Covid-19 in poor countries fail, \u201cthe virus could become endemic, producing new waves of destructive outbreaks around the world\u201d, the letter warned.</p>",

But if the title bears any validity, his military tactics have been highly unconventional. He has exacerbated the problems encountered by federal agencies by playing musical chairs at the top of the coronavirus force. </p> \n<p>The president began by creating on 29 January a special coronavirus taskforce, then gave Vice-President Mike Pence the job, who promptly <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/vice-president-pence-announces-ambassador-debbie-birx-serve-white-house-coronavirus-response-coordinator/\">appointed Deborah Birx</a> \u201ccoronavirus response coordinator\u201d, before the federal emergency agency Fema began taking charge of key areas, with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-coronavirus-team-sparks-confusion-plaudits-inside-white-house-response-efforts/2020/03/18/02038a16-6874-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html\">Jared Kushner</a>, the president\u2019s son-in-law, creating a shadow team that increasingly appears to be calling the shots.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point of responsibility,\u201d the former senior official told the Guardian. \u201cIt keeps shifting.

The president, with more than half an eye on the New York stock exchange, has consistently talked down the scale of the crisis.</p> \n<p>On 30 January, as the World Health Organization was declaring a global emergency, Trump said: \u201cWe only have five people.

The next day, Nancy Messonnier, the CDC\u2019s top official on respiratory diseases, took the radically different approach of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/cdc-expects-community-spread-of-coronavirus-as-top-official-warns-disruptions-could-be-severe/\">telling the truth</a>, warning the American people that \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">reportedly</a> so angered by the comment and its impact on share prices that he shouted down the phone at Messonnier\u2019s boss, the secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar.</p> \n<p>\u201cMessonnier was 100% right. She gave a totally honest and accurate assessment,\u201d Konyndyk told the Guardian.

Where\u2019s the discussion on high-risk populations, on surveillance so we can detect where the virus is. I knew then that the president had set the priority, the bureaucracy was following it, but it was the wrong priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>So it has transpired.

When governors begged Trump to unleash the full might of the US government on this critical problem, he gave his answer on 16 March.</p> \n<p>In a phrase that will stand beside 20 January 2020 as one of the most revelatory moments of the history of coronavirus, he said: \u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>To date, the Trump administration has supplied 400 ventilators to New York. By Cuomo\u2019s estimation, 30,000 are needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?\u201d Cuomo scathingly <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/03/24/cuomo-mocks-fema-shipment-you-want-a-pat-on-the-back-for-sending-400-ventilators/#35884a3ca7b8\">asked on Tuesday</a>. He added: \u201cYou pick the 26,000 who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018A total vacuum of federal leadership\u2019</h2> \n<p>In the absence of a strong federal response, a patchwork of efforts has sprouted all across the country. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/us-governors-coronavirus-trump\">State governors</a> are doing their own thing. Cities, even individual hospitals, are coping as best they can.</p> \n<p>In an improvised attempt to address such inconsistencies, charitable startups have proliferated on social media.

My two crewmates and I will spend six months on the ISS, coming home around October.</p> <p>We are all trying to navigate the uncertainty. The quarantine has been largely the same as usual: as a crew, we still keep our distance, and I am relatively isolated in my living quarters. The difference now is that other people are doing the same.</p> <p>To my knowledge, there has never been any sickness on the space station. It would be unprecedented to have a virus like this on board. We have lots of medicine, but there is no vaccine. It would be something significant to deal with.</p> <p>The biggest change for me is that my friends and family won\u2019t be at the launch. Nor the US support team and operational group. It will be kind of quiet.</p> <p>The other difference will be when I call my wife and family from the space station. We\u2019ll be talking a lot about how things have changed since I left: can you move around, are your plans cancelled?

This way of working is a huge change from being face-to-face or on the couch in a consulting room \u2013 a lot of visual and bodily communication is lost. Normally, as soon as I open the door, I get a sense of how the patient is feeling that day. Over the phone it\u2019s more difficult, but I can hear something in the tone of voice. Not all the indicators are lost. Silences carry a different weight and patients are saying more than they might if we were actually in the room \u2013 I suspect I am, too.</p> <p>New themes are emerging around the possibility of loss, particularly not being able to see family for some time, and there\u2019s a huge sense of anxiety, which most of the population is probably feeling. People are having to think very carefully about their own autonomy: who am I? What do I do here? Who will be there for me? Who can I be there for? Of course, the conflicts patients brought to therapy beforehand will remain or intensify with isolation or illness. There will also be some creativity and resourcefulness emerging.</p> <p>I am more acutely aware of the discrepancy between those who can and can\u2019t afford therapy. For those whose financial circumstances are hugely impacted, I have substantially reduced my fees \u2013 I don\u2019t want anybody to stop having therapy because they can\u2019t afford it. What I\u2019d suggest to people who can\u2019t, particularly those feeling very anxious, is to set up phone calls with one or two trusted people to share feelings and listen. <strong>S</strong><strong>de</strong><strong>R</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Igor Bastidas</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dabe49f87b647c488f1e47490f9109424e939f53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dabe49f87b647c488f1e47490f9109424e939f53/0_82_548_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrator Igor Bastidas\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A Venezuelan artist living in New York, whose illustration appears at the top of this piece, Bastidas says: \u2018In the midst of this collapse, New Yorkers and the rest of the world are looking out for each other.

I have around 20 guys on the street, with approximately 200 regular customers. We have two main concerns now: sourcing drugs and getting enough money. We expect no more cocaine shipments from abroad for the next six weeks, so prices have shot up. I\u2019m maintaining the same prices I\u2019ve always charged but I\u2019m concerned that, when stock begins to run low, people higher up the chain will charge more or cut the cocaine and decrease its quality. People are panicking \u2013 the amounts of cannabis they\u2019re buying is ridiculous \u2013 so we are just dealing to regulars now. I\u2019ve told my workers to be strict with what they sell and who to, but they aren\u2019t changing their behaviour much, other than offering to post through letterboxes and accept bank transfers from trusted customers. People running out of money is a big concern, but we\u2019ll always have the regular cokeheads who buy most days. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been doing this for 12 years and don\u2019t have any dependants \u2013 other than sometimes helping my parents out with bits of cash \u2013 so I\u2019m not financially worried. My biggest concern is handling money. I\u2019ve been wearing gloves. <strong>D</strong><strong>H</strong></p> <h2><strong>The City trader</strong></h2> <p><strong>You can\u2019t trade millions while your child is screaming for hot milk</strong></p> <p>A trader\u2019s life is stressful enough: your work is high frequency, intense and filled with risk. No one wants to screw up and lose a bunch of money for their firm. </p> <p>We\u2019ve been tracking coronavirus for months, but no one thought it would get as bad as in China. So when we heard we\u2019d either have to relocate to a disaster recovery site, away from our offices, or set up a trading desk at home, we were shocked.</p> <p>The idea of a disaster recovery site came about after 9/11. The idea was that major investment banks needed to have a building away from their offices so they could keep functioning in an emergency. Goldman Sachs has offices in Croydon; Barclays is in Northolt; JP Morgan in Basingstoke. But they were created as a solution to a terrorist attack, not to a pandemic. In a London lockdown, some traders will struggle to make it to these sites.</p> <p>Working from home brings a lot of problems. Traders tend not to have four screens on their kitchen table, nor recorded lines to make sure we don\u2019t break compliance procedures. Plus I have kids. You can\u2019t expect to trade millions with a child next door screaming for hot milk. Much of trading involves making fast decisions. We\u2019re struggling through what will probably be the toughest time in our career, and we\u2019re worried about patchy wifi and that our kids will be slowing down the connection by watching a streaming service.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s trying to keep their spirits up, with funny photos of people\u2019s home setup \u2013 I saw a Persian cat sitting in front of someone\u2019s screens, looking like a trader. But this disruption will affect our ability to get the economy back on its feet, at what may be a defining moment in our lives. </p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Yang Sio Maan</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6863fb9768d6af1e3be688d7362654553f2a6057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6863fb9768d6af1e3be688d7362654553f2a6057/0_599_2917_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of people wearing face masks exercising in a park, with tower blocks behind and cars on the road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"972\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e5a0cb6ae260cfbd7755d3f7e045a28d8a0ea43d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5a0cb6ae260cfbd7755d3f7e045a28d8a0ea43d/41_42_452_496/452.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of illustrator Yang Sio Maan\" width=\"452\" height=\"496\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yang, who is based in Macau, southern China, says, \u2018This is the most densely populated region in the world. Since the outbreak in late January, most people have been working from home. But while the streets and malls are a ghost town, Coloane island has never been so crowded. This is the lung of the city, covered in hiking trails, and at the weekend, the traffic gets backed up. People exercise wearing surgical masks: jogging, hiking, yoga, or simply absorbing some vitamin D after another week in quarantine.\u2019</p> <h2><strong>On not touching Dad, by Tom Lamont</strong></h2> <p><strong>Hugging was really great</strong></p> <p>A couple of weekends ago, for the first time since the 90s, when I was a shoegaze-addled teen who thought misanthropy was quite sophisticated, I waved hello to my dad. He is 75 now. Never one to take more than his share of anything in the past, he\u2019s recently started stockpiling underlying health conditions, and this puts him among the 30 million vulnerable and/or elderly people in the UK who\u2019ll be getting some coronavirus clearing room for the foreseeable future, whether any of us like it or not. I warned him on the way in: \u201cI\u2019m only going to wave, Pa! From the other side of the room!\u201d Overdoing it, making light of it, first with the chorus dancer\u2019s jazz hands, then with the big, all-arm, side-to-side motion, as if I was a gameshow contestant encouraged to say hi to a parent watching at home.</p> <p>It felt about as silly and contrived as a gameshow, greeting him this way. Not hugging your dad? We chuckled it off at the time. We settled, on different sofas, into our usual routine of company and snacks. I felt weirdly agitated, as if I\u2019d left something unfinished \u2013 like when you keep one hand out of bath water, to hold a magazine or a phone, and the rest of your body seems to nag at you: \u201cSubmerge the other hand, Tom. Submerge the bloody hand!\u201d</p> <p>I come from a family that, for the most part, could be defined as Way-Tactile Jew. We kiss each other. We hug. We really get in there. I am not by nature overfamiliar, but this tactility when saying hello is hardwired in me. It has led to more than my share of greetings errors with men who vaguely resemble my father or grandfather, yet who don\u2019t, weirdly, relish the full bear hug on a first encounter.</p> <p>Maybe for this reason I\u2019ve always been interested in how, physically, we say hello. A couple of years ago, I wrote a story for this magazine on the subject, interviewing dozens of people about their own habits. There was a lot of contradiction, between generations and genders and cultures. Hand slaps. Fist bumps. \u201cA curt nod and a please-move-on-now look.\u201d The one- or two-arm hug. Chaos, someone called it. An 80-year-old told me she was tired of it all. Why couldn\u2019t we just choose a few blanket rules and stick to them?</p> <p>Coronavirus has given us those rules. Strangers get a wide berth \u2013 the government-mandated two metres \u2013 so that now we slalom the pavements to get to the supermarket, avoiding accidental incursions by anyone travelling the other way. </p> <p>Among friends and relatives, the transition has been the hardest. For a while (until about 10 days ago, at the time of writing), the hugging and kissing carried on with a kind of fuck-you heedlessness. No global pandemic was about to stop us grabbing a bezzie around the shoulder, or giving Mum a peck on either cheek. Then, with a creeping sense of the seriousness of things (seven days ago? six?), there was a period of honest forgetfulness. People would smash a wet one on you and then touch their foreheads, remembering. Horribly quickly it became unthinkable. Kissing would be like punching somebody in the mouth. No more arm-squeezes, no wrist-grabs. So there I was, in my parents\u2019 living room, with my back against the wall, waving. \u201cHOW ARE YOU OVER THERE?\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the visit, I had realised how much we used to communicate around the edges of our talk. You can tease \u2013 but without the fond finger-jab on the shoulder, teasing registers as mean. You can suggest a hot drink \u2013 but without the palm on the thigh, to mean, \u201cI know you like one around now\u201d, this may as well be the offer of a well-intentioned stranger. There was that sense of something half-done, and when it was time to say goodbye, this feeling clarified into a more fundamental one of abandonment. My dad knew why I was waving at him as if he were a distant parade float. I knew why. This didn\u2019t change the fact that a wave was inadequate.</p> <p>I worry that when this is over, we\u2019ll all have been reprogrammed not to touch, to fear proximity. I worry that the self-conscious elbow bump will become the standard, and that entering a stranger\u2019s two-metre exclusion zone will for ever be considered uncool. I worry that we\u2019ll never rid ourselves of the sense, bedding deeper as I write, that to do the most natural thing in the world and embrace someone elderly and ailing and who we love might only be to hurry them on their way. </p> <h2><strong>The Guardian magazine model</strong></h2> <p><strong>Winston will miss being in the Guardian\u2019s All Ages fashion shoots</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"46422517478f189ebfc4c812ab2edeb9bb58ee68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46422517478f189ebfc4c812ab2edeb9bb58ee68/615_188_1224_3016/406.jpg\" alt=\"All Ages model Winston\" width=\"406\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All Ages is like a family. \u2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started modelling when I was 73. I\u2019m 83 now, though people tell me I look 56. I was introduced to modelling by chance, by my neighbour Lydia, and I\u2019ve been lucky. Coxy, my agent, says: \u2018\u2018There is something in your face that people like.\u201d I\u2019ve been a regular in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/series/fashion-for-all-ages+mens-fashion\">All Ages</a> for four years, and I\u2019ve worked all over the world.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had five shoots cancelled so far. All Ages is suspended after this week because we need to self-isolate; work trips to Romania, Sweden and Nigeria have been called off. I was supposed to play a dead body in a film shoot in Germany; that\u2019s off. I\u2019m lucky that, as a retired engineer, modelling isn\u2019t my only source of income. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but I don\u2019t have too many worries. The one thing I will miss is the company of the Guardian team: All Ages is like a family. </p> <p>A friend told me I am supposed to stay indoors now, but I do go out, just to shop. I live alone and my daughter comes at weekends to check that Daddy is OK. I\u2019m very cautious. I wash my hands and use Dettol. If I saw a person coughing on the bus, I would stay far away.</p> <p>Touch wood, I\u2019ve always been lucky health-wise. I eat a strict diet; I like green tea, cabbage, chicken, wild salmon. I\u2019ve been weightlifting since I was 15. In 1997 we extended our garage and put barbells in there, so I can exercise at home.</p> <p>I saw people fighting over toilet paper on the news. To me that is selfishness, though I\u2019m lucky again there: in the 80s, I bought a dozen packets of toilet paper in a cash and carry, and I\u2019m still getting through them now. <strong>H</strong><strong>M</strong></p> <h2><strong>The life-drawing model</strong></h2> <p><strong>Getting naked in a stranger\u2019s living room can be cosy</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m an actor, but like most I am often between roles. I started life modelling as a way to earn extra money and it\u2019s been a good source of income. When coronavirus started limiting public gatherings, I was concerned I wouldn\u2019t be able to model any more, just as theatres were closing and acting work was drying up. But one of the drawing clubs I model for, <a href=\"http://atyn.co.uk/\" title=\"\">All The Young Nudes</a>, has begun running a livestreamed class and they asked me to model for the first one.</p> <p>We did it at an organiser\u2019s home. Sometimes these sessions are cold and uncomfortable \u2013 you have to sit on a plastic chair \u2013 so it was nice being in a warm room with a fire and a couch. There was a camera operator there to set up the technical side. Around 100 artists then paid \u00a34 (a normal session is \u00a36) to get a link to the private stream, for two hours.</p> <p>It might seem strange to watch a livestream when you could just draw from a picture, but all the artists I\u2019ve spoken to say that, psychologically, it\u2019s a very different practice: you\u2019re responding to something in the moment (often poses are held for only five minutes) and you\u2019re time-limited. It makes people draw differently, and it still felt like a drawing club because there was an online chat with some discussion of the works, which people posted on social media afterwards.</p> <p>For me, the only thing the technology changed was that there was a lag on the camera. So sometimes when I changed pose I\u2019d glance at the monitor and see how I\u2019d looked. It made me remember: life drawing poses are not meant to be flattering. And at moments it felt strange, in the way that being alone and naked in someone else\u2019s living room would.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware livestreaming is more open to abuse than live sessions: someone could be screenshotting me, or they might be at home wanking. It\u2019s important I am not recognised as a model in other areas of my life, and there\u2019s a greater risk of that happening online. I\u2019m placing a lot of trust in the artists. <strong>Sam Wolfson</strong></p> <h2><strong>The IndyCar racer</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.indycar.com/Series/IndyCar-Series/Felix-Rosenqvist\" title=\"\">Felix Rosenqvist</a> finds a virtual car race is sweatier than a real one</strong></p> <p>I was in Florida for the start of the IndyCar Series when they cancelled the whole thing. Two days later, back home in Indianapolis, I put on shorts and socks \u2013 no shoes \u2013 and got into my racing simulator in my little man cave. Most pros now practise in simulators before each race weekend. It\u2019s a whole business: companies scan tracks and sell them to teams who integrate them into their simulators. I got mine so I could mess around in winter; it\u2019s got a racing seat and pedals, and a 49in screen.</p> <p>A lot of pros are on<a href=\"https://www.iracing.com/\" title=\"\"> iRacing</a>, an online simulation game where you get matched against people with the same rating. I use it a bit, and sometimes I\u2019ll get tagged in an Instagram post: \u201cOh, Felix Rosenqvist just drove into me!\u201d It\u2019s a pretty cool way for fans to engage with racers, though the best gamers always beat us. It kind of lowers your self-confidence, but it\u2019s different because they don\u2019t need to be brave.</p> <p>After the Formula One season also got suspended because of the pandemic, a company called <a href=\"https://torqueesport.com/\" title=\"\">Torque Esports</a> organised an all-star e-racing battle. They invited pro gamers as well as pro racing drivers from IndyCar and F1 to compete, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/max-verstappen\" title=\"\">Max Verstappen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/piquetjr/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Nelson Piquet Jr</a>.</p> <p>About 70,000 viewers watched the battle stream live. I got to the final and started 12th but finished 7th and was the best driver. It\u2019s weird: I sweated more in that race than I do on the track, because I was concentrating and squeezing the wheel so hard. I was done for the day. Real driving will always be my priority, but this is something new, and these strange times will put it on the radar. <strong>S</strong><strong>U</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Rebecca Hendin</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11cc5fce201e0282307fd77a0b2b26fd1aafb555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cc5fce201e0282307fd77a0b2b26fd1aafb555/0_0_2627_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of woman in blue-tinted room sitting looking out of window with pink flowers and leaves outside it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e51816c3829e5ae9612a3cdc4f4ad6a252afc813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e51816c3829e5ae9612a3cdc4f4ad6a252afc813/0_0_548_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"Headshot of illustrator Rebecca Hendin\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The London-based American illustrator and animator, who won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/guardians-rebecca-hendin-wins-award-for-boris-johnson-cartoon\">2019\u2019s political cartoon of the year</a> award, says, \u2018I wanted to focus on the dichotomy of the horrific news, and the world outside.

But it\u2019s also up to me to decide what we do when something serious happens outside the Big Brother house. The 14 contestants for the current series went into the house on 10 February, when there were only 14 confirmed infections in Germany.</p> <p>As a general rule, the contestants are not meant to know what is going on in the outside world. But when the number of Covid-19 cases in Europe began to increase dramatically, we knew we needed to tell them. Cancelling the show wasn\u2019t an option, but if one of the people had told us they wanted to be with their family, we would have let them. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just television.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t want there to be a great drama; just to give the contestants a sober account of what was happening outside. That\u2019s why we sat the Big Brother doctor, who assessed the contestants, next to the host, behind a glass wall. The German Big Brother container is located near Cologne, in North Rhine-Westphalia, the German state that has seen the highest number of infections and deaths.</p> <p>There were a lot of shocked faces, and some tears. But 23 hours later, life in the Big Brother house had pretty much resumed as normal.</p> <p>After the contestants were given an update, there were individual messages from parents, siblings and friends. Luckily, they are all fine. The sister of one of the contestants is in quarantine, but only as a precautionary measure. A lot of relatives begged the contestants to stay in the house. It\u2019s the safest place in Germany right now: you are effectively already under quarantine.</p> <p>It\u2019s also the only place in Germany that doesn\u2019t need to apply any social distancing measures, or handwashing routines, because we know all the contestants are healthy. The celebrities who were introduced to the house later on were all tested beforehand. If Angela Merkel had wanted to give her corona address to the nation from inside the Big Brother house, we would have let her in.</p> <p>What would we do if the next contestant to be voted out asked to stay? If they\u2019re voted out, they have to leave the house. Those are the rules. <strong>P</strong><strong>O</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Jesuit sister</strong></h2> <p><strong>A simpler life might lead more people to </strong><strong>God, hopes Jane Livesey</strong></p> <p>Normally I live a peripatetic life. A significant part of my work, as general superior of the <a href=\"https://www.congregationofjesus.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Congregation of Jesus</a>, is visiting communities all over the world \u2013 we have about 1,500 sisters in 20 countries \u2013 to support and encourage them. But now we\u2019re all in lockdown \u2013 I\u2019ve been out once in 12 days \u2013 and I can see cabin fever is not unlikely. We\u2019re a small community in Rome, aged mainly from our mid-50s to mid-70s, and like everyone else we don\u2019t go out. People are only allowed to the supermarket and pharmacy. Fortunately, we have space and gardens, unlike most Romans. We\u2019re trying to keep in touch with our communities in the wider world. At least we\u2019re blessed to be enduring this crisis in a time of technology and social media. We\u2019re completely wired up here.</p> <p>Normally we have Mass daily; not now, but we\u2019re praying more. Faith is important to people in times such as this. For all of us, the crisis is triggering questions about what is important. Having a pope like Francis is wonderful; he sent out a beautiful message: \u201cTonight before falling asleep, think about when we will return to the street, hug again\u2026 We will go back to laughing together. Strength and courage. See you soon!\u201d</p> <p>It will be interesting to see what happens in the longer term \u2013 whether some people turn to faith. Faith is about finding meaning, and everyone is now trying to do that. People are living a stripped-back life and that means they\u2019ve been given time for reflection. This crisis has shown us that vulnerability has something to teach us; suddenly, we\u2019re all vulnerable.</p> <p>The temptation is to retreat, to look inwards. But once this is over, do we stay behind borders or will we have learned things? We might have opened our hearts in ways we hadn\u2019t thought about before. <strong>HS</strong></p> <h2><strong>The round-the-world sailor</strong></h2> <p><strong>You\u2019re safe in the middle of the ocean, says Afshin Ahmadian</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t have any sailing background; I was working in finance in London when I saw an ad on the underground for the <a href=\"https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/\" title=\"\">Clipper Round The World Race</a>. It started in September from St Katharine Docks in east London, with a crew of all nationalities: Chinese, French, Iranian, British, Australian, Swedish and Italian. We went to Portugal, Uruguay, South Africa, across the Southern Ocean to Australia; then we were supposed to go to Sanya in south-west China.</p> <p>When we set off, there was no sign of coronavirus; we were just happy to be going to sea. Everything was new and interesting \u2013 the watch system, the storms, the sunrises and sunsets.</p> <p>Then the skipper got an email saying the destination would be changing because of an outbreak. That was in February; we thought it was just an isolated incident. On the boat you are quite shut off, just focusing on the race and how to keep yourself fit, fed and hydrated.</p> <p>When we arrived in the Philippines, I realised the situation in Iran had become severe \u2013 for a time, it had the highest number of cases after China, before the Italian situation worsened. My family is in Iran and my girlfriend is Italian; they are OK, but all the countries close to my heart were badly affected.</p> <p>We were in no danger on the boat: we were in the middle of the ocean and hadn\u2019t been in any contaminated regions. But when we came back to the Philippines, around 14 March, the whole event was postponed. We had five more months to go.</p> <p>I have a flight booked to Italy, and will move into my girlfriend\u2019s place. We are all hoping that in 10 months\u2019 time we can continue the race. <strong>Sam Wollaston</strong></p> <h2><strong>The prison inmate</strong></h2> <p><strong>A hotel-size bar of soap, says Joe Vanderford, doesn\u2019t last a week in jail</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve been in US prisons across three states for 33 years. Never in my life did I think I would envy an Iranian prisoner [85,000 were temporarily released this month]. I\u2019m in the Shakopee women\u2019s correctional facility in Minnesota. There have been no commutations or early releases in this state so far. Cases of Covid-19 on the outside are rising: 89 at the time of writing. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in our facility yet.</p> <p>There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to how this virus is being managed inside these walls. One officer travelled to Europe and returned to work. Another went to a nearby state, and hasn\u2019t been allowed back in. One guard says this is all an overreaction, a conspiracy against Trump, and refuses to clean anything. Another is constantly wiping her shoes with hospital-grade disinfectant. When I went for my arthritis checkup, they\u2019d taken most of the chairs out of the waiting room, an attempt to force social distancing. But the trash was overflowing, a rubber glove lying on the filthy floor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, people are being transferred in from county jails every day, and service providers are coming in from other states. Yesterday, an eye doctor who services a bunch of prisons in the area treated several women here. In the middle of appointments, he was stopped: the Wisconsin system, where he had just seen patients, has people quarantined. He said he had no symptoms, but the women who were treated are furious.</p> <p>If someone here gets diagnosed with Covid-19, I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll go. We have an isolation room intended for a single person. They\u2019ve already taken two people up there, with more to follow. One of them had already been quarantined for days in her cell with two roommates who remain in the general population. They\u2019re serving the sick people food on paper plates. In another unit, someone has fallen ill; she was using the open restrooms, which means people go to the bathroom while you brush your teeth. They\u2019re testing them all for the virus. No results yet.</p> <p>I\u2019m on a biohazard task crew. We have special gear, but we\u2019re short on supplies. They\u2019re rationing toilet paper and giving us each a hotel-sized bar of soap, which won\u2019t last a week with handwashing alone. There\u2019s no hand sanitiser, except in the kitchen. I see on the news the public is hoarding, panicked. As incarcerated people, we\u2019re the bottom of the barrel. Times will just get tougher for us.</p> <p>Most of my friends are older: women in wheelchairs, women with respiratory conditions, women who spray the door handles without being asked. We\u2019re a village, trying to protect each other. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if, we will be exposed. I\u2019m 52. I wasn\u2019t sentenced to death. But it\u2019s a crapshoot from here on out. <strong>Jvd</strong><strong>L</strong></p> <h2><strong>The musician</strong></h2> <p><strong>We\u2019ll be desperate to dance when this is over, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-turner\" title=\"\">Frank Turner</a></strong></p> <p>My last three shows \u2013 in Bath, Aylesbury, Southend \u2013 were three of the weirdest days of my life. My tour started on 3 March and the first week was fine. You don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real at first, then the bad news starts piling up and what you can\u2019t contemplate becomes reality at remarkable speed. Every day was a rollercoaster. I\u2019d wake up thinking we should cancel everything, then I\u2019d do a show and think, actually, this is what people want. There was a redemptive feeling in the room.</p> <p>Usually, my line of work survives catastrophic events because people want to gather and lose themselves in art, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re supposed to be doing right now. Looking out at a room full of people who were standing close to each other was troubling on a moral level. You ask yourself: am I part of the problem? I mentioned coronavirus halfway through the show in Bath and people got nervous. I realised I wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring them about their decision to come.</p> <p>Over that weekend, the national mood shifted. I started copping a lot of flak on social media from people who were very angry the shows were going ahead. By the time we got to Southend, we still had 800 people but the mood was really odd. It felt like last orders. Before I went on, I was 95% sure this was the last one; when I came off stage, I told my tour manager, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re done now.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of doing a live stream seemed obvious. I set up a fundraiser for my touring crew, because if they don\u2019t work they don\u2019t get paid. As we speak it\u2019s raised \u00a343,000, which is incredible, but it\u2019s a one-off for a specific cause. I\u2019m not sure I could make my living this way. I think when shows become viable again, there may well be a golden period because people will be extremely relieved to be out of the house. The problem is nobody knows how far off that is. My worry is how much of the live infrastructure is still going to be there. All my friends who run independent venues are staring into the abyss right now.

The next week we limited everything. But even then, loo roll, kitchen roll, wipes, baby milk and nappies are going in a flash. As soon as we bring a pallet out, it\u2019s gone before we can get it on the shelves. There\u2019s one lonely tin of oxtail soup where there used to be a whole section of tinned tomatoes and kidney beans. Our supply chain is good but they can\u2019t get it to us fast enough.</p> <p>Of course, if you see an empty shelf, you panic. It\u2019s human nature. This morning there were 150 people snaking around the car park half an hour before we opened. We\u2019re selling more than Christmas Eve every day, seven days a week.</p> <p>You\u2019re seeing everyday dramas unfold. One minute, there\u2019s someone with the last four packs of pasta and they\u2019re giving two to an older person; the next you\u2019re seeing an 18-year-old mum in floods of tears because there\u2019s no baby milk and she\u2019s got newborn twins. I would say that 90% of people are fine, but I\u2019ve had girls I work with called the worst names you can imagine just for saying, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, you can\u2019t have that whole trolley-full of loo roll.\u201d There\u2019s been an unspoken divide in this country between people who are mindful of how their actions might affect people who are less comfortable than them, and the small minority who don\u2019t care about anybody else. We\u2019ve got zero tolerance for them.</p> <p>Morale is really good. The company\u2019s been brilliant. What was a mundane job has turned into a really important social responsibility. We feel like the fifth emergency service. You know those magnetic sirens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/26/kojak-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Kojak</a> used to put on his car? I want one of those for when I\u2019m driving to work. We\u2019re all exhausted, but I\u2019ll do what I can until I drop. <strong>D</strong><strong>L</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Antarctic researcher</strong></h2> <p><strong>At the bottom of the world, says <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/mrian\" title=\"\">Mike Brian</a>, there\u2019s always telemedicine</strong></p> <p>There are 124 people on the Rothera Research Station today and I am responsible for their health, safety and welfare. My first action was to make sure we were not bringing in any unessential staff. We also started screening staff before they depart for Antarctica. We are a small community and live in relatively close proximity. But there\u2019s always a doctor here, even in winter when we go down to 20 people; right now we have two.</p> <p>When something like this happens, we feel a long way away but well connected. We have good internet access and great support from our headquarters in Cambridge, England. We also have our own dedicated medical unit, experts in telemedicine who can give a whole station advice.</p> <p>My folks are in Fort William, Scotland, and my father said very cheerfully that it gives him a perfect excuse to spend lots of time in the garden by himself. That and turning down social engagements makes him very happy. <strong>Sam Wollaston</strong></p> <h2><strong>The drum\u2019n\u2019bass DJ</strong></h2> <p><strong>Club culture will return with the mother of all parties, says <a href=\"https://andyc.cc/about\">Andy C</a></strong></p> <p>The last shows I played were in Moscow and Prague at the end of February. We landed in Moscow and they wouldn\u2019t let us off the plane. Without explanation, a woman with a mask got on and started going up to every passenger and taking their temperature. Then in the airport a whole planeload of people arriving from the far east of Russia were herded into a corner. There were people in hazmat suits taking temperatures before you got to baggage claim. Then the whole airport was locked down. We thought we were going to be quarantined in Moscow. That was unnerving. The show was actually fantastic \u2013 a beautiful vibe \u2013 but the urge to get home to my family was huge.</p> <p>At that point my diary was still full. The first cancellation was Ultra in Miami. I should have been in Vienna on 14 March but that got cancelled. Would I have gone if it hadn\u2019t been cancelled? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer now. If I don\u2019t turn up, nobody gets paid, but then the moral approach is to make sure everybody\u2019s safe. If we all work together and heed these warnings, then this is going to be over quicker. My kid got sent home with a cough, so we\u2019re indoors for 14 days.</p> <p>On a personal level, the next few months are wiped out but my main concern is covering the people who put the stages together, do the lighting, work behind bars, security\u2026 It\u2019s savage for our industry. Loads of DJs are doing tutoring online, uploading mixes, doing virtual sets. I\u2019m definitely going to be in the studio a lot more. I\u2019m holding on to the hope that the second half of this year is going to be a lot more positive. The drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene is such a beautiful, communal scene and we will bounce back with the mother of all parties. I was listening to a set earlier and thinking, oh yeah, that\u2019s when we used to go out and rave. <strong>DL</strong></p>",

But for the first time as a practitioner, she is not in her a studio. Instead Bradley is live-streaming via Zoom and her students are participating in their own homes.</p> <p>With the coronavirus forcing businesses to close their doors as governments around the world move to either ban or limit social contact, many freelancers and self-employed people are finding their income decimated by the virus.

He\u2019s also starting to explore different revenue streams such as online courses for people wanting to learn more about growing vegetables, fruit and herbs. \u201cThis is a topic I\u2019m incredibly passionate about because I know it will help people, growing crops to mitigate self-isolation boredom, and it\u2019s good for you too,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Like millions of others, he has strict rules on what remaining work he can do that is not online as a result of the government\u2019s lockdown rules this week. \u201cI\u2019ve actually now postponed all \u2018in garden\u2019 jobs for at least these three weeks.

But a good online course will be very specific, so rather than \u201chow to meditate\u201d, something like \u201cmeditating to de-stress during coronavirus\u201d is better. People need to instantly see why your course is for them.</p> <p>Once the idea is refined, choose a name that is simple \u2013 no wordplay \u2013 and takes search engine optimisation into account. You want people to Google the words that make up the name of your course and find the one you have created.</p> <p>You should also be sharing tips and advice on social media on this subject, so that people trust you to talk about this subject. If you have an online profile and have developed a relationship with your followers, and they are keen to read all the information you share about this subject, you have a ready-formed customer base for your course.</p> <p>You should include text and video, as people have different tastes. Separate the information into modules and topics. Keep it simple, informative and digestible.</p> <p>There are third-party hosting sites such as <a href=\"https://www.thinkific.com/\">Thinkific</a>, or you can create a password-protected page on your website, and sell through <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/\">Eventbrite</a>. Once your courses are selling well, you might like to invest in a proper online course website. I have done this through Wordpress, using the <a href=\"https://www.learndash.com/\">Learndash</a> online course platform, and it works really well.</p> <p>Think carefully about pricing: too low and it devalues your course; too high and people either will not buy it or will have very high expectations. If it then does not match the price tag, participants will not stick around to buy your next course, which, by the way, you should be designing as soon as the first one is launched because your existing customers will be easier to sell to than new ones.</p> <p>Consider having a start date. Customers often need an incentive to purchase. Early-bird discounts can be useful \u2013 although many people are looking to up-skill while at home, so the current climate might be all the incentive they need. </p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>US cases pass 100,000</strong></h2> <p>Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis have pleaded for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known infections surpassed 100,000 \u2013&nbsp;the most in any one country \u2013&nbsp;with more than 1,600 dead.</p> <h2><strong>Italy overtakes China with second-highest number of cases</strong></h2> <p>Italy also recorded its highest daily number of deaths \u2013 the 969 fatalities were also the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/more-countries-deploy-their-military-to-help-during-covid-19-crisis\">highest daily figure in any country so far</a>, according to AFP. The fatalities took the country\u2019s death toll to 9,134 while the total number of cases topped 86,400, second only to the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. The head of Italy\u2019s national health institute warned that infections had not yet reached their peak and lockdown measures would have to be extended.</p> <h2><strong>Australia steps up enforcement of social distancing rules</strong></h2> <p>In an attempt to contain community transmission, Australian states have implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/australias-coronavirus-toll-covid-19-related-deaths-across-the-country\">death toll</a> from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea reports most new cases in a week</strong></h2> <p>South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days.</p> <h2><strong>No new domestic infections, China reports</strong></h2> <p>China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier.</p> <h2>UK PM and health secretary test positive</h2> <p>After Boris Johnson tested positive for Covid-19, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">confirmed they both had coronavirus</a> with mild symptoms as well, and were self-isolating.</p> <h2><strong>Iranian doctors say \u2018hundreds\u2019 dead after ingesting methanol</strong></h2> <p>An Iranian doctor said hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus.</p>",
  "<p>Roots, including beetroots, carrots, radishes, etc, grow with a plume of stalks and leaves that are versatile, easy to prepare and nutritious, much like any other leafy green or herb. It\u2019s important to eat root greens to make full use of the resources, labour and fuel that\u2019s been used to farm them, and roots sold with their greens attached are likely to be very fresh (the leaves perish quickly), so are also likely to have been farmed relatively locally. They can cost more than stored roots, but that\u2019s reduced or even mitigated if you use the whole plant. </p> <p>In the recipes for my new book, Eating for Pleasure, People &amp; Planet, nothing is peeled, trimmed or composted unless it\u2019s inedible. The result is a climate-friendly diet that saves money through reducing food waste in order to buy better farmed and more flavourful produce in recipes such as this one.</p> <h2>Pan-roasted radishes with labneh, freekeh and radish leaves</h2> <p>Radish leaves are a common ingredient in various world cuisines, and they are used in soups, braised, curried or simply added to salads. In this recipe, adapted from my new book, they are simply wilted in the residual heat of cooked freekeh. Freekeh is a type of cracked wheat that is picked green and then set alight to burn off the husk a process that creates an incredibly flavoursome and smoky grain that\u2019s a great base for a simple meal. <a href=\"https://www.zaytoun.org/zaytoun_freekeh.html\" title=\"\">Zaytoun sells a delicious Palestinian freekeh</a> that is certified by Fair for Life, whose aims to create a world where trade is a driving force for positive and sustainable change, benefiting people and their environment, is shared by my own root-to-fruit eating sustainability manifesto.</p> <p>Serves <strong>2 as a light meal or 4 as a side dish<br>100g freekeh</strong>, or bulgur wheat or couscous<strong><br>1 bunch radishes with leaves<br>\u00bc lemon</strong>, zested and juiced, ideally unwaxed<br><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil<br>Salt and black pepper<br>200g labneh</strong>,<strong> </strong>or plain yoghurt<br><strong>1 tbsp coconut oil or rapeseed oil<br>1 tsp nigella seeds</strong>, or black onion or sesame seeds</p> <p>Put the freekeh in a small saucepan, cover with plenty of water and cook for 15 minutes, until cooked through, but still a bit chewy. Drain, return to the pan, then gently stir in the radish leaves, lemon zest and juice, and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, and season to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and spoon the labneh on top.</p> <p>Heat a dash of coconut or rapeseed oil in a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat, being careful not to let it smoke. While it\u2019s heating up, cut the radishes in half, then add a pinch of salt and fry for just a minute, until they are slightly blistered and still bright in colour. Spoon on top of the labneh, sprinkle the nigella seeds on top, and serve.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was edited on 28 March 2020, to correct the excision of the end of the recipe method.</p>",
  "<p>I say it a lot, but don\u2019t take my own advice enough. Experiencing nature is about slowing down \u2013 stopping, in fact. The stiller you stay, the more you see. Nature confides when you\u2019re not blundering through it. But that\u2019s only half the story. The rest is attention. It takes mental effort to stand, orient, step and not fall on your face. Backroom brainwork for sure, but it still absorbs neural capacity, and so the best way to see is to sit.</p> <p>The bench under the kitchen window is as good a place for this as I know. Three metres from the bird feeder, a bed of overgrown lavender and rosemary, a backdrop of grass too scruffy to be called a lawn and a wooded slope that limits the horizon to less than 100 metres. We\u2019re lucky, I know it. In this space, if need be, we can exercise the dog and ourselves. We can feel the sun, listen to the birds, sniff the wind without fearing what the air might contain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/how-to-make-the-most-of-the-spring-wildlife-carnival-on-your-doorstep\">How to make the most of the spring wildlife carnival on your doorstep</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I settle. The dog dozes at my feet. In the dense matrix of rosemary stems I notice an ancient football we thought we\u2019d lost, then furtive movements of dunnocks and a chaffinch, picking at spilt birdseed. A wren peeks. Robin sings. Long-tailed, coal and willow tits return to the feeder and tree sparrows skirr past in a small, hectic squadron. A blue tit alights on the wall of the house and begins inspecting every cranny in the stonework, pausing every second to check its surroundings with eyes black and bright as thought itself. Peer and scan, peer and scan. There\u2019s another movement in the rosemary and I realise a young rabbit has been there all along \u2013 less than a collie\u2019s standing-leap from the dog\u2019s snoozing muzzle.</p> <p>They are all stay-at-homes, I realise. Despite wings and swift feet, their lives will likely be lived wholly in the arena I can see now. They notice the overhead trajectories of crows, wood pigeons and buzzards the way I register a passing helicopter, clueless as to where it came from or where it might be going. For these little homebodies, this horizon is all there is. And I\u2019m reassured it can be enough.</p>",
  "<p>Around the world, as cities have gone into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus, the mass efforts to save lives have put one vulnerable group more at risk.</p> <p>Women and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse.</p> <p>In Hubei province, the heart of the initial coronavirus outbreak, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled in one county alone during the lockdown in February, from 47 last year to 162 this year, activists told local media.</p> <p>\u201cThe epidemic has had a huge impact on domestic violence,\u201d Wan Fei, a retired police officer who founded a charity campaigning against abuse, told <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005253/domestic-violence-cases-surge-during-covid-19-epidemic\">Sixth Tone website</a>. \u201cAccording to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence [in this period] are related to the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d</p> <p>It is a pattern being repeated globally. In Brazil a state-run drop-in centre has already seen a surge in cases it attributes to coronavirus isolation, the Brazilian broadcaster Globo said.</p> <p>\u201cWe think there has been a rise of 40% or 50%, and there was already really big demand,\u201d said Adriana Mello, a Rio de Janeiro judge specialising in domestic violence. \u201cWe need to stay calm in order to tackle this difficulty we are now facing.\u201d</p> <p>The Catalan regional government said that calls to its helpline had risen by 20% in the first few days of the confinement period; in Cyprus, calls to a similar hotline rose 30% in the week after 9 March, when the island had its first confirmed case of coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62c9be23cc9b4fb2441d31b679624a2c343d73af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62c9be23cc9b4fb2441d31b679624a2c343d73af/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman crosses an empty street in Paris during the nationwide confinement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman crosses an empty street in Paris during the nationwide confinement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a dramatic rise and it has only gone up,\u201d said Annita Draka, of the association for the prevention of domestic violence, which is based in Nicosia, the island\u2019s capital. \u201cIt\u2019s a 24-hour helpline and the calls come in all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Those alarming figures log only cases where women are able to seek help; many cannot make calls because they fear being overheard by abusive partners, or are stopped from leaving home.</p> <p>In Italy activists said calls to helplines had dropped sharply, but instead they were receiving desperate text messages and emails.</p> <p>\u201cOne message was from a woman who had locked herself in the bathroom and wrote to ask for help,\u201d said Lella Palladino, from <a href=\"https://www.cooperativaeva.com/\">EVA Cooperativa</a>, an activists\u2019 group for the prevention of violence against women. \u201cFor sure there is an overwhelming emergency right now.

Increased abuse is a pattern repeated in many emergencies, whether conflict, economic crisis or during disease outbreaks, although the quarantine rules pose a particularly grave challenge.</p> <p>\u201cIt happens in all crisis situations,\u201d said Marcy Hersh, a senior manager for humanitarian advocacy at <a href=\"https://womendeliver.org/\">Women Deliver</a>. \u201cWhat we worry about is just as rates of violence are on the rise, the accessibility of services and the ability of women to access these services will decrease.

Trump tried to dissuade the Massie from holding up the vote.<br></p> \n  <p>In a series of tweets on Friday morning, he assailed Massie as a \u201cthird rate Grandstander\u201d and \u201ca disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!\u201d Trump also suggested Republicans should \u201cthrow Massie out\u201d of the party.</p> \n  <p>Massie\u2019s statement reads in full:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d or \u201cpresent.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics, and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?</p> \n   <p>I am not delaying the bill like Nancy Pelosi did last week. The bill that was worked on in the Senate late last week was much better before Speaker Pelosi showed up to destroy it and add days and days to the process.</p> \n   <p>This bill should have been voted on much sooner in both the Senate and House and it shouldn\u2019t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s pork \u2013 including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts, and millions more other measures that have no direct relation to the Coronavirus Pandemic. </p> \n   <p>That $25 million, for example, should go directly to purchasing test kits. The number one priority of this bill should have been to expand testing availability and creation of tests so that every American, not just the wealthy and privileged, have access to testing. We have shut down the world\u2019s economy without adequate data. Everyone, even those with no symptoms, needs immediate access to a test. This bill creates even more secrecy around a Federal Reserve that still refuses to be audited. It allows the Federal Reserve to make decisions about who gets what, how much money we\u2019ll print. With no transparency.</p> \n   <p>If getting us into $6 trillion more debt doesn\u2019t matter, then why are we not getting $350 trillion more in debt so that we can give a check of $1 million to every person in the country?</p> \n   <p>This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing. 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13,333.00 per person. That\u2019s much more than the $1,200 per person check authorized by this bill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T16:09:23.450Z\">at 4.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7e212b8f081e5eda23815f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T15:52:50.041Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump invokes Defense Production Act in urging GM to manufacture ventilators</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act in a series of tweets urging General Motors to take the lead in manufacturing ventilators. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243559373395410957\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!

But the idea of a vaccine \u2013 the quintessential silver bullet \u2013 has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> \n  <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p> \n

The idea is simple: there are businesses which will have to close their doors. They will have to keep them closed either because we have made it necessary for them to do so, or simply because there is just not the business to keep their doors open. We want those businesses to start again. And we do not want over the course of the next six months or as long as it takes, for those businesses to be so saddled by debt, so saddled by rental payments, so saddled by other liabilities that they will not be able to start again on the other side.

If you see news you think our readers should know, or something that might lower our collective stress levels for a moment, let me know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n  <p>A lot has happened in the last few hours. Here are the main developments: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.</strong> Johns Hopkins University suggests the US now has more suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 than China with 82,404 reported in the US and 81,782 in China. Italy is third with 80,589.</li> \n   <li><strong>The global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed the half a million mark,</strong> according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. The latest number of confirmed cases worldwide is 529,093.</li> \n   <li><strong>Leaders of the G20 industrialised nations committed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to minimise the social and economic damage of the world-wide pandemic.</strong> But a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique set no specific commitments such as deferring debt repayment to the world\u2019s poorest countries, as sought by the World Bank and the IMF.</li> \n   <li><strong>China has announced it will close its borders to foreign nationals from this weekend</strong>. Other measures include restricting foreign airlines to a single route, with no more than one weekly flight. Each Chinese airline is permitted one route to any specific country with no more than one flight a week.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa came under a nationwide military-patrolled lockdown on Friday, </strong>joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa\u2019s three-week total lockdown which began at midnight.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brita</strong><strong>in\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, called on governments around the world to work together to create a vaccine</strong> as quickly as possible and make it available to anyone who needs it.</li> \n   <li><strong>The International Monetary Fund on Thursday asked G20 leaders to back a doubling of its emergency financing capacity</strong> to strengthen its response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic that is set to cause a global recession in 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>France </strong><strong>began evacuating coronavirus patients from Alsace using a special high-speed train.</strong> About 20 patients were taken from Strasbourg to hospitals in the Pays-de-la-Loire and other regions. The move is aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals overwhelmed in Alsace.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO said it sees \u2018encouraging signs\u2019 in Europe. </strong>The World Health Organiszation says it is encouraged by the lower rate of new infection in Italy. </li> \n   <li><strong>A slower rise in deaths was reported in Spain. </strong>Spain has announced anothera further 655 coronavirus fatalities, taking the country\u2019s total to more than 4,000. As the increase is below the daily rise recorded on Wednesday it offers support to government claims that the rise is deaths in Spain is stabilising.</li> \n   <li><strong>India announced a stimulus package. </strong>India has announced a 1.7tn-rupee (\u00a318.9bn) economic stimulus plan to millions of people, affected by a nationwide lockdown. </li> \n   <li><strong>Iran posted a record rise in cases. </strong>The health ministry confirmed another 157 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s total to 2,234 fatalities. A record 2,389 new cases had been recorded over the same period.

It is the biggest daily rise in deaths across the country since the outbreak began.</li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow shut down as Russia banned flights. </strong>Moscow announced it would close restaurants, bars, parks, and shops other than grocery stores and pharmacies. It came as Russia posted record growth for confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T00:13:49.778Z\">at 12.13am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",
