study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.<br></p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government is under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/spain-path-out-of-covid-lockdown-complicated-by-polarised-politics\">growing pressure from political opponents to end the two-month state of emergency</a> that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, the health ministry was due to decide whether the Madrid region would be granted permission to follow other areas into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/global-report-spain-and-italy-grapple-with-how-to-end-covid-19-lockdown\">next stage of the de-escalation</a>, which allows up to 10 people to meet and permits the reopening of cafe and restaurant terraces at 50% capacity.</p> \n  <p>Pedro Duque, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/new-spanish-pm-appoints-astronaut-pedro-duque-science-minister\">former astronaut who serves as Spain\u2019s science minister</a>, told the Guardian that the preliminary results of a nationwide serological study published earlier this week would be crucial to the government\u2019s response.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-14/antibody-study-shows-just-5-of-spaniards-have-contracted-the-coronavirus.html\">study, which involved more than 60,000 people</a>, revealed that around 5% of the population \u2013 about 2 million people \u2013 had had the coronavirus. It also showed that 33% of those who had caught the virus had not shown any symptoms.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe think that the seroprevalence test we\u2019ve carried out is the best that\u2019s been done anywhere in the world so far. The most important conclusion we\u2019ve reached is that it is vital to keep acting very prudently when it comes to this illness \u2013 there are still a lot of people who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Duque said the pronounced geographical variations underscored the need for a region-by-region loosening of restrictions: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha.</p> \n  <p>\u201cRight now, the only way to act is by making small changes when it comes to relaxing the conditions, by maintaining the distances between people, and by keeping up with the infection precautions,\u201d he added.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe consequences of acting irresponsibly could be enormous given that we know that only 5% of the population has some degree of immunity against the virus. That means that 95% don\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Duque also dismissed talk of so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow more freedom of movement to those who had recovered from the disease.

Details on the precise implementation of the rules is to follow, but the western state of North Rhine Westphalia already applied them on the stroke of midnight on Friday.</p> \n  <p>Germans are closely watching the gradual easing of travel restrictions wanting to know to what extent they can hope to go on a foreign holiday this year. From May, 25 flights between Germany and Greece will resume. But officially the advice remains that Germans should not travel anywhere abroad, until at least 14 June.</p> \n  <p>On Monday Heiko Maas, the foreign minister, will hold a video conference with his counterparts from European countries where Germans typically go on holiday, including Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, Malta, Slovenia, Cyprus and Bulgaria. The aim is to facilitate a coordinated reopening of borders including mutual agreements on being able to swiftly close them again in case of a rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, announced that an opening of the borders with France, Switzerland and Austria was on the cards from 15 June. On Wednesday, border traffic between Germany and Luxembourg is due to normalise again. Discussions with Denmark are still ongoing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:31:26.329Z\">at 2.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe895b8f0849a584fe11e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:30:58.134Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d449499bdbd6a41bba2045349f8c1b558c21f8a9/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health workers in the Take Care of Care movement protest in Liege against the Belgian authorities\u2019 management of coronavirus.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:32:36.324Z\">at 2.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe88bf8f08898ae689136b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:20:07.127Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Denmark has reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March, Reuters reports.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T13:33:01.701Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe87d98f08898ae6891364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/david-agren\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T12:15:50.238Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100 Mexicans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol over the past month in a string of mass poisonings which followed a ban on the sale of liquor during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Deaths from unsafe alcohol have been reported in at least four states.

Whether there is a maximum number of people allowed for each household has not been specified. For those from a single household the distancing rules do not apply. </p> \n  <p>Waiting staff are required to wear face coverings.

If restaurants submit applications specific to the streets they would like to occupy, officials will move to close the roads to traffic on Fridays and at weekends, between 11am and 10pm.</p> \n  <p>Some concerns have been expressed that that arrangement may put the safety of diners under threat \u2013 with some sceptics making reference to the Berlin Christmas market attack of 2016 when an Islamist terrorist drove a lorry into the crowd, killing 12.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T11:13:13.631Z\">at 12.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe70258f08898ae689124f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:36:25.650Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin, taking over the liveblog from my colleague Matt. </p> \n  <p>If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or reach me on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin\">@aamnamohdin</a>).</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe6bb88f08898ae689122b\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:33:52.799Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments so far on Friday: </p> \n  <p><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong><br></p> \n  <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the north-eastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> \n  <p><strong>Virus pushes Germany into recession</strong><br></p> \n  <p>German output shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to new official data. The quarter-on-quarter contraction is \u201cthe worst since the financial crisis\u201d in 2009, the federal statistics office Destatis said. The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Slovenia proclaims end to the outbreak</strong></p> \n  <p>Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home. It said on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 was under control and there was no longer a need for extraordinary health measures.</p> \n  <p><strong>Spain announces lowest daily death toll since Monday</strong></p> \n  <p>Spain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus registered its lowest increase since Monday with 138 new fatalities announced by the health ministry. The overall coronavirus death toll, in Europe\u2019s fourth worst hit country, rose to 27,459 on Friday, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 230,183 cases from 229,540.</p> \n  <p><strong>Italy and Germany to ease more restrictions</strong></p> \n  <p>Italy is set to allow free travel across the country from 3 June, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. The draft, which could still be modified before it is approved, also said all travel within separate Italian regions would be allowed from 18 May. Germany will loosen quarantine rules for travellers arriving from the European Union and the UK, according to the interior ministry. </p> \n  <p><strong>China responds diplomatically to Trump threat of cutting off ties</strong></p> \n  <p>China\u2019s foreign ministry has responded diplomatically to Donald Trump\u2019s threat of cutting ties with Beijing over the virus. The US president said the pandemic had cast a pall over his January trade deal with Beijing and that he had no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that steady Sino-US bilateral relations served the interests of both countries.</p> \n  <p><strong>Baltic states restore free movement </strong></p> \n  <p>The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have opened their borders to each other to create a mini-Schengen area. Free movement of people will be restored to all 6 million permanent residents of the Baltic states, but arrivals from outside the three countries will have to undergo a two-week quarantine period.</p> \n  <p><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></p> \n  <p> Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> \n  <p><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></p> \n  <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday. The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in the last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> \n  <p><strong>South Korea, China and Japan\u2019s health ministers to hold video conference</strong></p> \n  <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the east Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</strong></p> \n  <p>Aid groups have warned of a looming humanitarian disaster after coronavirus was detected for the first time in the sprawling camps that host about 1 million Rohingya refugees.

This is a \u201creciprocal\u201d measure after Spain imposed 14 days\u2019 quarantine for anyone arriving from the EU/Schengen area.</p> \n  <p> The French border is currently closed to any visitors other than essential travellers who have a \u201ccompelling\u201d professional or personal reason to enter the country and are carrying a sworn declaration to that effect. June 15 has been set for a possible reopening of French borders to European visitors.</p> \n  <p>Deaths on French roads dropped by just under 56% during April compared with the same month last year. This is hardly surprising as everyone was locked down, but police records suggested those who were on the empty roads drove faster.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference. </strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh. </strong>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed. </strong>Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:05:58.460Z\">at 8.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2d908f08d99d46a174b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:50:18.490Z\">6.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe2c038f08d99d46a174a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alison-rourke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T05:45:17.107Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global report: Trump threat to cut trade ties over Covid-19 branded \u2018lunacy\u2019 by Chinese media</h2> \n  <p>An escalation of rhetoric between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and China over the coronavirus pandemic has sparked concerns that a trade deal between the nations is in peril, as Chinese state media dismissed as \u201clunacy\u201d a suggestion by the US president that he could \u201ccut off relations with Beijing.</p> \n  <p>The US president said he was very disappointed with China\u2019s failure to contain Covid-19 in an interview with Fox Business news.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</li> \n   <li><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced. </strong>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says he could cut China ties. </strong>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over the novel coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now and going so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. </li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will gather by video conference </strong>to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases. </strong>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000. </strong>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to Johns Hopkins data. 844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T07:07:10.737Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1d1b8f080c727453b50c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:41:08.002Z\">5.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Get in touch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter @helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebe1c578f080c727453b508\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T04:37:51.856Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kjalee/status/1260918708458991616\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh my god, this is amazing.

The true number is likely to be higher. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global death toll passes 300,000. </strong>The global toll from Covid-19 has just passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected.According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 301,370 people have now died as a result of the outbreak.The institution says it has counted 4,426,937 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly 600,000 Australians have lost their jobs during the pandemic. </strong>Almost 600,000 Australians lost their jobs between March and April, unemployment rose to 6.2%, the underemployment rate increased by 4.9 points to 13.7% and the underutilisation rate increased by 5.9 points to 19.9%.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the figures were \u201cterribly shocking, although not totally unexpected\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus. </strong>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">Donald Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</a>. </strong>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but without wearing a mask himself.Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</li> \n   <li><strong>A vaccine for coronavirus must be available to all countries, the EU has insisted</strong>, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US. \u201cThe vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,\u201d said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.</li> \n   <li><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed as another 3 million filed for benefits</strong>. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</li> \n   <li><strong>The European commission has suspended the delivery of 10 million face masks from China</strong> after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received, the Associated Press reports. As part of its efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, this month the commission started dispatching the masks to healthcare workers in its 27 member states and the UK.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officials in Bangladesh have announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the country\u2019s Rohingya refugee camps</strong>. Health experts and NGOs have issued warnings that the virus could race through the camps that house almost a million people forced to flee a military offensive in Myanmar almost two years ago.</li> \n   <li><strong>Greece will open 515 organised beaches to the public this weekend</strong>, but alcohol and music will be banned, along with sports and games.

  "<p>The start of Pete Evans\u2019 long goodbye from the mainstream first became apparent in 2012. After two seasons as a judge on the successful Channel 7 cooking show My Kitchen Rules, co-owner of the glamorous Sydney hotspot Hugos (in its heyday voted best pizza in the world) and a guest on cooking shows such as MasterChef, Sunday Life magazine approached him to take part in their weekly column, My Day on a Plate.</p> <p>The column \u2013 a chance to perve on celebrities\u2019 sometimes bizarre food habits \u2013 often provokes mockery, yet <a href=\"https://kitchen.nine.com.au/healthy/the-pete-evans-diet-decoder/0fcf035f-84f5-4238-a3e3-b4d047128fc0\">Evans topped them all</a>. His morning began with \u201ca smoothie of blended alkalised water, organic spirulina, activated almonds, maca, blueberries, stevia, coconut kefir and two organic, free-range eggs.\u201d The howls of derision could be heard all over the internet and in homes around Australia. Just what the hell were activated almonds?</p> <p>While activated almonds (nuts soaked for 24 hours in water, then dried out again over a low heat) have crossed over to the mainstream and can now be found on supermarket shelves, over the last eight years Evans has been walking a tightrope between two worlds. In one world he\u2019s a prime time television personality and author whose cookbooks, with their wide availability and low price point, have brought him into millions of homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">Chef Pete Evans criticised for trying to sell $15,000 light device to fight coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the other world he\u2019s a promoter of alternative medicines and health claims that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/14/doctors-warns-pete-evans-to-stick-to-cooking-after-sharing-anti-vaxx-podcast\">slammed by medical authorities</a>, caused his books to be pulled from shelves and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">most recently attracted penalties</a> from the Therapeutic Goods Administration for promoting a $15,000 light device that could be used in relation to \u201cWuhan Coronavirus\u201d.

He recently took part in the surge of disinformation around Covid-19 and anti-vaxx theories when he posted on Facebook a link to the discredited conspiracy theory film Plandemic before it was removed.</p> <p>A theme that recurs in his social media feed is mistrust of authorities, the mainstream media and a belief that the real truth is being hidden from the people.</p> <p>After leaving MKR, on Instagram under a picture of Donald Trump and hashtagged with #obamagate he wrote: \u201cThis may be a great time to take off the mainstream media lens, if that is what you have been viewing the world through, and perhaps look through a different lens....or not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CABro77jvXC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The run on toilet paper and panic buying was an expression of that. Conspiracy thinking is a consequence of increased fear when people\u2019s idea systems break down,\u201d says Rose. \u201cExcessive and unreasonable conspiracy thinking arises when some people attempt to fill gaps in idea systems that are breaking down. Their existing ideas no longer help them understand a changing world, so they look around for new ideas to fill the gaps.\u201d</p> <p>These include ideas such as the virus being caused by 5G \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-the-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-is-false-video-explainer\">categorically found to be false</a> \u2013 or conversely not existing at all.</p> <p>Evan\u2019s social media platforms have a massive, global reach and include a Facebook page that has more followers than a lot of mainstream news organisations, a podcast and a role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/pete-evans-documentary-should-be-cut-from-netflix-doctors-group-says\">controversial Netflix documentary The Magic Pill</a>.

Evans doesn\u2019t need traditional broadcast television any more.\u201d</p> <p>Years in the public eye have meant that Evans has already built a solid following. Now, as his message is increasingly unorthodox, followers aren\u2019t necessarily being repelled by Evans but are supporting him, says Ferrier.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are a person or brand with a lot of followers and you are under attack, the followers like you even more because they have sunk in capital and attention into your brand.\u201d</p> <p>Capital and attention include watching Evans every night on MKR, buying his cookbooks and trying his paleo diet.</p> <p>\u201cThey have already invested in him, they have to keep on rationalising it,\u201d says Ferrier. \u201cIf you\u2019ve sunk costs into something, it\u2019s hard to pull out.\u201d</p> <p>Ferrier, who has also worked as a cult buster, says: \u201cEveryone who has a cookbook in his house is one step closer to believing his bullshit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb8b64e7de642be703115cb9dc82d512c943a4f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb8b64e7de642be703115cb9dc82d512c943a4f9/0_104_3110_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"My Kitchen Rules co-hosts Manu Feildel and Pete Evans, in a publicity still from 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My Kitchen Rules co-hosts Manu Feildel and Pete Evans in a publicity still from 2016.

Pete Evans is a businessman \u2013 he promotes a brand which is based on creating imaginary hierarchies in society \u2013 so he sells the idea that you can be superior to other people if you follow his diet. For some people this is reassuring.\u201d</p> <p>The feeling of superiority can also mean that people who attack the ideals of the group are dismissed as unevolved, brainwashed or sleepwalking \u2013 thereby cutting off the circulation of any meaningful debate or dissent.</p> <p>Ferrier believes Evans\u2019 power is increasing. \u201cIt depends what\u2019s driving him, but the more influential he becomes, the bigger the harm.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Evans is tapping into a prevailing mood \u2013 anxiety, confusion and distrust of authority.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s always had the ability to have the taste of popular culture \u2013 ever since Hugos.

A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments.</p> <p>\u201cAnybody who looks at our economy objectively and thinks about what will be the source of growth after this crisis clearly thinks that industry needs to have cheaper and cleaner energy,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cWe need to get that skills mix, the R&amp;D commercialisation side \u2013 all of those things \u2013 they will be the key to the future.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess what I am relaying is what business says to me \u2026 business can\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t get a resolution on energy, and if you think about our challenges on growth, employment and wages, then I think any serious objective observer would say energy has got to be part [of post-Covid recovery].\u201d</p> <p>Chalmers said it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether the major parties could come to terms but he said Labor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/21/labor-to-keep-national-energy-guarantee-in-bid-for-climate-truce\">attitude towards the national energy guarantee</a> indicated \u201cthere were compromises Labor was prepared to make to get some kind of certainty in the system so business could invest with confidence\u201d.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging conversation, Chalmers also flagged Labor would look to develop policies during the current parliamentary term that recognised that unemployment was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-rate-in-australia-jumps-to-62-due-to-covid-19-as-600000-jobs-lost\">likely to remain elevated</a> in Australia after the worst of the coronavirus economic shock had passed.</p> <p>New figures released this week show the jobless rate in Australia has hit the highest level since September 2015, with seasonally adjusted employment falling by 594,300 in April. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said around 2.7 million people, or one in every five person employed in March, either left employment, or had their hours reduced between March and April.</p> <p>Chalmers said there was a problem with demand in the economy and there was also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/01/newstart-crisis-calls-for-independent-commission-to-set-rate-of-welfare-payments\">problem that the unemployment benefit was too low</a>. The shadow treasurer said he was not an advocate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income\">universal basic income</a> as a concept. Universal basic income provides all citizens with a cash payment, replacing traditional welfare systems.</p> <p>But Chalmers said there was clearly a need to \u201crethink whether the social safety net is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/society-must-not-snap-back-to-insecure-work-and-poverty-after-coronavirus-crisis-albanese-says\">stitched together robustly enough to deal with crises</a> like [Covid-19] and the aftermath of crises like this\u201d.

The fires were not contained until March. Among the victims were five firefighters, including three from the US who died when their waterbomber aircraft crashed in northern NSW after losing contact with control crews. More than 2,500 homes were destroyed, including upwards of 300 in Victoria.</p> <p>Dr Debra Parkinson, a research fellow with Monash University\u2019s Disaster Resilience Initiative, said \u201cpeople wildly overestimate the ability of the emergency sector to save their properties\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor years now, the CFA has warned that there will not be a CFA truck in every driveway in the event of a fire,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really surprised to see that more than a third of respondents still expected this, and especially that almost two-thirds expect a firefighting aircraft.\u201d</p> <p>Parkinson is among the founders of the <a href=\"https://www.genderanddisaster.com.au/\">Gender &amp; Disaster podcast</a>, which examines the role of gender survivor responses to and emergency management of natural disasters.

Liberal states also front-ran the climate and energy debate, pushing for the national energy guarantee \u2013 the policy that had been dumped in the frenzy of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s ousting \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/21/liberal-states-in-talks-to-revive-turnbulls-dumped-energy-policy\">to be reinstated</a>, a sortie that caused the energy minister Angus Taylor all kinds of angst, until that angst was replaced by the angst of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/07/clover-moore-demands-pm-explain-angus-taylors-use-of-false-document-to-attack-her\">the self-inflicted Clover Moore controversy</a>.</p> <p>The sense of really important things sliding, drifting, sputtering, then collided with the absolute disaster of the summer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/australia-is-burning-like-a-tinderbox-and-the-coalition-wont-acknowledge-voters-rising-fears\">Morrison flailed when the country most needed reassurance</a>, failing to rise to the occasion of the most catastrophic bushfires in a century. The failure of leadership was so profound that by the middle of January, Morrison\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/14/essential-poll-more-voters-disapprove-of-scott-morrison-and-see-him-as-arrogant\">disapproval in the Guardian Essential poll</a> had spiked by nine points, and Anthony Albanese pulled ahead as preferred prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9bc04b2bc141eace1a1c5fce40f1514b50c0511\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9bc04b2bc141eace1a1c5fce40f1514b50c0511/80_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison tries to shake hands with unwilling woman in Cobargo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison\u2019s disastrous performance during the bushfire crisis was symbolised in the image of a Cobargo, NSW resident refusing to shake his hand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prime minister then ricocheted into the red-hot \u201csports rorts\u201d controversy, which triggered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/michael-mccormack-barnaby-joyce-national-party-leadership-spill\">implosion inside the National party</a> and also generated a bunch of significant questions that have not been satisfactorily answered to this day, not the least of which is: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/01/while-bridget-mckenzie-hovers-in-no-mans-land-were-left-waiting-for-a-clear-explanation\">did the government act lawfully?</a> It is infuriating that a question of such significance can linger, unanswered, for months, despite our best efforts to keep asking it.</p> <p>Then Covid-19 arrived \u2013 a crisis huge enough to hurl everything wildly into the air.</p> <p>It is valid to quibble about various specifics. Would Morrison have moved fast enough on the lockdown of non-essential services without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/the-two-meetings-that-changed-the-trajectory-of-australias-coronavirus-response\">forceful intervention by Gladys Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews</a> during March? Should the government have produced the jobkeeper wage subsidy a week earlier? Would that have saved jobs?</p> <p>It was chaotic for weeks on end, the stress and anxiety off the charts, but what was clear from the outset was the prime minister\u2019s focus.</p> <p>Morrison was determined to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/29/morrisons-urgent-manoeuvring-on-coronavirus-is-atonement-for-summers-bushfire-shambles\">learn from his own deficiencies during the summer crisis</a>. He wanted to do a better job with coronavirus than he had done with the bushfires, and this was a high bar to set, because the nine governments of Australia could have easily been overwhelmed by the pandemic, as other governments were.</p> <p>What this shows us is Morrison can learn. Not all political leaders can, because learning requires self-knowledge. One of the primary motives for the studious learning may well have been self-preservation. But learning does require self-awareness and a measure of humility \u2013 and humility and Morrison aren\u2019t that obvious a pairing.</p> <p>So lesson number one of this past 12 months, for me: our prime minister can learn.</p> <p>Related to learning is adaptation. Morrison adapts. He\u2019s tribal \u2013 fealty matters, intrinsically he\u2019s an \u201care you with me or against me\u201d personality \u2013 but not ideological. He\u2019s a sponge, capable of absorbing and utilising the potential around him.</p> <p>What this means is Morrison\u2019s prime ministership could go anywhere. The trajectory isn\u2019t predictable. We aren\u2019t looking at a leader with fixed preoccupations. We aren\u2019t looking at John Howard, who came to public life to pursue tax and industrial relations reform. We are looking at a prime minister who likes to operate in the moment, provided he\u2019s got a firm grip on it.</p> <p>Morrison is so protean, we are looking at a prime minister who is yet to determine what sort of prime minister he will be.</p> <p>He could choose to do some good. A pragmatist, and that\u2019s what Morrison is, could dial down the partisanship that has poisoned our politics for more than a decade, choking hope and destroying trust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d10aed142cfcbd1f320cbbfb56a1c9aefa2c267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d10aed142cfcbd1f320cbbfb56a1c9aefa2c267/0_171_5136_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison in the national cabinet meeting of March 22\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison in the national cabinet meeting of 22 March, a key milestone in Australia\u2019s coronavirus response.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He could choose to build something rather than tearing things down. He\u2019s done that through the first phase of the Covid-19 crisis. We\u2019ve watched him do it. We\u2019ve watched Morrison test that version of a prime ministerial self.</p> <p>But already you see pressure building in the system, the gravitation pull for everything to revert to type.</p> <p>Rightwing voices in our busted media ecosystem are clamouring for the return of mindless biff. The conflict merchants are starved of material. Someone always has to be punching on, otherwise nothing is happening. Never mind if healing is happening. Healing in the polity is counterproductive to the king tide of outrage that fuels the sideshow of unhinged opinion.</p> <p>Morrison has to govern in this environment, same as all his predecessors since Kevin Rudd. It\u2019s not clear to me whether Morrison will have the will to persist in the mode of leadership he\u2019s developed during the current crisis, whether he\u2019s got the bottle, and more pertinently, the patience, for persistent collaboration in the national interest \u2013 or whether constraints will start to accumulate, limiting his agency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/scott-morrison-reverts-to-politics-as-usual-over-sports-rorts\">Scott Morrison reverts to \u2018politics as usual\u2019 over sports rorts | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s worth noting at this juncture the prime minister really doesn\u2019t like constraints. If he encounters them, the Morrison instinct is always to decouple. If there are questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer, the first resort is ignore them. If pain persists, he sledges the questioner. If that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s back to shutdown.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the management of the colleagues. If pesky ideologues inside his own ranks start sounding off unhelpfully, in recent examples <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/george-christensen-revives-diplomatic-spat-with-threat-to-summons-chinese-ambassador\">cartoonishly about China</a>, or to query whether a Liberal government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/12/labor-and-the-greens-push-to-extend-eligibility-for-jobkeeper-scheme\">should be paying people not to work</a>, Morrison says isn\u2019t free speech wonderful. He presents like a proud parent at a school speech night: sure, George is terrible at clarinet, but how great are kids, warbling away, expressing themselves.</p> <p>At one level Morrison has to indulge what he can\u2019t control. At another level, this is a frictionless rebuke. If you listen closely there are always adults and kids in the prime minister\u2019s \u201chow great\u201d parables. There is always a responsible adult, Morrison, who is in charge, and getting on with things, and then there are others enjoying their hobbies. It\u2019s a frictionless rebuke that nimbly asserts a hierarchy.</p> <p>The frictionless rebuke is different from Tony Abbott deploying Peta Credlin to keep the show on a tight leash, and the various, ultimately fruitless accommodations Malcolm Turnbull tried to make with the right to prevent a repeat of 2009.</p> <p>It is too soon to say whether the Morrison management technique will be any more successful than the strategies of his predecessors. All we can say right now, 12 months on from the miracle, is it is quantifiably different.</p>",
  "<p>I remember receiving a stream of late night texts in 2014, from a Melbourne friend who was incensed that the Greater Union cinema on Russell Street was being torn down \u2013 its incredible wood-panelled lobby walls thrown into scrap, its projectors shut off for good. Emily made a deal with one of the crew hired to gut the place and managed to salvage two neon lights before the skip bins were retrieved at dawn.</p> <p>By that point I was fatigued by the sheer number of cinemas that had closed during my own cultural lifetime, and vowed never to frequent whatever business would rise from its ashes. Four years later I found myself checking into the hotel on that very site, while visiting from Sydney to host a post-screening Q&amp;A at the Melbourne international film festival. The popcorn might stop popping, but life moves on. I get it.</p> <p>Almost all of my childhood and adolescent cinema haunts have now been shuttered. I grew up in Sydney\u2019s north-western suburbs and my local was the beautiful Roxy in Parramatta, built in 1929 in a Spanish mission style. At one point my sister researched its architectural history for a university assignment, and I tagged along to her daytime site visits attempting to locate the ghost that supposedly haunted the upper level.</p> <p> Closed as a cinema since 2004, a proposal to renovate the Roxy as a 29-storey mixed use development was mercifully stymied by the NSW Land and Environment Courts last year. These iconic sites are so often under threat, and unprotected by statutory heritage protection, like the long-closed Globe theatre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70c186685b9bf5daf8271fe414cb0c785130413c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70c186685b9bf5daf8271fe414cb0c785130413c/0_0_4856_3237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Event Cinemas on George Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I remember the midnight sessions of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and A Clockwork Orange, and picking up a friend who worked at the Village candy bar after her shift.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Speed Media/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many, my nostalgia for the cinemas of my youth runs deep.

The Mandolin on Phillip Street, the Dendy cinemas in Martin Place and George Street, along with countless others, gone. </p> <p>Add in all the cinemas that were closed before my time, and you\u2019ve got yourself a modern cultural tragedy.

  "<p>My friend Anne Charlton, who has died aged 84 after contracting Covid-19, was a pioneer of cancer education research and smoking prevention in schools. She was a passionate advocate of the importance of public knowledge about cancer for its prevention and early diagnosis.</p> <p>Her work attracted considerable interest and had a significant impact both in the UK and abroad. The Cancer Research Campaign (now <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/\">Cancer Research UK</a>) made her a life fellow in 1980 and in 1996 she was appointed professor of cancer health education at Manchester University. It is a testament to her energy and enthusiasm that Anne began her career in cancer research at the age of 39.</p> <p>She was born in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, the eldest of three daughters of Roy Turner, who worked for the Midland Bank, and his wife, Isobel (nee Sharp), who ran a clothes shop before the second world war. Anne was a naturally investigative child and knew the names of many plants and rocks. A family joke was that she must have been reincarnated; how else could she have acquired such prodigious knowledge? Educated at Barrow Girls\u2019 grammar school and with a first degree from Keele in biology and geology, she qualified as a teacher in Cambridge. She returned to Barrow and taught biology at her old school for many years.</p> <p>In the years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/19/sellafield-nuclear-plant-cancer-cases\">the 1957 fire at Windscale</a> (now Sellafield), Anne\u2019s pupils sometimes brought in strange bluebells for her scrutiny. Ever curious, Anne applied for a PhD in the botany department at Manchester University. While completing her studies on bluebell development and its sensitivity to radiation, Anne met a young lecturer, Alan Charlton, and they married in 1965. Alan went on to build a distinguished research career in botany, while Anne returned to teaching, this time at Whalley Range High school in Manchester. The couple shared many interests throughout their lives, including a passion for steam locomotion and the restoration of <a href=\"https://www.theduke.uk.com/the-duke/about-the-duke-of-gloucester/\">Number 71000 Duke of Gloucester</a>.</p> <p>In 1974, Anne applied for a job with the Manchester Regional Committee for Cancer Education and began to survey children\u2019s and teachers\u2019 opinions about cancer. The work led to a master\u2019s degree and a lectureship at Manchester University and set Anne\u2019s course for the next few decades.</p> <p>Anne\u2019s work helped to overcome the taboo of cancer and her research on the factors that encourage young people to take up or stop smoking fed into teaching and resources for schools. Her studies also highlighted external influences that reinforced children\u2019s smoking, including tobacco industry sponsorship of Formula One racing and snooker, and contributed to the big push to transform UK government policy to denormalise smoking.</p> <p>Her zest for living was irrepressible; she continued to travel, to publish and present her research, and to enjoy Shakespeare plays and flower shows to the end of her life. A good friend and colleague to many, Anne was always ready to offer encouragement and support. </p> <p>Alan died in 2013. Anne is survived by her sisters, Kay and Valerie.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n    <div>\n     <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n      <p></p>\n      <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread.

Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n      <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n      <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity.

Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.</p> \n  <p>The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been extremely effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T15:57:15.171Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebeb3148f0849a584fe145a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T15:23:53.499Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>People wrongly charged under coronavirus laws have included a teenager fined after going to visit his mother and a woman arrested at a train station.</p> \n  <p>Marie Dinou, 41, was held by British Transport Police at Newcastle Central station just days after the Coronavirus Act came into force and wrongly fined \u00a3660.</p> \n  <p>Her case was an early warning that the legislation \u2013 which allows officers to remove or detain a \u201csuspected infectious person\u201d for screening and assessment \u2013 was being misused by police.</p> \n  <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has now admitted all 44 charges under the act, from when it was introduced on 27 March to the end of April, were wrong, following a review launched after errors were highlighted by journalists, lawyers and campaigners.</p> \n  <p>Thirty-one of the wrongful charges were corrected in court, but included 13 convictions, which have since been sent back to be withdrawn.</p> \n  <p>Lewis Brown, 18, was fined for allegedly breaching lockdown rules after going to visit his mother.

That term also reveals a key fact that capitalism has always sought to render invisible with another term, \u201chuman resource\u201d. Human beings are <em>not</em> one resource among many.

By the same token, it is time to enfranchise workers.</p> <p>Representation of labour investors in the workplace has existed in Europe since the close of the second world war, through institutions known as <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=707&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=211\">works </a><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=707&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=211\">councils</a>. Yet these representative bodies have a weak voice at best in the government of firms, and are subordinate to the choices of the executive management teams appointed by shareholders. They have been unable to stop or even slow the relentless momentum of self-serving capital accumulation, ever more powerful in its destruction of our environment. These bodies should now be granted similar rights to those exercised by boards. To do so, firm governments (that is, top management) could be required to obtain double majority approval, from chambers representing workers as well as shareholders. </p> <p>In Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, different forms of codetermination (<em>Mitbestimmung</em>) put in place progressively after the second world war were a crucial step toward giving a voice to workers \u2013 but they are still insufficient to create actual citizenship in firms. Even in the United States, where worker organising and union rights have been considerably suppressed, there is now a growing call to give labour investors the right to elect representatives with a supermajority within boards. Issues such as the choice of a CEO, setting major strategies and profit distribution are too important to be left to shareholders alone. A personal investment of labour; that is, of one\u2019s mind and body, one\u2019s health \u2013 one\u2019s very life \u2013 ought to come with the collective right to validate or veto these decisions.</p> <p>This crisis also shows that work must not be treated as a commodity, that market mechanisms alone cannot be left in charge of the choices that affect our communities most deeply. For years now, jobs and supplies in the health sector have been subject to the guiding principle of profitability; today, the pandemic is revealing the extent to which this principle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/us-insurance-companies-coronavirus-hospitals\">has led us astray</a>. Certain strategic and collective needs must simply be made immune to such considerations. The rising body count across the globe is a terrible reminder that some things must never be treated as commodities. Those who continue arguing to the contrary are imperilling us with their dangerous ideology. Profitability is an intolerable yardstick when it comes to our health and our life on this planet.</p> <p>Decommodifying work means preserving certain sectors from the laws of the so-called free market; it also means ensuring that all people have access to work and the dignity it brings. One way to do this is with the creation of a job guarantee. Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reminds us that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. A job guarantee would not only offer each person access to work that allows them to live with dignity, it would also provide a crucial boost to our collective capability to meet the many pressing social and environmental challenges we currently face. Guaranteed employment would allow governments, working through local communities, to provide dignified work while contributing to the immense effort of fighting environmental collapse. Across the globe, as unemployment skyrockets, job guarantee programs can play a crucial role in assuring the social, economic, and environmental stability of our democratic societies. </p> <p>The European Union must include such a project in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">green deal</a>. A review of the mission of the European Central Bank so that it could finance this program, which is necessary to our survival, would give it a legitimate place in the life of each and every citizen of the EU. A countercyclical solution to the explosive unemployment on the way, this program will prove a key contribution to the EU\u2019s prosperity.</p> <p> We should not react now with the same innocence as in 2008, when we responded to the economic crisis with an unconditional bailout that swelled public debt while demanding nothing in return. If our governments step in to save businesses in the current crisis, then businesses must step in as well, and meet the general basic conditions of democracy. In the name of the democratic societies they serve, and which constitute them, in the name of their responsibility to ensure our survival on this planet, our governments must make their aid to firms conditional on certain changes to their behaviours. In addition to hewing to strict environmental standards, firms must be required to fulfil certain conditions of democratic internal government. A successful transition from environmental destruction to environmental recovery and regeneration will be best led by democratically governed firms, in which the voices of those who invest their labor carry the same weight as those who invest their capital when it comes to strategic decisions. </p> <p>We have had more than enough time to see what happens when labor, the planet, and capital gains are placed in the balance under the current system: labor and the planet always lose. Thanks to <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es102641n\">research from the University of Cambridge</a>, we know that \u201cachievable design changes\u201d could reduce global energy consumption by 73%. But those changes are labor intensive, and require choices that are often costlier over the short term. So long as firms are run in ways that seek to maximise profit for their capital investors alone, and in a world where energy is cheap, why make these changes? Despite the challenges of this transition, certain socially minded or co-operatively run businesses \u2013 pursuing hybrid goals that take financial, social and environmental considerations into account, and developing democratic internal governments \u2013 have already shown the potential of such positive impact.</p> <p>Let us fool ourselves no longer: left to their own devices, most capital investors will not care for the dignity of labour investors, nor will they lead the fight against environmental catastrophe. Another option is available. Democratise firms; decommodify work; stop treating human beings as resources so that we can focus together on sustaining life on this planet.</p> <p>\u2022 Isabelle Ferreras (University of Louvain/FNRS-Harvard LWP), Julie Battilana (Harvard University), Dominique M\u00e9da (University of Paris Dauphine PLS), Julia Cag\u00e9 (Sciences Po-Paris), Lisa Herzog (University of Groningen), Sara Lafuente Hernandez (University of Brussels-ETUI), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore (Yale University), Pavlina Tcherneva (Bard College-Levy Institute), Miranda Richmont Mouillot, Israr Qureshi (Autralian National University), Clare Wright (La Trobe University), Isabelle Martin (University of Montr\u00e9al), Neera Chandhoke (Delhi University), Lukas Clark-Memler (University of Oxford), Alberto Alemanno (HEC Paris-NYU Law), Elizabeth Anderson (University of Michigan), Philippe Ask\u00e9nazy (CNRS-Paris School of Economics), Aur\u00e9lien Barrau (CNRS et Universit\u00e9 Grenoble-Alpes), Adelle Blackett (McGill University), Neil Brenner (Harvard University), Craig Calhoun (Arizona State University), Ha-Joon Chang (University of Cambridge), Erica Chenoweth (Harvard University), Joshua Cohen (Apple University, Berkeley, Boston Review), Christophe Dejours (CNAM), Olivier De Schutter (UCLouvain, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights), Nancy Fraser (The New School for Social Research, NYC), Archon Fung (Harvard University), Javati Ghosh (Jawaharlal Nehru University), Stephen Gliessman (UC Santa Cruz), Hans R.

After a few years of spreading its wings, creating an international arm to the business and beginning to chase down the Premier League\u2019s domination of global popularity, the Bundesliga now has at least a few weeks of a clear run at a hungry worldwide football audience.

  "<h2>What is it?</h2> <p>It is a workplace health and safety policy that sets out the dos and don\u2019ts of how to operate in the coronavirus-altered landscape. Employers have a duty of care to ensure a safe environment for their employees and, in this case, it means clubs carrying out risk assessments of their facilities, educating their players and staff members about them and therefore mitigating against them catching the virus or passing it on to somebody else. There has been a good deal of focus on how the players have been asked to sign the form as part of the league\u2019s return-to-train plan but it will be rolled out for everyone who goes back to the training grounds.

The clubs have then created a document bespoke to their own facilities because every training ground is different and so is every method of training.</p> <h2>Why has it become so controversial?</h2> <p>Some players have interpreted it as a sign-your-life-away waiver that could remove recourse to legal action in the event they catch the virus at work and their careers/future earnings are affected. Consequently, they have been wary of it and, in some cases, hesitant to sign. It was mentioned during Wednesday\u2019s conference call between the players and the league. Is it not simply a backside-covering exercise by the clubs and their regulatory body, the league?</p> <h2>What do the clubs say?</h2> <p>In a worst-case scenario, if a player caught the virus and tried to sue for negligence or breach of health and safety in the workplace, the clubs could make a number of arguments. They would have followed the advice of government, which has told people to go back to work, plus that of their regulatory body; they would have carried out risk assessments, put protocols and procedures in place, educated, got people to sign it off.

  "<p>A global pandemic calls for a global comic response. That\u2019s the rationale behind <a href=\"https://www.mickperrin.com/tours/comedywithoutborders/\">Comedy Without Borders</a>, last night\u2019s international comedy bill assembled by producers Mick Perrin Worldwide to raise money for the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The promise was \u201chilarious takes on the world as it turns upside down\u201d, delivered by quarantined standups from Iceland, Australia, India and beyond. OK, so we mustn\u2019t compare the death rate country by country, if our government is to be believed. But at least we can compare the jokes.</p> <p>Comedy Without Borders hung together best when it gave us the chance to do so. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/02/anuvab-pal-interview-the-empire-soho-theatre-india-identity-british-raj\">Anuvab Pal</a> explained how India has kept its Covid-19 stats low by simply refusing to test for the virus. Russia\u2019s Igor Meerson addressed the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/Russia-unleashed-500-lions/\">spectacular fake news</a> that Vladimir Putin released 500 lions on to Moscow\u2019s streets to keep the population homebound. London-based Italian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/08/never-mind-the-backstop-camden-comedy-club-brexit-standups\">Luca Cupani</a> pined for the pre-lockdown era (\u201cmost of all I miss \u2026 money\u201d) and boasted of Italy\u2019s macabre status as European champions of coronavirus. To which the obvious response was: not any more, mate \u2013 Covid\u2019s coming home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a7526be8901dc41d98ecd482283d57743b4aea0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7526be8901dc41d98ecd482283d57743b4aea0/0_0_5304_7870/674.jpg\" alt=\"Trump card \u2026 Schalk Bezuidenhoet.\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump card \u2026 Schalk Bezuidenhoet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Garrett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His set was evidently recorded some time before broadcast; none of the contributors \u2013 a little disappointingly \u2013 performed live. The exception was South African MC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/03/schalk-bezuidenhout-funniest-things\">Schalk Bezuidenhout</a>, the show\u2019s trump card. As many a recent livestream has proven, it\u2019s not easy performing comedy to a webcam and silence. Bezuidenhout brought energy and a healthy sense of absurdity to the task, gleefully exposing elephants in the room, segueing skilfully, keeping things brisk. But there could be no interplay with his guests\u2019 prerecorded routines, which were pitched less to a live audience than to the ether. Pal didn\u2019t make eye contact even with his webcam, delivering his set to a place slightly above my left shoulder.</p> <p>Though we got neither liveness, nor (with the above exceptions) many hot takes on coronavirus, Comedy Without Borders remained an entertaining portmanteau. While nine-tenths of the acts were straight standups, their styles varied so dramatically as to make the show feel like variety. We got Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.brodisnook.co.uk/\">Brodi Snook</a> (the sole female act) peddling cynical sex-and-relationship comedy. Sam Morrison of the US delivered a concentrated hit of bitchy with his five minutes on gay conversion therapy and fancying older men. Lugubrious Dave Hill \u2013 also American \u2013 pitched in, apropos of nothing, with his list of tortuous \u201cpick-up lines that only work in London\u201d.</p> <p>And it was fun, as ever, to see comedians wrestle with \u2013 and find ways to flout \u2013 the limitations of their new medium. Snook\u2019s set ended with a simple visual joke, breaking out of her webcam\u2019s frame. Pal foregrounded the discomfort of performing to nobody. (\u201cThere is a fine line between standup comedy and madness \u2013 and that line is an audience.\u201d) And Cupani ended his set with a slightly adjusted version of the standard sign-off: \u201cGuys you\u2019ve been lovely \u2013 so quiet \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The gig ended with guest star \u2013 and committed globalist \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/10/eddie-izzard-trying-to-get-mother-back-victoria-and-abdul\">Eddie Izzard</a>, whose performance <em>was</em> live but wasn\u2019t comedy. As at the Edinburgh fringe last year, I found myself wondering: why is Eddie Izzard rendering great chunks of Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations at me? Other viewers clearly felt the same: \u201c<em>Ou est le singe</em>?\u201d one commenter asked, nostalgic for Izzard\u2019s actual standup. \u201c<em>Dans l\u2019arbre</em>,\u201d another duly replied. But if his Dickens recital felt incongruous, he certainly performs it with passion and flair. And his backchat with Bezuidenhout pepped up the closing stages of this largely successful, globe-straddling standup bill.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNk2mMEBk3A\">Comedy Without Borders is available on YouTube</a>.</p>",
  "<p>More than 43 million people in west Africa are likely to be in urgent need of food assistance in the coming months \u2013 double the initial estimates \u2013 as the Covid-19 outbreak accelerates, the World Food Programme has said.</p> <p>Food insecurity could also double this year to affect 265 million people across the continent; west Africa, where the outbreak of the virus is most severe, is of increasing concern.</p> <p>The region faces the three-pronged threat of surging jihadi attacks across the Sahel and Lake Chad area, climate change harming vital food supply chains, and now the pandemic.</p> <p>The WFP had estimated a 70% rise in food insecurity to 21 million people in west Africa this year before the outbreak, but now anticipates a further 22 million becoming reliant on food aid by August, unless major steps are taken.</p> <p>\u201cEven before Covid we had a number of shocks which were affecting people,\u201d said Dr Chris Nikoi, the WFP\u2019s regional director for west and central Africa.</p> <p>\u201cFood flows were already not optimal because of conflict across west Africa,\u201d he said. Covid has exacerbated existing crises, presenting an immense challenge to food insecurity.</p> <p>With schools closed in most African countries due to containment measures, the World Health Organization also estimates that 65 million children are now having to do without a previously provided nutritious meal at school.</p> <p>Across the continent there have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections and 2,563 deaths. </p> <p>According to the WHO, cases in Africa have not been as high as in other parts of the world, in part due to early and aggressive measures adopted by African countries to stem the spread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e19a1c4d984f97e67bc0a972d2bb17a3f2da160\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e19a1c4d984f97e67bc0a972d2bb17a3f2da160/0_134_4208_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wears face masks in compliance with state rules in Ojodu-Berger, Lagos, Nigeria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear face masks in compliance with state rules in Ojodu-Berger, Lagos, Nigeria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pius Utomi Ekpei/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet infections have risen more sharply in the past week, and are already a significant challenge to health systems.</p> <p>The challenges are increasingly acute in a number of countries. After hundreds of deaths were linked to Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/11/we-depend-on-god-gravediggers-on-frontline-of-kanos-covid-19-outbreak\">in the northern Nigerian state of Kano</a>, similar reports proliferated elsewhere in the country, and health authorities are investigating outbreaks in seven other states.</p> <p>A combination of the deaths and low levels of testing has cast doubt on the capacity of health authorities to detect cases across the country.</p> <p>In Guinea-Bissau, a rise to 900 from 54 confirmed cases two weeks ago has left health services in the tiny west African country under strain, according to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.</p> <p>\u201cIn a small country like Guinea-Bissau \u2026 this dramatic increase shows that the virus continues to spread in communities and faster than we thought,\u201d said Monica Negrete, MSF\u2019s head of mission in the country.</p> <p>Unprecedented conflict in west Africa\u2019s Sahel and the north-east of Nigeria has displaced millions in recent months, adding to the challenge of containing the virus in those countries.</p> <p>About 4.5 million people are displaced in the Sahelian region covering Mali, Niger, Mauritiana, Chad and Burkina Faso. Of these, 838,000 have fled violence in the last year alone in Burkina Faso. Some 1.8 million people are displaced in north-east Nigeria.</p> <p>Measures to prevent the spread of the virus among displaced populations have been swiftly adopted, yet aid organisations say those measures have also increased hunger, as distributing support has become a greater challenge.</p> <p>African countries quickly adopted a range of aggressive measures that helped mitigate the spread of the virus. Lockdowns and travels bans were imposed when cases were few, yet many countries across Africa have begun relaxing lockdown measures while cases continue to accelerate.</p> <p>The economic pressures \u2013 particularly on the millions working in informal economies, earning daily wages \u2013 have diminished the capacity for governments to lock down cities without rapidly impoverishing large populations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/15/people-are-more-scared-of-hunger-coronavirus-is-just-one-more-threat-in-nigeria\">'People are more scared of hunger': coronavirus is just one more threat in Nigeria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGovernments are having to put in place certain measures, lockdowns, restricted movements etc, which are making an already bad situation in some areas, in some contexts, worse,\u201d Nikoi said.</p> <p>A competitive global market for test kits, favouring higher prices and bulk purchases, significantly disadvantaged many African countries, the ACDC has said. Yet the level of testing is gradually improving. About 1.2 million tests have now been administered, tripling in the last month, according to ADCD\u2019s director, Dr John Nkengasong,</p> <p>\u201cWe still have an issue of access to tests but the issue is going in the right direction,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ACDC and WHO are supporting Senegal, Morocco, Kenya and South Africa in creating locally made diagnostic tests, which are expected to be validated in the next few weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Under the cover of coronavirus, all kinds of wickedness are happening. Where you and I see a global health crisis, the world\u2019s leading authoritarians, fearmongers and populist strongmen have spotted an opportunity \u2013 and they are seizing it.</p> <p>Of course, neither left nor right has a monopoly on the truism that one should never let a good crisis go to waste. Plenty of progressives share that conviction, firm that the pandemic offers a rare chance to reset the way we organise our unequal societies, our clogged cities, our warped relationship to the natural world. But there are others \u2013 and they tend to be in power \u2013 who see this opening very differently. For them, the virus suddenly makes possible action that in normal times would exact a heavy cost. Now they can strike while the world looks the other way.</p> <p>For some, Covid-19 itself is the weapon of choice. Witness the emerging evidence that Bashar al-Assad in Damascus and Xi Jinping in Beijing are allowing the disease to wreak havoc among those groups whom the rulers have deemed to be unpersons, their lives unworthy of basic protection. Assad is deliberately leaving Syrians in opposition-held areas more vulnerable to the pandemic, according to <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/cross-border-aid-covid-19-and-us-decisions-syria\">Will Todman</a> of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. As he puts it: \u201cCovid-19 has provided Assad a new opportunity to instrumentalize suffering.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, China continues to hold 1 million Uighur Muslims in internment camps, where they contend now not only with inhuman conditions but also a coronavirus outbreak. Those camps are cramped, lack adequate sanitation and have poor medical facilities: the virus couldn\u2019t ask for a better breeding ground. What\u2019s more, Uighur Muslims are <a href=\"https://uighurtimes.com/index.php/in-a-dangerous-move-china-forces-30000-uighur-workers-to-return-to-work-in-hotan/\">reportedly being forced to work as labourers</a>, filling in for non-Muslims who are allowed to stay home and protect themselves. That, according to one observer, \u201c<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2020/04/23/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-uighur-muslims-an-ignored-crisis/\">is reflective</a> of how the [People\u2019s] Republic of China views [Uighur Muslims] as nothing but disposable commodities\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the pandemic has allowed would-be dictators an excuse to seize yet more power. Enter Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, whose response to coronavirus was immediate: he persuaded his pliant parliament to grant him the right to rule by decree. Orb\u00e1n said he needed emergency powers to fight the dreaded disease, but there is no time limit on them; they will remain his even once the threat has passed. They include the power to jail those who \u201cspread false information\u201d. Naturally, that\u2019s already led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/hungary-viktor-orban-coronavirus-laws-prompt-new-showdown-with-brussels\">crackdown on individuals </a>guilty of nothing more than posting criticism of the government on Facebook. Orb\u00e1n has long sought to rule Hungary as an autocrat, but the pandemic gave him his chance, allowing him to brand anyone standing in his way as unwilling to help the leader fight a mortal threat.</p> <p>Xi has not missed that same trick, using coronavirus to intensify his imposition of China\u2019s Orwellian \u201csocial credit\u201d system, whereby citizens are tracked, monitored and rated for their compliance. Now that system can include health and, thanks to the virus, much of the public ambivalence that previously existed towards it is likely to melt away. After all, runs the logic, good citizens are surely obliged to give up even more of their autonomy if it helps save lives.</p> <p>For many of the world\u2019s strongmen, though, coronavirus doesn\u2019t even need to be an excuse. Its chief value is the global distraction it has created, allowing unprincipled rulers to make mischief when natural critics at home and abroad are preoccupied with the urgent business of life and death.</p> <p>Donald Trump gets plenty of criticism for his botched handling of the virus, but while everyone is staring at the mayhem he\u2019s creating with one hand, the other is free to commit acts of vandalism that go all but undetected. This week the Guardian reported how the pandemic has not slowed the Trump administration\u2019s steady and deliberate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-environmental-blitzkrieg-coronavirus\">erosion of environmental protections</a>. During the lockdown, Trump has eased fuel-efficiency standards for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/31/trump-epa-obama-clean-car-rules-climate-change\">new cars</a>, frozen rules for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/14/trump-epa-soot-pollution-clean-air-standards\">soot air pollution</a>, continued to lease public property to oil and gas companies, and advanced a proposal on mercury pollution from power plants that could make that easier too. Oh, and he\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-trumps-epa-halts-environmental-law-enorcement-during-coronavirus-pandemic\">relaxed</a> reporting rules for polluters.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Brazilian mini-me, Jair Bolsonaro, has outstripped his mentor. Not content with mere changes to the rulebook, he\u2019s pushed aside the expert environmental agencies and sent in the military to \u201cprotect\u201d the Amazon rainforest. I say \u201cprotect\u201d because, as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/deforestation-amazon-has-soared-under-cover-coronavirus-n1204451\">NBC News reported this week</a>, satellite imagery shows \u201cdeforestation of the Amazon has soared under cover of the coronavirus\u201d. Destruction in April was up by 64% from the same month a year ago. The images reveal an area of land equivalent to 448 football fields, stripped bare of trees \u2013 this in the place that serves as the lungs of the earth. If the world were not consumed with fighting coronavirus, there would have been an outcry. Instead, and in our distraction, those trees have fallen without making a sound.</p> <p>Another Trump admirer, India\u2019s Narendra Modi, has seen the same opportunity identified by his fellow ultra-nationalists. Indian police have been using the lockdown to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34ad9282-74d7-4a85-a629-a9655339c366\">crack down on Muslim citizens</a> and their leaders \u201cindiscriminately\u201d, according to activists. Those arrested or detained struggle to get access to a lawyer, given the restrictions on movement. Modi calculates that majority opinion will back him, as rightist Hindu politicians brand the virus a \u201cMuslim disease\u201d and pro-Modi TV stations declare the nation to be facing a \u201ccorona jihad\u201d.</p> <p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who can claim to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/09/donald-trump-twin-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-white-house\">Trumpist before Trump</a> \u2013 has been handed a political lifeline by the virus, luring part of the main opposition party into a government of national unity that will keep him in power and, he hopes, out of the dock on corruption charges. His new coalition is committed to a programme that would see Israel annex major parts of the West Bank, permanently absorbing into itself territory that should belong to a future Palestinian state, with the process starting in early July. Now, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-there-will-be-lots-of-annexation-talk-from-netanyahu-but-no-action-1.8826440\">the smart money suggests we should be cautious</a>: that it suits Netanyahu to promise/threaten annexation more than it does for him to actually do it. Even so, in normal times the mere prospect of such an indefensible move would represent an epochal shift, high on the global diplomatic agenda. In these abnormal times, it barely makes the news.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, argues that many of the global bad guys are, in fact, \u201cdemonstrating their weakness rather than strength\u201d \u2013 that they are all too aware that if they fail to keep their citizens alive, their authority will be shot. He notes Vladimir Putin\u2019s forced postponement of the referendum that would have kept him in power in Russia at least until 2036. When that vote eventually comes, says Niblett, Putin will go into it diminished by his failure to smother the virus.</p> <p>Still, for now, the pandemic has been a boon to the world\u2019s authoritarians, tyrants and bigots. It has given them what they crave most: fear and the cover of darkness.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Maybe people will adjust to it, maybe a blitz spirit will kick in. You\u2019d have to test it, but it\u2019s going to be an expensive test.\u201d</p> <p>Penford is particularly worried that Nottingham\u2019s pantomime may not happen and the consequences of that. \u201cThe pantomime is incredibly popular with our audience and we are very proud of it. It makes a really generous surplus every year. It is a fundamental part of our business model and we use the money to fund the rest of the year in terms of new and riskier artistic work.\u201d</p> <p>One fear articulated by Penford and others is that after the lockdown, theatre may be more risk-averse. \u201cIt is a big worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to take a step back in terms of representation and access and championing emerging artists.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel Evans, artistic director of <a href=\"https://www.cft.org.uk/\">Chichester Festival Theatre</a>, said the situation for British theatre was one of \u201chigh jeopardy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Chichester is better placed than others for physically distanced audience experiments in that it has a huge 1,300-seat main theatre. \u201cSay we have 300-400 people in there and we could make some kind of production that wasn\u2019t too costly \u2026 we can imagine that happening as an interim measure.\u201d</p> <p>It is also examining using its lawn for physically distanced outdoor shows, and the car park as a drive-in cinema. \u201cAll these ideas are interim stuff, but I do think it would be helpful to try to test the waters to see what audience appetite is like, to see how audiences behave, but also to see if it is something we could develop until such time when we are back fully. And we will be back fully.\u201d</p> <p>Evans said physically distanced programming in the main theatre would begin with comedy, cabaret, spoken word and physical theatre, which often requires little in the way of set or design. Outside, he is thinking of events that might cheer people up, along the lines of songs from the shows, or a mass quiz.</p> <p>Beyond that, there could be monologues and duologues. Beckett plays in particular might lend themselves to the new environment. \u201cI was actually thinking of Happy Days [whose main character Winnie is buried to her waist in sand],\u201d said Evans. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty socially distanced.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2017/may/29/octagon-theatre-bolton-at-50-in-pictures\">Bolton\u2019s Octagon theatre</a> has a 400-seat auditorium, and having fewer people in would not work, said artistic director Lotte Wakeham. \u201cWe really do rely on audiences and people spending at the bar and using the cafe. That smaller audience model would be a real challenge.\u201d</p> <p>The Octagon was due to reopen in the summer after a \u00a312m refurbishment. That has now been delayed until at least October, blowing a \u00a3500,000 hole in its finances. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to look at a scenario in which we might not be able to open until 2021,\u201d said Wakeham. </p> <p>Most employees in theatres are furloughed, but most organisations are continuing their wider work in the communities that they serve.</p> <p>Brining said people were missing theatre. \u201cI phoned around some of the older people\u2019s groups, and it is really inspiring \u2026 They say, \u2018Coming to the playhouse is what keeps me going.\u2019 One lady said she\u2019s going to donate to us because she\u2019s not getting out now.

At the ECB\u2019s recent purchase rate, it will have exhausted the \u20ac750bn PEPP by end-September. Significant PEPP expansion could help allay market concerns for now, even if it isn\u2019t a lasting solution.</p> <p>Although we now expect a slower rebound [in eurozone growth in 2021], it is still very swift by historical standards.

But as lockdowns are eased, consumer spending could rise rapidly - provided the furloughing measures, fiscal cushions and central bank lending schemes work.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-asset-purchase-programme-boosts-euro\">ECB asset purchase programme boosts Euro</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ebe6e688f080d0eec42a6fb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:42:10.996Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Royal Mail shares jump 8% after it announces shock departure of boss Rico Back</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Investors have welcomed the news that Rico Back is no longer running Royal Mail, with shares up 8% this morning at 175p</strong>. </p> <p>The company said he was leaving immediately, less than two years after being appointed chief executive, as it announced a \u00a322m drop in revenues in April, mainly due to a sharp drop in letter volumes which were down by a third. </p> <p><strong>Russ Mould, AJ Bell\u2019s investment director, gives his take on the news:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The middle of a global crisis feels like an odd time to part ways with a CEO, particularly one who has been in post for as short a time as Royal Mail\u2019s Rico Back.</p> <p>With his P45 delivered, Back is being given more time to enjoy the Swiss penthouse from which he has reportedly been running the company.</p> <p>The best hint at the reasons behind his departure is the company\u2019s statement that interim executive chair Keith Williams will lead discussions on \u2018an accelerated pace of change across the business\u2019.</p> <p>Royal Mail\u2019s board will need to move fast to appoint a successor given the big challenges facing the business and the market will want to hear more as promised when full year results are posted on 25 June.</p> <p>The bonus to be paid to frontline staff and withdrawal of incentives for the executive team may go some way to mending fences with a disgruntled workforce.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read our full story here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/15/royal-mail-chief-rico-back-quits-with-immediate-effect\">Royal Mail chief quits with immediate effect</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ebe67ef8f08898ae6891204\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T10:10:07.700Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other UK companies at risk of falling into S&amp;P\u2019s \u201cfallen angel\u201d category (when a debt issuer\u2019s rating is cut to junk from investment grade) this year include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Next</strong></li> <li><strong>British Airways</strong></li> <li><strong>ITV</strong></li> <li><strong>Ashtead</strong></li> <li><strong>Kingfisher</strong></li> <li><strong>Virgin Money</strong></li> </ul> <p>Commenting on the trend globally, S&amp;P said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The financials sector led the additions to the potential fallen angels list [for 2020], highlighting the challenges the sector is facing. </p> <p>However, we see the highest downgrade potential in the lodging and leisure and auto sectors, which have the greatest number of potential fallen angels that have ratings on CreditWatch negative.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ebe62758f08898ae68911b7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-15T09:49:11.166Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">S&amp;P: companies at risk of 'fallen angel' status at record high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In other news, the number of companies or countries at risk of having their credit ratings cut to junk from investment grade has been pushed to a record high of 111 by the coronavirus pandemic, according to research by S&amp;P global ratings research.</p> <p>The number of so-called \u2018fallen angels\u2019 has so far this year reached 24, with more than $300bn in rated debt, S&amp;P estimates.

The revision to Q4 means that the economy entered a technical recession at the start of the year, and this <em>before</em> the incoming collapse in Q2 activity. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Q2 will be orders of magnitudes worse, though we suspect the German economy will continue to \u201coutperform\u201d its EZ peers. In addition, employment was hardly affected by the Covid-19 epidemic in Q1, <em>rising</em> by 0.3% year-over-year in Q1. This is consistent with the fact that the labour market is a lagging indicator.</p> <p>But it also reflects the fact that the jump in the use of the short-time work scheme, <em>Kurzarbeit</em>, means that workers remain employed, even if they are, strictly speaking, furloughed. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jack Allen-Reynolds</strong>, senior Europe economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The release] confirms that the government\u2019s less stringent virus containment measures mean that the economy is not faring as badly as the other major euro-zone countries. That said, the crisis is still taking a heavy toll. <br></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For comparison, the declines in GDP in France and Italy were much deeper, at 5.8% and 4.7% respectively. This will have been partly because strict social distancing measures were not introduced in Germany until 22nd March, compared to 10th March in Italy for example. But the lockdown was also less stringent, which allowed the construction sector, for example, to record an expansion of 1.8% m/m in March. That compares to a 40.2% m/m drop in construction in France.</p> <p>Further ahead, we have pencilled in a much bigger decline in German GDP in Q2 of about 10% q/q.

  "<p>Not long after launching in the UK, BuzzFeed co-founder Jonah Peretti wrote of his dream for the website, built on viral cat videos, to become the Time magazine for a \u201c<a href=\"https://medium.com/@peretti/is-history-repeating-itself-33390aeb6cd9\">new golden age of media</a>\u201d. Comparing BuzzFeed\u2019s trajectory with the iconic magazine of the 20th century, he wrote: \u201cIn our case, it only took a few years to go from summarizing web trends in our little Chinatown office to reporting from Syria and the Ukraine.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this week, BuzzFeed pulled the plug on its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/13/buzzfeed-pulls-plug-on-uk-and-australian-news-operations\">UK and Australian news operations</a>, effectively ending its global expansion plan.</p> <p>The first thing to say about this closure \u2013 leaving a few reporters to cover \u201cnews that hits big in the US\u201d \u2013 is that it is not a failure of BuzzFeed\u2019s journalism. In both places, tiny teams (cut to just four in Australia and 10 in the UK) punched well above their weight in covering underreported issues such as <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lesterfeder/lgbtq-rights-decade-in-review\">LGBT rights</a> and publishing scoops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/13/buzzfeed-pulls-plug-on-uk-and-australian-news-operations\">BuzzFeed pulls plug on UK and Australian news operations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The failure is one of a marketplace in which digital advertising has not been able to match the combination of cover price and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/26/uk-ad-market-booms-but-newspapers-lose-155m-in-print-advertising\">print ads</a> which supported Time magazine, as well as other newspapers, from the early years of the 20th century to the early years of this one.</p> <p>Without the baggage of printing presses and grey-haired readers, the retreat of BuzzFeed and other digital natives <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/media/quartz-to-lay-off-80-employees.html\">such as Quartz</a>, which on Thursday cut half its workforce, shows the extent of an industry car crash already piled high with newspaper closures and job losses. Even before Covid-19, it felt far from a new golden age for the media.</p> <p>BuzzFeed blamed \u201ceconomic and strategic reasons\u201d for its decision, and it is hard to predict which news organisations will survive what the company called this \u201cdifficult period\u201d. But it\u2019s not too early to think about what lessons could be learned from it.</p> <p>To start with the obvious, news does not make money. At the start of this year, in an exhortation to \u201cget after 2020,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/buzzfeed-in-2020\">Peretti wrote</a> about how news remained the only unprofitable BuzzFeed division. Yet in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/15/buzzfeed-jonah-peretti-facebook-ads\">interview in 2015</a>, that all seemed part of the plan: Peretti told me that news was the best way to move beyond clickbait. It drove readers to the site, but it cost more to produce and was shared less than any other content. What counted, he said, was \u201cimpact, not traffic\u201d. Getting laws changed and righting wrongs, in other words, rather than making money.</p> <p>Second, global as well as local news is under threat. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-towns-lose-local-newspapers-as-impact-of-coronavirus-deepens\">collapse of local newspapers</a> in both the UK and US is well documented, but BuzzFeed\u2019s decision to focus on serving its home market is a sign that, when the wolves are howling at the door, only those close to home get pulled inside. Foreign news outfits are particularly costly to run, no matter how attractive the size of the market. Losses in BuzzFeed\u2019s <a href=\"http://telecast.ca/2019/12/21/buzzfeeds-international-business-losses-quadruple/\">non-US business quadrupled</a> from \u00a31.9m to \u00a38.9m in 2018, the last date available.</p> <p>The company, which relied until 18 months ago on advertising alone, was nothing if not innovative \u2013 yet its struggles suggest that innovation counts for little in a market sewn up by two groups. Like many journalists, Peretti mistook the reach of his company\u2019s content rather than its financial firepower as a marker of its scale. In his grandiose 2014 memo to staff, Peretti wrote: \u201cBuzzFeed reaches \u2026 more people globally than the print circulation of all the biggest newspapers or magazines, and as we continue to expand internationally, the benefits of this scale will become even more dramatic. The golden age of media never saw numbers this big.\u201d</p> <p>Yet BuzzFeed never made a global profit despite this enormous audience. Even at its peak, with annual revenues of some $300m (\u00a3245m), it could never compete with the two companies which dominate the digital advertising market. Google and Facebook together accounted for $205bn of revenues in 2019. Buzzfeed tried many things to beat the so-called \u201cattribution problem\u201d in which Google and other platforms hoover up revenues from content they didn\u2019t create. But neither pivoting to video with shows for Facebook et al, nor <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90162560/buzzfeed-is-selling-home-goods-now-at-walmart\">selling kitchenware in Walmart</a> earned enough.</p> <p>I called Martin Sorrell, the veteran advertising executive who was once a huge fan of BuzzFeed, to ask what went wrong. \u201cBuzzFeed never got the scale [of Google or Facebook],\u201d he said. \u201cThe strong will just get stronger.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to finances, BuzzFeed \u2013 and indeed so much of the current carnage in the US media \u2013 proves that venture capitalists, or anyone out for a quick profit, make bad media owners.</p> <p>Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/buzzfeed-with-nearly-500m-in-funding-asks-for-contributions/\">raised hundreds of millions</a> from sexy venture capital firms with names like a16z \u2013 and there was even talk of a listing on the US stock market in 2018. But such investors like charts that shoot up at 45 degree angles. Once growth slows, so does their interest. Investment into digital media stuttered as early as 2014, according to <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vice-buzzfeed-become-latest-cautionary-tale-for-digital-media-investors\">Pitchbook data</a>. BuzzFeed started asking for voluntary contributions from readers in November 2018.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/07/mirror-and-express-owner-reports-30-slump-in-revenues\">Mirror and Express owner reports 30% slump in revenues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, and perhaps most worryingly, appealing to young people is not enough for news organisations. Not so long ago, a newspaper industry that worried about an average reader close to claiming free bus fares looked on in envy at sites like BuzzFeed, which trumpeted an audience largely made up of 18- to 34-year-olds. At one point, Google Analytics research suggested that half of that age group in the US visited Buzzfeed.com every month, catnip to those all-important digital advertisers.</p> <p>Yet once they realised these young readers pay less than their parents\u2019 annual subscriptions to the New York Times, advertising attention moved on, to sites like Snapchat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/22/tiktok-viral-stars-could-make-up-to-1m-per-post-say-researchers\">and now TikTok</a>.</p> <p>Few journalists will feel happy at the demise of digital news sites. But there is still hope that news and professionally curated information can survive.

A professor of infectious diseases, Garner was discussing the new coronavirus with David Nabarro, the UK\u2019s special envoy on the pandemic. At the end of the Zoom call, Nabarro advised Garner to go home immediately and to self-isolate. Garner did. He felt no more than a \u201clittle bit off\u201d.</p> <p>Days later, he found himself fighting a raging infection. It\u2019s one he likens to being \u201cabused by somebody\u201d or clubbed over the head with a cricket bat. \u201cThe symptoms were weird as hell,\u201d he says. They included loss of smell, heaviness, malaise, tight chest and racing heart. At one point Garner thought he was about to die. He tried to Google \u201cfulminating myocarditis\u201d but was too unwell to navigate the screen.</p> <p>Garner refers to himself wryly as a member of the \u201cBoris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-herd-immunity-yes-it-was-part-of-the-plan\">herd immunity</a> group\u201d. This is the cluster of patients who contracted Covid-19 in the 12 days before the UK finally locked down. He assumed his illness would swiftly pass. Instead it went on and on \u2013 a rollercoaster of ill health, extreme emotions and utter exhaustion, as he put it in a <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/05/05/paul-garner-people-who-have-a-more-protracted-illness-need-help-to-understand-and-cope-with-the-constantly-shifting-bizarre-symptoms/\">blog last week for the British Medical Journal</a>.</p> <p>There is growing evidence that the virus causes a far greater array of symptoms than was previously understood. And that its effects can be agonisingly prolonged: in Garner\u2019s case for more than seven weeks. The professor at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine says his experience of Covid-19 featured a new and disturbing symptom every day, akin to an \u201cadvent calendar\u201d.</p> <p>He had a muggy head, upset stomach, tinnitus, pins and needles, breathlessness, dizziness and arthritis in the hands. Each time Garner thought he was getting better the illness roared back. It was a sort of virus snakes and ladders. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply frustrating. A lot of people start doubting themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir partners wonder if there is something psychologically wrong with them.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50baa5c127d5342aa56203bb927b58409683dc4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50baa5c127d5342aa56203bb927b58409683dc4b/0_154_3824_2296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The C-19 symptom tracker app on a smartphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">About 3 to 4 million people are using the C-19 symptom tracker app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since his piece was published, Garner has received emails and tearful phone calls from grateful readers who thought they were going mad. \u201cI\u2019m a public health person,\u201d he says. \u201cThe virus is certainly causing lots of immunological changes in the body, lots of strange pathology that we don\u2019t yet understand. This is a novel disease. And an outrageous one. The textbooks haven\u2019t been written.\u201d</p> <p>According to the latest research, about one in 20 Covid patients experience long-term on-off symptoms. It\u2019s unclear whether long-term means two months, or three or longer. The best parallel is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/humanity-united-partner-zone/2019/dec/01/global-heating-driving-spread-dengue-fever-asia-americas\">dengue fever</a>, Garner suggests \u2013 a \u201cghastly\u201d viral infection of the lymph nodes which he also contracted. \u201cDengue comes and goes. It\u2019s like driving around with a handbrake on for six to nine months.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Tim Spector, of King\u2019s College London, estimates that a small but significant number of people are suffering from the \u201clong tail\u201d form of the virus. Spector is head of the research group at King\u2019s College London which has developed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/24/uk-app-aims-to-help-researchers-track-spread-of-coronavirus\">Covid-19 tracker app</a>. This allows anyone who suspects they have the disease to input their symptoms daily; some 3 to 4 million people are currently using it, mostly Britons and Americans.</p> <p>Spector estimates that about 200,000 of them are reporting symptoms which have lasted for the duration of the study, which is six weeks. There is good clinical data available for patients who end up in hospital. Thus far the government is not collecting information on those in the community with ostensibly \u201cmild\u201d but often debilitating symptoms \u2013 a larger group than those in critical care.</p> <p>\u201cThese people may be going back to work and not performing at the top of their game,\u201d Spector says. \u201cThere is a whole other side to the virus which has not had attention because of the idea that \u2018if you are not dead you are fine.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>He adds: \u201cWe are the country that invented epidemiology. We haven\u2019t produced any epidemiological studies other than the app. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201d</p> <p>As more information becomes available, the government\u2019s Covid model seems increasingly out of date. Many Covid patients do not develop a fever and cough. Instead they get muscle ache, a sore throat and headache. The app has tracked 15 different types of symptoms, together with a distinct pattern of \u201cwaxing and waning\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve studied 100 diseases. Covid is the strangest one I have seen in my medical career,\u201d Spector says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Scientific explanations for what is happening are still at an early stage. Lynne Turner-Stokes, professor of rehabilitation medicine at King\u2019s College, says Covid is a \u201cmulti-system disease\u201d which can potentially affect any organ. It causes microvascular problems and clots. Lungs, brain, skin, kidneys and the nervous system may be affected. Neurological symptoms can be mild (headache) or severe (confusion, delirium, coma).</p> <p>Turner-Stokes says it\u2019s uncertain why the illness is sometimes so protracted. One explanation is that the body\u2019s immune system goes into overdrive, with an ongoing reaction. Another is that the symptoms are virus-driven. Either way, she says there can be a \u201crecrudescence of symptomatology\u201d. Or, as she also puts it using more colloquial language, \u201cthe whole caboodle comes back\u201d.</p> <p>Researchers are now collaborating across borders. They are examining the latest data from European countries ahead of the UK in pandemic terms, such as Italy and Spain, as well as China. They are seeking to work out what support may be needed for severe and chronic patients, with Covid posing similar challenges to HIV/Aids a generation ago.</p> <p>Meanwhile Covid \u201clong-termers\u201d have been comparing notes via a Slack support group. It has #60plus-days and #30plus-days chat groups. The dominant feeling is relief that others are in the same grim situation, and that their health problems are not imaginary.</p>",
  "<p>State contracts worth over \u00a31bn have been awarded to private companies dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, without offering other firms the chance to bid for the work, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>In what amounts to a Covid-19 bonanza for some firms, ministers have suspended the standard rules to enable contracts to be issued \u201cwith extreme urgency\u201d.</p> <p>Under the fast-track rules, private firms have been handed direct contracts to administer Covid-19 tests, provide food parcels and personal protective equipment (PPE), and to run an operations room alongside civil servants.</p> <p>Among the firms benefiting from taxpayer-funded contracts under the emergency powers are the accountants Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst &amp; Young.</p> <p>Laws designed to ensure transparency and value for money in the way public funds are spent usually require government and other state bodies to advertise any new contract over a certain value, and invite several bidders to compete.</p> <p>However, in March, ministers told Whitehall departments, the NHS, local councils and other agencies that if they needed to act fast because of the public health risks posed by the pandemic, they could lawfully sign deals with private firms \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0120-responding-to-covid-19\">without competing or advertising the requirement</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Official data analysed by the Guardian shows state bodies have awarded at least 177 contracts worth \u00a31.1bn to commercial firms in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Of those, 115 contracts \u2013 with a total value of just over \u00a31bn \u2013 were awarded under the fast-track rules bypassing competitive tenders.

In Derry, a company that normally makes window blinds is being paid \u00a348m to make face shields for the health service in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>In order to produce 30m pieces of protective equipment, Bloc Blinds has formed a partnership with the Finnish packaging giant Huhtamaki, recruited hundreds of extra workers, repurposed its existing factory and turned a sports centre into a second workshop.</p> <p>Northern Ireland has spent more than \u00a3160m buying protective equipment for health and social care staff. A spokesperson for the Department of Health in Belfast said prices had been \u201cbenchmarked against other prices being offered in the marketplace\u201d.</p> <p>A Hertfordshire firm, Computacenter, has a \u00a360m contract for the education department to provide laptops to teachers and disadvantaged children during the lockdown. The education department has said there was not enough time to advertise and sift through competitive bids.</p> <p>The health department awarded a deal valued at \u00a38m to Amazon, which is helping deliver home test kits through the post. However, a spokesman for the US retail giant said it had waived any fee and was covering the costs itself.</p> <p>Smaller contracts have been given to private firms tasked with building mortuaries, developing the NHS contact-tracing app and housing the homeless. A cruise ship firm, Noble Caledonia, was paid \u00a31.5m to bring 118 people back from Antarctica without having to go through the Falkland Islands.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland, Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers were hired without competition to help set up an <a href=\"https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:197968-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML&amp;src=0\">operations room within the Executive Office</a> to manage the response to the pandemic.

In Paris, the mayor has allocated \u20ac300m for a network of cycle lanes, many of which will follow existing metro lines, to offer an alternative to public transport.</p> <p>In Bogot\u00e1, the Colombian capital, a 75-mile network of streets usually turned over to bicycles one day a week <a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/bogota-expands-bike-lanes-overnight-to-curb-coronavirus-spread-5127\">will now be traffic-free all week</a>, and a further 47 miles of bike lanes are being opened to reduce crowding on public transport and improve air quality.</p> <p>In the UK, the Scottish government has announced \u00a310m to create pop-up walking and cycling routes, and Manchester has unveiled plans to pedestrianise part of Deansgate in the city centre. </p> <p>But David Miller, from the C40 Cities Climate Leadership group, which has been coordinating much of the response, said Khan\u2019s plans stood out.</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations to \u2026 Khan for showing the world what is possible when we reimagine our cities for the benefit and health of everyone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese measures <a href=\"https://c40.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=529235039ea48b192727b37a9&amp;id=7dd3792851&amp;e=50c10b1cb5\">announced in London today</a>, including major car-free zones, will clean the air that Londoners breathe, improve public health both during the Covid-19 pandemic and long into the future, while also helping to avert the climate crisis. This is the future we want.\u201d</p> <p>Doug Parr, from Greenpeace, welcomed what he said was an \u201cambitious project\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNot only will transforming our streets in a way that prioritises pedestrians and cyclists, and makes it safer for people to move about as lockdown restrictions are eased, but by permanently restricting car use we can keep toxic pollution from filling our air once again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Theo Highland from Sustrans said the initiative was \u201ca potential game-changer\u201d in efforts to encourage walking and cycling. He called on boroughs across the capital to follow suit. \u201cAll boroughs must now make the changes our streets need to give Londoners space to move around safely and build our spirited city\u2019s resilience as we begin to bounce back from this pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Air pollution campaigners also welcomed the initiative. Jemima Hartshorn, founder of Mums for Lungs, said she was delighted. \u201cWe need pollution levels to stay reduced because pre-corona levels, caused primarily by traffic, stunt lung growth and are linked to many illnesses, from cancer to diabetes.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Almost 5m British households have signed up to streaming services since the coronavirus lockdown began, as the nation turns to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ to alleviate the impact of the restrictions.</p> <p>There have been an estimated 4.6m new signups to subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) offerings since much of normal British life ground to a halt in late March, according to research.</p> <p>The lockdown has provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/disney-netflix-rival-doubles-subscriptions-in-virus-lockdown\">the perfect launch conditions for Disney+</a>, which debuted in the UK on 24 March, a day after Boris Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home.</p> <p>Disney+, which launched with titles including the $100m (\u00a382m) live-action Star Wars series The Mandalorian, is estimated to have attracted 1.6 million subscribers in the UK in its first month. The research found that 85% of the Disney+ subscribers say they will keep using the service after the health crisis is over.</p> <p>\u201cWith a further 13% of people who have not yet tried Disney+ expressing an interest in trying it, the device could be well past 2 million subscribers in the near future,\u201d says the report by Oliver and Ohlbaum Associates.</p> <p>The survey found that a quarter of people were more willing to consider subscribing to a streaming service during lockdown than before the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe appetite for fresh entertainment during lockdown when content from traditional channels has been exhausted, along with increased demand for TV content at all times of the day, is contributing to consumers re-evaluating SVOD services,\u201d the report\u2019s authors conclude.</p> <p>Streaming services are also attractive in their low cost and flexibility. Subscribers get a one-month free trial and can cancel at any time, unlike most pay-TV packages with longer lock-in periods and much higher costs.</p> <p>\u201cThey provide a potentially cheaper option to traditional pay-TV, something consumers are likely to become increasingly attuned to in the medium to long term,\u201d the reports says.</p> <p>In the UK, Netflix is the market leader with 12.4m subscribers, according to the most recent figures from TV measurement body Barb. Amazon\u2019s Prime Video ranks second with just over 7 million subscribers.</p> <p>Netflix\u2019s first-quarter new global subscriber numbers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/21/netflix-new-subscribers-covid-19-lockdown\">more than double its forecast at 15.8 million</a> thanks to the global lockdown.</p> <p>Disney+ has attracted 50 million subscribers worldwide in six months, although many have it free for a year due to distribution deals with telecoms and TV partners. Nevertheless, it took Netflix seven years to reach the same milestone after moving from DVD rental by post to streaming in 2007.</p> <h2>Streaming in the UK</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"586d7e147c1fd8874196c94a97fbbd80ba27fb72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/586d7e147c1fd8874196c94a97fbbd80ba27fb72/0_8_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left, Netflix headquarters in Los Gatos, California; The Crown; Stranger Things; and Orange is the New Black.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Netflix HQ in Los Gatos, California; The Crown; Stranger Things; and Orange is the New Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Netflix</strong> (standard tier): \u00a38.99 a month<br><strong>Content</strong>: Stranger Things, The Crown</p> <p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong> (based on cheaper annual tariff): \u00a36.58 a month, or \u00a379 a year<br><strong>Content</strong>: Good Omens, Man in the High Castle, The Grand Tour</p> <p><strong>BBC TV licence</strong> (iPlayer): \u00a313.10 a month, or \u00a3157.50 a year<br><strong>Content</strong>: The Bodyguard, Line of Duty, Top Gear</p> <p><strong>Brit</strong><strong>Box</strong>: \u00a35.99 a month<br><strong>Content</strong>: Love Island, Gavin &amp; Stacey, Victoria</p> <p><strong>Disney+</strong>: \u00a35.99 a month, or \u00a359.99 a year<br><strong>Content</strong>: The Mandalorian, Loki, Star Wars, Avengers, Avatar</p> <p><strong>AppleTV+</strong>: \u00a34.99 a month<br><strong>Content</strong>: The Morning Show, shows from Oprah Winfrey, Stephen Spielberg</p>",

  "<p>Rain falls in the Almer\u00eda desert. A mummified hand gradually emerges from the sluiced sand. It appears to be giving a one-figured salute to the sky. It is the perfect opening image for Netflix\u2019s irreverent, brash, kinetic new 10-part crime drama-cum-caper.</p> <p>The desiccated corpse is identified as Axel Walker (Tom Rhys Harries), a young DJ who moved from Manchester to the Balearics 20 years ago with a group of friends trying to make their mark on Ibiza, and who subsequently disappeared without trace. The thriller unfolds on two timelines: the group\u2019s 90s glory days, when they ruled the clubbing roost in Manchester and their gradual comedown as they try to settle in Spain, and the present-day mystery of who killed Axel and why. In the absence of much police concern, his sister Zoe (Laura Haddock, the lead in recent BBC drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/03/the-capture-review-chillingly-real-thriller-or-utter-bobbins-lets-check-the-tape\">The Capture</a>) flies out to Nancy Drew it herself.</p> <p>Simply put, White Lines is a massive amount of fun.

Each one ratchets up the suspense (it emerges early on that Axel was involved with the daughter of the head of Ibiza\u2019s main crime family, the Calafats), the emotional investment (the effects of what Zoe thought was her brother\u2019s careless abandonment on her) or the gleeful absurdity. In the opening episode, Axel\u2019s former best friend, Marcus (Daniel Mays). can be found resuscitating a dog that has overdosed on the cocaine leaking from the inflatable banana boat he uses to haul his product in. There\u2019s plenty of sex, too, courtesy of Marcus\u2019s ex-wife Anna (Angela Griffin) who runs what the new girl guides are advised not to call orgies but do very much resemble, at least to the untutored eye, exactly that. They\u2019re especially popular with Oriol Calafat, the family\u2019s son and heir, as a way of relaxing in between trying to expand the family business beyond club-running and skimming drug money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"White Lines trailer\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uj7uyeaJjFQ?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the head of the family is busy commissioning his heavies to find out who killed Axel and buried him on Calafat land \u201cto fuck with me\u201d.

  "<p>Camels laze in the shade of 2,300-year old columns. Centre stage at the amphitheatre is temporarily reserved for goats. The noise of crowds in front of the treasury \u2013 the most recognisable and best preserved feature of the ancient city of Petra \u2013 has evaporated, and only birdsong intrudes on the silence.</p> <p>This is peak season of what was supposed to be a record year for tourism in Jordan\u2019s crown jewel, the Nabataean metropolis carved into kaleidoscopic rock. But the last tourists left the Middle Eastern kingdom on 17 March, just before it shut its borders because of coronavirus, and since then Petra and the surrounding towns have been deserted.</p> <p>\u201cWe just had our best year since the Arab spring, which affected us really badly,\u201d says Jihad Kaldany, a guide who specialises in taking Christian tourists through the country\u2019s Old Testament sites. Those visitors tended to be older people, the demographic most at risk of the virus. \u201cIf we knew it would be better in, say, two years, we could plan. But there is no assurance. Nobody knows.\u201d</p> <p>The site in southern Jordan is one of the centres of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">an unprecedented crisis</a> for the global tourism industry, with 120 million livelihoods under threat and no end in sight.</p> <p>But the empty streets, hotel rooms and restaurants in Wadi Musa, the town that serves as gateway to Petra, also illustrate the dire challenge facing middle and lower-income countries over the next years. Most, like Jordan, have so far avoided the worst of the virus. They will not be spared the economic blow, with countries that were banking on tourism and hospitality to be major engines of their growth projected to suffer most, according to <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020\">the International Monetary Fund</a>.</p> <p>Surviving for long stretches without rainfall was the test of Petra\u2019s original inhabitants. How to survive a year without tourists is the challenge facing its modern ones.</p> <p>\u201cIn a community like Wadi Musa, up to 80% of people rely on tourism as their source of income,\u201d says Suleiman Farajat, the chief commissioner of the Petra tourism authority.

But he needs to pay down his balance at a local market by the end of the month to keep buying groceries, and money is already running short. \u201cIf the situation continues like this, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Governments in developed countries are scrambling to weave again the safety nets some have spent the past four decades unpicking. The welfare system in Jordan is relatively advanced compared with many of its neighbours, but still has huge gaps.</p> <p>Fewer than half of Jordanian workers are registered with the country\u2019s social security system, which is already rationing its welfare payments. Without external aid, the fund could run dry within months.</p> <p>The rest of the country\u2019s workforce, including tens of thousands of migrant workers, have no safety net at all, and are totally exposed to the vagaries and predations of the market.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the everything we\u2019ve made in the past two months,\u201d Muadth gestures at the handful of bills in the cash register, at a convenience store a few metres from Petra\u2019s gates.</p> <p>The Yemeni, in sandals and a corduroy suit jacket, arrived in the tourist hub a year ago. Even in bad months, he says, he could send about 200 dinars home to his family in Sana\u2019a. \u201cNow, nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cMy younger brother sells water and the family lives off that.\u201d</p> <p>His debts include to a pastry shop owner who sponsored his working visa a year ago.

She said Labour thought it was a mistake to have stopped contact tracing in March, and said it supported moves to establish a \u201ccomprehensive strategy for contact tracing both through the use of a suitable mobile phone app and a manual tracing service\u201d. </p> \n<p>Separately, with teaching unions due to meet government scientific advisers to discuss the proposed return to school for some children, Lewis said he believed it was possible for young children to practise social distancing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think one of the things teachers are able to do, both in the classroom and outside the classroom, and all of us as parents and people in society, is to continue to educate each other around social distance,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. \u201cSo yes, even in a school environment I think it is important that we do what we can to encourage and explain and educate around social distancing.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the return to school was important \u201cnot just so that parents can get to work, but particularly [for those] age groups it is a really key time for children to be taking in that knowledge - and a few weeks out of school can make quite a big difference\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked on Sky News if he would be comfortable for his children to return to schools, Lewis said \u201cyes, absolutely\u201d, while adding that his children were no longer school age.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think I would be very comfortable with my children going back in a safe environment with social distancing, with schools able to advise children about all of those practical things we need to do in terms of staying alert \u2013 washing hands, practising social distancing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Lewis also insisted that using public transport was safe \u201cif we\u2019re practising proper social distancing\u201d, adding that he recognised that if everyone used public transport it would be a challenge. <br><br>\u201cThat is why we\u2019re so clear in saying to people we must follow social distancing to keep on top of this R level, that is why we\u2019re saying to people don\u2019t use public transport unless you absolutely have to,\u201d he told Sky News.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Lewis told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the government\u2019s guidance to care homes in March was \u201cclear\u201d, after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, showed evidence at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday that government advice at the start of the outbreak had said it was \u201cunlikely that people receiving care in care homes will become infected\u201d.</p> \n<p>Lewis said: \u201cFirst of all, I think it was disappointing to see Keir sort of quoting things out of context at PMQs and playing a bit of politics at a stage where I think people just want to see us focused on looking after people\u2019s healthcare.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer was quoting from government guidance published on 25 February, where the exact phrase was included as an explanation for why face masks were not generally required within care home settings.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had clear guidance that we were giving to care homes at that point in time at that early stage in March,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had very, very low levels of death and spread of the virus and we were giving guidance to care homes around isolation for those patients who required it in terms of having symptoms from the virus.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My son is dressed as a giant banana and he is throwing hamburgers at me. I am making my getaway on a solid gold quad bike. For once, neither of us has access to automatic weapons.</p> <p>No, our home schooling regime hasn\u2019t taken a dark turn. This is Party Royale, the brand new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\">Fortnite</a> mode, where deadly violence is banned and where the emphasis is on messing about and engaging in non-lethal competitions \u2013 but mostly messing about. It\u2019s only been live for a few days but already it feels like what the early-millennium online social experiment Second Life could have been if it had been built by game designers rather than Californian internet eggheads.</p> <p>Launched on 8 May with an in-game party featuring live performances by Steve Aoki and Deadmau5, Party Royale starts like any Fortnite: Battle Royale session \u2013 with dozens of online players landing on a remote island. However, instead of then running about searching for guns before shooting each other until only one remains, Party Royale players can do what they like. It\u2019s a smaller environment than the main game, but it still has rolling fields, meandering rivers and a little town crowded with fast-food joints. Vending machines distribute paint guns, plunger bows and other comedy projectiles with which to assault players, but no one gets hurt \u2013 you just get covered in glossy gloop or burger sauce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b25028976fae9b2c22d5df745f9c94ff2f07ebfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b25028976fae9b2c22d5df745f9c94ff2f07ebfa/78_0_2156_1294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Epically failing at a quad bike challenge in Fortnite Party Royale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Epically failing at a quad bike challenge in Fortnite Party Royale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fortnite</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dotted around the place, there are also lots of little challenges. Over here you can clamber onboard a speed boat and whiz through a series of markers to set the fastest time possible; over there you can jump through a time rift and then swoop through a series of aerial hoops \u2013 like the classic Nintendo game PilotWings. Each activity has a high-score table for players to aim at, so there is still a competitive element, but while we were playing no one seemed that serious about it, judging by the number of quad bikes and speed boats careering into the scenery.</p> <p>Epic Games says that it will hold regular live events and there is a dedicated concert area; once again this brings Second Life to mind. That vast online metaverse experiment, which launched to much fanfare and fascination in 2003, was billed as an explorative virtual social space with its own culture and economy \u2013 and over the next decade many music artists and theatre groups gave virtual performances within its ever-changing world. But the technological demands of the service, together with the impossibility of moderating such a huge space, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/second-life-plagued-security-flaws-ex-employee-says/\">led to problems and controversies</a> from cyber fraud to riots to flocks of flying penises.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hjWMSOmEew\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9hjWMSOmEew?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Second Life is still going, and there\u2019s a VR equivalent called Sansar, but it\u2019s a lot quieter now, and it\u2019s definitelt an adults-only space. Party Royale, where the visuals are bright and toy-like and most communication is through the medium of short dances such as the famed Floss and Electro Shuffle, feels much more like the Red Bull-guzzling little brother to Second Life. It\u2019s the virtual world as bouncy castle.</p> <p>Currently, all you can really do is pop in for an hour and race about the map with a few friends, firing each other out of the cannons on the pirate ship in Buccaneer Bay or throwing burgers at strangers from a speeding boat. But in the future, Epic clearly wants to run events and competitions, and this would be an amazing venue for film trailer premieres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86f3b0a6aa5f09ce25bae926073ff5dc380d221b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f3b0a6aa5f09ce25bae926073ff5dc380d221b/100_0_1993_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fortnite Party Royale is crammed with racing challenges, each offering a high score to beat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fortnite Party Royale is crammed with racing challenges, each offering a high score to beat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fortnite</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Players can\u2019t build in the mode right now, but that could change. Maybe Party Royale could be combined with Fortnite\u2019s creative mode, allowing players to construct their own buildings and racing challenges. There are currently phone booths around the map where you can change your outfits, but perhaps participants will one day be able to design and trade clothes, custom emotes or spray paint tags.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen something like this before, in the form of PlayStation Home, a gamified online multiplayer metaverse that arrived for the PlayStation 3, a year after its launch. For a few years, PlayStation owners could decorate their own virtual clubhouses, explore a virtual shopping mall and make real-life purchases from fashion brands and furniture companies. Millions of PS3 owners gave the service a try, but it <a href=\"https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2015/07/29/the-untold-story-of-playstation-home-sonys-most-successful-disaster\">never attracted</a> the player interest or commercial support it needed, and closed in 2015.</p> <p>But now, with 350 million players who are used to hanging out in a vibrant, ridiculous online world filled with dancing bananas and cartoon skirmishes, Party Royale could be the experience that finally realises the idea of a playful, mass participation online metaverse. Right now, with a whole generation of teenagers desperate to go <em>anywhere</em> where their parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t follow them, it\u2019s pretty much a godsend.</p>",

I have managed to write a whole new movie script in lockdown, which I\u2019m thrilled about.

  "<p>The British-born Zen master <a href=\"https://tricycle.org/magazine/houn-jiyu-kennet-roshi/\">Roshi Jiyu-Kennett</a> used to say that her philosophy, when it came to teaching students, wasn\u2019t to try to lighten the burdens they carried through life, but to make those burdens so heavy they\u2019d choose to put them down. I\u2019m no Zen master (I do have the requisite baldness; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m still working on the boundless equanimity). But I\u2019ve always loved that line, because it gets at something profound about the stressfulness of existence.</p> <p>To spell out what I take from it, which is something a Zen master would never do: most of us subliminally spend our days scrambling to get to a point where we feel like life\u2019s finally in working order, and everything\u2019s under control \u2013 which for you might mean total financial security, becoming the perfect parent, leaving your childhood traumas entirely behind, or anything else.</p> <p>The \u201cburden-lightening\u201d approach, as preached in a thousand self-help books, involves somehow actually reaching that place of safety. The burden-increasing approach, by contrast, involves pointing out that the goal was impossible all along. And when you grasp that you were chasing a mirage, you\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.lionsroar.com/you-dont-have-to-know-tales-of-trauma-and-transformation-march-2013/\">disinclined</a> to keep chasing.

Though perhaps slightly easier than usual right now, at a time when all sorts of things we tend to tell ourselves we need to do \u2013 to be happy, or secure, or to justify our existence \u2013 have been rather obviously impossible to do. You just <em>can\u2019t</em> do a full-time job at full throttle while caring for small children; you <em>can\u2019t </em>be absolutely certain your relatives are safe from the pandemic; you <em>can\u2019t </em>guarantee your family won\u2019t feel the shocks of economic meltdown. Etcetera. </p> <p>Of course, realising this doesn\u2019t magically make it fine to be overstretched, sick or struggling financially. But it triggers a kind of inner liberation. You\u2019re still in a bad fix, but you\u2019re no longer staking everything on achieving an impossible kind of escape from it. Moreover, the result of this shift isn\u2019t that you become passively resigned to your fate. Instead, you\u2019re more motivated to take whatever useful actions you can.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/08/how-to-have-fun-during-lockdown-oliver-burkeman\">How to have fun during lockdown | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, I\u2019ve noticed that I read the news with a similar subconscious yearning for something impossible: deep down, I think I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll find some confirmation, somewhere among the headlines, that everything will eventually be OK with the world.

  "<p>My friend and colleague Roger Bowers, who has died aged 77, was influential in English language teaching (ELT) over five decades and a key figure at the British Council for many years.</p> <p>Roger was born in south London, the son of George Bowers, an accountant, and his wife, Hilda (nee Wells). He attended the Royal grammar school in Guildford, then studied classics at Wadham College, Oxford.</p> <p>On graduating in 1964, he joined the British Council, and was posted in 1965 to Ghana, where he lived with his first wife, Gwen (nee Pith), and where their children, Mark and Alison, were born. He later led projects in India and Egypt, and in 1985 became director of the British Council\u2019s English language division.</p> <p>Roger completed his PhD on classroom talk at the University of Reading in 1980, and subsequently combined the roles of academic and education manager. His research was the basis for a series of publications and editing roles, such as the ELT Docs series. He was seconded by the British Council to Birmingham University in 1965, where he was a tutor to international students, and was a visiting professor at Ain Shams University, Cairo, from 1980 to 1984.</p> <p>At the end of the cold war in 1989, Roger was a key figure in the UK government\u2019s response, setting up initiatives to develop English teaching in eastern and central Europe, where English was quickly replacing Russian as first foreign language in schools. In 1992, he became assistant director-general of the British Council, overseeing restructuring and expansion as the organisation became more commercial and enterprise oriented.</p> <p>In 1998 he became CEO of the Trinity College London (TCL) Examinations Board on English language testing. He retired in 2006, and in 2007, after 10 years of work as a trustee, became chair of the Hornby Trust, an English language education charity. He helped to expand the charity, creating grants to language education projects in the global south.</p> <p>Roger and Gwen divorced in 1989. In 2009 he married his long-term partner, Jenny Pugsley, who was also a colleague at the British Council. They were great hosts, welcoming many to their home in London, and in Macclesfield, when the British Council moved him to Manchester, or at the farmhouse they were restoring in France. Roger loved cooking, was a keen angler and, as a linguist, had an enduring curiosity about words.</p> <p>Roger was made OBE in 1984 and CMG in 1997. He is survived by Jenny, by Mark and Alison, and by his four grandchildren, Ellie, Holly, Hazel and Pippa.<br></p>",

  "<p>Even now, I\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t bring herself to say: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election \u2026 \u201d Because, to me, she <em>did </em>win. She received nearly 2.9m more votes than Donald Trump, but of course Trump received more electoral votes. So instead I say: \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had become president\u201d or \u201cIf the outcome of the 2016 election had been different \u2026 \u201d Finishing the sentence requires less finessing on my part; it is perfectly clear: \u201c\u2026 I would not have written a Hillary novel.\u201d</p> <p>If Hillary had become president, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to. Instead of watching in real time as our country becomes a more racist, sexist, xenophobic and homophobic place, Americans would have had a leader committed not just to equality among people but also to addressing climate change, gun law reform and healthcare. And it seems equally unprovable and indisputable that her response to a global pandemic would have been vastly different \u2013 science-based, measured, compassionate.</p> <p>But instead we live in this world, not that one, and, for my own sake, I did need to write a novel in which the 2016 US presidential election unfolded differently. I\u2019m 44, and it was only a few years ago, after well over three decades of writing fiction, that I realised I have devoted much of my life to this creative act for two reasons above all: to entertain myself and to soothe myself. Writing <em>Rodham</em> was definitely an example of the latter. Plus, it tapped into my fascination with politics, fame, and the discrepancy between our public and private selves \u2013 all themes I first explored in my 2008 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, which was a fictionalised retelling of the life of Laura Bush.</p> <p>But where <em>American Wife</em> mostly embellishes the real or historical timeline, <em>Rodham</em> creates a parallel universe. What I didn\u2019t know when I embarked on writing in March 2017 was how much I\u2019d teach myself \u2013 or perhaps I should say how much Hillary would teach me. These are some of the lessons I learned:</p> <p><strong>Multi-decade rumour mill notwithstanding, it\u2019s hard to find examples of things Hillary has done wrong.<br></strong>The false accusations levelled at her range from murky acts of financial malfeasance, to bonkers conspiracy theories about paedophilia, to persistent suggestions that she mishandled email when she was secretary of state. On close examination, what\u2019s striking about these supposed scandals is that they either have no relationship to reality or she\u2019s being accused of something that I (and admittedly I\u2019m not a lawyer) would not at first glance understand to be inappropriate, let alone illegal. After reading multiple accounts of the controversy around \u201cWhitewater\u201d, Bill and Hillary\u2019s late 1970s real estate investment, I still would struggle to cogently summarise the sequence of events to another human. This murkiness contrasts with the events that currently unfold on a weekly basis in the White House \u2013 consider the New York Times headline on 21 April \u201cTrump (the Company) Asks Trump (the Administration) for Hotel Relief<em>\u201d </em>\u2013 that prompt me to sincerely wonder, how can this <em>possibly</em> be legal?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94d359c32312a5da17c7812f63f0a30f612bb1cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94d359c32312a5da17c7812f63f0a30f612bb1cc/0_61_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Clintons campaigning with Al and Tipper Gore, in Michigan, 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clintons campaigning with Al and Tipper Gore, in Michigan, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dirck Halstead/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t see Hillary as saintly, but the two damning titbits that emerged about her in my research that have stayed with me are actually absurdly insignificant. The first is that, according to biographer Carl Bernstein, in 1993 the Clintons travelled together to St Louis, Missouri. Hillary told an aide to leave Bill\u2019s briefcase aboard Air Force One, but when Bill later asked for it, Hillary supposedly told him: \u201cYour staff always does that ... They don\u2019t serve you well.\u201d This is not, I\u2019d venture to say, grounds for locking her up. Nor is the other scrap of scandal: New York Times reporter Amy Chozick, who covered the 2016 campaign, describes in her book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/12/chasing-hillary-by-amy-chozick-review\">Chasing Hillary</a></em> how, at events, members of Hillary\u2019s staff sometimes confiscated supporters\u2019 homemade signs and instructed them to hold up mass-produced campaign signs instead. Then again, given the ease with which one can find photos that show supporters holding homemade placards and flags, this practice doesn\u2019t seem to have been widespread \u2013 and in any event, it\u2019s safe to assume it wasn\u2019t Hillary herself doing the confiscating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many see Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic \u2013 little attention is given to the possibility she\u2019s neither</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The disparity between the vitriolic criticism Hillary has faced and who she actually is seems to be so great that it reminds me of that optical illusion \u2013 itself a sexist binary \u2013 where from one angle the image looks like a beautiful young woman and from another angle like a hag. Many Americans perceive Hillary as either irredeemably corrupt or heroic, with little apparent attention given to the possibility that she\u2019s neither. Sometimes while writing, I thought that if, in a parallel universe, I ended up sitting next to her at a dinner party and she were exactly the same person but instead of going into politics was a university president or corporate executive, I would be dazzled by her. \u201cThat woman is so smart<em>,\u201d</em> I\u2019d think. \u201cShe\u2019s so tough and interesting and impressive<em>.\u201d</em><br><br><strong>If Bill Clinton had wanted to marry me in 1975, I\u2019d have accepted.<br></strong>When I decided that the premise of my novel would be \u201cWhat if Hillary hadn\u2019t married Bill?\u201d, it wasn\u2019t because I find Bill loathsome. I do find him very flawed \u2013 some of his behaviour has been disturbing at best \u2013 but my main goal was to examine chance, fate, free will and the notion of parallel universes or other, unlived lives. As Hillary has mentioned publicly more than once, in the early 1970s, she was initially reluctant to accept Bill\u2019s marriage proposals. Indeed, as an epigraph for <em>Rodham</em>, I chose these lines from her 2017 memoir <em>What Happened</em>: \u201cMy marriage to Bill Clinton was the most consequential decision of my life. I said no the first two times he asked me. But the third time, I said yes. And I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if Hillary hadn\u2019t married Bill she\u2019d be president today</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It seems facile and preposterous to claim that if only she hadn\u2019t married him, she\u2019d be president today. On the one hand, if almost anything in 2016 had happened differently, that seems a likely outcome, but on the other hand, who knows? And while I used this particular marital departure from reality for fiction, Bill\u2019s charms aren\u2019t lost on me. In fact, in June 2017, I tweeted a picture of his almost thousand-page memoir along with the comment: \u201cVERY unexpected outcome of writing my Hillary novel \u2013 I myself am now in grave danger of falling in love with Bill<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>In his autobiography <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/27/biography.politicalbooks1\">My Life</a></em>, Bill is a funny, self-deprecating raconteur with an excellent eye for colourful details (especially of the southern fried variety) and an apparent fondness for almost everyone he has ever met. Plus, the photos of him and Hillary from back then, along with the ones in her memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">Living History</a></em>, are downright swoony. Though the couple are far less polished-looking than now, she\u2019s pretty and he\u2019s dashing, and in pictures from their wedding, they gaze at each other with adoring intensity. In the present day, it\u2019s never a foregone conclusion that an ambitious man will be smitten with an ambitious woman; 50 years ago, it was all the more notable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c09e9b17bdce2df03c23ebed141607ed43d80d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c09e9b17bdce2df03c23ebed141607ed43d80d48/0_10_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adoring intensity \u2026 Hillary and Bill Clinton on their wedding day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downright swoony \u2026 Hillary and Bill Clinton on their wedding day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And though I\u2019ve never met either Clinton, his in-person charisma is legendary. In fact, in response to my tweet about Bill, one of my Twitter followers shared that someone she knew had seen him in a London department store shortly after the news of his affair with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/monica-lewinsky\">Monica Lewinsky</a> had emerged. The woman approached, planning to tell him he was a national embarrassment. Instead, as they shook hands, she exclaimed, \u201cI love you!\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Clintons just might have a good marriage.</strong><br>In late January 1992, when Bill\u2019s first presidential campaign hung in the balance due to the cabaret singer Gennifer Flowers\u2019s recent allegation that she\u2019d had a 12-year affair with him, he and Hillary sat for a joint interview with the news show <em>60 Minutes</em>. \u201cI think most Americans would agree that it\u2019s very admirable that you\u2019ve stayed together,\u201d said the journalist Steve Kroft. \u201cThat you\u2019ve worked your problems out and that you\u2019ve seemed to reach some sort of understanding and arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>Kroft and the Clintons were in a hotel suite in New Hampshire, the Clintons on a loveseat across from their interlocutor, and Bill quickly responded: \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You\u2019re looking at two people who love each other. This is not an arrangement or an understanding. This is a marriage. That\u2019s a very different thing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think Hillary will read the book, and if she does, she won't like it \u2013 it\u2019s not a straightforward love letter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When this interview aired, I watched it in my boarding school dorm; I was 16 and had never had a boyfriend. I\u2019ve now been married for 12 years, and the pertinent question doesn\u2019t seem to be, is the Clintons\u2019 marriage an arrangement? The question is, what marriage isn\u2019t?</p> <p>Yes, I understand that Kroft was essentially saying: \u201cDo you not love each other but stay together anyway because of your shared ambition?\u201d But this question itself seems simplistic, a pretence that the default mode of marriage is happily ever after. I don\u2019t know any couple for whom it\u2019s this easy.</p> <p>I believe that the Clintons genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company, are genuinely interested in each other\u2019s opinions, have considered divorce and made the choice not to pursue it. At the risk of sounding cynical, it\u2019s possible such a dynamic is about the best any of us can hope for. I sometimes think about how their marriage outlasted that of Bill\u2019s vice-president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/al-tipper-gore\">Al Gore</a>, and his former wife Tipper. Little information was public about the Gores\u2019 marriage, whereas I know as much about the Clintons\u2019 marriage as I do about my own. Or maybe \u2013 bear with me here \u2013 I don\u2019t. Maybe <em>every</em> marriage is unknowable except to the people inside it.<br><br><strong>In the United States, it\u2019s rare to hear the unfiltered voices of female politicians.<br></strong>More than a year after it had aired, I learned about the existence of a 2016 campaign podcast created by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/clinton-foundation-bill-hillary-us-election-state-department\">Clinton Foundation</a>. Called <em>With Her</em>, it was hosted by a quintessentially podcasty guy named Max Linsky \u2013 a smart, casual Brooklyn-based white man \u2013 and featured interviews with Hillary, Bill, Chelsea, vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine, and assorted campaign staff members.</p> <p>From the first seconds of listening to it, I was aware of something weird and unfamiliar in its tone, though it took a few minutes to pinpoint what: Hillary was not being addressed with reflexive scepticism and cynicism, and she therefore did not need to respond defensively. The assumption was not that she was a power-hungry Machiavellian. The assumption was that she was a likable hard worker who cares about the American people. Even more disorienting: the person giving her the benefit of the doubt was male.</p> <p>As research, I read many articles and watched many news segments from the autumn of 2016, before the election, and there is a weary undertone to almost all of them, a kind of irritation that Hillary will be the first female president when she\u2019s so, you know, polarising and baggage-laden. Her victory is both foregone and irksome. This undertone would seem laughably wide of the mark were it not for the fact that so many Americans have paid such a high price for the ignorance.</p> <p>Also as research, I listened to audiobooks by all the female senators running for president in 2020: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kirsten-gillibrand\">Kirsten Gillibrand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>. They narrate their own books, and, once again, to listen to their literal voices was to feel a heartening disorientation. They got to speak for as long as they wanted without interruption, tell their own stories, and present themselves, instead of being presented through the lens of America\u2019s profound ambivalence about, or outright aversion to, women in power. Of course I understand that these kinds of books are a form of campaigning, but I\u2019m not convinced that being in charge of the way you are portrayed makes your portrayal inherently false.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18c33a9dd1aa3a591f7b32853b2f0f4ac38fa650\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18c33a9dd1aa3a591f7b32853b2f0f4ac38fa650/66_437_1222_733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curtis Sittenfeld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis Sittenfeld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Sittenfeld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Based on my remarks here, a person could be forgiven for thinking I wrote <em>Rodham</em> because I\u2019m such an ardent fan of Hillary. This isn\u2019t quite right. I am a fan of Hillary, but, to answer a question I\u2019ve already been asked many times, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll read the book, and if she does, I don\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019ll like it. It\u2019s not a straightforward love letter. The character I\u2019ve created makes personal and professional tradeoffs. She\u2019s not perfect, and the character of Bill is (spoiler alert) even less so. Also, the sex scenes are way too detailed.</p> <p>I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s less that my novel grew out of my admiration for Hillary and more that my admiration grew out of my research about her. For my entire adulthood, she has been not merely a public figure but a cultural touchstone. Many Americans still say they don\u2019t know her, yet she\u2019s shown us over and over who she is: how strong and capable, how caring and complicated. We just have to choose to see her.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Rodham is published by Doubleday in July and as an audiobook on 19 May.

His $6.5m municipal budget is almost entirely dependent on tourism.</p> <p>\u201cSome say it\u2019s too soon, especially those residents that are very concerned about our vulnerable populations,\u201d said Mayor Emily Niehaus of Moab, Utah. Her town is located near Arches and Canyonlands national parks. \u201cOthers are saying not soon enough. But we need a target date.\u201d Niehaus has expressed support for the<strong> </strong>safe reopening of the parks \u2013 meaning, for instance, that visitors will have to follow physical distancing guidelines \u2013 at the end of May.</p> <p>\u201cThe gateway communities have to understand the numbers [of coronavirus infections] are going to go up,\u201d the Yellowstone park superintendent, Cameron Sholly, <a href=\"https://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/recreation/plan-for-reopening-yellowstone-coming-soon-superintendent-hints/article_97addd22-a3f7-5d6e-9574-6fef676ae2bc.html\">told</a> the Billings Gazette, acknowledging the potential spread of Covid-19 in communities adjacent to parks.</p> <p>There has been no word on whether parks have enough protective equipment, and they are not looking into strategies such as timed entry, said Kristen Brengel, a senior vice-president at the National Parks Conservation Association. \u201cAt parks like Zion, where you already had a lot of overcrowding, this could occur quite quickly.\u201d</p> <p>In an email, the park service said it is \u201cworking service-wide with federal, state, and local public health authorities to closely monitor the Covid-19 pandemic and using a phased approach to increase access on a park-by-park basis\u201d.</p> <p>Alan Morgan, chief executive officer at the National Rural Health Association, had a bracing prognosis for the communities located near national parks.</p> <p>\u201cThe story of Covid-19 now shifts to rural America.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2020.

  "<p>The relaunch of Scooby-Doo, a character born in the late 60s and sustaining a presence in the decades ever since, carries with it the potential for both high highs and low lows. Because universal familiarity and affection among parents might make it a swifter rental decision but the weight of expectation and of childhood association will mean that casual, uninvested background watching won\u2019t suffice. Which is where the problem with Warner\u2019s early summer franchise-relauncher Scoob lies. While a younger audience might be enthralled by the fast pace and bright colour palette, those understandably curious adults sitting nearby will find themselves watching in horror, a deep, sorrowful howl emerging.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/20/the-willoughbys-review-netflix-animated-movie\">The Willoughbys review \u2013 imaginative animated Netflix adventure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Originally intended for a theatrical release, the studio decided to demote their animated adventure (the first big-budget Scooby-Doo film since 2004) to the home cinema, a wise sacrifice given a captive family audience thirsty for new content as shown by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/02/studios-bypass-cinemas-with-lucrative-streaming-premieres-the-end\">controversial success of last month\u2019s Trolls: World Tour</a>. Scoob has a steeper hill to climb though, without the inbuilt younger fandom of Universal\u2019s sequel, so it\u2019s important to woo an older crowd and so while longtime animation director Tony Cervone might be at the helm, the script includes input by comedy writer Adam Sztykiel, whose previous projects have been aimed at adult viewers. The end result, trying to appeal to both ends of the spectrum, can\u2019t quite master something that say, Pixar, manages with ease. It\u2019s uncomfortably strained with laboured winks scattered among the sub-par slapstick action, a dog\u2019s dinner of a movie best enjoyed by those with no knowledge of who or what Scooby-Doo used to be.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzlEnS7MmUo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GzlEnS7MmUo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But even then, Scoob stumbles because so much of the plot plays off an assumed knowledge of the history of these characters and their dynamic, hoping that we fill in the many gaps it can\u2019t fill itself. It starts promisingly, with a neat meet-cute as we learn how a young Shaggy befriends a stray dog he calls Scooby-Doo. On one Halloween night, the pair then end up meeting three friends, Fred, Daphne and Velma, who help them bring a thieving local in a ghost mask to justice. It\u2019s a charming throwback and so it\u2019s then frustrating that we\u2019re dragged into the future via lazy mystery-solving montage as the gang find their business underfunded leading to a bizarre and dated cameo from Simon Cowell, playing himself as a potential investor. He bitchily recommends dropping Shaggy and Scooby from the Mystery Inc banner and so the group splits, a befuddling inciting incident that\u2019s indicative of a confused and confusing plot to come.</p> <p>The ensuing mess of events continues to take us further away from the ingredients that made the original show and its many iterations so well-loved by so many, replacing a goofy small-town mystery with a blockbuster-level global quest. In trying to update the formula, the film\u2019s four writers have expanded the focus too wide, flattening out the distinctively <em>shaggy</em> mystery elements and turning it into just another soulless kids movie. The tiresome insertion of a superhero narrative feels patronising, as if a younger audience can\u2019t be trusted without it, and transforming kitschy Wacky Races bad guy Dick Dastardly into a slick, all-powerful supervillain is both boring and a predictable sign that a Hanna-Barbera cinematic universe is upon us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e96eac969fe2a9577b8becb4dc00fe8bc82305e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e96eac969fe2a9577b8becb4dc00fe8bc82305e/0_0_2864_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s something too <em>big</em> about the plot, making it feel more like the third or fourth instalment in a franchise, rather than the more modest scene-setter it needed to be. We get so little time with the group as a whole and have such little understanding of what it is they actually do that suddenly throwing them into jeopardy doesn\u2019t have much of an effect, especially when it\u2019s on such a large scale. It doesn\u2019t help that the garish animation looks more suited to a mobile game than a studio movie, passable in the bigger action sequences but hideous when trying to portray human features. There\u2019s a stacked voice cast \u2013 including Zac Efron, Mark Wahlberg, Gina Rodriguez and Amanda Seyfried \u2013 and while Will Forte nails his Shaggy impression, the others are hard to distinguish, struggling to add life to a script that relies on clunky pop culture references (most of which conveniently nod to other Warner properties).</p> <p>At one point in Scoob, Fred insists that this is their \u201cmost important mystery ever\u201d rather than being \u201cabout some guy in a rubber mask\u201d, an annoyingly smug attempt to elevate this above the many entertainingly dopey adventures we\u2019ve seen them on before.

Wind shifts their direction, with swarms of 40 million travelling <a href=\"https://africanbusinessmagazine.com/region/east-africa/kenyan-agribusiness-fears-the-worst-from-locust-invasion/\">up to 150km</a> and eating 80 tonnes of vegetation daily.</p> \n<p>Ambrose Ng\u2019etich, who is managing FAO control operations for the vast areas of Samburu, Isiolo, Laikipia and Meru, has his work cut out.

The shortfall will be hard to find amid the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, pastoralists such as Moses Lomooria, 34, from Isiolo county, are bracing for new enemies. Drought and disease are familiar, he says, and are slowly diminishing his herds. \u201cThis is just an additional burden.

It is clear that criminals on some sporting estates, both in the uplands and lowlands, have used the wider closure of the countryside as an opportunity to ramp up their efforts to kill birds of prey.</p> <p>\u201cSpring is the time when birds of prey are most visible and therefore vulnerable, as they put on courtship displays, build nests and find food ready to breed. The criminal actions are targeted and malicious in nature, taking out birds before they have the opportunity to breed, often in areas where they have previously faced persecution.\u201d</p> <p>Supt Nick Lyall, the head of <a href=\"https://www.nwcu.police.uk/raptor-persecution-priority-delivery-group/\">a national police and policy group tasked with tackling raptor persecution</a>, said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the number of cases in recent weeks.</p> <p>\u201cLockdown has been seen as a green light by those involved in raptor persecution offences to continue committing crimes, presumably in the belief that there are fewer people around to catch them doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cI remain grateful to everyone involved in investigating these crimes, and thankfully in the vast majority of the cases I am aware of, it looks like some really good lines of inquiry are taking place which should lead to arrests and interviews.\u201d</p> <p>Amanda Anderson, director of the Moorland Association, said: \u201cAny confirmed reports of raptor persecution are cause for concern. The incidents specified near Leeds and York ... [by the RSPB] are clearly not on grouse moors, while reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public. Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes.</p> <p>\u201cWe condemn any illegal activity and Moorland Association members have signed up to a cross-sector zero tolerance approach to wildlife crime.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Ruth Tingay of Raptor Persecution UK and co-founder of <a href=\"https://wildjustice.org.uk/\">Wild Justice</a>, said: \u201cThe reported surge really shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise. Birds of prey have been ruthlessly targeted on many game-shooting estates for decades; lockdown simply provides the criminals with more opportunity to pursue their targets with little fear of detection or consequence.</p> <p>\u201cThe big question remains the same \u2013 lockdown or not: when will this government acknowledge the scale and extent of the problem and hold these shooting estates to account? Wilful blindness can no longer be tolerated.\u201d</p>",

The furore over children\u2019s rainbow drawings, combined with dogwhistle remarks by the head of the religious affairs directorate during a Ramadan sermon that gay people \u201cspread disease\u201d, were met with concern by human rights and legal advocacy groups. The Izmir Bar Association said Ali Erba\u015f\u2019 comments could fuel hate crimes, while an Ankara-based human rights group filed a judicial complaint.</p> <p>Those actions in turn led to a veiled threat from president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that any attack on the head of the <em>Diyanet</em>, or religious affairs directorate, was tantamount to an attack on the state. Retaliatory investigations into the bar associations in Ankara and Diyarbakir on the grounds of \u201cbelittling the religious values adopted by Turkish society\u201d followed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad that the natural beauty of a rainbow is automatically assumed to have a political agenda in Turkey,\u201d said activist Aydin\u00e7 Y\u00fcksel.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pretty typical for the government to try and find a scapegoat for its problems. With coronavirus it was the Chinese first, and now seemingly out of the blue, it\u2019s us.

Donation campaigns, soup kitchens and attempts to distribute bread and masks across the country have been halted.</p> <p>The goverment has said such initiatives are an illegal attempt to undermine the state: Istanbul mayor Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu and Ankara mayor Mansur Yava\u015f are both facing criminal probes for collecting donations not authorised by the local governors\u2019 offices, and at least 900,000 lira (\u00a3105,000) in collected money has been been seized by the treasury.

  "<p>Half of Spain has advanced to phase one of a four-phase plan to ease lockdown restrictions by July. Hoteliers can open their properties \u2013 though none of the common areas \u2013 and bars and restaurants can open a limited amount of outdoor seating. Although Madrid, M\u00e1laga, Granada, Barcelona and parts of Valencia are among the provinces and municipalities not yet cleared to advance.</p> <p>Tourism is Spain\u2019s third largest contributor to the economy, making up 12.3% of its GDP<strong>,</strong> and there is pressure to get hotels to reopen, despite the fact that until July no one will be allowed to travel between provinces. And until borders reopen, airlines start flying and the 14-day quarantine is lifted, there will be no foreign tourists.</p> <p>In the meantime, to ensure health security and help restore confidence, government health-and-safety guidelines have been drawn up for every sector of the tourism industry. For hotels, this means vigorous cleaning and disinfection multiple times a day by staff wearing PPE, as well as changes to the guest experience, such as a ban on buffets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll change all hotel services to ensure minimum contact,\u201d said Manuel Vegas of the Spanish Association of Hotel Directors (AEDH). \u201cKitchens will be transformed to reduce handling and we\u2019ll be demanding maximum guarantees from service providers. It is a radical change.\u201d</p> <p>Many hotels are installing screens between tables in their dining rooms, and introducing staggered dining hours and room service deliveries by staff in masks and gloves. Rooms are more wipe-down, with coffee makers, extra bedding and decoration removed. The government protocol also suggests removing carpets and minibars. And when common areas such as pools and gyms can be reopened, strict social distancing and disinfecting regimes will be in place.</p> <p>Credit-card payment is being promoted in hotels and bars, and contactless technology is coming faster than anticipated. Until the lockdown, AEDH had been running a hotel digitalisation project, providing tools and expertise, said Vegas: \u201cPlanning apps to generate a welcome the moment you arrive at the hotel, to create a virtual key, for the lift to take you to the right floor without having to touch a button, to place orders in the restaurant and bar without contact with a waiter. We had been anticipating the crisis without knowing it.\u201d This innovation needs to continue he said, to free up more staff to act as hosts to meet and greet guests.</p> <p>Guests will be welcomed with a \u201csafe smile\u201d from receptionists (albeit from behind a screen) at Room Mate Hotels. \u201cAfter so much time in confinement, we need that warmth. We are needy,\u201d said the group\u2019s founder, Kike Sarasola. Screens will be widespread - and the brand will ensure they look stylish. \u201cWe have designers competing to design the best screen and the public can vote on them,\u201d said Sarasola, adding that hotels will offset the strict rules in common areas with personalised touches in the bedrooms, making \u201cguests feel like kings\u201d with personalised notes and messages. Room Mate has gained extensive practice of working with safety protocols, having made 13 staffed hotels available free of charge to healthcare workers and the elderly from the start of the crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2639a8968a6c24de50e67819b30b80d4bbf28780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2639a8968a6c24de50e67819b30b80d4bbf28780/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed hotel in the Canary Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed hotel in the Canary Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mercedes Menendez/Pacific Press/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether guests will \u201cfeel like kings\u201d or feel a little uncomfortable in an environment of screens, masks and none of the usual interaction, is another question.</p> <p>\u201c[Who wants to] go to a hotel and not be allowed to enjoy the swimming pool or the common spaces? To finally be free, after quarantine, and spend money to go and be confined in a hotel room?\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Zoreda, executive vice-president of non-profit group Exceltur (Alliance for Excellency in Tourism).</p> <p>Post-Covid, seaside resorts and beaches will be very different. Senator Hotels and Resorts, a major presence on Spain\u2019s Costas, plans to ensure physical contact is avoided in its kids clubs, and will monitor the spaces between loungers and disinfect them after use. The usual summer crowds of up to 40,000 will certainly not be gathering on the beaches of Benidorm this year; the most popular beaches are being divided into plots in order to manage social distancing, and access will be controlled by using QR codes for booking a patch (as in Valencia) and AI and sensors for monitoring (as they hope to do in V\u00e9lez, M\u00e1laga).</p> <p>Those booking hotels can expect bargains but not a fire sale. Acknowledging that \u201cmany families will be in a situation that\u2019s not good\u201d, MP Hotels has two-for-one offers and free accommodation for children. The majority of hotels are offering no payment upfront deals and free cancellation policies.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware that 2019 prices can\u2019t be maintained, and we have to promote prices that are attractive, but we are promoting dynamic pricing not offers,\u201d said Vegas. The industry is keen to avoid a potentially ruinous price war.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m completely against it,\u201d said Sarasola. \u201cWe should raise quality and service instead. This is the time for solidarity, to help small and medium hotels survive the summer.\u201d</p> <p>Smaller hotels may do better than most, especially those in the uncrowded natural locations 87% of Spanish people say they plan to holiday in post-lockdown. \u201cThey can offer more personalised attention,\u201d said Vegas. \u201cThose that will suffer most from the lack of international tourists are the biggest hotels in the top destinations, dependent on tour operators.\u201d</p> <p>Due to the uncertainty (and adding to it), it is estimated that around a third of hotels will not reopen this summer, or until there is the demand. Costa del Sol hotels are currently anticipating 30% occupancy. The holiday hotels that do open, said Vegas, will try to extend the season and, instead of closing in September as usual, will continue to November.\u201d Hope also rests with the Canary Islands where the peak season starts in November and runs through the winter.</p> <p>Spain has adopted health-and-security protocols that are among the strictest in the world, including antibody tests for all workers in the hospitality industry in the Canary Islands. They now need to ensure that when tourists eventually come, they don\u2019t bring the risk of infection. The hotel chain Riu is among many of the major groups to introduce temperature control at the hotel entrance, while VP Plaza Espa\u00f1a Design in Madrid is even introducing rapid tests for arriving guests, who then must wear masks and gloves in common areas.</p> <p>What\u2019s needed, said Vegas \u201cis confidence in the measures adopted, confidence in the protocols, confidence in the future \u2026 and then planes full of healthy guests.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping Spain\u2019s hotels secure has to start with testing foreign visitors at the point of origin. Coronavirus arrived in Spain with a German tourist flying into La Gomera and, appropriately, from July the Canary Islands will be the first destination in the world to require tourists to carry a digital health passport, developed by the islands\u2019 Laboratory Project with the support of the World Tourism Organization.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global death toll passes 302,000</strong></h2> <p>The global toll from Covid-19 has passed 300,000, with nearly 4.5 million people infected. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, at least 302,452 people have now died as a result of the outbreak. The institution says it has counted 4,443,597 confirmed cases worldwide. It\u2019s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</p> <h2><strong>China marks one month with no new coronavirus deaths announced</strong></h2> <p>China has gone a month without announcing any new deaths from the coronavirus. The National Health Commission reported four new cases of the virus on Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last time the commission reported a death was on 14 April.</p> <h2><strong>Trump threatens to cut China ties</strong></h2> <p>US President Donald Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China over coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping at the moment and going so far as to suggest he could cut ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. Chinese state media has responded saying his comments are \u201clunacy\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Trump visits a mask distribution centre without wearing a mask himself</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump toured a mask distribution centre in the political swing state of Pennsylvania on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/donald-trump-mask-medical-equipment-facility-pennsylvania\">without wearing a mask himself</a>. Trump, who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration\u2019s guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring staff to wear them at work.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico sees record one-day increase in cases</strong></h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday confirmed 257 additional coronavirus deaths and 2,409 new infections, the biggest one-day rise in cases since the pandemic began.The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 42,595 and 4,477 deaths in total, according to the official tally.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil confirmed cases pass 200,000</strong></h2> <p>The number of cases in Brazil passed 200,000 on Thursday.The country now has 202,918 confirmed cases, with 13,944 added in last 24 hours, according to health ministry.The tally means it is the sixth-worst-affected country worldwide in terms of cases, according to John Hopkins data.844 new deaths were reported in last 24 hours, bringing the total to 13,993.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea, China and Japan health ministers to hold video conference</strong></h2> <p>The health ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will get together by video conference on Friday to discuss ways to work together in the global campaign against the novel coronavirus, South Korean officials said. The meeting is the first between top health officials of the East Asian neighbours since the outbreak emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.</p> <h2><strong>Doctors in Italy and France report spike in rare inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus</strong></h2> <p>Doctors in northern Italy,<strong> </strong>one of the areas hardest hit by coronavirus, and in France have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/13/italian-doctors-find-link-between-covid-19-and-inflammatory-disorder\">spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory</a> syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the US, Britain and Spain, according to a report in the Lancet.The condition shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation.</p> <h2>Covid-19 reaches refugee camps in Bangladesh</h2> <p>A Rohingya man has become the first person to test positive for Covid-19 in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh that is home to almost one million people. Local health coordinator Abu Toha Bhuiyan initially said two refugees had been put into isolation. The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man, and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.</p> <h2><strong>36 million Americans are now unemployed</strong></h2> <p>Another 3 million Americans filed for benefits, bringing the country\u2019s total unemployed to 36 million. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show the rate of claims is slowing but the record-breaking pace of layoffs has already pushed unemployment to levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>",
  "<p>Domestic cats are killing an estimated 230m native Australian birds, reptiles and mammals every year, according to new research that quantifies the pet\u2019s national toll on native animals for the first time.</p> <p>Researchers said owners of Australia\u2019s 3.7m domestic cats needed to make sure their pets were indoors or contained to reduce their impact on native species.</p> <p>As well as killing native animals, pet cats were also preying on about 150m introduced animals \u2013 mostly rodents \u2013 the research found.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Legge, lead author of the <a href=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR19174\">study published in the journal Wildlife Research</a>, told Guardian Australia: \u201cIf we want native wildlife in our towns and cities \u2013 rather than introduced rodents and birds \u2013 then there are choices to be made.</p> <p>\u201cAll we need to do is keep pet cats contained.\u201d</p> <p>The research, funded by the Australian government\u2019s National Environmental Science Program, reviewed data from more than 60 studies on domestic cats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/18/parasitic-disease-spread-by-feral-cats-likely-to-be-killing-native-wildlife\">Parasitic disease spread by feral cats likely to be killing native wildlife</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Feral cats are a significant threat to Australia\u2019s native animals but less is known about the hunting habits of pet cats. </p> <p>There are about 2.1m feral cats in Australia, with numbers almost tripling during wet periods, said Legge. </p> <p>Understanding the impact of Australia\u2019s pet cats has been harder to track than feral cats. </p> <p>Much analysis of the eating habits of feral cats is based on analysis of the stomachs of killed cats. </p> <p>The new analysis on pet cats drew on recent studies that had used a range of techniques to understand their hunting habits, including GPS trackers, video collars, analysis of scats and surveys of owners.</p> <p>The study found each feral cat kills an average 576 native birds, mammals and reptiles per year, while pet cats kill an average of 110 native animals every year \u2013 40 reptiles, 38 birds and 32 mammals.</p> <p>In total, this meant pet cats were killing 66.9m native mammals, 79.7m native birds and 82.9m native reptiles every year.</p> <p>The study was not able to estimate the numbers of frogs and insects eaten by pet cats.</p> <p>Because pet cats live in higher densities, they were responsible for killing up to 50 times more animals per square kilometre in residential areas than feral cats killed in out-of-town areas.</p> <p>\u201cIf we accept that feral cats in the bush are a problem, then we have to accept that pet cats in town are also a problem,\u201d said Legge, of the University of Queensland.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s easier for us to manage the impacts of pet cats than feral cats. Either keep them inside, or in secure pet runs outside.\u201d</p> <p>In the study, researchers accounted for the numbers of pet cats that are contained \u2013 about 30% \u2013 but warned there could actually be more roaming pet cats.</p> <p>One study carried out in Adelaide found more than one-third of pet cats were going out at night when their owners thought they were contained.</p> <p>The study also accounted for the known difference between the prey that pet cats brought home and analysis done of pet cat scats. This suggested roaming pet cats only brought home about 15% of their prey.</p> <p>Legge said there was often an argument that pet cats helped keep rodents or sparrows under control, but she said there was little evidence to back this up.</p> <p>Legge said: \u201cAll cats will prefer a mammal if they can find one \u2013 animals like feathertail gliders, for example. For birds you could be talking about rosellas or fairy wrens. Cats will learn to stalk around bird feeders.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/08/australian-government-stops-listing-major-threats-to-species-under-environment-laws\">Australian government stops listing major threats to species under environment laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said blue-tongue lizards and possums were also known prey items for pet cats. Cats that roamed at night tended to kill more mammals, while daytime roaming cats killed more reptiles and birds.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIf you have anywhere that prey animals are coming together, cats will get onto that very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.au/adopt-pet/adopting-catkitten/safe-and-happy-cats\">guidance from the RSPCA</a>, cats are healthier if kept at home and away from the risk of traffic accidents, insect and snake bites and fights with other cats and dogs.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Zito, senior scientific officer for companion animals at RSPCA Australia, said: \u201cContrary to what some might believe, cats do not need to roam to be happy. Indoor cats can live longer lives, protected from all these dangers. And, if provided with everything they need, they can be just as happy at home.</p> <p>\u201cIf your cat is a hunter, keeping them safely contained at home can also help to eliminate or minimise the risk they might pose to wildlife.\u201d</p> <p>Sean Dooley, of BirdLife Australia, said the organisation welcomed the study, saying it was further confirmation that \u201cboth feral and domestic cats are a major threat to birds\u201d.</p> <p>Dooley said it was likely domestic cats were a major contributor to the decline of smaller bird species in urban environments.</p> <p>He said there was evidence an entire colony of fairy terns \u2013 a nationally listed threatened species \u2013 had been <a href=\"https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2019/08/a-single-cat-wiped-out-an-entire-colony-of-fairy-terns/\">wiped out by one feral cat and a domestic cat</a> in Mandurah in Western Australia. He said the introduction of a cat curfew in Victoria\u2019s Dandenong Ranges had helped superb lyrebirds to recover there.</p> <p>Holly Parsons, BirdLife Australia\u2019s urban bird program manager, added: \u201cNot only do domestic cats have an impact on native birds, keeping your cats inside and contained is healthier for them and they live longer. We want people to enjoy both our diverse and wonderful wildlife as well as their pet companions.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Across the country, temporarily abandoned golf courses are reopening. The course that I\u2019m visiting, however, illustrates longer-term abandonment. Following years of financial instability, the Oaks golf club at Mollington, a couple of miles to the north of Chester, closed its doors in May 2016. Without weedkiller and blades, the paths are slowly succumbing to moss and plantains. Edged by dandelions, the former fairway grows past my ankles and is scattered with wildflowers. Overhead, house martins zap at each other and gorge on the bounty of insects on offer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/22/its-time-for-golf-clubs-to-open-their-gates\">It's time for golf clubs to open their gates | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sand traps have been overwhelmed by nettles, and while some water hazards closer to the canal host happy families of mallards, the most artificial ones are now just damp patches marked by buttercups.

At its highest point you get a 360-degree view; on a clear evening like this one, you can see Cheshire\u2019s sandstone ridge to the east and the distant Welsh hills in the west. From this perspective, the golf course rolls out like a child\u2019s play mat, paths winding circuitously around obstacles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/12/warblers-sing-among-reeds-country-diary\">Warblers sing among the reeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It still attracts leisure seekers: dog walkers and joggers doing their best to stay healthy at a safe distance.

  "<p>Nearly a quarter of a billion people across 47 African countries will catch coronavirus over the next year, but the result will be fewer severe cases and deaths than in the US and Europe, new research predicts.</p> <p>A model by the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) regional office for Africa, published in the <a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/\">BMJ Global Health</a>, predicts a lower rate of transmission and viral spread across the continent than elsewhere, resulting in up to 190,000 deaths. But the authors warn the associated rise in hospital admissions, care needs and \u201chuge impact\u201d on services such as immunisation and maternity, will overwhelm already stretched health services.</p> <p>About one in four (22%) of the one billion people in the countries measured would be infected in the first year of the pandemic, the model suggests. However the disease is likely to linger for longer \u2013 possibly for several years.</p> <p>The continent\u2019s much younger age profile compared to other countries is behind the lower transmission rates, the authors say. Lower rates of obesity in African countries, compared to the US and elsewhere, also help to slow its progress.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest factor that plays out in our numbers is age,\u201d said data analyst Humphrey Karamagi. \u201cWe also have very few people who are obese, although the numbers are rising. But not at the levels in the US.\u201d</p> <p>A report by the <a href=\"https://www.uneca.org/\">UN Economic Commission for Africa</a> in mid-April predicted a much higher infection and death rate on the continent, of 1.2 billion infections and 3.3 million deaths. However, the models are not comparable, because the new model uses data from the WHO African Region, a smaller grouping of the continent that does not include Djibouti, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan or Tunisia. The paper has been peer-reviewed. Scientists have also learned much more about the virus and its transmission since the UN research.</p> <p>\u201cWe tried to factor in what we are seeing on the ground,\u201d said Karamagi. \u201cAnd we are seeing slower transmission rates in African countries compared to Europe and the US.\u201d</p> <p>Some commentators have speculated that African countries may be reporting fewer cases because they are not detecting them, but Karamagi points to South Africa, which has \u201cgood detection capabilities, but low numbers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere might be an effect of reporting but we do not think that fully explains the rates, when we are seeing the pattern we are seeing. There is something around social-cultural or developmental or environmental structure that is slowing the transmission rates,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The researchers have calculated the risk of exposure, and estimated the number of infections and deaths for each of the 47 countries in the WHO region. </p> <p>\u201cWe are including a risk of exposure into our estimation of the risk of transmission\u201d said Karamagi. </p> <p>The risk of exposure, which is country specific, is driven by factors including number of people in a household, population density, what proportion of the population lives in slums, and road infrastructure.</p> <p>Small countries, including Mauritius, are likely to be the most vulnerable, while sparsely populated countries, such as Niger, Mauritania and Chad, less so, the research found. Per head of population, Mauritius, Seychelles and Equatorial Guinea are likely to have the highest numbers of cases.</p> <p>Larger countries, including Cameroon, South Africa and Algeria, would be most at risk, while Nigeria is set to have the largest number of infections overall, followed by Algeria and South Africa.</p> <p>Recent data about who is likely to suffer more severe symptoms, for instance those who are obese, or who have hypertension or diabetes, has informed the research. Levels of diabetes in Africa are similar to elsewhere, but the condition is more likely to be undiagnosed, so more cases of severe infections in people thought to be healthy are expected.</p> <p>\u201cThe pattern that seems to be emerging is that it is diseases of lifestyle that pushes someone to severe illness as opposed to diseases of poverty,\u201d said Karamagi. \u201cWe have fewer people whose infections will progress to a more serious disease.\u201d</p> <p>The infection mortality rate across Africa, he said, was 0.06%, compared to about 0.1% elsewhere.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>In the wake of a devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/gunmen-attack-kabul-hospital-used-by-medecins-sans-frontieres\">attack in Kabul on Tuesday on a maternity unit</a> that saw gunmen shoot women in labour, new mothers and their newborn babies, hopes of a peace process for Afghanistan appear to be slipping away as both the government and Taliban ramp up military operations.</p> <p>The Taliban on Thursday attacked a city in Afghanistan\u2019s east, killing five civilians and at least one soldier, and injuring dozens more with a truck bomb. The bomber had been targeting an army base in Gardez, but the explosives detonated before he reached it, leaving a too-familiar tangle of rubble and bodies.</p> <p>It was the first attack by the Taliban in an urban centre since the group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/us-taliban-sign-peace-agreement-afghanistan-war\">signed a deal with the US in late February</a> agreeing the departure of American troops in return for security guarantees. This was meant to pave the way for intra-Afghan negotiations, but the process was crumbling before talks even began.</p> <p>The militants said Thursday\u2019s bomb was retaliation for government statements blaming the Taliban for the hospital attack and for president Ashraf Ghani\u2019s announcement that he had put security forces on the offensive, after months of an \u201cactive defence\u201d stance in preparation for the possible peace talks.</p> <p>The Taliban have denied any role in the Kabul attack, which killed 24, and condemned the slaughter. But they also said they were ready to return to the battlefield in full force.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the upper hand in the war, we are not tired of war and we are ready,\u201d Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a radio interview. \u201cWhen we say the issue should be solved through negotiations, it doesn\u2019t show our weakness.\u201d</p> <p>Senior US officials, heavily invested in the peace process, appeared to urge the Afghan government to accept the Taliban\u2019s position.</p> <p>The US special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad noted the group\u2019s denial and called on the Afghan government and Taliban to work together to fight terrorism; US secretary of state Mike Pompeo made similar comments.</p> <p>But even if the Taliban did not dispatch the suicide bombers, their decision to keep up an intense pace of attacks against government forces in recent months \u2013 even while the movement was nominally preparing for peace \u2013 may have facilitated the violence.</p> <p>\u201cThe Taliban have created an enabling environment for this kind of attack. If they had agreed a ceasefire it would be much harder for any group to carry out this kind of attack,\u201d said Kate Clark, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the Taliban does [with attacks nationwide], takes up the bandwidth of the security services. Also the general insecurity is a sea in which other [militant] groups swim.\u201d</p> <p>Clark added that Taliban intelligence was relatively strong, and had they chosen to stop fighting and focus attention on preventing attacks, they might have been able to stave off violence planned by another group.</p> <p>The peace process had already been faltering over disputes about a prisoner release plan, and Afghan government anger about increased Taliban violence. Even the US had expressed anger about the scale of attacks, saying they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/us-military-taliban-withdrawal-agreement-afghanistan\">violated a secret verbal commitment </a>made on the sidelines of the withdrawal deal.</p> <p>But with the withdrawal of American troops already underway, and presidential elections looming, US officials may feel they have no choice but to try and double down on a peace process they promised Afghans and Americans would be the fruit of their departure, regardless of realities on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cOne question that has hung over the process from the start is whether the Taliban had serious intent to talk, and I just don\u2019t think we have seen that,\u201d Clark said. \u201cMy fear all along was that there wasn\u2019t really a plan B in Washington, for what happens if the Taliban don\u2019t really want to talk.\u201d</p>",

They want an inquiry into how I got the dossier.\u201d</p> <h2>BuzzFeed bites the dust</h2> <p>The remaining four reporters and one sub-editor at BuzzFeed News in Australia were told this week that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/13/buzzfeed-pulls-plug-on-uk-and-australian-news-operations\">local news operation was closing down</a>, along with its UK counterpart, ending a global expansion strategy that once seemed so promising. It\u2019s a sad end for the team, already much diminished after the downsizing strategy targeted 11 staff in January 2019. Head of news Marni Cordell left in August last year to become major projects editor at Guardian Australia, leaving reporter Lane Sainty as editor.</p> <p>BuzzFeed is not the only digital venture to fail in Australia. The Global Mail, the Hoopla and the Huffington Post have all closed after relatively short periods and the longest online-only news outlet, Crikey, is struggling. It\u2019s very hard to support a digital publishing venture with advertising, especially at the moment. The industry is eagerly awaiting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/19/facebook-and-google-to-be-forced-to-share-advertising-revenue-with-australian-media-companies\">mandatory code from the competition watchdog which will force the digital</a> platforms such as Google and Facebook to compensate news media companies for using their content.</p> <h2>Oz casualty</h2> <p>In November Craig Johnstone joined the Australian as Queensland editor after a long stretch as a media executive for the local government association in that state.

  "<p>It is no coincidence that Beijing\u2019s threats to put punitive tariffs on Australian barley and halt beef exports on fake technical grounds are happening before the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly starting next Monday.</p> <p>These moves are Chinese Communist party shots across Australia\u2019s political bow. The message, pure and simple, is that Canberra should not use the assembly meeting to press for a transparent and independent inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.</p> <p>The assembly is the peak governing body of the World Health Organisation. Before the pandemic no one would have expected that this year\u2019s virtual and shortened two-day meeting would be the most significant geopolitical summit of 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/australia-china-ties-at-risk-of-slipping-into-permanent-hostility-former-senior-diplomat-warns\">Australia-China ties at risk of slipping into permanent hostility, former senior diplomat warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are four key elements to the call by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, for an investigation into the origins of the virus and all directly conflict with Beijing\u2019s interests. First, Morrison wants an investigation to be open and transparent. Second, he says it must be independent, presumably free from political influence and able to produce advice to help strengthen protections against future pandemics.</p> <p>Third, he wants arrangements in place to speed up WHO responses to crises. He says Australia decided to work on the basis that the virus would become a pandemic fully a fortnight before the WHO made that judgment. <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/interview-paul-murray-sky-news-2\">He told Sky News</a> in late April that earlier advice \u201ccould have potentially saved thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of lives\u201d globally.</p> <p>Fourth, Morrison wants to ensure that the WHO is \u201cnot fettered in any way\u201d \u2013 a delicate reference to an obvious problem, which is that the organisation\u2019s handling of the crisis has been astonishingly and inappropriately attentive to Beijing\u2019s political sensitivities.</p> <p>The Communist party\u2019s response to this suggests it has something to hide. Its refusal to allow foreign investigators into Wuhan, the halt on publishing research on the virus, the failure to hand over physical virus samples rather than genome sequences all show the party is tightly controlling access to information about the virus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are seeing the arrival of a loose coalition of countries focused on shaping a more effective WHO</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Australia is not the only country wanting to pursue an inquiry: the European Union has submitted a draft resolution to the WHA calling for an \u201cindependent evaluation \u2026 to review lessons learned\u201d from the crisis. Morrison has also directly spoken to the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and the United States among others.</p> <p>All countries turned inwards in their initial reaction to the crisis, but in the absence of the US providing global leadership on international responses we are seeing the arrival of a loose coalition of countries focused on shaping a more effective WHO that is not in thrall to China.</p> <p>Aside from the obvious focus on the virus, these countries share the experience of dealing with a China that is sharpening its political rhetoric and is quick to resort to threats of economic retaliation if states do and say things that Beijing does not like. The Communist party\u2019s response to calls for Taiwan to attend the assembly as an observer is a case in point.</p> <p>Taiwan had previously attended the WHA between 2009 and 2016 as an observer but was excluded from the organisation after the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive party was elected in May 2016.</p> <p>As Beijing hardens its position on what it considers to be acceptable applications of the One China policy it is reacting badly to international judgments that Taiwan very effectively suppressed the spread of Covid-19 without resorting to the punitive measures we saw in Wuhan.</p> <p>This week China\u2019s ambassador to New Zealand sharply rebuked Wellington for backing a growing international call to make Taiwan an observer at the WHA meeting. The foreign ministry spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-new-zealand-mofa/china-berates-new-zealand-over-support-for-taiwan-at-who-idUSKBN22N18E?il=0\">Zhao Lijian, said</a> New Zealand should \u201cimmediately stop making wrong statements on Taiwan, to avoid damaging our bilateral relationship\u201d.</p> <p>China\u2019s ever more strident and stringent demands for countries to publicly acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s political agenda is seemingly having the opposite reaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/01/we-need-to-reduce-our-dependence-on-china-and-have-the-courage-to-call-it-out-when-required\">We need to reduce our dependence on China, and have the courage to call it out when required | Peter Jennings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s uncertain how these issues will play out next week at the WHA because China has presented itself as so inflexibly opposed to an open and independent review and to Taiwan\u2019s observer membership that it is difficult to see what compromises might be developed. Equally Australia and others seem intent on pressing their points.</p> <p>This could make for a fiery meeting. If the WHA is not capable of agreeing on a meaningful review into the origins and early management of the virus, it\u2019s possible that a number of countries will establish an investigation, pooling intelligence resources and making the best assessments they can without direct access to Wuhan.</p> <p>Would China unleash economic retaliation at this point? It would be a tough call for Beijing because banning Australian barley and beef would punish Chinese consumers. For its own stability, the party cannot risk too many unhappy citizens. On trade, Beijing\u2019s bargaining position is not as strong as some assume.</p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s position is harder to reconcile, but one possible outcome is that countries will simply refuse to let Beijing go any further in predating the island\u2019s autonomy.</p> <p>In both cases these would amount to major political setbacks for Beijing, the largely self-imposed costs of the party\u2019s hardline diplomatic brinksmanship.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Jennings is the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and a former deputy secretary for strategy with the defence department</p>",

  "<p> A troubled super fund run by an offshoot of the Commonwealth Bank has had the highest proportion of withdrawals under Josh Frydenberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/22/australia-is-easing-superannuation-access-for-those-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-but-can-we-afford-it\">coronavirus early access scheme</a>, according to data compiled by Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>Smaller superannuation funds appear to be hardest hit by applications for early release of super, the data suggests.</p> \n<p>The average amount people using the scheme have so far drawn out is about $8,000.

Leading the table for drawdowns was Commonwealth Essential Super, a $3.8bn fund that has lost about 5.4% of its value to coronavirus early withdrawals.</p> \n<p>Problems with the fund, which is closed to new members, were raised at the banking royal commission and it is the subject of a class action against the bank over the low rates paid to members who chose to invest in cash.</p> \n<p>The fund is managed by CBA division Colonial First State, which the bank is in the process of selling.</p> \n<p>A CFS spokeswoman said the average member balance in the fund was about $18,000.</p> \n<p>She said that across all the funds managed by CFS requests for early access have totalled about 65,000, or 7% of super customers, for a dollar value of about $473m, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cColonial First State\u2019s investment approach has always favoured investing in assets that have a high level of liquidity,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis approach has proven its value with the early release scheme.
