It\u2019s been a very big focus on the eggs, whereas we\u2019re an organisation that focuses on the hens.\u201d</p> <p>While she hastens to add that many of her recent applicants have been credible, \u201cThere\u2019s been a big increase, and they\u2019ve been quite impatient. It\u2019s been an interesting experience, dealing with those enquiries.\u201d</p> <p>Fiona Scott-Norman, who wrote a book on Australians\u2019 love of chooks in 2019 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781760786083/\">This Chicken Life</a> \u2013 puts it bluntly: \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re the new toilet paper.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/30/chickens-rule-why-the-backyard-chook-is-the-pet-of-the-decade\">Chickens rule: why the backyard chook is the pet of the decade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Smith, Scott-Norman and RSPCA\u2019s scientific officer Dr Sarah Babington all warn that a backyard chicken coop is not an easy egg fix, if the supermarket runs low.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not something you can just put in your backyard and leave. They require a lot of care,\u201d says Babington.</p> <p>\u201cHens \u2026 are very social creatures,\u201d Babington explains. Would-be hen parents need to keep at least three, so the birds do not get lonely. They also require space to explore, a nutritious diet (household scraps won\u2019t be enough), nests, perches, dust baths, an enriching environment, veterinary care and Fort-Knox like protection from predators.</p> <p>\u201cThe great tragedy of the chicken is it tastes good to everyone and everything,\u201d says Scott-Norman, who recently lost her own flock to a very persistent fox. \u201cOnce [foxes are] on the beat, they\u2019re on the beat. They\u2019re waiting for you to slip up.\u201d</p> <p>Most of all, chickens need affection. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a dog or cat,\u201d says Babington. Smith and Scott-Norman suggest that if you do not get to know your chickens, and their individual personalities, you\u2019re missing out on the best part of owning them. \u201cThey crawl over you, and they\u2019re preening you,\u201d says Smith of her hens\u2019 friendly nature.</p> <p>Then, there\u2019s the clean-up. \u201cThey do poop a lot,\u201d Scott-Norman says. \u201cThe bigger the chicken, the bigger the poop.\u201d Though she adds, \u201cthere\u2019s something homey about the smell of chicken poop\u201d and even waste has its uses. \u201cIt is black gold. It\u2019s great fertiliser.\u201d</p> <p>Smith fears \u201cwe\u2019re going to get inundated with surrenders\u201d from unprepared new owners. \u201cIt\u2019s a very worrying time.\u201d</p> <p>However, for those that have <a href=\"https://kb.rspca.org.au/article-categories/backyard-hens/\">done their research</a>; have enough space (Smith recommends an area of 10m2 for a flock of five); are prepared for the set-up costs and ongoing veterinary bills; know how they\u2019ll keep their flock warm in winter and cool in summer; and have ensured their flock complies with council regulations, chickens can be brilliant pets.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re productive pets. The whole package,\u201d says Scott-Norman. \u201cMy experience is if you want chickens and you get chickens you will fall in love with them.\u201d</p> <p>Just do not expect them to start laying eggs right away, says Smith. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from breeders of people buying hens, and then being frustrated that they\u2019re not laying yet. It\u2019s a process, it happens when it happens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5cf2d9913178f49c539ef8320aff82753ad70fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5cf2d9913178f49c539ef8320aff82753ad70fb/0_392_5877_3526/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Isa Brown chickens \u2013 the most common egg laying hens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isa Brown chickens \u2013 the most common egg-laying hens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ACM1988/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all chickens are even bred for regular laying, and those that are \u2013 Isa Browns \u2013 come with a host of health complications associated with the stress of producing eggs every day. As a result of these complications, many of Smith\u2019s hens are on a hormonal implant to stop them from laying, at a cost of $300 a year.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about chickens is that they\u2019re incredibly resilient \u2026 but they will also get a panoply of afflictions and will occasionally drop dead,\u201d says Scott-Norman, who suggests keeping chickens for companionship, and treating the eggs \u201cas a bonus\u201d.</p> <p>Choosing to keep hens also comes with a community of like-minded people. Scott-Norman says local Facebook groups are a useful resource if you\u2019re just starting out, and Babington suggests that people turn to their local poultry club for more information about chicken ownership.</p> <p>Poultry clubs are also the best places to find a reputable breeders. Or, if you\u2019ve ensured you can take care of a rescue chicken\u2019s specialised needs, you can adopt a few.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/turning-crap-into-gold-why-a-composting-habit-will-change-your-life\">Turning crap into gold: why a composting habit will change your life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, Scott-Norman is optimistic about a boom in backyard hen adoption, provided the animals are well cared for. \u201cWe\u2019re always delighted when people choose to join Team Chicken,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re really smart and hugely fun. They\u2019ve got stuff going on ... there\u2019s always chicken business. While you\u2019re isolating, chickens are the best. It\u2019s like chicken TV.\u201d She also touts their mental health benefits. \u201cThe more people have chickens the more calm people are, the more in touch with the land,\u201d she concludes: \u201cIt\u2019s a win. It\u2019s a total win.\u201d</p>",

How much worse the situation is compared with the usual numbers of people who die in normal circumstances has been a subject of some debate in some sections of the media, and particularly on social media. </p> \n  <p>A blogpost by David Shaw, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, posted on the British Medical Journal provides some much-needed context. Shaw identifies four important contextual factors that should be borne in mind to understand reports of death tolls that make headlines in the daily press. For example, he writes: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[I]n all the millions of words written about how many people have died in each country each day, no coverage appears to have given the baseline daily death rate before the outbreak began. Take Scotland: here, the death rate had averaged between 6 and 8 people per day before increasing to 16 on the 1<sup>st</sup> of April. But the <a href=\"https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/vital-events-ref-tables/2018/vital-events-ref-tables-18-publication.pdf\">typical death rate in Scotland</a> is 160 people per day, with about a quarter of them dying of cancer. This means that the virus is currently increasing the daily rate by 10% (and before that around 5%) \u2013 a substantial increase, but not as massive as many members of the public are probably assuming, given the press coverage. Reporting the increasing number of deaths in isolation without this context is likely to increase people\u2019s stress about the virus, because people are unaware of how many people normally die each day. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2020/04/02/the-vital-contexts-of-coronavirus/\">Read more on the BMJ website: The vital contexts of coronavirus.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:45:04.925Z\">at 4.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8c99548f08ec70cecec420\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:18:59.356Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More people have now died from the coronavirus in New York City than perished in the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, the <strong>Associated Press</strong> reports.<br></p> \n  <p> At least 3,202 people in the city have been killed by the virus, according to the latest figures released on Tuesday.

According to <a href=\"http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-covid-19-forecasts-europe-italy-spain-have-passed-peak-their-epidemics-uk-early-its\">a news release by the institute</a>: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The death toll in many countries is compounded by demand for hospital resources well in excess of what is available. For example, peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds needed compared to 17,765 available, 24,544 ICU beds compared to 744 ICU beds available, and 20,862 ventilators needed (with data currently unavailable on ventilators available). </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in so far in the UK, fewer than in Spain, Italy and France.

The app is available for smart watches or fitness armbands and is free to download. <br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cIf we have a big enough sample group our scientists can draw conclusions about the virus,\u201d Wieler said. He compared it to a similar app used in the US to monitor the flu wave. The app works by collating the data of a user such as weight, height, sex, pulse, heart rate, sleep patterns, as well as their post code, and being able to register when that person was showing indications that they may have contracted coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt can recognise changes in temperature, if the individual is less active, or their sleep is disturbed,\u201d Wieler said. \u201cIt is a supplement to other measures, but in my opinion a very useful one.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The data will be recorded on an interactive map which will be published on the internet and will be regularly updated \u201cand will indicate if the measures [taken] are working,\u201d he added.</p> \n  <p>The RKI said around 10 million people in Germany possess a smartwatch or fitness armband. Wieler stressed participation was voluntary and data would be anonymous. No mobile phone data would be collected, he said.</p> \n  <p>This morning, Germany had over 103,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 1,823 people have so far died. The RKI said the current reproduction rate is 1.2-1.5. The aim is for this rate to go below one.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T09:27:14.865Z\">at 10.27am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8c45c28f08c35a1d11b6c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T09:21:01.603Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth has sent a message of \u201cenduring appreciation and good wishes\u201d to health workers around the world for World Health Day. <br><br>\u201cI want to thank all those working in the healthcare profession for your selfless commitment and diligence as you undertake vitally important roles to protect and improve the health and well-being of people,\u201d the Queen said. <br><br tabindex=\"-1\">\u201cMy family and I send our enduring appreciation and good wishes.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0544c09b4db4f02f527ef17520cb057fd5817b44\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0544c09b4db4f02f527ef17520cb057fd5817b44/60_0_1800_1080/1000..jpg\" alt=\"the queen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T09:27:45.833Z\">at 10.27am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8c43578f08c35a1d11b6af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T09:10:09.204Z\">10.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello, I am bringing you the latest updates on the global live feed.

  "<p>Cruise ships are drowning out the roars of seals that are important for bagging a mate, researchers have found in the latest study to reveal the consequences of human activity on wildlife.</p> <p>Ships are known to produce low-frequency sounds which can overlap with calls made by marine creatures. But now researchers studying harbour seals say such noise could be taking its toll.</p> <p>\u201cAs it gets noisier, it becomes harder for harbour seals to be heard,\u201d said Dr Michelle Fournet, a co-author of the research at Cornell University, noting the animals\u2019 roars serve a number of purposes \u2013 including advertising to females and establishing underwater territories.</p> <p><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0795\">Writing in the journal Biology Letters</a>, Fournet and colleagues report that they lowered an array of microphones into Glacier Bay in Alaska and recorded underwater sounds during May to October 2015. The team then analysed data from a nine-day period that overlapped with the peak breeding period for harbour seals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/country-diary-the-seals-are-equally-intrigued-by-us-skye\">Country diary: the seals are equally intrigued by us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the sounds recorded were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/country-diary-the-seals-are-equally-intrigued-by-us-skye\">roars of male harbour seals</a>, as well as the noise from other animals and passing shipping. \u201cVessels in general are one of the largest contributors to underwater sound in this area,\u201d said Fournet.</p> <p>Overall, the team analysed recordings of 545 underwater roars, produced by at least four different male harbour seals.</p> <p>Fournet said widespread animals such as harbour seals are generally thought to be resilient to human activity.</p> <p>However the team found little, if any, difference in the loudness of roars made by the seals during noisy periods, when cruise ships were known to be passing, compared with those made during quiet periods when the ships were absent. The duration or frequency of the roars also showed no tangible difference. </p> <p>Instead, the team found that the loudness of a roar beyond the rest of the soundscape fell by about 0.86 decibels for every one decibel increase in noise in the environment caused by the cruise ships. In other words, the area over which they could communicate shrank.</p> <p>\u201cBecause the harbour seals are already calling as loud as they can possibly call \u2026 as ocean noise gets louder, the ability to detect that signal goes down,\u201d said Fournet, adding that the animals were likely calling loudly even during quiet periods as this would be advantageous both in bagging a mate and defending territory \u2013 but it meant they may not be able to turn up the volume when cruise ships show up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/31/call-for-jetskiers-and-kayakers-to-keep-away-from-marine-wildlife\">Call for drone users and jetskiers to keep away from marine wildlife</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The team say the findings could potentially mean it is harder for males to find a mate, not least since the peak time for vessels including cruise ships overlaps with the animals\u2019 breeding season. They add that more research is needed to see if this is indeed the case, noting that the passage of cruise ships in Glacier Bay is concentrated to just two periods of the day.</p> <p>Fournet added the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a> has opened up a new opportunities for research. \u201cWe are working right now on trying to get a hydrophone in the water so that we can listen [during breeding season] in the absence of ships for the first time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Marley, an expert in the impact of noise on marine animals from the University of Portsmouth who was not involved in the study, said that noise from human activities has been increasing in the oceans \u2013 a trend that could change animals\u2019 behaviour or mask sounds they make for important activities.</p> <p>But, she added, the new findings do not necessarily mean harbour seals have failed to adapt, noting that even quiet times in Glacier Bay may be noisier than locations without any shipping and hence require a louder roar.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be that the seals are already roaring at maximum levels during the so-called \u2018quiet\u2019 periods, and just can\u2019t go any further to communicate during the really noisy periods,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Marley added that the findings could have important ramifications for the UK, which has a population of about 43,000 harbour seals living in areas that, at least in part, overlap with those used by humans.<br></p> <p>\u201cIf man-made noise is impeding the breeding success of harbour seals, this could have important repercussions at the local and national level for seal management and conservation,\u201d she said.</p>",

Non-profit food banks and food pantries rely in large part on surplus food from a range of food businesses. For example, many restaurants donate excess food. But during this time of social distancing, restaurants are closed, and many other normal channels of excess food have also shut down. To make matters worse, as supply is dwindling, demand for food bank services is going up.\u2063 \u2063 Today, I want to support those on the front lines at our nation\u2019s food banks and those who are relying on them for food with a $100 million gift to @FeedingAmerica. Feeding America will quickly distribute the funds to their national network of food banks and food pantries, getting food to those countless families who need it.\u2063 \u2063 Feeding America is the largest non-profit focused on food security. Millions of Americans are turning to food banks during this time. If you want to help, the link to Feeding America is in my bio. They\u2019d be excited and grateful for donations of any size.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeffbezos/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Jeff Bezos</a> (@jeffbezos) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-04-02T18:00:55+00:00\">Apr 2, 2020 at 11:00am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Bezos\u2019s donation represents less than 0.1% of his estimated $123bn fortune.</p> <p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has given $100m to efforts to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and to fund testing and treatments.

At kava bars, where the traditional psychoactive brew is served, people share the same kava bowl, dipped into the muddy brown liquid, as they drink through the night. They are also notorious for people spitting, to rid their mouths of the bitter taste after drinking.</p> <p>In the wake of Covid-19, all kava bars are now only providing takeaway, and at the Blue Galaxy Nakamal, in Bladiniere Estate on the outskirts of Port Vila, Kelsie Java is pulling on disposable gloves to fill up plastic bottles full of the beloved drink to sell to customers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c2e494f14bf5eeab82e92366d004c9fab256c440\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2e494f14bf5eeab82e92366d004c9fab256c440/0_263_5496_3298/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Vanuatu has introduced hand-washing measures, including at food markets, as well as a curfew of 9pm and a limit on gatherings to no more than five people.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanuatu has introduced hand-washing measures, including at food markets, as well as a curfew of 9pm and a limit on gatherings to no more than five people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky Kuautonga/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUsually I open until midnight.

  "<p>For most of us, the announcement of the lockdown last month was a sober, even daunting moment. It is hard to imagine how terrifying it must have been for those who knew they would now be confined with their abusers. As the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned on Monday, the threat for many women and girls looms largest where they should be safe: in their own homes.</p> <p>The warning was first sounded in Wuhan, where activists reported that domestic violence rates were soaring due to the lockdown. Since then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/28/lockdowns-world-rise-domestic-violence\" title=\"\">around the world</a>, orders to stay at home have made many victims more vulnerable. The cause of domestic abuse is the perpetrator, not coronavirus. But rates of violence increase in many emergencies and this crisis is doubly perilous, because it is simultaneously closing routes to safety. One of the most chilling reports is that calls to helplines in Italy have actually dropped, while text messages and emails have increased, from women who do not dare to ring while their abuser is close by.</p> <p>In the UK, the national domestic abuse helpline has recorded a 25% increase in calls and online requests for help since the lockdown began. Visits to its website are 150% higher than in the last week of February. Children, too, are vulnerable. While those with a social worker are still attending school, the Easter holidays have now begun, and other children will no longer have the opportunity to access support at school.</p> <p>Mr Guterres has rightly <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/global-surge-domestic-violence-coronavirus-lockdowns-200406065737864.html\" title=\"\">urged</a> all governments to make preventing violence against women a key part of their Covid-19 response. In the UK, organisations that deliver services to those affected have warned the government that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/call-for-uk-domestic-violence-refuges-to-get-coronavirus-funding\" title=\"\">action is needed now</a>. Austerity has already had a punitive effect on the sector. Now police, health services and local authorities, as well as refuges and support groups, are under new pressure from the combined effect of additional demands and reduced resources due to illness and self-isolation. Smaller organisations, in particular, face huge financial pressure. Cash is urgently needed to support and bolster current work and address new needs \u2013 for example, moving services online where possible \u2013 for groups helping victims (and those such as Respect, which works with perpetrators looking for help to stop). Women\u2019s Aid has also asked for protective clothing for workers and testing in refuges. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has already announced that she is increasing funding to Scottish Women\u2019s Aid and Rape Crisis Scotland.</p> <p>Ministers should also stress that victims need not wait to seek help. While reinforcing the importance of the lockdown in general, they must say loud and clear that people should leave home if they need to do so for their safety, and remind them that services are still open. They should also publicise helpline numbers and websites, and remind those in danger that they can call 999 and simply <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-and-domestic-abuse\" title=\"\">press 55</a> when prompted, so that they do not risk being overheard.

Speedy boarders could have made a 27% return in 48 hours by buying shares in easyJet first thing on Monday morning. In the same short period, Rolls-Royce, the engine-maker, gained 24%.

Asos, the online fashion retailer, joined the club on Tuesday by saying it is close to raising more equity and debt.</p> <p>What does it all mean? Very little, probably. There is a fear of missing the bounce in over-sold stocks, but it would be unwise to draw wider morals. Central banks and governments have made financing conditions easier \u2013 a big achievement \u2013 but the shape of the post-lockdown recovery remains anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p>The V-shaped camp has adherents, but they are dwindling in number. The \u201ccorrugated\u201d thesis \u2013 brief surges and relapses \u2013 is gaining ground, which would make sense if lockdowns are rolled back and then partially reimposed if fresh viral outbreaks occur. Take your pick.</p> <p>History, though, says it\u2019s far too soon to call the bottom for share prices, at least according to Bank of America\u2019s analysts. They think it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d since 1929 if the S&amp;P 500, the main US index, \u201cfailed to re-test or even fall below\u201d its low point on 23 March if recession arrives. Their point is that bear markets in stocks, when accompanied by recession on the ground, tend to last a while \u2013 about 11 months on average.</p> <p>This time may be different, not least because most recessions aren\u2019t caused by pandemics, but the current stock market still feels essentially directionless. The FTSE 100 has gained 5.3% in two days as global investors have focused on lower infection rates in many countries. That news is encouraging, but the jobless numbers are still horrendous and are likely to get worse. This mini-rally for share prices feels fragile.</p> <h2>Cineworld accepts a dose of realism</h2> <p>A dose of dividend realism has arrived at Cineworld, where the board has finally understood that distributing cash to shareholders is not a smart idea when you\u2019re carrying debts of $3.5bn and the doors of all your 787 cinemas in 10 countries are shut.</p> <p>Mooky Greidinger, Cineworld\u2019s acquisition-hungry boss, was wedded to the divi three weeks ago. Since he and his family own 20% of the company, one could understand the desire for income. But the stance was obviously nonsensical. A final quarterly divi for 2019 worth $58m may be peanuts, or popcorn, in the context of the debt pile, but lenders prefer borrowers to be serious.</p> <p>The $58m distribution has now been suspended, along with dividends for 2020 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/07/cineworld-talks-with-landlords-and-studios-to-weather-coronavirus\">Cineworld starts talking to banks about securing liquidity</a>. For good measure, Mooky\u2019s crew are donning hair shirts, relatively speaking, by deferring salaries and bonuses until the screen comes into focus.</p> <p>One can see how Cineworld, which also owns the Picturehouse chain in the UK, could muddle through. Half its costs in a normal year are royalty payments to film studios; if no films are showing, there\u2019s no payment. The company can also make use of governments\u2019 furlough schemes and beg landlords to defer rents.</p> <p>Yet Cineworld must also find a way to abandon its planned $2.1bn purchase of the Canadian chain Cineplex, a cash deal agreed before coronavirus and due to be funded entirely with debt.</p> <p>The good news, of a sort, is that Cineplex\u2019s share price sits at one-third of the supposed takeover price, suggesting the Toronto market thinks the deal is dead. But Cineworld still needs to get itself formally off the hook: wriggle and squirm if needs be.</p> <p>After that, Greidinger needs to tame his debt-fuelled takeover ways permanently. Cineworld\u2019s share price, up on Tuesday but down 70% this year, says that game is over.</p>",

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/07/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-spends-night-in-intensive-care?page=with:block-5e8ca47b8f085d226cfd49e2#block-5e8ca47b8f085d226cfd49e2\"> 5.05pm.)</a> It is always advisable to show strong support for the boss, even if you don\u2019t particularly mean it, but in this case it seemed very obvious that Raab did. Johnson\u2019s illness has clearly shocked his colleagues, and their concern for him is genuine.</p> \n  <p>Beyond that, what was probably most interesting was what Raab had to say about the prospect of the lockdown measures being relaxed. When Johnson announced the lockdown 15 days ago, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again <a>in three weeks</a>, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The three-week deadline comes up on Monday. But when Raab was asked about the prospect of the restrictions being lifted in any way next week, he very much played down the idea. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of the review, we are not at that stage yet. We will take any decision when the time is right, based on the facts and the scientific and medical advice.</p> \n   <p>Our number one and overriding focus right now is on conveying the key message, which is that everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance.</p> \n   <p>There is a long Easter bank holiday weekend coming up, warm weather and we understand people are making big sacrifices to follow this guidance. It is helping, it is contributing to our ability to tackle the coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>The worst thing now would be to take our foot off the pedal, to ease up on that and risk losing the gains that have been made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And in another answer, Raab said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The critical thing is to take evidence-based decisions and so we\u2019ve said that we will take any review once we\u2019ve got the evidence that the measures are working and having the kind of impact taking us past the peak which means that they can be responsibly done. We\u2019re not at that stage yet.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong> was a bit more explicit. Talking about when some of the restrictions might be relaxed, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s really important that we get to the point that we\u2019re all confident that we\u2019re beyond the peak and then at that point start making it clear what combination of things, and over what period of time, seems a sensible combination to take us through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1b91f03f-b7ca-4277-9fc2-f065733bcca9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LmHGQxTqETE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T19:12:54.095Z\">at 8.12pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8caa198f08ec70cecec52c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T16:33:30.032Z\">5.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: A letter from GPs to Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, suggests some people who should be shielded are not being shielded.

Large numbers of patients could be denied care, with those facing a poor prognosis losing the potentially life-saving equipment even if their condition is improving.</p> \n  <p>A strong-worded statement issued by Dr Jackie Applebee, chair of Doctor in Unite, challenged such guidance.</p> \n  <p>It said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We believe that all people are of equal value. </p> \n   <p>Intensive care will not work for some patients. Ventilator support will sometimes not succeed. Doctors must judge who is most likely to improve with these measures, and who is not.</p> \n   <p>These decisions have previously always been made on a case-by-case basis, where the risks and benefits to an individual patient are carefully considered. The arbitrary condemnation of one group or another is inexcusable. Being old, living in a care home, or having a pre-existing disability should not lead to an automatic exclusion from possible treatment. Blanket categorisation of large groups of people in such a way is prejudice. There is no place for it in the NHS.</p> \n   <p>There may come a time where our healthcare system is overwhelmed.

  "<p>The second season of Shrill, which became available on SBS in its entirety in January, picks up right where the first left off: with our heroine, Annie Easton (played by the show\u2019s co-creator and Saturday Night Live mainstay Aidy Bryant), running away from the house of the man who\u2019d been harassing her with nasty comments online.</p> <p>The show is based on the writer Lindy West\u2019s 2016 memoir, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman. A writer for an alt-weekly that mirrors Seattle\u2019s the Stranger \u2013 the publication West wrote for in the early days of her career \u2013 Annie was high on the adrenaline of confronting her troll and hurling a pot plant through his window. As she sprinted away with a triumphant smile on her face, his response echoed after her: \u201cYou better run, you fat bitch!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/07/crazy-ex-girlfriend-a-magical-blend-of-comedy-tragedy-earnestness-and-irony\">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend: a magical blend of comedy, tragedy, earnestness and irony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first season, which followed Annie\u2019s journey to accept, love and no longer be defined by her body, was bookended by people calling her these words; in episode one it was a trainer encouraging Annie to sign up for workouts. But with her body acceptance journey seemingly realised, the show needed to take Annie somewhere else.</p> <p>One place it takes her, in the best episode of TV I\u2019ve seen so far this year, is a pastel pink \u201cempowerment conference\u201d called WAHAM: Women Are Having A Moment. Based on events like the Goop summit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/14/gwyneth-glows-like-a-radioactive-swan-my-day-at-the-goop-festival\">West covered for the Guardian in 2017</a>, it paints a glaring picture of contemporary and commercialised feminism, where attendees pay thousands of dollars to listen to panels full of people spouting empty catchphrases. In the conference\u2019s thoroughfares they can spend even more: on expensive novelty dildos, makeup to cover their supposedly gross legs, and T-shirts that aren\u2019t available in plus sizes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cf0f3fa306d0d8bc1b4196a58bbc5f093e24038\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cf0f3fa306d0d8bc1b4196a58bbc5f093e24038/0_170_2560_1536/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Annie (Aidy Bryant), in Shrill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie (Aidy Bryant) finally gets a good assignment \u2013 and it takes her to a Goop-style \u2018empowerment\u2019 conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allyson Riggs/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Annie takes it all in, has a brief and revealing conversation with the conference\u2019s \u201cshe-EO\u201d (played by Bryant\u2019s SNL co-star Vanessa Bayer, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/shrill-season-2-waham-conference.html\">who has \u201chate in her eyes through a smile\u201d</a>), and returns to the office struggling to reckon with both the price tag put on self-care, and the ultimate act of self-care she performed for herself in season one when she chose to have an abortion.</p> <p>With its accomplished writing staff, which includes Bryant, West, essayist Samantha Irby and SNL writer Sudi Green, Shrill is a show that seems uniquely positioned to put its characters in situations in which they genuinely need to weigh up, say, feeling disheartened by pink-washed politics and recognising that, for many women outside major cities, this is their only exposure to feminist communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5c54878425a15e717e33d2ea39d53520d88f737\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5c54878425a15e717e33d2ea39d53520d88f737/0_0_2560_1707/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Annie (Aidy Bryant) at a roller skating rink\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There\u2019s something incredibly revealing in seeing how, when it comes to romance, fat women are implicitly instructed to receive the bare minimum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allyson Riggs/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also refuses to offer easy answers or tie up stories neatly. Annie\u2019s dopey, disappointing but well-meaning boyfriend, Ryan (Luka Jones), remains in the picture \u2013 but with increasingly little to show for it. This season of Shrill <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/hulu-shrill-season-2-review/\">copped some criticism</a> for the cycle of their relationship, where he\u2019s unable to step up and be an adult partner for her, and she moves on, believing him when he says he\u2019ll do better next time. A friend echoed a similar frustration to me over text when she binged the series, declaring that Annie is too good for him. But that kind of feels like the point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/06/wallace-and-gromit-and-shaun-the-sheep-why-i-reach-for-them-in-dark-times\">Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep: why I reach for them in dark times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s something incredibly revealing in seeing how, when it comes to romance, fat women are implicitly instructed to receive the bare minimum \u2013 and be grateful for it. What plays out between Annie and Ryan on screen is a reflection of reality for a lot of women who look and feel like she does. And after finding confidence in herself throughout season one, this series culminates in her using that confidence to demand better for herself from her partner.</p> <p>Stacked up next to something like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 another series produced by American streaming service Hulu \u2013 Shrill\u2019s concerns seem comparatively minor. The chronicle of one woman in a sort-of bad job with a kinda-shitty boyfriend as she slowly acquires the confidence to see both \u2013 and the rest of her life \u2013 with more clear-eyed confidence seems tiny and low-stakes in the midst of a global catastrophe. But it\u2019s also intimate and personal, and encourages similar interrogation of the tiny, snowballing injustices we\u2019ve accepted because we feared the repercussions of making a fuss.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Shrill is currently available to stream in Australia on SBS On Demand</em></p>",
  "<p>The news is overwhelming and exhausting in a way it has rarely been in most of our lifetimes, but if you have five minutes of energy left this is worth your attention. That it hasn\u2019t been reported in most of Australia\u2019s major news outlets doesn\u2019t make that any less the case.</p> <p>Across nine days last month, Prof Terry Hughes from James Cook University travelled the length of the Great Barrier Reef in a small plane to survey the health of more than 1,000 individual sites. He was joined by an observer from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a government agency.</p> <p>Hughes has been here before. It was his work in 2016 and 2017 that told us there had been back-to-back mass bleaching events that ultimately killed an estimated 49% of shallow water corals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">Great Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His technique sounds uncomplicated, but it relies on sharp observational skills honed over decades. Reefs are filmed, assessed and scored. If 60% of coral on a reef has been drained of its colour it is considered severely bleached. Where possible, the assessments are checked and confirmed in the water.</p> <p>Hughes this week released maps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">that show 25% of reefs falling into this category</a>, with another 35% having recorded modest bleaching. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/26/great-barrier-reefs-latest-bleaching-confirmed-by-marine-park-authority\">marine park authority has confirmed</a> it is the third mass bleaching event to hit the global landmark in just five years. It is the most widespread and second most severe episode of its type on record.</p> <p>Crucially, areas that previously escaped bleaching at the southern end, particularly those near or below Mackay, have been badly hit. The affected reefs include those around the Keppel group of islands, where Pauline Hanson was filmed diving in 2016 as she <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-25/pauline-hanson-visits-the-great-barrier-reef-climate-change/8059142\">denied bleaching was a significant problem</a>. Hughes says the coral there is now \u201csnow white\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/05/rescuing-the-great-barrier-reef-how-much-can-be-saved-and-how-can-we-do-it\">Rescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The impact of bleaching is now cumulative. Across the three events, in 2016 , 2017 and 2020, reefs along nearly the full length of the 2,300km natural wonder have been severely affected. Some of the staghorn corals in the south this year are expected to die in the months ahead, and turn a scuzzy brown as they are swamped by algae. Others will survive but be less resilient and aren\u2019t likely to make it next time bleaching hits.</p> <p>Unprecedented is a word that gets thrown around so often now that it has lost meaning but it is a clear understatement when describing what has happened here.</p> <p>Look at it this way: when the Australian government last reported to the Unesco world heritage centre on the health of the reef back in 2015 \u2013 a moment that led to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/26/australia-lobbying-to-stop-great-barrier-reef-making-in-danger-list\">extended diplomatic dance by the Coalition government</a> to avoid it being labelled world heritage \u201cin danger\u201d \u2013 there had been only two mass bleaching events in observed history, and none since 2002.</p> <p>Since then, the reef has bleached more years than not. The two most recent events have been in both years when there was no El Ni\u00f1o, the climate cycle in the Pacific that inflates water temperatures.</p> <p>It suggests the underlying global heating is now at a level that an extended spell of warm weather is enough to leave the reef stricken. Next summer is considered a reasonable chance to bring another El Ni\u00f1o on top of that.</p> <p>Hughes took to Twitter on Tuesday to express his heartbreak at again seeing the natural monument he has dedicated his life to studying irrevocably hurt, and raise doubts whether he would make the trip again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ProfTerryHughes/status/1247367294029672448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m not sure I have the fortitude to do this again.

It is rare for public officials to speak their minds in ways that may be uncomfortable for their elected overlords but, in an interview with my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graham-readfearn\">Graham Readfearn</a>, Wachenfeld set out the reef\u2019s plight in clear, blunt language.</p> <p>He described the bleaching as a clear signal the reef was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">calling for urgent help</a>, warned the resilience of the reef was not limitless and said it would require the \u201cstrongest action possible\u201d on climate change to save it given the planet is headed for 3C heating \u2013 a level at which science tells us coral reefs can\u2019t be protected. </p> <p>That science was summarised by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reported a majority of tropical coral reefs <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-3/\">would disappear if heating was limited to 1.5C</a>, and would be \u201cat very high risk\u201d at just 1.2C. The globe has already warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution.</p> <p>The government\u2019s language did not match Wachenfeld\u2019s urgency. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, acknowledged mass bleaching was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and the importance of coordinated global action to cut emissions but said the focus had to be on programs to reduce the pressure on the reef and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/05/rescuing-the-great-barrier-reef-how-much-can-be-saved-and-how-can-we-do-it\">strengthen its resilience</a>.</p> <p>It echoed Scott Morrison\u2019s eventual response to the summer bushfires: conceding the role played by rising emissions but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/29/australia-already-carrying-its-load-on-emissions-and-must-adapt-to-warmer-climate-pm-says\">quickly emphasising adaptation</a> over Australia doing more to tackle the problem at its source.</p> <p>There is another potential path, of course. Written down, it couldn\u2019t sound simpler. It is true that Australia cannot address the climate crisis on its own but it is the world\u2019s 14th biggest emitter and, as Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-news-australia-update-live-stage-2-3-lockdown-nsw-victoria-qld-scott-morrison-restrictions-cases-death-toll-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with%3Ablock-5e7d34a88f0878a2a48ab0ec\">pointed out after he joined a G20 video conference to discuss coronavirus</a>, can be influential in global debates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps\">Australia\u2019s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A growing number of analysts and policy experts, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps\">ClimateWorks Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy\">Ross Garnaut, </a>have suggested in detail that the country could set a jobs-friendly and economically sound course to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/24/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-it-a-controversial-ambition-and-will-the-coalition-adopt-it\">net-zero emissions</a>. The stimulus program that will be needed to recover from the pandemic offers a one-shot opportunity to speed up a clean transition.</p> <p>This combination of action at home combined with a new diplomatic effort would give Australia the best chance at saving the reef. At a minimum, Australia\u2019s new role as a climate hawk would point to a future in which the country embraced what will be an inevitable shift to a low-emissions world, rather than be dragged to it. And the prime minister, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/the-two-meetings-that-changed-the-trajectory-of-australias-coronavirus-response\">his new collaborative mode</a>, could have influenced others on the way.</p> <p>Unlikely, perhaps.

  "<p>It was as a direct result of a newspaper article by the former Labour MP Joe Ashton, who has died aged 86, that a compulsory register of MPs\u2019 financial interests outside Westminster was first established by the House of Commons in 1974. Ashton had called for the creation of such a register in a column he wrote for the party newspaper, Labour Weekly, under the heading MPs for Hire, and two weeks after its publication the newly elected Labour government took the first steps to seek to control political corruption.</p> <p>The February 1974 general election had been held in the middle of a scandal involving the builder John Poulson, a man with many political contacts who had been imprisoned for using bribery to win lucrative public sector contracts. Labour had campaigned on a manifesto promising a compulsory register that might prevent a repeat, and Ashton had been prompted to write his article in April 1974 by a report in the Guardian suggesting that the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\">Harold Wilson</a>, was preparing to resile from that commitment in favour of a regime of voluntary declarations of interest.</p> <p>Ashton was subsequently found (by a formal inquiry of the Commons\u2019 Committee of Privileges) to have committed a serious contempt of parliament for suggesting, in his article, that MPs were available for hire. He was obliged to apologise for being what he himself called \u201ca brave, mad whistleblower\u201d, yet it was because of the political uproar his column caused that Wilson was obliged to act so swiftly after his general election win.</p> <p>Ashton was a Yorkshireman who had a background of poverty and an instinctive populist sense of what mattered to his working-class constituents and to the Labour electorate. He was blessed with articulacy, had the ability to turn a colourful phrase and possessed a common touch \u2013 all attributes that took him into parliament and made him a punchy, popular newspaper columnist. He was an immensely active constituency MP for 33 years, but failed to progress at Westminster because of a lack of judgment that sometimes antagonised his parliamentary colleagues. He was also part of the unlucky generation of Labour MPs whose prime years at Westminster coincided with 18 years of uninterrupted Conservative government.</p> <p>Born in the slums of Attercliffe in Sheffield to teenage parents, Arthur (known as Ike) Ashton and Nellie (nee Maloney), Joe was named after an uncle who had been killed at the age of four by a runaway steamroller. His father was intermittently unemployed, although he did stand-in shifts at the local Nunnery pit and later found work in the city\u2019s steel industry. His mother was a \u201cbuffer girl\u201d, polishing nickel-plated silver cutlery. Joe passed the 11-plus to attend High Storrs grammar school, but never wore the uniform his family could not afford, something his parents were successfully advised to blame on the lack of clothing coupons under wartime rationing. At 16 he became an engineering apprentice at Rotherham Technical College and joined the Labour party.</p> <p>In 1954 he did two years\u2019 national service in the RAF, taking part in the ill-fated Suez invasion before returning to a white-collar job as a design engineer, a post he held until narrowly winning a difficult byelection in Bassetlaw in 1968. The constituency, situated in the Nottinghamshire coalfield, was at the time facing pit closures imposed by an unpopular Labour government, and Ashton\u2019s majority was reduced to 1.72%. A traditionally safe Labour \u201cred wall\u201d seat until lost to the Conservatives in December 2019, it was held by Ashton with a 36.4% majority at his last election in 1997.</p> <p>He learned politics as a shop steward and as a member of Sheffield city council from 1962 until 1969. When first elected, he was the youngest member of the council, succeeding Roy Hattersley in that distinction. Hattersley would later write, in an affectionate and forthright foreword to Ashton\u2019s first book of memoirs, Red Rose Blues (2000), that what he most admired about the author was his \u201cabsolute lack of discretion\u201d and his inability ever to moderate his support or antagonism for any cause.</p> <p>Such full-hearted enthusiasm was immediately evident at Westminster, where Ashton busily embarked on various backbench campaigns and established a high public profile as a national newspaper columnist, including briefly for the Guardian. He was parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the sports minister Denis Howell (1969-70) and after Labour\u2019s return to government did the same job for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/14/tony-benn-obituary\">Tony Benn</a> as secretary of state for industry and then energy. He was a strong leftwing supporter of Benn, encouraging him to fight Wilson as prime minister \u2013 \u201cget into the ring like Cassius Clay and knock him out,\u201d he advised Benn in 1975 \u2013 and although he was sacked as PPS for rebelling against the government in early 1976 he continued to do the job informally. He ran Benn\u2019s campaign for the Labour leadership when Wilson unexpectedly resigned in the spring of 1976, and was surprised to be appointed as an assistant whip by the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\">James Callaghan</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9/31_61_4594_2757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Lomas/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He lasted only a year in the whips\u2019 office, but it was sufficient to provide material for a stage play based on the knife-edge existence of the Callaghan government. The play, A Majority of One, was well received after performances in Oldham and Nottingham in 1981; Ashton was fond of claiming that it was the inspiration for James Graham\u2019s This House at the National Theatre 30 years later. During this period he published a political novel, Grass Roots (1977), which also garnered good reviews.</p> <p>He fell out with Benn over the latter\u2019s campaigns to introduce internal constitutional reforms within the Labour party, and thereafter became increasingly antagonistic both towards Benn and the party\u2019s leftwing. He told a fellow Labour whip that he had explained to Benn: \u201cThe trouble with you, Tony, is you think the working class are noble savages when in fact there are just as many shits among the working class as anywhere else.\u201d He criticised plans for mandatory reselection of MPs at successive party conferences and was slow-handclapped in 1980 when he warned that reselection could hasten defections to a breakaway party, as indeed happened when the SDP was launched the following year.</p> <p>Ashton spent two years on the opposition frontbench as an energy spokesman from 1979. Thereafter he returned to the backbenches and sat on various select committees: trade and industry (1987-92), home affairs (1989-92), national heritage (1992-97) and on the select committee charged with modernising the House of Commons (1997-98). He chaired the all-party football committee from 1992 until he retired at the 2001 election, and was a passionate supporter of Sheffield Wednesday football club, of which he was a director from 1990 to 1999.</p> <p>In 1998 Ashton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/16/michaelwhite\">on the premises of a Thai massage parlour</a> in Northampton during a police raid for suspected immigration offences. The following year it was disclosed that he had been questioned by police, although he had committed no offence. He wrote later in his memoirs that he had acted on a \u201ccrazy impulse\u201d. The chapter was entitled All Political Careers End in Tears. In retirement he founded the Association for Former Members of Parliament in 2001. He also published a second book of Sheffield memoirs, Joe Blow \u2013 his childhood nickname \u2013 in 2014, and donated the proceeds to the Salvation Army. He was appointed OBE in 2007.</p> <p>He married Margaret (Maggie) Lee, a former secretary at the Sheffield Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society coal depot, in 1957. She died in 2014 and he is survived by their daughter, Lucy.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph William Ashton, politician, born 9 October 1933; died 30 March 2020</p>",

  "<p>The coronavirus crisis seems to be placing everything under a harsh, unforgiving spotlight: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/lockdown-britain-victorian-class-divide\">economic inequality</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/doctors-nurses-lack-of-equipment-johnson-government\"> the vulnerabilities of healthcare systems</a>, the fragility of globalisation and the challenges of dealing with scientific uncertainty. Here\u2019s another issue for that list: men\u2019s health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">Men are much more likely to die from coronavirus - but why?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s no secret that males are in many respects the frailer sex. On average, men die younger and are at more risk of life-threatening ailments, especially heart disease and many forms of cancer. The Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus seems to follow the same pattern. In all six of the countries that, up to 20 March, had sex-specific records of deaths from Covid-19, the proportion of men was higher than women. For four of those (China, France, Italy and South Korea), male mortality rates were more than 50% greater than female rates.</p> <p>It\u2019s best not to place too much trust in the exact figures: some of the data could be skewed by differences in the extent of testing, and how deaths are recorded and reported. But there seems good reason to trust the general trend: this coronavirus hits men harder.</p> <p>We don\u2019t know why \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect differences in biology. Covid-19 is more dangerous for people with existing health issues, particularly cardiovascular or pulmonary (lung-obstructing) problems or hypertension \u2013 and these are all conditions that disproportionately affect men.</p> <p>Part of the reason for that is behavioural: on average, men indulge in more health-damaging habits such as smoking and drinking. Smoking is particularly suspected to cause the higher risk in men: in South Korea, where the ratio of male to female Covid-19 deaths is close to 2:1, the male smoking rate is the highest of all OECD countries, while the female smoking rate is the lowest. It\u2019s possible that other differences in behaviour also play a part \u2013 for example, compliance with handwashing advice.</p> <p>Yet biological differences could well be involved too. Men have weaker immune systems and so are more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases, such as those caused by bacteria. One potential explanation is that sex hormones, which differ in men and women, are involved in the way the immune system triggers an inflammatory response to pathogens.</p> <p>Based on past pandemics, we would expect that SARS-CoV-2 would pose a greater risk to men. This coronavirus is closely related to the virus that caused the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003, for which the mortality rate was significantly higher for men. In Hong Kong, for example, 21.9% of males with the disease died, compared with 13.2% of females. Here too it is possible that the higher proportion of smokers among men contributed to the difference \u2013 but one study found that there was also a higher death rate among male mice infected with the Sars virus, suggesting that sex differences in the immune response were responsible too.</p> <p>There\u2019s still plenty that we don\u2019t understand about the sex differences seen so far for Covid-19. But there is also plenty to reflect on. Sex differences in our vulnerability to this coronavirus and other life-threatening diseases are shaped by social norms and practices. On the one hand, drug testing has <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/550S18a\">neglected women</a> (as well as females in animal tests), sometimes on the grounds that their hormonal cycles \u201ccomplicate\u201d the results, with the consequence that some approved drugs have had disproportionate and unforeseen side-effects on women. On the other hand, we insist on portraying men as the \u201cstronger sex\u201d to whom seeking medical help is a sign of weakness \u2013 until suddenly it\u2019s too late.</p> <p>Our societies often seem determined to encourage these disparities. Cigarette marketing, at least until the 1980s, targeted men with stereotypes of the rugged, independent male. Today, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19124303\">smoking is seen in China</a> and other Asian countries not just as masculine but as an almost essential aspect of business relations and male bonding. While many problems of gender disparities in global health stem from underrepresentation of women in all sectors, reinforcement of such stereotypes causes problems for both sexes.</p> <p>And although health conditions fall more heavily on men, they are also less likely to do anything about it. Many studies show that women are considerably more likely to seek healthcare advice. Even though men are at greater risk of many types of cancer, one <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6016653/\">recent study</a> in the US suggested that only men who had already received a cancer diagnosis used healthcare services as frequently as women. Without making any assumptions about individual cases, the cliche of an ill man who dragged himself prematurely back to work and only made things worse is partly grounded in reality.</p> <p>The sex differences in susceptibility to Covid-19, then, are a reminder of issues we have long known about but are failing to address. Even the highly incomplete statistics on these differences themselves reflect a failure to recognise longstanding <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/SexGenderInfectDis.pd\">WHO recommendations</a> to separate the numbers by sex, so causes and responses can be better understood. Probably for both biological and cultural reasons, men and women are often affected differently by disease. But until we understand why, we are all the losers.</p> <p>\u2022 Philip Ball is a science writer</p>",
  "<p>Air pollution is linked to significantly higher rates of death in people with Covid-19, according to analysis.</p> \n<p>The work shows that even a tiny, single-unit increase in particle pollution levels in the years before the pandemic is associated with a 15% increase in the death rate. The research, done in the US, calculates that slightly cleaner air in Manhattan in the past could have saved hundreds of lives.</p> \n<p>Given the large differences in toxic air levels across countries, the research suggests people in polluted areas are far more likely to die from the coronavirus than those living in cleaner areas. The scientists said dirty air was already known to increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is extremely deadly and a cause of Covid-19-related deaths, as well as other respiratory and heart problems.</p> \n<p>A separate report from scientists in Italy notes that the high death rates seen in the north of the country correlate with the highest levels of air pollution.</p> \n<p>The scientists said their findings could be used to ensure that areas with high levels of air pollution take extra precautions to slow the spread of the virus and deploy extra resources to deal with the outbreak. Air pollution has already fallen because of widespread lockdowns, but the scientists said ensuring cleaner air in the future would help reduce Covid-19 deaths.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/covid-pm\">study</a>, by researchers at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston,analysed air pollution and Covid-19 deaths up to 4 April in 3,000 US counties, covering 98% of the population. \u201cWe found that an increase of only 1\u03bcg/m3 in PM2.5 [particles] is associated with a 15% increase in the Covid-19 death rate,\u201d the team concluded.</p> \n<p>A small increase in exposure to particle pollution over 15-20 years was already known to increase the risk of death from all causes, but the new work shows this increase is 20 times higher for Covid-19 deaths.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe results are statistically significant and robust,\u201d they said. The study took account of a range of factors, including poverty levels, smoking, obesity, and the number of Covid-19 tests and hospital beds available.

In light of this, we should consider additional measures to protect ourselves from pollution exposure to reduce the Covid-19 death toll.\u201d</p> \n<p>The authors said the results highlighted the need to keep enforcing existing air pollution regulations, and that failure to do so could potentially increase the Covid-19 death toll.

  "<p>The language of war is baked in to most of us, to one degree or other. Our new daily discourse runs deep with talk of field hospitals, frontlines, the battles against an invisible enemy.

According to the breakfast interview inquiries thrown at Michael Gove, it seems that one of the primary questions is whether Raab is now technically in charge of the UK\u2019s response to a notional nuclear attack. I suppose we have to treat this as a matter of vital pertinence, though like many people living through this 100-year deadly pandemic, I\u2019d have just three words for any nuclear power contemplating an imminent first strike at the UK: not now, mate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/boris-johnson-illness-horror-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson's illness is a message to us all about the horror of coronavirus | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the news gets more horrifyingly real each day \u2013 and somehow, at the same time, more unmanageably unreal \u2013 I\u2019m not sure who this register of battle and victory and defeat truly aids. We don\u2019t really require a metaphor to throw the horror of viral death into sharper relief: you have to think it\u2019s bad enough already. Plague is a standalone horseman of the apocalypse \u2013 he doesn\u2019t need to catch a ride with war. Equally, it\u2019s probably unnecessary to rank something we keep being informed is virtually a war with things in the past that were literally wars. \u201cYour grandparents were called to war,\u201d runs <a href=\"https://makeameme.org/meme/your-grandparents-were\">one popular meme</a>. \u201cYou\u2019re being asked to sit on a couch. You can do this.\u201d Unsurprisingly, given this level of bellicose confusion, we have already seen those who visit the park literally branded \u201ctraitors\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, it should be said that people don\u2019t die from this ghastly illness because of a lack of fight, whatever that might mean. Patients don\u2019t \u201close\u201d against coronavirus because they failed to smite it or to personally out-strategise it. In recent years there has been a growing attempt to actually listen to people with cancer on the language used around the disease, and mountains of evidence has found that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/28/stop-fighting-cancer-ordinary-illness-language\">largely disdain</a> and frequently loathe the characterisation of their sickness as a \u201cbattle\u201d. The absurdity of putting the burden of healing on the patient incenses many, who don\u2019t care to be told that they are \u201cwinning their war\u201d, or to be remembered as having \u201clost their battle\u201d.</p> <p>Writing on the death of Robin Gibb, Jenni Murray (herself a former cancer patient), righteously refused to characterise him as having lost any battle, instead stating the reality: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/hei-fi/views/jenni-murray-dont-tell-me-canceris-a-battle-7777803.html\">he drew the short straw</a> of a difficult disease\u201d. Or think of the late great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/21/deborah-orr-obituary\">Deborah Orr</a>\u2019s withering refusal to tolerate this nonsense in her rules on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/18/10-things-not-say-when-ill\">how to talk to cancer patients</a>. \u201cFunnily enough,\u201d ran some typically twinkly menace, \u201cit\u2019s not comforting to be told that you have to go into battle with your disease, like some kind of medieval knight on a romantic quest. Submitting to medical science, in the hope of a cure, is just that \u2013 a submission. The idea that illness is a character test, with recovery as a reward for the valiant, is glib to the point of insult.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it would be better for us all if we resisted talking about coronavirus in this way. Last year, new research found that the ubiquity of military metaphors in cancer discussions could do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/10/war-cancer-metaphors-harm-research-shows\">more psychological harm</a> than good, making people fatalistic about treatment chances and encouraging the feeling that altering their own behaviours was beyond them.</p> <p>In our current crisis, it is interesting how the language of war is used, and by whom. Without wishing to over-generalise about that innate desire to be a hero, women in public life seem to do it rather less. Health workers themselves do it even more sparingly. Easily the most powerful thing I have seen thus far in the coverage of the deepening virus crisis was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrfRs0WeShU\">a report screened on BBC News</a>, which was given access to an intensive care ward at University College hospital in London.</p> <p>The BBC correspondent framed his film entirely in terms of war: \u201cThis is the frontline in a war,\u201d it began. \u201cEvery day some battles are won and some are lost.\u201d That\u2019s certainly not a judgment on the excellent report \u2013 it may be a helpful way of communicating the desperation to many people. But it was notable that the hospital workers themselves never strayed into that kind of terminology. I can\u2019t shake the memory of the female ER worker talking about how impossibly difficult some doctors and nurses found the unique work of the Covid-19 ICU. I don\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been on shift, but she spoke absolutely fluently and with absolutely no judgment. \u201cSome of our staff can\u2019t cope with it \u2026 not all of them can deal with it.\u201d Not for her the veil of platitudes about heroes or battlers or victories. The grim bathos of reality is more powerful. I felt the lurch again reading a Guardian report about the desperate shortage of PPE in care homes, in which the executive chair of the National Care Association spoke plainly. \u201cOnce you run out,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/06/residential-homes-desperate-for-ppe-as-two-care-workers-die\">Marigolds and bin </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/06/residential-homes-desperate-for-ppe-as-two-care-workers-die\">liners</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Oof. I wonder, incidentally, if I am alone in having felt the absence of any women in the government\u2019s \u201cwar cabinet\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-stress-test-cabinet-rishi-sunak\">five top ministers</a>, and whether we\u2019d be hearing quite so much about wars and battles if there were more? I understand, of course, that this is where the cards fell \u2013 there are a whole six women in the cabinet, and ministers can only do the jobs that were put in front of them months before this crisis exploded. Even so, I feel the imbalance.</p> <p>Then again, on Sunday night, the Queen made an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">address to the nation</a> that \u2013 to surprise in some quarters \u2013 ended up being powerful even to many of those who feel the Jedi mind trick of royalty does not usually work on them. Her Majesty certainly mentioned the war. But she provided something that has not been in ready supply from government podiums over the past few weeks, yet is arguably needed more and more as the darkness sets in: a strangely homespun oratory. Castlespun, whatever.</p> <p>This was not the oratory we associate with soaring wartime speeches or martial inspiration. The callback to her first broadcast, made in 1940 to evacuated children, was particularly affecting. For all the second world war metaphors we\u2019ve had over the past month, this was the first time the parallel was made explicitly with what war really means for the vast, vast majority, who don\u2019t regard it as a chance to be the hero of popular stereotype and earn their glorious mentions in dispatches. For them \u2013 for us \u2013 war is a state of fear, of seeing our children frightened, of being the victims of immense disruption, and of being separated or sundered from many of those we love.

Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments.</p> <p> The new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time.</p> <p>Indeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions \u2013 which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years \u2013 is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff07ea90cd3d5700880f6cd7ec8076951650d6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff07ea90cd3d5700880f6cd7ec8076951650d6c/0_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lava piles of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province in Morocco (Midelt)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lava piles of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province in Morocco (Midelt)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Marzoli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That, they say, offers a sobering warning for today. \u201c[This] suggests that the end-Triassic climatic and environmental changes, driven by CO2 emissions, may have been similar to those predicted for the near future,\u201d the team write.</p> <p>Capriolo stressed the similarity in CO2 levels was striking. \u201cThe end-Triassic world and the modern one are very different, as well as the origin of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we, as geoscientists, announce this alarming comparison,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15325-6\">Writing in the journal Nature Communications</a>, Capriolo and colleagues report how they studied more than 200 samples of rock from North America, Morocco and Portugal. These were deposited towards the end of the Triassic, in volcanic activity that contributed to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent and the opening up of the central Atlantic Ocean, with the rocks creating what is known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province \u2013 a vast expanse covering an area about a third of the size the moon.</p> <p>The team found around 10% of the samples showed the presences of bubbles within small blobs of magma trapped by crystals in the rocks, most of which were found to contain carbon dioxide. Further analysis, they say, suggests the gas probably became entrapped deep within the Earth\u2019s crust, suggesting it originated in the lower-middle crust or in the mantle.</p> <p>From these findings the team were able to calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide that would have been present in the magma of the volcanic eruptions, revealing that up to 100,000 Gt of carbon dioxide would have been released in total as the volcanic rocks were laid down.</p> <p>Dr Jessica Whiteside, associate professor of geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was not involved in the work, said the role of volcanic activity in the end-Triassic mass extinction had been a matter of much debate. \u201cOver the past 30 years, the question as to whether widespread volcanic eruptions trigger climatic effects severe enough to result in extinction has waxed and waned, from most certainly no to most certainly yes,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The new study, she said, added weight to the latter view. \u201cThe study reports new evidence that is the most conclusive that has been produced for CO2 being emitted directly from individual lava eruptions relating to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province,\u201d she said, adding that the report reveals pulses of the eruptions spewed out amounts on a par to those produced by human activities, with devastating effects.</p> <p>That, Whiteside added, provided lessons for today. \u201cThe initiation of these eruptions created one of the warmest climate since the dawn of animal life on our planet, and coincided with massive extinction on land and in the oceans,\u201d she said.</p>",
  "<p>A rare hole has opened up in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ozone-layer\">ozone layer</a> above the Arctic, in what scientists say is the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole.</p> <p>The hole, which has been tracked from space and the ground over the past few days, has reached record dimensions, but is not expected to pose any danger to humans unless it moves further south. If it extends further south over populated areas, such as southern Greenland, people would be at increased risk of sunburn. However, on current trends the hole is expected to disappear altogether in a few weeks.</p> <p>Low temperatures in the northern polar regions led to an unusual stable polar vortex, and the presence of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere \u2013 from human activities \u2013 caused the hole to form.</p> <p>\u201cThe hole is principally a geophysical curiosity,\u201d said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. \u201cWe monitored unusual dynamic conditions, which drive the process of chemical depletion of ozone. [Those dynamics] allowed for lower temperatures and a more stable vortex than usual over the Arctic, which then triggered the formation of polar stratospheric clouds and the catalytic destruction of ozone.\u201d</p> <p>The hole is not related to the Covid-19 shutdowns that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\">drastically cut air pollution</a> and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is also too early to say whether the unusually stable Arctic polar vortex conditions are linked with the climate crisis, or part of normal stratospheric weather variability.</p> <p>Peuch said there were no direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/global-efforts-on-ozone-help-reverse-southern-jet-stream-damage\">implications for the climate crisis</a>. Temperatures in the region are already increasing, slowing the depletion of ozone, and the hole will start to recede as polar air mixes with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. The last time similar conditions were observed was in spring 2011.</p> <p>The hole was tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, based partly in Reading and funded by the European commission.</p> <p>While a hole over the Arctic is a rare event, the much larger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ozone-layer\">hole in the ozone layer</a> over the Antarctic has been a major cause for concern for more than four decades. The production of ozone-depleting chemicals has been drastically reduced, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, but some sources appear still to be functioning \u2013 in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/china-factories-releasing-thousands-of-tonnes-of-illegal-cfc-gases-study-finds\">unauthorised emissions</a> were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/09/mysterious-source-of-illegal-ozone-killing-emissions-revealed-say-investigators\">detected from eastern China</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/05/ozone-layer-healing-after-aerosols-un-northern-hemisphere\">Antarctic ozone hole</a> was the smallest in 35 years last November, showing the success of efforts to cut the production of the harmful pollutants. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p> <p>New sources of ozone-depleting chemicals were not a factor in the hole observed in the Arctic, said Peuch. \u201cHowever, this is a reminder that one should not take the Montreal Protocol measures for granted, and that observations from the ground and from satellites are pivotal to avoid a situation where the chlorine and bromine levels in the stratosphere could increase again.\u201d</p>",

Based on studies of disasters such as floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, an estimated<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902711\"> 10% of people</a> affected by traumatic events go on to develop severe psychological problems such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These symptoms typically arise soon after the disaster. Such findings suggest that 10% of people affected by coronavirus \u2013 possibly more \u2013 will develop psychological disorders during or after this pandemic.</p> <p>However, if coronavirus is anything like Sars, this percentage could be substantially higher among those infected with the virus. A number of people who had been hospitalised with Sars in 2003 later developed PTSD. A four-year follow-up study of 70 Sars survivors found that 44% of people <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112559/\">developed </a>the disorder. Even after recovering from Sars, 82% of these people had PTSD years later. PTSD symptoms tended to be more severe in people who had a high mortality risk, low social support, and close relatives who suffered or died from Sars.</p> <p>It\u2019s likely that even those who aren\u2019t infected with coronavirus could also develop psychological symptoms. Isolation and confinement, even if only for a few weeks, can cause lasting anxiety. People quarantined for prolonged periods in cramped accommodation, sharing a bedroom with multiple occupants, or trapped at home in an abusive or coercive relationship, may be especially vulnerable to developing PTSD symptoms during and after the outbreak.</p> <p>Other psychological effects will have more to do with environmental and social changes. Covid-19 has forced societies to trial entirely new ways of living. School lessons have moved online; work meetings take place over Zoom; groceries are delivered via Amazon. We\u2019re living through the first global pandemic in the digital age, where the internet has made it possible to withdraw from the outside world.</p> <p>Even before the outbreak, people were already working from home, shopping online, and having food delivered, rather than going to restaurants. The outbreak may have further entrenched the direction in which society was already heading. After coronavirus has passed, we may find that life never fully returns to \u201cnormal\u201d. Risk-averse, digitally connected people could continue retreating to the safety of home.</p> <p>As a result of Covid-19, some people will become fastidious germophobes, striving to avoid touching \u201ccontaminated\u201d surfaces or shaking hands. Germ phobias, which are typically symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders, arise from a combination of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26630089\">genetic and environmental factors</a> that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22024245\">interact</a> with one another. In other words, when a person with a particular genetic makeup has a traumatic experience with infections (such as developing a severe case of Covid-19), they are likely to develop a germ phobia. Such phobias are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24084621\">typically chronic</a>, although milder phobias may be short-lived.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/six-in-10-people-in-uk-have-felt-anxious-about-coronavirus\">Six in 10 people in UK have felt anxious about coronavirus \u2013 poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, there is some cause for optimism.

However, getting approval from the Department of Interior to shut down requires that state and county health authorities petition the interior secretary and make the case that the park poses a public health threat.</p> <p>In the absence of this approval, superintendents have implemented piecemeal facility closures to try to protect staff from exposure to coronavirus, such as shutting visitor centers and closing roads.

But national parks are designed to concentrate people on to developed trails to protect the environment, and this makes following current CDC guidelines for social distancing tough.</p> <p>\u201cI wish we could find refuge in national parks right now but in many cases the parks are too crowded to be safe,\u201d said Phil Francis, chair of the Coalition to Protect America\u2019s National Parks, which represents more than 1,800 current and retired NPS employees. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible to keep people far enough apart on the trails. If CDC guidelines aren\u2019t being followed then the parks need to be closed.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to hazards posed to park staff and locals in communities where parks are located, the cross-country travel that national park visitation encourages poses its own threat. \u201cPeople want to drive out to where it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said Steve Howe, a canyoneering guide living near Capitol Reef, \u201cbut they are visiting all the services en route and transmitting disease from areas of high urban density to rural areas every time they stop for gas or at a convenience store.

  "<p>Brian Limond is coping remarkably well with the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cI don\u2019t like going out, so I never really leave the house,\u201d he says over the phone from his Glaswegian abode. \u201cStaying in is fine by me.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a mantra which has come to shape his decade-long career producing some of television\u2019s most irreverent and obscure comedy. Starting out with a series of short-form online sketches filmed largely alone in his house, Limond \u2013 aka Limmy \u2013 built a cult following hooked on his malleable face, wry observations and pitch-black humour. In 2010 he released the first season of Limmy\u2019s Show on BBC Scotland and introduced recurring characters such as the chronically paranoid stoner Dee Dee, the recovering heroin addict Jacqueline and fantasy gamer Falconhoof. Three seasons on, with three books under his belt \u2013 two short story collections and his autobiography, published in 2019 \u2013 he is returning to his housebound roots with the first full season of Limmy\u2019s Homemade Show.</p> <p>\u201cIt all coincidentally looks like something I\u2019ve filmed since lockdown began because it\u2019s just me and the camera, and if I do go outside, I make sure there\u2019s no one else there,\u201d he says. The result is somehow both inane and profound all at once; a repeated treatise on a kitchen game that involvs throwing a tea bag into a cup, Limond imagining his first day at an office job, a walk through an underpass, all of it underscored with pathos and absurd hilarity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/jul/25/brian-limmy-limond-comedian\">Limmy: \u2018In my mind, I can joke about anything\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps this mixture of the mundane and the serious comes from Limond\u2019s writing process. \u201cI just go about the house and see if there\u2019s any ideas around,\u201d he says. \u201cI sit in the living room and look around and think, is there anything interesting here? And then I go to the kitchen and the toilet. If I can think of something funny in there, that\u2019s a good start \u2013 I\u2019ll stick with it and see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Taking observational comedy to its core of simply looking, Limond\u2019s sketches are known for deftly walking the knife\u2019s edge between tragedy and laughter, often incorporating themes of trauma, suicide and violence. \u201cWhen I\u2019m making something, I prefer it to be darker and maybe that just comes from my experiences growing up in Glasgow,\u201d he says. \u201cI like stuff that isn\u2019t particularly funny, too, just observations we drag out, or making stupid faces and then being serious again.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to his own tastes, though, Limond is characteristically unpredictable. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t always have to be darkness for something to be funny,\u201d he says. \u201cTake Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys \u2013 OK, I\u2019m not sitting here waiting for it to come on, but I do like it.

Limond has become something of an arbiter of online cancel culture \u2013 where celebrities or members of the public get called out for past wrongdoings \u2013 although he sees it as a grey area. \u201cIt can be great to hold people to account and make them pay for doing or saying something horrific, whereas before there was fuck all,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as much as I like people getting punished for bad things, is it a life sentence for everything?

If I can expose the weaknesses in myself, they can\u2019t be uncovered,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t write about my life with the aim of then saying, \u2018This is how you can get better\u2019.

  "<p>Darrell Shephard and his family had been living in Berriew, a small village in rural Powys, for 12 years when the owners of Groes-y-Garreg farm, just up the road, put in a planning application to be allowed to raise 100,000 chickens.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 14 family homes within 500 metres, and ours is 300 metres from the farm, which is traditionally a dairy,\u201d Shephard told the Guardian. \u201cI understand why many farmers need to diversify, but I had no idea about intensive chicken farming until it came to my doorstep. This isn\u2019t farming, it\u2019s a large, busy 24/7 automated factory.\u201d</p> <p>The county of Powys runs from the Brecon Beacons up to brooding Snowdonia. But these days, with an almost 100% increase in intensive farming since 2011, it is known as the \u201cpoultry capital of Wales\u201d. There are now 116 intensive poultry units (IPUs) in the county, each raising more than 40,000 birds. With an estimated 8.5 million chickens on permitted units in Powys, that is 64 times more chickens than people. <br><br>Large-scale intensive pig and poultry facilities require a permit from the Environment Agency to operate. In Wales these are issued by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). Of the 36 permits issued since 2017, 29 (81%) have been in Powys and concerned residents are campaigning to stop them.</p> <p>\u201cWe moved here for a peaceful rural lifestyle,\u201d says Shephard. \u201cBut if this chicken factory gets built it will be no different to living in an industrial area. Our narrow village roads are totally unsuitable and the noise will keep us awake. Other people near these complain of unbearable smells and fly swarms too.\u201d The Guardian was unable to reach the owners of Groes-y-Garreg farm for comment. The company who made the application for the farm had no comment to make.<br><br>The residents of Berriew are not the only ones opposing IPUs in Powys \u2013 others include the <a href=\"http://ecotipus.co.uk/\">Llanerchydol</a><a href=\"http://ecotipus.co.uk/\"> residents</a> who are resisting plans for a \u201cmega farm\u201d unit for 15,000 birds at Frochas, and residents near Llangadfan who are trying to stop a <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/local-hubs/mid-wales/welshpool/2019/12/05/smell-and-health-worries-over-chicken-farm-plan/\">120,000-chicken facility.</a></p> <h2>Surge in poultry farms</h2> <p>Supporters of intensive farming say the developments create much-needed diversification for farmers, as well as employment and support for the local economy.

At present, only pig and poultry facilities housing more than 2,000 pigs, 750 breeding sows or 40,000 birds require an environmental impact assessment from NRW. The problem for the Powys community, however, is that the region has also seen the growth of unregulated poultry farms, producing broilers and free-range eggs. Such units only require planning permission.</p> <p>\u201cSmall villages are being ringed with units,\u201d says Kibble. \u201cLlanwnog has five, with another in planning and Llanfair Caereinion and Meifod have numerous units too. It\u2019s essential that all potential impacts are looked at in combination and determinations made on the basis of independent expert analysis.\u201d</p> <h2>Risk to human health and wildlife</h2> <p>Intensive poultry operations have <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749113002595\">been linked</a> to local biodiversity damage from ammonia emissions. Simon Bareham, principal air quality adviser at NRW, says: \u201cThe rise of IPUs in the region is totally unprecedented and in areas like Powys, we know the ammonia is coming from poultry \u2013 its levels have reverted to those in 1990. The rapid expansion of the poultry industry poses the greatest short-term threat to biodiversity in Wales that I have experienced in over 30 years.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GH000103\">2017 report</a> by the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences says that residents and farmers near intensive units are at increased risk of harmful bacteria, infectious diseases, viruses and air pollutants: \u201cThe current situation in densely populated livestock farming areas could be regarded as a \u2018natural experiment\u2019\u201d, it concluded.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The greatest short-term threat to biodiversity in Wales that I have experienced in over 30 years</p> <footer> <cite>Simon Bareham, Natural Resources Wales</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2018, the Welsh government told local planning authorities to exercise particular care when considering developments that would bring livestock units within close proximity to homes, schools and hospitals.

The planning process allows members of the public to view the information submitted in support of the application and to make comments. Such comments are also taken into account in the decision making process in so far as they are relevant and material.\u201d</p> <p>However, Russell George, the Welsh assembly member for Montgomeryshire, says communities have yet to witness any change \u2013 of the two environmental permits issued to IPUs this year, both are near other poultry units, and a Powys county council planning meeting heard in February that the authority is not currently monitoring the numbers of IPUs in the region, and has given planning permission for a new 100,000-broiler unit at Lower Trederwen farm.</p> <p>Bareham says: \u201cSomeone in the planning system has to ask when is enough enough? How many poultry units are we going to have in Powys?\u201d</p> <p>For Darrell Shephard and the residents of Berriew, any changes may be too late: \u201cIf I wanted to build a factory in the same location, the same size, pumping out pollution, it would be laughed out of planning.

  "<p>Unlike the financial crisis of a decade ago, coronavirus is not at root a manmade disaster, but it struck a society weakened and undermined by a decade of economic stagnation and nearly \u00a340bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/23/welfare-spending-uk-poorest-austerity-frank-field\">slashed</a> from social security with the acquiescence of the pre-Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/21/labour-disarray-welfare-48-mps-defy-whips\">Labour </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/21/labour-disarray-welfare-48-mps-defy-whips\">party</a>.</p> <p>Now the rules have been torn up. A \u00a3330bn package of support is available for businesses, while welfare systems were rapidly made temporarily more generous to the tune of \u00a37bn. The state is now capable of stepping in to cover the salaries and sick pay of millions, to the fury of the <a href=\"https://iea.org.uk/media/government-jobs-scheme-gives-business-wrong-incentives/\">Institute of Economic Affairs</a>.</p> <p>The job retention scheme was <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wages-welfare-and-wellbeing/\">demanded</a> by Labour and trade unions, with details being hammered out between the TUC, CBI and the Treasury. Though it keeps in place employers\u2019 roles in deciding whether, when and who to lay off, it seems vastly preferable to the situation in the United States, where a third of workers appear likely to have to fall back on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/us-unemployment-congress-must-act\">unemployment insurance</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any demands for permanent social change need to connect the current crisis with long-term problems, if not to seem unconvincingly opportunist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government has rightly been criticised for not covering everyone who needs support and for the ludicrously low level of statutory sick pay, which Matt Hancock sheepishly <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-statutory-sick-pay-matt-hancock-question-time-covid-19-a9413821.html\">admitted</a> he couldn\u2019t live on. And for the<a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/sick-pay-all\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/sick-pay-all\">2 million employees </a>earning too little to qualify even for that and for the lack of help for those whose hours have been reduced but who won\u2019t see their <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/claimant-compliance-manual/ccm1135\">tax credits</a> rise in response. For workers who started after 28 February or are leaving their jobs, the safety net means the slim pickings of universal credit.</p> <p>The subsequent similar scheme for the self-employed will leave some even <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14772\">better off</a> than if coronavirus hadn\u2019t happened, but will not be paid until June and will still exclude <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14787\">2 million</a> self-employed because they earn too much, or have income from work elsewhere, or started their business after April 2019. These people will also have to rely on universal credit to get by.</p> <p>With all these flaws in the schemes and meagre fall-back, there has never been a better chance for advocates of a universal basic income (UBI): conceptually, if not practically, the simplest way to ensure nobody misses out. Long promoted by campaigners on both the left and the right, a universal payment would plug all the holes by regularly giving every adult enough to live on. The US is experimenting with something approaching it, though (so far) only as a one-off, means-tested payment.</p> <p>As yet, however, a basic income looks far from becoming a popular demand, let alone reality. Most people\u2019s regular incomes are now covered by employers or government and \u2013 as they are stuck at home with little to spend money on \u2013 it can seem like an irrelevant distraction to be demanding regular additional payments for them. There have always been other, more fundamental, arguments from <a href=\"https://newsocialist.org.uk/capitalist-and-socialist-universal-basic-incomes/\">all angles</a> against basic income. But, in terms of immediate practicality, it is hampered by the lack of a government database of people\u2019s bank accounts to make immediate payments without duplication, unlike employers and the benefits system.</p> <p>There are, however, alternatives that explicitly target only those currently missing out and that, like UBI, eliminate the upfront means test. OpenDemocracy has launched a campaign for a <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/we-must-catch-everyone-coronavirus-safety-net/\">liveable income guarantee</a> and last week the New Economics Foundation put forward its proposal for how a <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/MIG-new.pdf\">minimum income guarantee</a> might work. Set at the level of the 2019 minimum income standard of \u00a3221 a week (excluding rent), though any level could be chosen, the payment would be available to every adult not currently benefiting from the existing schemes. It would be paid immediately through the universal credit advanced payment system, but would be free from conditionality and upfront means testing, while wealthier recipients could see theirs clawed back. People waiting for payments from job retention or self-employed schemes could also claim it as an advance on those.</p> <p>As the Black Death is said to have sown the seeds for the Industrial Revolution, some have claimed coronavirus could even do for capitalism. But any demands for permanent social change need to connect the current crisis with long-term problems, if not to seem unconvincingly opportunist.</p> <p>Not only is a minimum income guarantee a more feasible short-term solution to the economic crisis precipitated by coronavirus, it highlights the need for a permanently stronger social security net \u2013 one that is humane to those who lose their jobs under all circumstances, without seeming impossible or utopian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed\">Universal basic income is the best way to help the self-employed | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most importantly, alongside any new policy ideas, the left cannot let up for a moment in pointing out the painful shortcomings exposed in public provision: the scandalous fragmented <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-52165397\">care</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/31/uk-care-home-staff-at-breaking-point-as-coronavirus-cases-rise\">system</a>; the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/long-read/coronavirus-exposes-dangers-outsourcing-nhs\">outsourcing</a> and the two-tier health workforce; the evil of \u201c<a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/04/no-recourse-to-public-funds-must-be-scrapped-both-in-this-crisis-and-beyond/\">no recourse to public funds</a>\u201d, which endangers us all; our overfilled and understaffed prisons.</p> <p>Above all, the crisis has shown the continuing dependence of society on the working class \u2013 employed in both the public and private sector, male and female, of all religious and ethnic backgrounds.

The US is now third worst-affected, with 10,993 deaths \u2013 3,485 in New York City alone.</p> <h2>Japan declares a state of emergency</h2> <p>Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has declared a state of emergency to fight new coronavirus infections in major population centres. He also unveiled a stimulus package he described as among the world\u2019s biggest to soften the economic blow. Abe announced the state of emergency targeting the capital Tokyo and six other prefectures \u2013 accounting for about 44% of Japan\u2019s population \u2013 for a period of about one month.</p> <p>\u201cWe have decided to declare a state of emergency because we\u2019ve judged that a fast spread of the coronavirus nationwide would have an enormous impact on lives and the economy,\u201d he told parliament earlier.</p> <h2>Some French cities make masks mandatory</h2> <p>A number of French cities, including Nice, have announced they plan to make face masks mandatory for those who go out. The mayor of Nice, the capital of the French Riviera, has said all city inhabitants will receive a mask within eight to 10 days that they can reuse for a month. Cannes and a few other places are following suit, and the capital, Paris, has said it is considering introducing the rule.</p> <p>French authorities have also tightened their lockdown measures in the capital by banning Parisians from outdoors sports activity between 10am and 7pm local time, aiming to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.</p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson in intensive care</strong></h2> <p>The British prime minister was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">moved to intensive care </a>on Monday night after his condition worsened.

  "<p>In 2011, when the pain of the 2008 economic crisis was still being acutely felt, grassroots activists began fighting for debt abolition. Since then, we have consistently been told by public officials from both parties that our demands were unrealistic and impractical, but we\u2019ve kept organizing.</p> <p>Coronavirus has changed the calculus. With a global pandemic and economic depression looming, the case for cancelling debt, especially student debt, has taken on a new urgency. The economy is entering freefall and millions are unable to pay their bills. With a fourth stimulus package on the horizon, now is the time for debtors to get organized and fight for what\u2019s right \u2013 full student loan abolition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/28/us-debt-collection-wage-garnishment-coronavirus\">'I have no money': debt collection continues despite pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Overnight the Democratic party has undergone a tectonic shift in regards to debt relief. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has paused all medical and student debt owed to the state. The other week, representatives Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley introduced a coronavirus-timed piece of legislation <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/reps-ilhan-omar-and-ayanna-pressley-propose-massive-st-1842458123\">that would forgive at least $30,000</a> of student debt per borrower. Similarly, Democrats in the House and Senate, led by Elizabeth Warren, pushed for a suspension of student loan payments and a $10,000 \u201cpayoff\u201d for all federal student loan borrowers to be included in the stimulus package, but were blocked by the opposition.</p> <p>Yet even Republicans, who just used a public health crisis to pull off a <a href=\"https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-bailouts-tradition-unlike-any-other/\">staggering corporate cash grab</a>, have been forced to give some ground. The Department of Education announced that most student loan borrowers will be able to suspend payments for <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahmimms/coronavirus-bill-ends-student-loan-payments-interest-6\">six months</a> without accruing interest and they are also halting collection on defaulted federal student loans <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/exclusive-devos-halts-collection-of-defaulted-federal-student-loans-146929\">\u201cuntil further notice</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/exclusive-devos-halts-collection-of-defaulted-federal-student-loans-146929\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Around the world, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51814481\">mortgage and bill collections are being paused</a>, utility shutoffs for overdue accounts are being prevented, and foreclosures and evictions halted. It turns out that changing the rules that dictate our daily financial agreements <em>is</em> possible after all, and can happen with remarkable speed. The challenge moving forward is ensuring that some of these changes stick. This crisis offers a chance to not just hit the pause button and offer temporary relief for those who are in distress, but to permanently change the rules so that untold millions of people aren\u2019t so vulnerable to begin with.</p> <p>Completely eliminating student debt would be a good place to start. All federal student debt can be erased in an instant using authority Congress has already vested in the Department of Education. But it will take a movement to push public officials to actually do it.</p> <p>We can\u2019t repeat the mistakes of 2008, when the bank bailout program left the financial sector stronger than ever while millions of families lost their homes and jobs. This time around we need a <a href=\"https://thepeoplesbailout.org/\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://thepeoplesbailout.org/\">people\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://thepeoplesbailout.org/\">bailout\u201d</a> that includes a far-reaching program of debt cancellation to help those who are not just physically vulnerable but financially precarious better weather the coming storm.</p> <p>The fact that Joe Biden is currently the Democratic frontrunner only underscores the need for grassroots pressure. Unlike Bernie Sanders, who made student and medical debt cancellation a core part of presidential candidacy long before the coronavirus hit, Biden is no friend of debtors \u2013 unsurprising for a politician from Delaware, the credit card capital of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05d11b63b7d44a9a336eda0830711051f2638f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05d11b63b7d44a9a336eda0830711051f2638f9c/0_15_6240_3744/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A person walks down Wall Street in New York.

We can\u2019t afford to let our leaders make the same mistakes again.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s track record on student debt offers another indication that he is ill-equipped to meet the moment. Consider, for example, the fact that Obama blocked tens of thousands of defrauded for-profit college borrowers who were legally entitled to relief, leaving them at the mercy of Trump\u2019s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. They also ignored the activists who pleaded with them to stop social security garnishment on the growing number of senior citizens in default on their student loans.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s higher education platform is a hodge-podge of measures including increased grant funding, some adjustments to income-based repayments and public service loan forgiveness, and to allow those with private student debt to discharge their debt in bankruptcy\u2013in other words, undoing the very 2005 bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/joe-biden-student-loan-debt-2005-act-2020\">he fought long and hard to pass</a>. Since then the nation\u2019s total student loan burden has spiked from approximately $500m to over $1.7tn. Recently, in an attempt to appeal to younger voters, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1239280175826731010?s=20\">Biden has boasted</a> about having adopted aspects of Sanders\u2019 higher education plan, but his proposals still pale in comparison to those of the senator from Vermont.</p> <p>Even under normal circumstances, Biden\u2019s half-measures would be inadequate. But at a time when the economy is going haywire and life is about to get much more difficult for poor and working people, they are unconscionable.</p> <p>Just as they did after 2008, working people need and are entitled to assistance \u2013 including, but not limited to, student debt relief. Public officials should cancel all student debt immediately. Every cancelled payment would turn into cash used to purchase things like rent and food instead. Research shows that eliminating all student debt could <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/opinions/cancel-college-debt-smarter-richer-taylor/index.html\">potentially boost GDP</a> by an estimated $108bn a year for 10 years. That\u2019s one reason calls to pause collection or fiddle with interest aren\u2019t enough. Everyone will <a href=\"https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/2020/03/factsheet-cancel-federal-student-loans-to-provide-short-and-long-term-stimulus-amid-pandemic/\">benefit from the economic stimulus</a> provided by a full jubilee, not only the approximately 45 million borrowers who would see their balances disappear. Now that\u2019s a bailout regular people can get behind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The vast majority of Americans should demand debt relief as an essential part of a sane response to the coming downturn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, most politicians rarely do the right thing of their own accord. That\u2019s why <a href=\"http://www.debtcollective.org/\">the Debt Collective</a>, a union for debtors I helped found, has launched a <a href=\"https://strike.debtcollective.org/\">scaled-up student debt strike</a> to push for a full jubilee. Over half of all student debtors are already not paying their loans in one form or another (because they already defaulted, are in forbearance or deferral, or because their income level lets them lower their payments to $0 a month) and many more will be unable to pay next month. Instead of struggling alone and being ashamed, debtors need to come out of the shadows and declare themselves on strike.</p> <p>Corporate interests are well organized and have secured trillions of dollars of no-strings-attached public money for their efforts. The vast majority of Americans are indebted, and they should make their voices heard, demanding debt relief as an essential part of a sane and just response to the coming downturn.</p> <p>We must recognize that the coronavirus outbreak is a dual crisis. It is a biological and medical emergency that exposes a deeper political and economic disaster. For millions of Americans, life was difficult even before the disease hit and now things are untenable. With jobs and income lost people will take on more debt, and huge numbers will spiral into default.</p> <p>Ultimately, we need way more than debt write-downs or even debt abolition to heal what ails us. We need to rewrite the rules of the economy so that people don\u2019t have to live in perpetual financial peril. The vast majority of working people are not indebted because they live beyond their means, but because they are denied the means to live. The case for things such as paid sick leave, universal healthcare, guaranteed housing, a public banking system, cross border-cooperation and debt abolition has never been stronger.</p> <p>These days, the words \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201capocalyptic\u201d couldn\u2019t be more apt. The first term comes from the ancient Greek and means the turning point in an illness \u2013 death or recovery, two stark alternatives. The root of \u201capocalypse\u201d means to reveal or uncover. This is the truth this apocalyptic moment unveils: to truly cure ourselves and survive this crisis we are going to need way more than a vaccine. We need to think big and completely transform our economy from the ground up, prioritizing public welfare and ecological stability over private profit, before the next big disaster hits.</p> <ul> <li><p>Astra Taylor is the author of Democracy May Not Exist, but We\u2019ll Miss It When It\u2019s Gone, an organizer with the Debt Collective, and the Puffin Foundation/Economic Hardship Reporting Project fellow</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The latest weekend in the coronavirus crisis was a tale of two lockdowns. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer was caught contradicting her own instructions and escaping to her second home, a mistake for which she paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood\">with her job</a>.

How can they not be, when the rich have escaped to second homes, when bus drivers and nurses are dying on their jobs, and when our ability to tolerate large amounts of time at home or to properly self-isolate is determined by how much space we have at our disposal? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">UK sunbathers may trigger stricter coronavirus lockdowns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Space \u2013 how it\u2019s apportioned, how it\u2019s governed, how it\u2019s made available to some and denied to others \u2013 is always political. The middle classes, accustomed to constant mobility while valorising the home as a place of comfort and safety, balk at the thought of being unable to up sticks at will.</p> <p>For the urban working class, meanwhile, trapped inside flats where children have no option other than sharing bedrooms<strong> </strong>or \u201caffordable\u201d homes built to minimal space standards, there\u2019s not so much choice. In such circumstances local parks are one of the only forms of escape: access to open spaces when you have no private outdoor space is vital to public health. </p> <p>City parks have always been about more than just leisure. Victorian reformers such as the physician John Snow, who established the link between cholera and poor sanitation, and the statistician William Farr lent their weight to middle-class campaigns for urban parks that might improve their own health through the improvement of working-class environments. In 1839 Farr noted how \u201ca park in the East End of London would probably diminish the annual deaths by several thousand \u2026 and add several years to the lives of the entire population\u201d.</p> <p>His words, supported by a mass petition to Queen Victoria, led to the creation of Hackney\u2019s Victoria Park \u2013 the \u201cpeople\u2019s park\u201d \u2013 in 1845. Brockwell Park in Lambeth, the <a href=\"https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ssh-demography-factsheet-2017.pdf\">fifth most densely populated</a> local authority in England and Wales, where 31% of residents live in poverty, reopened on Monday. But Victoria Park, in Tower Hamlets, the borough with the <a href=\"https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/Documents/Borough_statistics/Research-briefings/BP2018_3_Poverty.pdf\">highest level of child poverty</a> in Britain, has remained closed since the end of March. Meanwhile, the \u201croyal parks\u201d in sparsely populated central London and posher suburbs have stayed open throughout the lockdown<strong>.</strong> </p> <p>The cultural historian Joe Moran, writing in 2004, noted how \u201cthe reality of uneven development\u201d \u2013 the way technology forces massive changes in some areas of life while leaving others untouched \u2013 means that \u201cour surroundings become out of sync with the needs of the present and we muddle through with outmoded layouts and dilapidated systems\u201d.</p> <p>Right now, our immediate surroundings are all we have, and we are being encouraged to imagine that every home and immediate neighbourhood is as comfortable and well-resourced as the next: that everyone has a garden, a computer, a quiet room to study or work in, and a supermarket and an open space nearby.</p> <p>Moran adds: \u201cWe rarely think about the collective logic of houses, their increasing connection with global systems of production and consumption, and their crucial relationship to the other spaces of everyday life.\u201d Now we are being forced to consider those crucial relationships, such as the availability of fresh, inexpensive food within walking distance of home. Not takeaways or off-licences, but the fresh food you need to stay healthy.</p> <p>Working from home, too, is a convenience available to those whose jobs tend to involve words and numbers \u2013 better remunerated, if no less precarious, in the \u201cknowledge economy\u201d \u2013 rather than people and objects. For many on low incomes, internet connection is patchy, slow and only available on phone screens while paying through the nose for data. (Remember how Labour, last November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\">promised free </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\"> broadband</a> for all, and how everyone who already had superfast broadband laughed?)</p> <p>For many people, life at the moment resembles an endless Sunday afternoon. That presents few problems if spending Sunday afternoons \u2013 that weekly appointment with invisibility when, according to Alan Bennett, \u201cthe spirit falters\u201d \u2013 trapped indoors is well-nourished, calm and convivial. Less so in small houses with cardboard-thin walls, the washing machine running at full pelt in the open-plan kitchen/dining/living room and the telly turned up to be heard over it. There comes a time when you have to get out before one of you \u2013 perhaps all of you \u2013 will explode.</p> <p>I grew up in one of those houses, a \u201cstarter home\u201d that people end up living in for 40 years because they can\u2019t afford to \u201ctrade up\u201d. They are, to use Nye Bevan\u2019s term, not homes but \u201crabbit hutches\u201d, designed as if to weaponise nuclear families against each other. As Bevan underlined in his revolutionary stint as both health and housing minister between 1945 and 1951, there was no point in establishing a universal health service if he wasn\u2019t also to try to establish a universal right to decent, spacious housing in equitable environments.</p> <p>For all the trauma caused by the coronavirus, I can\u2019t help but hope that, on the other side of it, we will better understand what we need to live well, and demand more. In comparison with most other rich countries, British people are incredibly badly housed, and are expected to treat open spaces as a luxury not a right. There\u2019s only so long you can keep fit and carry on, as instructed, when you\u2019ve no room to swing a cat.</p> <p>Graham Medley, an adviser to the government on coronavirus, made an awkward but relevant point when he highlighted the potential damage caused by trapping people for too long in a home environment that is influenced, in an absolute and quantifiable way, by class. The lasting social effects of coronavirus will only be seen more clearly once they are understood through the prisms of social class, economic disadvantage, and the ways that our environment can work against us, according to how much power we have to influence it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p> Joe Biden was not their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/california/democratic\">first choice.</a> In some cases, he wasn\u2019t even their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/nevada\">second</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/iowa\">third</a>. Now, as the all-but-certain nominee, Biden is aggressively courting a critical constituency of younger and leftwing Democrats who have so far rejected his presidential bid.</p> <p>Last month, Biden stitched together a wide range of support from African Americans, suburbanites and working-class white voters to rack up wins across the country and amass an almost indomitable lead over his rival, democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. Yet missing from that coalition is the young and more liberal voters who overwhelmingly prefer Sanders\u2019 call for political revolution to Biden\u2019s promise of a return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d.</p> <p>Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify after a divisive primary battle that stretched into the summer convention, Biden is now amplifying his appeals to the party\u2019s left.</p> <p>According to campaign officials, his team has for weeks quietly engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice. The effort, spearheaded by senior Biden advisers, includes outreach to legacy organizations such as Planned Parenthood as well as newer, youth-led groups like the Sunrise Movement.</p> <p>Biden has also made overt gestures. He recently adopted a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system and embraced elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal.</p> <p>\u201cLet me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by senator Sanders: I hear you,\u201d Biden said after sweeping three major primary contests last month. \u201cI know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.\u201d</p> <p>There is a delicacy around the engagement, especially with Sanders still claiming his campaign has a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to the nomination despite calls to bow out of the race. The left came tantalizing close to nominating a presidential candidate they hold up as a progressive champion only to watch in dismay as Biden, who is unquestionably more moderate, all-but vanquished those hopes, and with startling speed.</p> <p>There is a mutual understanding that the party must unify to defeat Donald Trump in November. But progressives also believe they have built sufficient leverage to press for sweeping policy concessions from Biden, particularly given the potentially worrisome <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-consolidates-support-trails-badly-enthusiasm-poll/story?id=69812092\">lack of enthusiasm</a> for his candidacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a/0_36_2918_1751/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJoe Biden, as the moderate frontrunner, has to convince progressives to support him,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, who directs Green New Deal strategy at the progressive think tank Data for Progress. \u201cHe needs more enthusiasm behind his campaign, and it\u2019s been a bruising campaign cycle.\u201d</p> <p>In interviews with progressive organizers, climate change has emerged as a key area where activists believe they can \u201cpush\u201d the former vice-president, in part because combatting global warming draws broad support from every corner of the party. Several <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/\">polls</a> this cycle have found that Democratic voters rank climate change among their top three issues, often second only to healthcare.</p> <p>Data for Progress, along with climate staff from Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s former presidential campaign, are among those urging the Biden team to prioritize climate change.</p> <p>In a recent six-page memo, the group laid out five policy areas where he could issue new proposals or emphasize existing ones. They are: stronger clean energy standards with clearer targets, investments in green infrastructure, a dedicated 40% of climate money going to disadvantaged communities, restrictions on Wall Street financing of fossil fuels and a commitment to high-quality union jobs. NoiseCat said the Biden campaign is engaging the authors at a high level.</p> <p>Some progressives believe Biden, who spent decades in the Senate before serving as vice president, would have a better shot at moving climate legislation through Congress because of his longstanding relationships and pragmatic approach. Biden also has strong ties to labor unions that are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18628299/green-new-deal-labor-union-2020-democrats\">skeptical</a> of ambitious proposals to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Already Biden has suggested Democrats should push for \u201cGreen Deal\u201d spending in the next aid package responding to the economic downturn spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. Though he is unlikely to endorse policies to significantly curb drilling for oil and natural gas \u2013 like a fracking ban \u2013 which could alienate supporters in swing states like Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done to have the full-scale mobilization of the federal government that is needed to defeat climate change,\u201d said Jamal Raad, former aide to Inslee\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s the task at hand here for the next president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775/0_0_4392_2928/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Progressive activists say their overriding priority in 2020 is to defeat Trump. But they warn that antipathy for the president is not enough to win in November. And how Biden engages the left and what concessions he is willing to make could determine the nature of their electoral efforts on his behalf.</p> <p>\u201cWill enough people be willing to volunteer for the nominee? Or send text messages for the nominee? Or overcome the barriers of voter suppression that we know are coming to vote for the nominee,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network director at the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Epps-Addison echoed many Democratic activists in urging Biden to put a progressive standard-bearer on the ticket with him. Biden has said he would choose a woman as his running mate, an overture to Democrats deeply disappointed that two white men in their 70s emerged from a historically diverse and female presidential field.</p> <p>Both Democratic contenders have vowed to actively support whoever becomes the party\u2019s nominee.</p> <p>Yet Biden, confined to his home in Delaware amid the coronavirus outbreak, has so far struggled to re-create the grassroots excitement that has powered Sanders\u2019 presidential bid, with packed rallies and an endless stream of small-dollar donations. Meanwhile, Sanders has continued to criticize his opponent\u2019s record.</p> <p>Asked during the last Democratic debate how he might appeal to Sanders\u2019 supporters if he became the nominee, Biden quipped: \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now.\u201d</p> <p>Though Sanders\u2019 chances of clinching the nomination have faded, the progressive proposals he championed on healthcare, climate change and student debt remain widely popular among Democratic voters \u2013 a point the senator has made explicitly as he defends his continued presence in the primary race. His ideas, the senator has asserted, are winning the \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cgenerational\u201d debate\u201d \u2013 even if he is not.</p> <p>Biden may be the eventual nominee, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren, but \u201ctens of millions of people who supported Warren and Sanders nonetheless wanted a president who advocated for bold, progressive policy ideas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb/0_0_6192_4128/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexis Confer, executive director of March For Our Lives, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in Florida, said the best way for Biden to reach young voters is to address their priorities with a shared sense of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cWe see our daily work as fighting the largest epidemic in our country,\u201d Confer said, referring to the scourge of gun violence that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/\">claims</a> more than 36,000 American lives each year. But they also view their activism as part of a wider movement for social, racial and economic justice, she added, emphasizing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t live single-issue lives.\u201d</p> <p>In discussions with Biden\u2019s team, March for Our Lives is advocating for a 10-day waiting period on all firearm purchases, a federal gun licensing program and the creation of an administration role dedicated to combating gun violence.</p> <p>Pro-choice organizations are also eager to see Biden elevate his support for reproductive rights, especially in light of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-02/red-states-block-abortion-coronavirus-outbreak\">efforts</a> in conservative states to restrict abortions during the pandemic.<br><br>Early in the primary season, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/abortion-joe-biden-hyde-amendment\">abandoned</a> his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortion with some exceptions. But he has a shifting voting record on the issue and some advocates have called on him to release a standalone plan outlining his commitment to defending reproductive rights.<br><br>\u201cVoters need to know that addressing this crisis is top of mind for our next president and that our nominee understands that reproductive freedom is fundamental to achieving meaningful equity in society,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.</p> <p>Immigration is a particularly thorny issue for Biden. Throughout the primary season, he has faced fierce criticism from immigration activists over the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policy, which resulted in the removal of roughly three million people. At campaign events and even during Democratic debates, Biden was met with protests and interruptions from activists shouting: \u201cNot one more deportation.\u201d</p> <p>Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, executive director of United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights network, said Biden has work to do to \u201cbridge the trust gap\u201d with Latino voters, a powerful Democratic constituency that tends to be younger. In the primary, many of these voters flocked to Sanders, who proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system.</p> <p>Her group, which jointly endorsed Sanders and Warren, expects to meet with Biden\u2019s team in the coming weeks. In those discussions, they intend to press him to commit to using executive authority to expand programs like Daca, which shields certain immigrants from deportation and to repeal a 1996 law that increased penalties for crossing the border illegally.</p> <p>Biden has acknowledged the \u201cincredible pain\u201d caused by deportation and recently pledged to halt nearly all removals in the first 100 days of his administration, a move activists believes is a testament to their advocacy.</p> <p>Still, many progressives remain skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cRight now it still feels like more of the same,\u201d said Erika Andiola, chief advocacy officer at the immigration services organization Raices Action and a former staffer on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to keep pushing him.\u201d</p> <p>In a virtual fundraiser on Friday, Biden was optimistic that he could find common ground with the Democrats most leery of his campaign in time to bring the party together in November.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good ideas they have \u2013 I disagree with many of them,\u201d Biden said. But he continued: \u201cThere\u2019s lot of significant change that can take place \u2013 both structurally and practically \u2013 that can bring everybody along.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u2018How was <em>your</em> last couple of years? Anybody else get in global amounts of trouble?\u201d It was only a matter of time before Louis CK, disgraced in 2017 when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/10/louis-ck-statement-sexual-misconduct-allegations-these-stories-are-true\">admitted to masturbating in front of several female comedians,</a> confirmed his comeback with a special. Sure enough last weekend, mid-lockdown and out of the blue, Sincerely Louis CK \u2013 recorded in Washington DC last year \u2013 was made available on his website. </p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/04/aziz-ansari-road-to-nowhere-review-hammersmith-apollo-london\">Aziz Ansari\u2019s corresponding show</a> a year ago, this set is hard to watch through any lens other than that of CK\u2019s behaviour. And, of course, he addresses them, in a manner you may find less pious than Ansari\u2019s, or less penitent, depending on how reprehensible you considered CK (or how much you loved his work) in the first place. Judging by this set, CK doesn\u2019t think he did anything uniquely bad. Everyone has their sexual quirks, he argues, and now, he reports shamefaced, \u201ceveryone knows mine\u201d \u2013 from Barack Obama to the Italian kid pointing at him recently in an airport.</p> <p>Towards the end, he fronts up to the issue of consent, reminding his audience that he sought consent from the women involved, but acknowledging (indirectly, via jokes about a similarity between the sounds of female sexual pleasure and slaves singing \u201cNegro spirituals\u201d in the fields) that that may not have been enough. This not-quite apology \u2013 heavier on self-pity than concern for the women involved \u2013 won\u2019t be enough for those outraged by CK\u2019s behaviour. But it\u2019s all we\u2019re getting, and at least it\u2019s consistent with CK\u2019s unsentimental worldview, which sees us all as amoral screw-ups struggling to get from cradle to grave with some shreds of dignity intact.</p> <p>That is the keynote in a show with a handful of jokes to recall CK\u2019s once permanent residency on all those \u201cworld\u2019s best\u201d lists, and more that recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/louis-ck-review-edinburgh-playhouse-standup-comedy\">his too cynical 2016 Edinburgh festival show</a>. You can\u2019t say he\u2019s not hunting big game, comedically speaking. He opens with a section on God that includes an unsparing riff on his mother\u2019s recent death and cremation. God is summoned to Earth to clear things up with a five-minute press conference \u2013 which, coincidentally, gives sexual deviants a free pass but comes down hard on carnivores. (\u201cHow could you eat a perfectly fuckable pig?\u201d)</p> <p>That\u2019s far from the only routine in whose margins CK\u2019s harassment scandal lurks, just out of vision. Elsewhere, there\u2019s some straightforward baiting of liberal pieties, as with a routine about \u201cretarded people\u201d that feigns to strike a blow for social justice while savouring the phrase \u201cretarded people\u201d a little too much; a riff on whether CK wants to \u201cfuck kids\u201d or not; and another about a Japanese waitress with a funny accent. Sometimes, it\u2019s all a bit of a strain: \u201cI used to date a woman who was vegan. So I had to fuck her with my dick substitute.\u201d Oh dear.</p> <p>Perhaps, now the veil has slipped, CK can no longer be bothered pretending to the loftier ideals that used to offset his more cynical material. But then some of his cynical gags here (the one about visiting boutique gift shops, say) are wickedly good, and there\u2019s higher-minded material, too \u2013 on his grandfather\u2019s flight from Hungary to Mexico, or on his relief, aged 52, that he now has only a manageable length of time left to live.</p> <p>On this evidence, it looks as if that time will be spent performing standup, even if \u2013 because the context\u2019s changed and because that doesn\u2019t seem to be bringing out CK\u2019s best instincts \u2013 he may be doing so to smaller and less joyful audiences.</p> <p>\u2022 Available at <a href=\"https://louisck.com/\">louisck.com</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Dismantling mass incarceration in the United States is not a question of possibility or costs, but a matter of imagination and will. Take the relationship between the criminal legal system and the Covid-19 outbreak. Families and activists have demanded the release of people currently detained in jails, prisons and immigrant detention facilities, and in some cases, they have won. New York has released 300 elders from Rikers Island \u2013 not enough, but a start. Massachusetts courts, under pressure from activists, are considering whether to release anyone. When California released an additional 3,100 people from prison, a media outlet was sure to note that Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s order included sentence commutations for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-gov-newsom-commutes-sentences-21-including-killers-n1170976\">killers</a>\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/united-states-numbers-dead-unemployed-trump-smaller\">As the numbers of dead and unemployed grow, Trump looks and sounds smaller | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What changed? The easy answer is that Covid-19 became a pandemic. Globally, more than 1.2m people have contracted the virus and upwards of 70,000 have succumbed. In the United States, the figures are over 336,000 and 10,000, respectively. Suddenly, student loan deferments, suspended mortgages, calls against evictions, direct cash payments to families and releasing portions of the incarcerated population have all become not only politically possible, but desirable.</p> <p>But these political gains have already faced serious setbacks.</p> <p>First: despite the urgent need for cities and states to decrease their prison populations to protect inmates and staff from Covid-19, and despite the general inability of carceral facilities to offer adequate treatment and protection, the political winds have already shifted in a more regressive direction. Federal prisons are now requiring a <a href=\"https://www.wvnstv.com/top-stories/federal-prisons-to-require-inmates-to-quarantine-in-cells-for-2-weeks/\">two-week quarantine</a> instead of release.</p> <p>Second: the public battle against Covid-19 has had the effect of empowering another pillar of the prison industrial complex \u2013 policing. Thirty states have issued stay-at-home orders enforceable by law enforcement and stacked with fines, citations and even jail time. We cannot let the confusion of the crisis further entrench mass incarceration.</p> <p>Through the Arab spring, Occupy Wall Street, and the Ferguson uprising, a full generation of activists have used street protests and social media to resist state repression, violence and policing. Those options are now limited. Notwithstanding the pandemic, American police have still killed at least 57 people since 1 March. Last year, the police killed 253 during the first quarter; this year, it is 227, a difference of 26 people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What would have happened if a Chicago officer had shot Laquan McDonald in the back, 16 times, while we were all under quarantine?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But so much is lost in the numbers. Television coverage is almost exclusively on the rapidly spreading Covid-19. Public approval of the police is increasing because the police are considered first responders to the pandemic. Police victims are most likely poor, people of color, or First Nations. Taken together, reporting on police violence, and the lives of their victims, would be unpopular. What would have happened if a Chicago officer had shot Laquan McDonald in the back, 16 times, while we were all under quarantine?</p> <p>We are at risk of police violence generally, and now specifically through this pandemic. In Los Angeles, police are reportedly stopping drivers to inquire about their destinations and issuing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8700400221\">$400 citations</a>. Rhode Island\u2019s governor ordered state troopers to profile and stop cars <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-29/rhode-island-ends-policy-of-stopping-cars-with-new-york-plates\">with out-of-state license</a> plates. Maryland and Washington DC have issued enforcement orders that are punishable by arrest, a fine up to $1,000 and six months in jail. Even Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers are still conducting raids to destroy lives, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/ice-raids-coronavirus-n95-masks\">wearing N95 masks</a> that could be used to save lives.</p> <p>All these additional surveillance tools are added on top of broken windows policing, racial profiling and stop-and-frisks. If this path continues, people newly freed from jails could find themselves returning to the increasingly occupied communities from where they were arrested, only to be replaced by new waves of arrestees vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 in jail.</p> <p>State divestment from poor neighborhoods, black communities and immigrant circles inevitably means that these groups will be policed the most aggressively and suffer the worst burden of enforcement. \u201cStaying home\u201d \u2013 in overcrowded and sometimes dilapidated housing \u2013 is much easier <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/lightfoot-shares-hilarious-psa-urging-people-to-stay-home-save-lives/2247859/\">s</a><a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/lightfoot-shares-hilarious-psa-urging-people-to-stay-home-save-lives/2247859/\">ung</a> in a PSA than practiced. Some states permit families to hike together for fresh air yet still outlaw families standing together outside as \u201cloitering\u201d. Near my neighborhood, the police monitor a group of black teenagers who stand at the traffic light with squeegees and window spray. I\u2019m used to chatting with the kids on weekends. Now, t-shirts and hoodies hug their faces. They nod and smile with their eyes for any pocket change to clean cars before the signal switches. I fear for their safety from the coronavirus. And also from the police.</p> <p>As I watch, I think: <em>this is dangerous. They should be inside. They should be learning. Where are their parents?</em> Then, I remember: the teenagers who have adequate safe space and food and activities and quality educational options would probably not be standing outside during a global pandemic for hours for one dollar in the first place.</p> <p>What should we do? How will we enforce social distancing without police? As activists, lawyers, organizers and artists build resources to show us the way, one important step is recognizing what police cannot do. Law enforcement cannot stop the coronavirus. They cannot even stop it among their own ranks. And because politicians refuse free and widely accessible testing and treatment, they risk the lives of police officers, their families and the rest of us by putting sick officers on the street. More than <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/01/more-than-1000-new-york-city-police-officers-are-infected-with-coronavirus.html\">1,000 officers</a> in the New York police department reportedly have coronavirus, as well as <a href=\"https://time.com/5812113/new-jersey-police-coronavirus/\">160 New Jersey</a> officers, and at least<a href=\"https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/almost-500-detroit-police-officers-quarantined-for-possible-coronavirus\"> 500 Detroit officers</a> have been quarantined for possible sickness and exposure.</p> <p>Another important step is to learn what communities are doing right now. Activist organizations are urging police to give warnings to people who violate coronavirus curfews, rather than coming into contact for arrests and citations. This effort would limit contact and decrease transmission between police and residents. Many people are joining or building <a href=\"https://itsgoingdown.org/c19-mutual-aid/\">mutual aid groups</a> to share resources so that people can limit their exposure to Covid-19.</p> <p>In all of this we must continue to fight for a more egalitarian society in the future. In a country with universal healthcare, perhaps people with regular access to quality care would have stronger immune systems to fight the virus. Workers would own the factories that produce our goods and would have better working conditions because they are vested in their own health. Artists would have a basic income and would not worry how to pay for rent or bills. Hotels would not sit empty while homeless people<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/las-vegas-parking-lot-homeless-shelter\"> sleep in concrete squares on parking lots</a> \u2013 we would have universal housing. Addictions, relapses and overdoses would subside because people are not stressed from economic and climate catastrophe. Property would be communal so that anyone, regardless of neighborhood, could have fresh air and sunlight. People would not be forced to stay in domestic violence relationships because their partner is the breadwinner or has health insurance. Families could rotate neighborhood garden visits for fresh food instead of hoarding groceries and tissue from their neighbors.</p> <p>Through strengthened social relationships, people would have less incentive to leave their homes, and we could solve problems without cages and guns.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Corona-related demand has even enabled some fashion labels to reopen their factories,<strong> </strong>providing desperately needed supplies and, for some, self-expression amid chaos.</p> <p>Concern over the spread of coronavirus for months hasn\u2019t stopped Marie Lodi and her husband from exercising their love of kitsch.</p> <p>\u201cOur masks are really flamboyant and have hot pink tie-dye and Guy Fieri flames on them,\u201d says Lodi, a fashion writer and host of Fishnet Flix, a podcast about costume design. \u201cBecause we said if we are living in a pandemic and have to wear masks, then we might as well have some fun.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than ape the sterility of increasingly unavailable standard masks, which before the crisis might have retailed for as little as <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190610012647/https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-earloop-style-face-mask/ID=prod6272763-product\">$0.44</a> per single-use item, the ones sold by indie designers and larger brands have playful styles fit for a public health crisis and springtime looks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4ed2a6910a81ad4f750bb4e57434e14c120f54e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4ed2a6910a81ad4f750bb4e57434e14c120f54e/0_0_2016_1512/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The mask with Guy Fieri flames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mask with Guy Fieri flames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marie Lodi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://matrushka.com/product/cotton-face-mask/\">Matrushka</a>\u2019s $10 cotton masks, constructed out of fabric scraps from its couture studio, are colorful creations with aliens and cartoon cats front and center. \u201cIf having a cool non-medical grade mask with cats or unicorns or sharks on it makes things less scary [for all of us], I\u2019m happy,\u201d says Laura Howe, the brand\u2019s owner and designer. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of us all looking the same: sad, scared, behind the same kind of mask.\u201d</p> <p>Men\u2019s sporting gear retailer Ball and Buck is selling a <a href=\"https://ballandbuck.com/products/ball-and-buck-original-camo-mask?variant=32183015145565\">camo print face mask</a>. Maison Modulare has sold out of their <a href=\"https://modulare.us/products/ivory-lace-mask\">French lace mask</a>, a more expensive item priced at $60. Los Angeles Apparel, the successor to American Apparel, is offering FACEMASK3, a three-pack of masks made of French Terry fabric, available in nine colors.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like this is what I\u2019d been training for,\u201d says Grisel Lopez, a <a href=\"https://www.papermag.com/possessed-covid-masks-2645574726.html\">designer for Possessed</a>, fetishwear line which produces neon-colored PVC masks that can be sanitized.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is not stepping up,\u201d adds MI Leggett, founder of Official Rebrand, which uses upcycled materials. \u201cMaking masks is something I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>Major brands such as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/how-christian-siriano-turned-his-fashion-house-into-a-mask-factory\">Christian Siriano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-03-24/fashion-brands-face-masks-medical-surgical-gowns-coronavirus\">Zara, H&amp;M and Prada</a> are using their factories to produce necessities solely for medical staff. Some smaller companies have one-for-one initiatives: for each mask sold, they donate another to essential workers. After the CDC released its new guidelines, Naomi Mishkin, owner of Naomi Nomi, says she has received 5,000 orders for her cotton masks, meaning the same number will go to first responders. Like many indie designers, she has been able to re-open her factory and get her team back to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da38513f100aefb33a4340e1d964b0fd801bb62d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da38513f100aefb33a4340e1d964b0fd801bb62d/0_415_1529_1495/1000..jpg\" alt=\"One of the Maison Modulare masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"978\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Maison Modulare masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maison Modulare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFashion brands who have been able to pivot to making masks right now are crucial,\u201d says Marie Lodi. \u201cEveryone benefits: the brands who are losing money, the healthcare workers, and the civilians who are in need of masks.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, as is the case when any moral effort is commodified, some who are familiar with the fashion industry have concerns.</p> <p>\u201cAs the pandemic continues to spread, I anticipate that some high-end brands might charge higher prices [for masks] and capitalize on the fact that people are scared,\u201d says Gianluca Russo, a style reporter for Teen Vogue.</p> <p>There are also sustainability issues plaguing fast fashion manufacturers, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/18/fast-fashion-environmental-audit-committee-polluting-industry\">environmental harm</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/05/female-garment-workers-gap-hm-south-asia\">labor abuses</a>.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Ben Doherty bringing you the main stories on Tuesday 7 April.</p> <h2>Australia\u2019s death toll reaches 48</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has reached 48, following two deaths in Western Australia and one in Tasmania.</p> <p>A woman in her 70s, who recently returned from overseas and was staying in a Perth hotel as a part of mandatory quarantine, died at the Royal Perth hospital. A man in his 70s, who was a passenger on the Artania cruise ship, died at Joondalup health campus.</p> <p>In Tasmania, a man in his 80s, yet another passenger on the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship, died. That ship is now the original source of more than 660 infections, and at least 13 deaths. A criminal investigation is under way by New South Wales police into how it was allowed to dock at Circular Quay and its passengers disembark when there were signs of Covid-19 onboard.</p> <p>Also on Tuesday, the government released modelling on the potential curve of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 spread.</p> <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, stressed the modelling was theoretical and was not based on case data. It does not predict what will happen in Australia in terms of how many people will contract the virus or will die from the virus, or how long it will last in Australia.</p> <p>The modelling, he said, drew on a broader international dataset, and bolstered\u200b the rationale behind \u2018flattening the curve\u2019: which is what Australia is seeing now as a result of its interventions (particularly border closures) with a steady reduction in the number of new infections each day.</p> <p>The interventions were \u201ccontrolling the spread, boosting the capacity of our health system, and buying time, giving us the opportunity for more choices\u201d, Morrison said.</p> <p>The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, reported there were 5,844 confirmed cases of Covid-19, fewer than 100 people in ICUs and fewer than 40 people on ventilators.</p> <p>The major concern for state and federal health bodies was 500 community transmissions where authorities do not know the source of the infection.</p> <p>\u201cThat is why we cannot relax what we have been doing,\u201d Murphy said.</p> <h2>Crisis takes staggering toll on Australian business</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-crisis-has-had-staggering-impact-on-australian-businesses-data-reveals\">The Covid-19 pandemic has forced a staggering 70% of businesses in the hospitality sector to reduce the hours of their staff</a> and 43% to either sack workers or place them on unpaid leave, new data shows.</p> <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics has <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/5676.0.55.003Main%20Features1Week%20Commencing%2030%20March%202020?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=5676.0.55.003&amp;issue=Week%20Commencing%2030%20March%202020&amp;num=&amp;view=\">released new data</a> showing the pandemic\u2019s impact on business, based on a survey of 3,000 companies in the days after the government\u2019s tough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">social distancing restrictions</a> were announced on 29 March.</p> <p>Two-thirds of businesses across all sectors reported taking a hit to revenue or cash flow due to Covid-19.</p> <p>Roughly the same number reported they had suffered decreased demand.</p> <p>Two in five businesses said they had changed how they delivered goods or services, one-third said they had renegotiated their leases, and one in four had deferred loan repayments.</p> <p>About one in 10 said they had paused trading altogether.

  "<p>This weekend brought the news that two workers at London\u2019s Pentonville prison, Bovil Peter and Patrick Beckford, had died <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/two-workers-at-londons-pentonville-prison-die-from-covid-19\">with symptoms of Covid-19</a>. \u201cSymptoms\u201d is nowadays a euphemism for \u201cthey weren\u2019t tested\u201d, and a grim reminder of the hundreds of thousands of key workers we are asking the world of, but whose selflessness is not being reciprocated.</p> <p>These are tragedies laced with guilt for all of us: plainly, the most dangerous place to be during this epidemic is in a densely populated care environment, whether a hospital, school or prison. People work in them because they have a passion, but also because there is no alternative, and they do so on all our behalves.</p> <p>Prison officers have always been the unsung heroes of public duty: never quite macho enough for the people who glorify the armed forces; always a bit too authoritarian for those who valorise nurses. They are some of the most inventive and diligent people working anywhere in the business of caring for others, but they have generally done so without much credit.</p> <p>This crisis is forcing an urgent re-evaluation of that, along with all those other jobs that were previously classed as low-value yet now turn out to be the most important in the country. Words are not enough, and nor is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">clapping</a>; you can praise care workers to the skies, but if you\u2019re paying them the minimum amount in 15-minute segments, without security of hours or of employment, without sick or holiday pay, then the praise is hollow.</p> <p>You can wax sentimental about the holy vocation of nursing, but you cannot then bring second-year students on to the frontline to fight coronavirus and still expect them to pay their tuition fees. You cannot claim, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told Andrew Marr on Sunday, that this <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/now-not-time-discuss-pay-21816787\">isn\u2019t the right time</a> to talk about pay rises; it is the best and only time to talk about pay rises, when we have finally realised, with a jolt, just how much we rely on people who put their jobs ahead of their own safety.</p> <p>Yet this is about more than money: Keir Starmer accepted the Labour leadership on Saturday with the rousing Old Testament statement about all key workers, cleaners, paramedics, carers, porters: \u201cFor too long they\u2019ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.\u201d But what would it actually mean to put these jobs first? Money is some of the answer, but we also have to look at the conditions and assumptions that drive wage stagnation and the steady erosion of security.</p> <p>There is nothing radical in the observation that jobs are often described as low-skill, when actually they are just poorly paid. More radical, yet still accurate, is the assertion that they are characterised as \u201clow-skill\u201d deliberately. Caring is a job of tremendous skill, hard as well as soft. And while there is a huge amount of bolt-on expertise that employers require, from administering medicines to dealing with dementia, this is not reflected in any career progression. It is not unusual for a carer in her 40s to be on the same hourly rate, adjusted for inflation, that she was on at 18.</p> <p>This has been systematic, not accidental. Without progression, the wage bill can remain reliably static, which is the only way the financial architecture of the sector makes sense.</p> <p>There is often better progression in public sector work, but the combination of the austerity-years pay freeze and a new normal (extending even to the police) of people at the start of their career being expected to work voluntarily, which itself erodes starting salaries, has had a striking effect on these jobs.</p> <p>Ironically, Theresa May was right when she famously said that a nurse might use a food bank for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letters/theresa-may-general-election-2017-dwp-grammar-schools-organ-donation-a7711881.html\">complicated reasons</a>\u201d. Of course there\u2019s a very simple reason \u2013 that nurse is not being paid enough. But the feedback loop between the private and public sectors \u2013 low pay, insecurity and poor conditions legitimised in one sector and migrating to another \u2013 is actually quite complicated.</p> <p>And there\u2019s an overarching fallacy, that a job many people could do must be inherently low in value. By these lights, huge numbers of people \u2013 cleaners, drivers, shop assistants \u2013 are without prospects, being so replaceable. The times are testing this assumption to destruction \u2013 when you\u2019re looking for the people whose courage we need in order for civilisation to survive, you don\u2019t have to look much further than the postal worker or the hospital porter.</p> <p>In the immediate term, putting key workers first means personal protective equipment; it means collective and determined effort to strip as much risk as possible out of essential jobs that simply wouldn\u2019t get done if everyone looked out for themselves. But there will be an era after coronavirus; and one thing to carry into it will be a determination never again to think, talk about or treat people as though logic demands they should be screwed down to their lowest possible price.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The French American artist Louise Bourgeois spent her life making artwork \u2013 mostly alone \u2013 in her New York studio. Now, with a global pandemic, and the country on lockdown, it\u2019s an arguably perfect time to look back on some of her drawings, which capture the poetry of solitude.</p> <p>To celebrate her work, the New York gallery Hauser &amp; Wirth has launched its first online exhibition, <a href=\"https://vip-hauserwirth.com/?utm_source=hauserwirth&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=mar-2020&amp;utm_content=hp-carousel&amp;utm_campaign=louise-bourgeois-works-on-paper&amp;_ga=2.8421749.1309557156.1585147831-613397249.1585000985\">Louise Bourgeois: Drawings, 1947 \u2013 2007</a>, showcasing 14 drawings from the artist\u2019s long career, which spanned seven decades. The gallery is calling it an <a href=\"https://www.vip-hauserwirth.com/louise-bourgeois-works-on-paper/\">online exhibit presentation</a> and the drawings are featured alongside a short documentary of the artist in her studio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/06/andy-warhol-take-a-virtual-tour-around-the-tate-modern-exhibition\">Andy Warhol: Take a virtual tour around the Tate Modern exhibition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a response to the current situation, in the sense that we\u2019re all glued to our devices,\u201d said Marc Payot, president of Hauser &amp; Wirth. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re not capable of going out into museums and galleries, but we\u2019re still interested in art. This is a possibility to share that.\u201d</p> <p>The drawings on view range from abstract landscapes to strange swirls, black holes and a pair of eyes gazing back at the viewer. There\u2019s a pink butterfly, grass-strewn landscapes and one that simply says: I Love You.</p> <p>\u201cWith drawing, she was capable of dealing with her anxieties,\u201d said Payot. \u201cTo some extent, it has a nice parallel in what we\u2019re all going through, collectively and individually. This selection of drawings is a great mirror for our current day-to-day.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s one piece from 1986 called Spit or Star, which depicts two pairs of scissors, large and small, referencing her own family history in the French tapestry business. Often, her reference to the tools of the trade are connected to emotional repair, rebuilding and self-healing.</p> <p>\u201cScissors are an aggressive tool of cutting, but they were also a familiar, tender thing with her family business,\u201d said Payot. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e261b3b25e77632e3a5e86debb46027ea642721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e261b3b25e77632e3a5e86debb46027ea642721/0_0_4815_5906/815..jpg\" alt=\"Louise Bourgeois - Spit or Star, 1986\" width=\"815\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louise Bourgeois \u2013 Spit or Star, 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo: Christopher Burke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s also a red and blue landscape, Untitled<em>,</em> from 1970, which calls to mind the curves of a woman\u2019s body. \u201cThat\u2019s something repeating throughout her oeuvre, the body,\u201d said Payot. \u201cThis piece is 50 years old, but looks like something out of a young artist\u2019s studio from Brooklyn.\u201d</p> <p>Bourgeois, who was born in 1911 in Paris, started drawing as a child, and helped her parents through the day-to-day of their tapestry business, drawing templates for torn fabrics that needed repairing. Later, after becoming an artist in her own right, her drawings became the starting point for her larger artworks, like her steel and bronze sculptures. But her drawings were also a daily meditation.</p> <p>\u201cThe drawings really had a healing effect, as she was overcoming pain and anxiety through her drawing,\u201d said Payot. \u201cWe all need this, these days.\u201d</p> <p>Though she had her first solo show in 1945 at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/31/louise-bourgeois-obituary-art\">Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York</a>, it wasn\u2019t until the Museum of Modern Art gave Bourgeois a retrospective in 1982, when she was already 70, that she took the art world by storm, riding the wave as a global art star until her death in 2010.</p> <p>Drawings were a daily ritual of the artist, and she used ink, watercolor and pencil to record her thoughts through images and words. \u201cI need to make things,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/louise-bourgeois-2351/art-louise-bourgeois\">she once said</a>. \u201cThe physical interaction with the medium has a curative effect.

It\u2019s very touching,\u201d said Payot. \u201cWhen you do an exhibition online, it can\u2019t just be a couple of images, we needed to add more. It\u2019s the only way to see art now because you can\u2019t go anywhere. For us, it\u2019s a challenge but we\u2019re working with that dilemma.\u201d</p> <p>Bourgeois is known for her giant spider sculptures but has also been called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/14/louise-bourgeois-feminist-art-sculptor-bilbao-guggenheim-women\">reluctant hero of feminist art</a>, for taking on the patriarchy, having lived through two world wars and making artwork about motherhood, rather than showing women as naked muses to male artists</p> <p>The main theme in her work is overcoming the trauma of her childhood, though she didn\u2019t always explain herself. She did once say, however: \u201cTo be an artist, you need to exist in a world of silence.\u201d Blocking out the busy New York art world was something she was an expert at. Loneliness didn\u2019t seem to faze her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ef7b7d9a85147d394f4e9d4089e41057c505656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef7b7d9a85147d394f4e9d4089e41057c505656/0_0_3508_2531/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Louise Bourgeois \u2013 Untitled, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louise Bourgeois \u2013 Untitled, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo: Christopher Burke</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Payot said that she hosted social gatherings for artists in her studio, where they would discuss artworks, like an old school Parisian salon. Bourgeois would often criticize other artists and their artworks. \u201cThat was her way to communicate and be in touch with the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of the time, she was isolated, interested in her work and not anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Though Bourgeois made much of her artwork about her childhood trauma and the complicated relationship between her mother and father, she also made artwork about the years her mother was critically ill from influenza and Bourgeois took care of her (sadly, her mother Jos\u00e9phine died when her daughter was just 22).</p> <p>Drawings were essential to her artistic process. They were often the start to her paintings and prints, even after she turned to sculpture in the 1940s. Some of these works, too, started as drawings. Her most well-known pieces, themed around a spider motif, started out as <a href=\"https://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/spider\">an ink and charcoal drawing in 1947</a>.</p> <p>Though she kept a written diary and a spoken diary (where she recorded her voice on to a tape recorder), her drawn diary was the most important to her. \u201cHaving these diaries means that I keep my house in order,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/louise-bourgeois-2351/art-louise-bourgeois\">she once said</a>.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://vip-hauserwirth.com/?utm_source=hauserwirth&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_term=mar-2020&amp;utm_content=hp-carousel&amp;utm_campaign=louise-bourgeois-works-on-paper&amp;_ga=2.8421749.1309557156.1585147831-613397249.1585000985\">Louise Bourgeois: Drawings, 1947 \u2013 2007</a> is available online now</p></li> </ul>",

in need is likely to be much greater as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has forced thousands of families into financial insecurity, meaning parents who did not previously qualify for free school meals may be eligible for them.</p> \n  <p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \u201cMany struggling families will be finding it even

It was busy in the park \u2013 but this is a densely populated area, home to tens of thousands of people, many of whom have no outside living space. I saw no large groups; I remember seeing one group of three teenagers and noting that everyone else was on their own or in pairs, or parents with young children.</p> \n   <p> Some people were sitting on the grass or on benches but at a distance from others. Most people were on the move and many were visibly taking care to stay away from other people as best as they could. It can be difficult to stay two metres away from other people at all times in a busy park. No one that I saw was gratuitously ignoring social distancing guidance.</p> \n   <p>Closing parks would in my view be appallingly damaging to people\u2019s physical and mental health at a time when they are dealing with unprecedented strain and anxiety. It will force people into smaller open spaces or on to roads where it will be harder to practise social distancing. If there is an irresponsible minority \u2013 and I didn\u2019t see them \u2013 surely they should be spoken to, asked to change their behaviour and then if necessary sanctioned. Why should the responsible majority suffer? </p> \n   <p>Perhaps more could be done to promote responsible use of parks. This is very important because we don\u2019t want to get into a situation where urban populations can no longer tolerate the lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Another reader, who did not want to be named, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I live in a small flat with no garden and walked to the park with my husband and baby. I ran around the park while my husband let our baby crawl on the grass. I saw no large groups, many people exercising, and everyone I encountered was assiduously respecting two-metre distance. There were some people sitting on the grass alone or in household or family groups. I was doing some stretches at the end of my run while our child crawled and we were moved on by a policeman who came within two metres of us. He said that while it was allowed for us to accompany our child crawling he wanted us to move on to set an example, which we did.</p> \n   <p>As a local resident I believe that during challenging times green spaces provide a vital source of well-being and psychological resilience. Local authorities and the police must not let a few people sitting on the grass in household groups \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, carries extremely low risk of Covid transmission \u2013 to prevent people from exercising in the fresh air.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:21:37.148Z\">at 2.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b20c88f080bdb9f535190\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:33:13.072Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour MP in hospital with coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b87be1c51acf8df3442bc94a678aaf0aeac8e2e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b87be1c51acf8df3442bc94a678aaf0aeac8e2e/0_117_3500_2100/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Tony Lloyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Lloyd.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Tony Lloyd</strong>, 70, the Labour MP for Rochdale, has been taken to hospital in Manchester with coronavirus, ITV\u2019s Hannah Miller reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hannahITV/status/1247133928223313923\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rochdale MP Tony Lloyd has been hospitalised in Manchester Royal Infirmary with coronavirus.<br><br>Labour Party say 'he is stable and responding to the treatment and dedicated care that he is receiving from the brilliant doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff.' <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GranadaReports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GranadaReports</a></p>\u2014 Hannah Miller (@hannahITV) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hannahITV/status/1247133928223313923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Lloyd is still the shadow Northern Ireland secretary. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/columeastwood/status/1247139710188879874\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wishing my good friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tony4rochdale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tony4rochdale</a> Tony Lloyd a full and fast recovery.</p>\u2014 Colum Eastwood (@columeastwood) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/columeastwood/status/1247139710188879874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:47:06.286Z\">at 1.47pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b20198f080bdb9f53517d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/stevenmorris\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:28:40.377Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05b0da8947e62b3585bd9d6d3ac63972649bcaa7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b0da8947e62b3585bd9d6d3ac63972649bcaa7/0_50_3000_1800/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The testing centre being prepared at Cardiff City Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The testing centre being prepared at Cardiff City Stadium.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>A Covid-19 testing centre at Cardiff City\u2019s stadium is due to open on Tuesday.

However, as the pandemic forces the closure of export and import markets, UK fishers are left with huge volumes of seafood which UK consumers might often overlook.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:58:12.935Z\">at 10.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af7648f08c35a1d11ab56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:41:07.195Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Debenhams prepares to bring in administrators</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Debenhams said it has the support of its lenders to enter administration and is engaging with employees and suppliers over the move.</p> \n  <p>Business live has more: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/06/stock-markets-gain-coronavirus-covid-19-lockdowns-disease-ftse-pound-oil-price-business-live\">British construction endures worst decline since 2009 as Covid-19 hits \u2013 business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af80a8f08c9eaf0daf3b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:40:05.666Z\">10.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A man has been arrested following threats to a police community support officer conducting social distancing enforcement patrols, PA Media reports. </p> \n  <p>South Yorkshire police said the arrest was made at the weekend as officers responded to reports of flouting of the regulations in the Fir Vale area of Sheffield.</p> \n  <p>Officers said they enlisted a university student to help them explain the regulations and the seriousness of situation to members of the Roma community in the area.</p> \n  <p>Pictures were posted on social media apparently showing people congregating in groups on the terraced streets of that part of the city.</p> \n  <p>Sheffield North-East Neighbourhood Policing Team said on Facebook on Sunday: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Tonight a member of the Roma community who is studying at university has been on patrol with officers to try and assist with educating and explaining the seriousness of the situation the country is facing.<br></p> \n   <p>Yesterday a male was arrested and charged with public order offences having threatened the PCSO conducting enforcement patrols.</p> \n   <p>The team have seen a steady improvement on compliance in the area however there is still progress to be made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Facebook police Sheffield\"> \n   <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSheffieldNENHP%2Fposts%2F3851411038232373&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"838\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T11:06:04.296Z\">at 12.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af67c8f08c9eaf0daf397\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:29:36.610Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-in-your-area\">Coronavirus UK: how many confirmed cases are in your area?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:29:43.973Z\">at 10.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af4188f080bdb9f534ee8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:24:35.319Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Times says Johnson is being treated in the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-boris-johnson-taken-to-hospital-over-persistent-symptoms-b2xsbg9hs\">nearest NHS hospital to Downing Street</a> \u2013 Guys and St Thomas\u2019 on the south bank of the Thames. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It was understood that Mr Johnson was driven to St Thomas\u2019 hospital, across the Thames from Westminster, at about 8pm, and given oxygen treatment.

Thus the older age group, starting from above 60 years old, they seem to show much more severe illness. It is in line with the adage that as we get older, we also pick up comorbidities along the way</p> \n   <p>However, this is not universal and as we know, fit and young people can also end up needing critical care support.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Does this mean he has pneumonia or not necessarily?</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is hard to tell, it may be just precautionary. If a patient is developing pneumonia, it can get progressively worse very quickly and hence early admission upon the first signs of difficulty with breathing are very import and hence it is important for people recovering at home that there be a monitoring system in place too. Something that we have thus far not introduced.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What sort of care do people receive in hospital when admitted with Covid-19?</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Simple oxygen support, to oxygen via mask and in some cases ventilatory support.

The plan is to enable oxygen exchange, enable the lungs to recover and while they are recovering we give a much higher does of oxygen to them as a tool to assist with keeping patients adequately oxygenated and prevent damage to other organs too.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What proportion of people who have Covid-19 tend to need hospital treatment?</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do not have the full range of data on this matter; estimates show that it would be in the range 5-10%.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:14:21.968Z\">at 10.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8ae93d8f080bdb9f534e81\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T08:44:11.736Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon: 'News management couldn't be further from my mind'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, has defended her decision not to sack Catherine Calderwood as soon as it emerged that Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer had twice visited her second home while fronting the stay at home campaign. </p> \n  <p>Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sturgeon also denied trying to bury the story of Calderwood\u2019s resignation last night under news about Boris Johnson being treated in hospital. </p> \n  <p>She said: \u201cThe normal rules of politics, or spin, or news management, couldn\u2019t be further from my mind.

  "<p>Andrew Moffat, the gay teacher targeted by Muslim anti-LGBT protesters at Parkfield community school in Birmingham, is wearing his usual rainbow lanyard and says he feels safe again. A year on from the ugly scenes outside the school gate, his hands no longer tremble, there have been no recent death threats, and he doesn\u2019t have to call home when he arrives at work each morning.</p> <p>He\u2019s just published his second book, No Outsiders: Everyone Different, Everyone Welcome, a new version of his award-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/15/islam-gay-teacher-muslim-school-birmingham\">lessons on equality</a>, No Outsiders.</p> <p>As a result of his experience at Parkfield a year ago, where activists and parents protested against lessons at the school, wrongly claiming they were part of the government\u2019s plans for relationships and sex education, and hundreds of children were withdrawn from school by their parents, Moffat has made one significant change to his second book. Now he no longer calls on everyone to \u201ccelebrate\u201d LGBT people. Instead, he wants the community to accept that there are different sexual orientations and that LGBT+ people exist.</p> <p>The change is likely to face \u201ca roar of disapproval from defenders of LGBT equality\u201d, he acknowledges.</p> <p>He has also moved to a new job, leaving his post as Parkfield\u2019s assistant head responsible for personal development for a wider role of personal development lead for the whole of the Excelsior trust, to which the school belongs.</p> <p>Looking back at the protests, Moffat thinks the word \u201ccelebrate\u201d might have been a sticking point for some Muslim parents.</p> <p>\u201cI am very happy to be gay myself and I\u2019m celebrating that, but I don\u2019t expect you to celebrate my sexual orientation with me,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, I do expect it to be accepted without judgment in the same way I will accept those parts of you that may be different to me.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTLPTl0_oZo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cTLPTl0_oZo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Moffat has posted a video of a public speaking competition at Cheshire academies trust, in which children explain what made them feel an outsider.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He hopes the \u201crealistic\u201d change in terminology will address the concerns of some faith groups, although he realises others might see the change as a climbdown.</p> <p>Almost all \u2013 98% \u2013 of children at Parkfield community school are Muslim, and many of their parents joined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/protests-against-lgbt-lessons-in-birmingham-primary-school-resume\">noisy protests</a>, orchestrated by outside activists, against the government\u2019s plans to introduce relationships and sex education from September 2020. The protesters alleged Parkfield was already teaching four- and five-year-olds about gay sex, and even said teachers were using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/02/parkfield-school-protest-teacher-silenced\">clay models</a> to demonstrate LGBT \u201csexual mechanics\u201d to infant classes. </p> <p>In fact, LGBT+ equality is only a small part of No Outsiders, the equalities programme Moffat had pioneered at the 770-pupil school, where 23 nationalities are represented. The scheme included welcoming people of any race, colour or religion and those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, and introducing young children to the idea that there are many different types of families, including ones with two mummies or daddies.</p> <p>Under the programme, older children read books showing that love can grow between many kinds of people, including those of the same sex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/10/there-is-never-a-reason-for-bigotry-at-the-school-gates\">There is never a reason for bigotry at the school gates | Kenan Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The school said its teaching was in line with the Equalities Act 2010, and Ofsted approved it as \u201cage appropriate\u201d and \u201caccepted by most parents\u201d. Moffat was one of 10 teachers worldwide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/21/teacher-targeted-over-lgbt-work-shortlisted-for-1m-global-award\">shortlisted</a> for a $1m global teaching award as a result of the success of his scheme.</p> <p>In his new role Moffat is busier than ever, training other schools to use the scheme. His second book shows how people who are very different, from eye and hair colour to disabilities, race and sexual orientation, can get on well together and should not be made to feel outsiders.</p> <p>He has updated and changed some of the recommended resources, including a wider range of cultures and nationalities, and is publishing a film on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTLPTl0_oZo\">YouTube </a>of a No Outsiders public speaking competition at a Cheshire academies trust, in which children explain what made them feel left out.</p> <p>He insists that the change in terminology, from \u201ccelebrate\u201d to \u201caccept\u201d is not a climbdown. \u201cThe last six months have been a huge learning curve and sometimes the right thing to do is step back and listen and reflect. I am not always right. Sometimes there is no right or wrong response; there\u2019s just a response and the \u2018right or wrong\u2019 depends on the listeners experience and understanding.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge is to work with the response to find common ground while bringing people with me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Interestingly, it was a Church of England vicar, who wrote to Moffat praising the No Outsiders programme who prompted the re-think.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9aadbccc9516897a49a97e3de4cb992bb70c2ea5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9aadbccc9516897a49a97e3de4cb992bb70c2ea5/0_186_5589_3353/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Child holds banner saying 'Say no to no outsiders'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters outside Parkfield school last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe asked me to consider that for some people of faith, while \u2018tolerating\u2019 LGBT was realistic, \u2018celebrating\u2019 was not. This stuck in my throat. My initial response was to accuse him of being homophobic and of asking me to accept his homophobia.</p> <p>\u201cBut, on reflection, I realised all he was asking for was to be allowed to tolerate rather than celebrate. Is that an unreasonable request? I may get a backlash from the LGBT community, but I think I am being realistic. To say \u2018I know you are Muslim, gay, black\u2019 is not inviting people to make any judgment. They just need to know.\u201d </p> <p>This time last year he had feared No Outsiders was under threat, but other schools continued to use it.</p> <p>\u201cLooking back, we all felt isolated and vulnerable. I was frightened all the time. I\u2019d built up a good relationship with the children over four years and it was crumbling; children were walking away from me, they would walk out of my assemblies. I would say good morning to them and they wouldn\u2019t answer,\u201d Moffat says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you do when children get up and leave an assembly. Do you put a bouncer on the door? What if they all get up? We decided I wouldn\u2019t do assemblies for a while, which you could argue was a climbdown, but it is about managing a school and avoiding confrontation.\u201d </p> <p>The demonstrations stopped last autumn after a judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/26/birmingham-anti-lgbt-school-protests-judge-ban-permanent\">upheld</a> a ban on protests outside another Birmingham primary. Now Moffat is enjoying his new role at the Excelsior trust, and already this year has visited 12 schools to train them and delivered 16 conference speeches and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/20/how-tackle-radicalisation-primary-school-birmingham\">workshops</a>, plus teacher training at universities.</p> <p>Was he forced out of Parkfield? \u201cNot at all. I took up the post in January this year and was at Parkfield a term before that. Reports last year that we had stopped the lessons and assemblies were wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWe tweaked the age at which one book was used and substituted one for another to show we were listening, but we did not give way.\u201d</p> <p>He continues to take assemblies at Parkfield and conducts regular workshops for parents to explain what the children are learning.</p> <p>Before he joined Parkfield, Moffat had left his previous primary school after Christian parents complained that he had come out as gay. \u201cWhen I came to Parkfield I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to get it wrong again,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So did he get it wrong again? \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I did because it worked for four years. But as much as I say I wasn\u2019t wrong, I can\u2019t just absolve responsibility. You can\u2019t just wave a flag; you have to deal with the perception and try to bridge that gap.</p> <p>\u201cI do think, though, that perhaps I underestimated the potential influence of groups outside the parent community at my school and their ability to upset the understanding of our equality work.\u201d</p> <p> And the protests have given his equality teaching a much bigger profile. Now his hope is for a generation of better informed and kinder young people who accept differences in society \u2013 even if they don\u2019t always celebrate them.</p>",
  "<p>Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Air has a new, fixed and more satisfying keyboard, improved processors and gets a price drop.</p> <p>From the outside essentially nothing has changed.

Where it struggled was attempting to do fairly complex edits to images in Affinity Photo or perform multiple tasks at once, such as downloading app updates and using relatively complex web apps in Chrome \u2013 something I\u2019ve not noticed with any Core i5-powered machines in the last few years.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a light computer user the Core i3 version will be perfectly adequate. But I would recommend most pay the extra \u00a3100 to upgrade to the quad-core Core i5 processor, which is far more capable and will be able to handle demanding programs and extensive multitasking, as you would expect from a computer costing \u00a31,099.</p> <p>The MacBook Air lasts about eight to nine hours of general work, including using Chrome with about 10 or so tabs open, various chat apps, Typora text editor, Affinity Photo, Apple Mail and a few other bits \u2013 enough to get a work day done without having to reach for a charger.</p> <p>Worth noting in these difficult times that a 50-minute video call knocked around two hours off the usual battery life so you\u2019ll need the charger more often.</p> <p>Charging the MacBook Air with the included 30W charger took more than two hours 15 minutes, which is pretty slow for a modern laptop with some such as Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 3 hitting 80% in an hour. Using a 45W charger shaved 40 minutes off the full charge time.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2> <p>The MacBook Air is one of the most sustainable laptops you can buy. Its battery is rated for 1,000 full charge cycles before diminishing to 80% capacity (most batteries are only rated for 500 charge cycles) and it can be replaced for \u00a3129 by Apple.</p> <p>The computer is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/mac/repair/service\">generally repairable too</a>, although it was awarded only a <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/36480/theres-something-new-in-the-macbook-air\">4 out of 10</a> for repairability by specialists iFixit, with downsides being the inability to upgrade the RAM or SSD.</p> <p>What makes the MacBook Air stand apart is its use of recycled material, including 100% recycled aluminium in the casing, 100% recycled tin in the solder of its logic board and at least 35% recycled plastic used in multiple components. Apple is also using renewable energy for final assembly of the machine, and breaks down the computer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/euro/environment/pdf/a/generic/products/notebooks/13-inch_MacBookAir_w_Retina_PER_Mar2020.pdf\">environmental impact in its report</a>.</p> <p>Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.</p> <h2>MacOS 10.15 Catalina</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"471baabee2a10006e7c6b956abac160aef6ce6db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/471baabee2a10006e7c6b956abac160aef6ce6db/441_817_4069_2442/1000..jpg\" alt=\"macbook air review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The classic wedge shape of the MacBook Air still looks great.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The MacBook Air ships with Apple\u2019s latest macOS 10.15 Catalina, which continues to be a mature and well-thought-out operating system that makes the most of Apple\u2019s laptops.</p> <p>The most useful addition this time round is Sidecar, which turns an iPad into a second screen for your Mac \u2013 particularly useful if you\u2019re stuck working from home and happen to have both a Mac and an iPad.

Twitter\u2019s app is one example, but good ones are thin on the ground right now.</p> <p>The iTunes app has also been split into three apps: Apple TV, Music and Podcasts, which are generally better and faster.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7537441e9a0174f06be63e1e8e6e14040d7bf0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7537441e9a0174f06be63e1e8e6e14040d7bf0cd/742_577_3495_2097/1000..jpg\" alt=\"macbook air review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 720p webcam is slightly disappointing, particularly compared to those fitted to the iPad Pro, smartphones and competing laptops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The stereo speakers are quite amazing in volume, sound and stereo separation for such a small laptop.</p></li> <li><p>The webcam is not fantastic, but it\u2019s only something you notice when you\u2019re suddenly forced to make lots of video calls.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Apple MacBook Air is available in silver, space grey and gold starting at <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/space-grey-1.1ghz-dual-core-core-i3-processor-with-turbo-boost-up-to-3.2ghz-256gb\">\u00a3999</a> with a dual-core Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p> <p>Changing the processor to a quad-core Intel Core i5 costs an extra \u00a3100, while the version with the Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage costs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/space-grey-1.1ghz-quad-core-core-i5-processor-with-turbo-boost-up-to-3.5ghz-512gb\">\u00a31,299</a>.</p> <p>Various other options are available totalling to a price of \u00a32,249 with everything maxed out.</p> <p>For comparison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/11/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-still-sleek-just-no-longer-unique\">Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 3</a> starts at <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/configure/Surface-Laptop-3/8VFGGH1R94TM\">\u00a3999</a>, Dell\u2019s XPS 13 starts at <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/laptop-desktop-accessories-deals/new-xps-13/spd/xps-13-9300-laptop/cnx93001\">\u00a31,399</a> and the MacBook Pro starts at <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch\">\u00a31,299</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The 2020 MacBook Air has so many things going for it across form, function and sustainability.</p> <p>Very few machines are made with any recycled material, let alone as much as the MacBook Air.

  "<p>Eight or nine photographers, a couple of TV camera crews and a handful of journalists were standing outside a tired, nondescript building near Liverpool earlier this year as a major news story unfolded. Though this sort of scenario is far from my daily working environment, I recognised the familiar patterns of behaviour. Everyone present had taken and filed the straightforward, scene-setting shots and there was a lull as friendly rivals awaited the next development. No substantial change was expected for several hours. A lone male walked across the scene in the distance and, without a prearranged signal or a word being exchanged, all the Nikons and Canons burst into life and recorded his every footstep at 12 frames per second. As the collective motordrive clatter faded, one of the agency guys broke into a verse of Bohemian Rhapsody: \u201cI see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouche, Scaramouche...\u201d. A muffled laugh among the group acknowledged their identical thought process. The passer-by wasn\u2019t connected to the event being documented but, without exception, this group of award-winning press photographers recognised that an image incorporating a figure in shadow somehow improved it greatly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1feb4f811b6be29d1a0e4873e14a71acdfae2111\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1feb4f811b6be29d1a0e4873e14a71acdfae2111/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Empire Burnley Theatre in Lancashire, January 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Empire Burnley Theatre in Lancashire, January 2020</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Empire Burnley Theatre in Lancashire, January 2020</p></li> </ul> <p>In the following days I began to consider how many times I actively include a tiny figure in my work. Not all are strictly silhouettes and some are brightly coloured or even highly illuminated to separate them from their surroundings. Some aren\u2019t even human, as dogs, cats, birds and even farm animals have received the same treatment.</p> <p>There are more than 100,000 of my photographs on the Guardian\u2019s archive dating back to the turn of the millennium when we started using digital cameras. There are also many more thousands of film negatives and prints filed away in ring binders and old Ilford boxes. During a quick confirmatory search it became apparent that the inclusion of a passing person regularly figured in my work and that of many others. They only account for a tiny proportion of the output but it\u2019s a device I\u2019ve repeatedly turned to over the decades and one that has served many different purposes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f168b1761f3145e83fabfe3e0ed560f44d77ad9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f168b1761f3145e83fabfe3e0ed560f44d77ad9/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woodsetts village in South Yorkshire where residents and campaigners from Woodsetts Against Fracking are fighting plans by energy firm INEOS to start shale gas extraction in an agricultural field in the village, June 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woodsetts village in South Yorkshire where residents and campaigners from Woodsetts Against Fracking are fighting plans by the firm Ineos to start shale gas extraction in an agricultural field, June 2009</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Woodsetts village in South Yorkshire, 2009.</p></li> </ul> <p>This week I\u2019ve attempted, like many colleagues, to illustrate the country\u2019s social isolation strategy by portraying a succession of individuals traversing an otherwise empty urban setting. I\u2019ve also watched through the viewfinder for the perfect juxtaposition of pedestrians as they furtively shuffle around each other or even cross the road. The recent views of London and other large UK towns and cities on lockdown have felt so stark because we are presented with well-known vistas that are usually teeming with life. There\u2019s something missing and invariably that thing is a person.</p> <p>In normal times the inclusion of people can be used to add scale, inject a sense of life and vibrancy or show a space being used as its designer intended. Conversely, given a different context the near identical human form could emphasise emptiness, neglect or to imply an area is down at heel or unloved. Over the years the solitary anonymous figure has been entrusted to illustrate articles about local politics, crime figures and health statistics. They have served as a proxy for the many individuals who are adversely affected by job cuts, those whose lives are impacted by a proposed infrastructure project or either the promotion or relegation of their local football team. However, on many occasions they are merely used as an element that complements the overall design of an image.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4fd8fad7246c5da01d80c0bda9ec3f3bd4509fbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd8fad7246c5da01d80c0bda9ec3f3bd4509fbd/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young jewish children playing outside in Broughton Green, Salford, November 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young Jewish children playing outside in Broughton Green, Salford, November 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Young jewish children playing outside in Broughton Green, Salford, November 2014.</p></li> </ul> <p>Perhaps my northern upbringing meant I was always likely to have a soft spot for silhouetted people in pictures. I went to primary school in the Salford of LS Lowry at the time \u201cMatchstalk men and matchstalk cats and dogs\u201d, celebrating the work of the local artist, was at No 1 in the pop charts. My immediate predecessors at The Guardian, Don McPhee and Denis Thorpe, were two of the finest exponents of black and white photojournalism. They criss-crossed the globe during distinguished careers but both lived in and around Manchester and documented the human condition in the north of England. They were a huge inspiration and inevitably their work included many street scenes featuring workers, shoppers, parents with prams and children playing in the street. Don captured many fine photographs this way but his own personal favourite from a 26-year stint at the newspaper was of a little girl, wrapped up against the freezing elements, making her way through impossibly deep snow near Oldham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11d9d926ec3f4dbdd243703522e29d46c649a061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11d9d926ec3f4dbdd243703522e29d46c649a061/0_0_8922_5825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child struggling through the snow in Oldham, 1982 by Don McPhee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child struggling through the snow in Oldham, 1982 by Don McPhee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don McPhee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A child struggling through the snow in Oldham, 1982, by Don McPhee.</p></li> </ul> <p>Though long retired, Denis is still busy taking classically beautiful photographs for his own pleasure.

Once in place Denis realised there was a vital missing ingredient. \u201cI\u2019d often spend hours waiting for people to walk into many of my pictures.\u201d The woman in Salford was no exception. \u201cI had an idea with the rainy street but I couldn\u2019t let it go like that. Because the homes were empty there\u2019s no cars and no clutter but it had to have someone in it. When the woman and her children are added it just springs out, it takes on a whole new life.

Bill Brandt was quite an influence with his instinct to just let things happen knowing that sometimes you will get lucky.\u201d Denis also greatly admired the French painter, photographer and Magnum founder Henri Cartier-Bresson and the Hungarian born photojournalist Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz who both frequently featured single or groups of figures in their work: \u201cHenri Cartier-Bresson took the perfect composition of a man cycling down the street in Hy\u00e8res, 1932. It\u2019s a favourite picture of mine. He looked down from some steps and saw the cobbles below in beautiful patterns. But he waited and waited, knowing it needed something else.

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/11/lesbos-coronavirus-case-sparks-fears-for-refugee-camp-moria\">spectre of coronavirus </a>striking severely overcrowded refugee camps in Greece has hovered menacingly for months.</p> <p>International aid organisations, human rights groups and doctors have sounded the alarm. With the spread of the pandemic, calls for action to prevent impending medical catastrophe have become shriller. In Aegean islands on the frontline of the crisis, health carers speak of days gained, not won.</p> <p>But an outbreak of the disease in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52174285\">two facilities </a>near Athens has intensified concerns over the estimated 36,000 men, women and children stranded on remote isles opposite the Turkish coast.</p> <p>Installations on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos \u2013 at six times over capacity, sprawling, wretched and congested \u2013 where social distancing, and other precautionary measures are an impossible privilege, offer fertile ground for Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cTime is on nobody\u2019s side,\u201d said Dutch physician Steven van de Vijver, the driving force behind an <a href=\"https://en.sosmoria.eu/\">online petition </a>urging EU leaders to bring refugees to safety by agreeing to take them in from Greece. Since its launch last week, more than 6,000 European doctors have signed the appeal.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to require superhuman force and a lot of luck now to stop this potentially lethal virus penetrating island camps,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I would say it\u2019s almost impossible that it won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/17/moria-is-a-hell-new-arrivals-describe-life-in-a-greek-refugee-camp\">'Moria is a hell': new arrivals describe life in a Greek refugee camp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After two weeks working in Moria, the squalid and notoriously overpopulated holding facility on Lesbos, De Vijver realised it was an illusion to think that, in such conditions, Covid-19 could be kept under control.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a miracle and it\u2019s dangerous to expect miracles to happen.

Detection of the disease in camps in Malakasa and Ritsona \u2013 among 30 refugee facilities on the mainland \u2013 has put them in uncharted territory. Malakasa was placed in quarantine on Sunday, hours after an Afghan refugee began displaying symptoms of the virus; Ritsona, 75km north-east of the capital, was sealed off after 23 African asylum seekers tested positive on Thursday.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian after ordering the first lockdown, Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry\u2019s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers\u2019 reception, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first case of coronavirus in a reception centre and, yes, we are testing our responses. We\u2019ve quarantined the entire area and taken steps to isolate those with the virus. It\u2019s not been easy, there\u2019ve been protests.</p> <p>\u201cFood has been brought by the International Organization for Migration, which is running the site, along with translators and cultural mediators. Testing will continue.\u201d</p> <p>The outbreak was traced to a 19-year-old Cameroonian woman found to be infected after giving birth in an Athens hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b9d3897f71e6bfc39efb033709d4b901010fc80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9d3897f71e6bfc39efb033709d4b901010fc80/0_0_3543_2362/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Members of the IOM and refugees unload boxes with food and medical supplies at the camp in Ritsona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ritsona is relying on food handouts from the International Organization for Migration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yannis Kolesidis/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the rest who have tested positive are asymptomatic,\u201d said Logothetis, a doctor himself. \u201cI found that surprising, but as in all the camps Ritsona\u2019s population is young. Most are under the age of 40 which is why we believe they\u2019ll be able to ride this out.\u201d</p> <p>However, many disagree. A surge in migrants from Turkey, even before the epidemic arrived in Europe, had increased concerns over the cramped and unsanitary conditions of reception centres in Greece.</p> <p>Increasingly, NGOs have voiced fears over lack of access to testing, medical facilities and basic services, including water stations and taps. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/eu-urged-to-evacuate-asylum-seekers-from-cramped-greek-island-camps-coronavirus\">Calls for the evacuation</a> of refugees to other EU countries have also soared amid evidence of the devastating effect coronavirus is likely to have on an already vulnerable population.</p> <p>Holding facilities on the mainland are generally managed better; refugees are accommodated in containers and pre-fab houses, in stark contrast to the tent cities on the Aegean isles that have long borne the brunt of the migrant and refugee crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not a matter of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019 coronavirus strikes the camps,\u201d said Sanne van der Kooij, a Dutch gynaecologist who has similarly volunteered in Moria multiple times. \u201cI do not have a good feeling. I was last in Lesbos in February and worked at the local hospital where pregnant refugee women are moved to give birth. There were only six ICU beds and the care was very poor. The bed linens were filthy and the Greek doctors and nurses were clearly overwhelmed by the extra work.\u201d</p> <p>Although so far confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported only among local people on Lesbos, refugees requiring emergency medical help run the risk of contracting the virus, she said. \u201cIn the hospital for example. That\u2019s where so many will be at threat of coronavirus infection. And then the spread inside [the facility] will be very difficult to stop.\u201d</p> <p>Most asylum seekers in the island camps are from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Unable to leave because of a <a href=\"https://www.msf.org/eu-turkey-deal-continues-cycle-containment-and-despair-greece-refugees\">containment policy </a>determined by the EU, they have found themselves in limbo, trapped on the outposts opposite the Turkish coast until their asylum requests are processed.</p> <p>Almost 35,000 European health workers and other citizens have also backed the doctors\u2019 petition calling on EU governments to comply with an accord struck with Turkey in 2016 under which each member state agreed to take in a fixed number of refugees. Although it is central to a pact aimed at curbing migratory flows, the resettlement pledge was never fulfilled.</p> <p>Greece has, so far, had relative success in keeping transmission of the disease under control, announcing fewer than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 76.</p> <p>But health officials warn that the coming weeks are critical.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU will have blood on its hands if it continues to look away,\u201d warned De Vijver, speaking from Amsterdam where most of his patients in the city\u2019s main hospital are now suffering from coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cThere are 22,000 people in Moria: men, women and children all packed into an area that is a fraction of the size of Hyde Park. Scabies, pneumonia, diarrhoea are rife,\u201d he said, adding that conditions had deteriorated markedly since NGOs and volunteer medics had left the island following violent attacks by far-right vigilantes last month.</p> <p>\u201cI was astounded to see that this terrible situation had caused 80% of the complaints we were dealing with. Politicians in the EU have a moral obligation to take these people in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s centre-right government has described the camps as \u201cticking health bombs\u201d.</p> <p>So far this year about 10,000 asylum seekers have been moved from the islands to the mainland \u2013 including 1,785 to closed, pre-deportation centres \u2013 according to the UN refugee agency. Plans are afoot to transfer another 600 people \u2013 300 elderly refugees and their dependents \u2013 to hotels in Athens. </p> <p>Reflecting restrictive measures enforced across Greece to combat Covid-19, authorities have allowed ATMs to be installed in the island facilities, as part of a wider lockdown on the camps.</p> <p>But Logothetis accepts that in the event of a \u201cmass coronavirus outbreak\u201d, health officials on Lesbos would be hard pushed to cope. \u201cIn an ideal world we would rent a big venue, keep it warm and kit it out with beds. That I hope will be the next phase of our emergency operational plan because with so few ICUs on the island we don\u2019t have the capacity to withstand the pressure if a lot of people were to get sick at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has effectively stopped any prospect of voluntary returns of migrants under a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-to-offer-2000-to-migrants-willing-to-go-home-from-greek-islands\">EU-funded scheme </a>announced last month. Citing coronavirus concerns, the asylum service is also sputtering. Though operational again following Athens\u2019 suspension of applications in response to Turkey\u2019s abrupt decision to relax border controls and allow refugees to head to Europe, the service is not receiving new requests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf6542e2b976148209439af962c2e67d6f913056\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf6542e2b976148209439af962c2e67d6f913056/0_0_4928_3280/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Migrants and refugees queue in a makeshift camp next to the Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos on 2 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors have warned about the consequences of a widespread outbreak in the island camps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manolis Lagoutaris/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hopes of resettling around 1,600 unaccompanied children to other parts of Europe have also dwindled.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global coronavirus deaths approach 75,000</h2> <p>Global infections stand at more than 1.347m, with deaths at 74,892. The US now has more than 368,000 cases and close to 11,000 deaths and the UK has more than 52,000 cases and close to 5,400 deaths.</p> <h2>World leaders send messages of support to Boris Johnson </h2> <p>The British prime minister was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">moved to intensive care </a>on Monday night after his condition worsened.

But intensive care is big stuff, really big stuff.\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison sent his good wishes, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re with you mate, and we hope you get better soon.\u201d The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/dominic-raab-set-to-lead-uk-through-covid-19-hurdles\">run the country\u2019s coronavirus response in Johnson\u2019s absence.</a></p> <h2>China reports no deaths from Covid-19</h2> <p>The country reported no coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since it began publishing daily data on the pandemic in January. The good news came as the Chinese city of Wuhan is preparing to reopen transport out of the city tomorrow.</p> <h2>Japan prepares for state of emergency</h2> <p>Prime minister Shinzo Abe is expected to declare a state of emergency in Japan in the coming hours. The move comes after several major regions saw a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, especially in the capital Tokyo.</p> <h2>Hopeful signs from New York</h2> <p>The governors of New York and New Jersey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-intensive-care-uk-donald-trump-america-us-praying-recovery-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8bc7058f08c35a1d11b415#block-5e8bc7058f08c35a1d11b415\">pointed to tentative signs</a> on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak was starting to plateau but warned against complacency as the nationwide death toll approached 11,000 in the US, with more than 366,000 confirmed cases.</p> <h2>Australia tells citizens to stay home for Easter, as infection curve flattens</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-intensive-care-uk-donald-trump-america-us-praying-recovery-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8bf5708f08c9eaf0dafd67#block-5e8bf5708f08c9eaf0dafd67\">told citizens to stay home for Easter</a>, as data showed the country\u2019s infection curve was being bent in the right direction. The country has 5,844 cases and 45 deaths from the virus. But the rate of increase in daily cases has dropped over the last week.</p> <h2>Spain records fourth consecutive drop in daily deaths</h2> <p>The country reported<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-intensive-care-uk-donald-trump-america-us-praying-recovery-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8bcc388f08c9eaf0dafcbe#block-5e8bcc388f08c9eaf0dafcbe\"> a fourth consecutive drop in the number of coronavirus-related deaths</a> on Monday, with 637 dead over the past 24 hours, the lowest number in nearly two weeks.</p> <h2>New Zealand\u2019s health minister demoted for breaking lockdown rules</h2> <p>Dr David Clark, the country\u2019s health minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/new-zealand-health-minister-demoted-after-beach-visit-broke-lockdown-rules\">has been demoted for flouting the country\u2019s strict lockdown rules</a>, after he revealed he had driven 20km with his family to go to the beach.

  "<p>There is a \u201cterrible fight\u201d going on in Kirstie Allsopp\u2019s kitchen. Her two sons, who are 11 and 13, are making a chocolate cake. Allsopp, speaking on the phone, takes a pause to listen out. At least they\u2019re not on screens \u2013 she has been trying, and not always succeeding, to implement a no-screens-before-6pm policy. How is that even possible? \u201cScreaming. Threats. I haven\u2019t resorted to physical violence yet,\u201d she says with a laugh. (In 2018, Allsopp became notorious, briefly, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/15/kirstie-allsopp-defends-decision-smash-childrens-ipads\">saying she had smashed her children\u2019s iPads</a> because they were spending too long on them.)</p> <p>Allsopp, 48, has presented the property show Location, Location, Location since 2000. And there are other TV shows, including a property renovation programme, Love It Or List It. She has also become known for shows about home crafts, and is about to begin filming a lockdown crafts special for Channel 4, with a team of 11 who are arriving at her house this week. They have all been in self-isolation for a couple of weeks in preparation \u2013 the channel believes the team can travel and work safely \u2013 and Allsopp has turned her tennis court into a kind of field canteen, where they will all eat together twice a day. She is putting them all up, and somehow, she says, will all observe the physical-distancing rules (yes, her house must be huge).</p> <p>\u201cThat means we\u2019re able to make 10 shows with family crafts that people can do with the stuff they have in their homes,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople should know by now to save the inside of their loo rolls.\u201d She is expecting a bit of a backlash \u2013 making a TV show about crafts may not be considered essential \u2013 but for some, it can relieve some of the pressure of this time, she says. \u201cWe just want to do fun stuff, which people can do with their kids or grandparents \u2013 they can FaceTime or Zoom while doing it. They can make things that they will link together when they meet up, and get through a couple of hours of the day doing something fun together. When you use your hands to make something, you have a sense of achievement. This is a really important thing for mental health \u2013 it gives us some control over an increasingly uncontrollable environment. It\u2019s very therapeutic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e5e9cb987eec0e38a3b35a78abd24481ae44ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e5e9cb987eec0e38a3b35a78abd24481ae44ecb/0_183_5120_3072/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Allsopp filming in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allsopp filming in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Hill/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What else is keeping Allsopp sane? \u201cI\u2019m not sure I am staying sane,\u201d she says. Watching Call the Midwife is helping (\u201cIt just reminds us how hard life was\u201d), as is Friends and Frasier. \u201cCooking, tidying and our daily walk at the end of the day. Daffodils and Evan Davies. Knowing I have some work to do next week. Mascara.\u201d She says she knows she has much to be grateful for. \u201cThere\u2019s no point pretending Covid-19 is a great leveller because \u2013 look at me \u2013 I\u2019m not on a par with other people, shut up.\u201d She has a big house and garden, she points out, and no financial problems. \u201cAnyone saying we\u2019re all in this together \u2026 we\u2019re bloody not. There are people who are shut up who have acute money worries, as well as being in small spaces.\u201d But, mentally, Allsopp is finding it a struggle. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m quite a robust, gung-ho type of person \u2026 that I would be responding really well, but I\u2019m not,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She worries about women trapped in abusive homes and children who were already living in deprived circumstances. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m feeling completely overwhelmed by the misery that this is causing \u2013 the loss of work, the loss of relationships. People are going to be saying things to each other in their lockdown that they\u2019ll never be able to take back. I worry far more about the economic impact and the effect on those with Aids, TB or malaria in places where those conditions are overwhelming. And the impact on children. In places where life is hard, it will be harder.\u201d</p> <p>It is this that has given her some perspective while dealing with a week of abuse on social media. Her partner, Ben Andersen, a property developer, was diagnosed with Covid-19, and she was criticised online and in the press for taking her family to their house in Devon. She does have a house in London, but insists the family is based in Devon, and that they weren\u2019t escaping the capital for their \u201csecond home\u201d. It blew up on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ve had some of the most unpleasant things said to me on social media that have ever been said to me.\u201d Devon, she says, \u201cis our home, 100%. It\u2019s the house that Ben had when I met him, and it\u2019s the only place that has been consistent in the lives of my stepchildren.\u201d Andersen has two sons from a previous relationship. \u201cWhen national newspapers use the internet to generate activity \u2013 when they go and look for negative things tweeted about people \u2013 they are bullying and they are generating hatred. Every single day on social media, people have said things to me. It\u2019s becoming less now, but yesterday somebody asked: \u2018Are you dead yet? You brought your vile, infected family to Devon.\u2019\u201d On the whole, she says, she can\u2019t allow herself to indulge in self-pity \u2013 her partner has recovered, the children are healthy, they have money and a home with outdoor space. \u201cI am in a far, far, better situation than 99.9% of the population. It\u2019s just that there will always be people out there who think I did something wrong, and I won\u2019t be able to change that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"27db60e1669cbd4f12209e9c971b19a93f84c99f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27db60e1669cbd4f12209e9c971b19a93f84c99f/32_54_2002_2500/801..jpg\" alt=\"Allsopp with her partner, Ben Andersen.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allsopp with her partner, Ben Andersen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, she sends me a text apologising for being \u201cso gloomy\u201d. One thing that has changed for the better during this period, she says, is people\u2019s relationships with their neighbours. \u201cI\u2019m seeing stories every day about neighbourhood relations, and if that is the one thing that comes out of this \u2013 people knowing their neighbours \u2013 then that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>I interviewed Allsopp about 15 years ago, and I couldn\u2019t help but like her. She often gets herself into trouble with her pronouncements (that washing machines in the kitchen were \u201cdisgusting\u201d, that women should think about putting off going to university to have children earlier), but I admire her willingness to say what she thinks. If she is privileged in the extreme \u2013 she is the daughter of Charles Allsopp, the sixth Baron Hindlip, and former chairman of Christie\u2019s \u2013 at least she is aware of it. Her late mother, Fiona, an interior designer, was diagnosed with breast cancer when Allsopp was 17, an illness she would live with, on and off, for 25 years until her death in 2014. That shaped Allsopp\u2019s early adulthood, and alongside her experience of being a step-parent \u201cmeans that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m completely lost in my privilege\u201d. Her job, she thinks \u2013 making TV shows about people looking for their next home \u2013 \u201calso enables me to both relate and be relatable. What my job has given me is something that I would never have had otherwise.\u201d Without spending 20 years seeing how more ordinary people lived, or at least those in a position to buy a house, \u201cI\u2019d have lived in my bubble. It would have been the life of an upper-middle-class country housewife. Who knows? Maybe not. Maybe I\u2019m doing myself an injustice. Maybe I would always have been interested in other people and other people\u2019s lives. I think that going all around the country, seeing houses, it would be good if more members of parliament did what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Allsopp is conspicuously posh \u2013 as in she has never pretended not to be \u2013 and well-connected. Her brother\u2019s godmother is the Duchess of Cornwall, who was a childhood friend of their mother\u2019s. She is careful not to talk about the royal family (\u201cMy mum was always very strict about never talking of any connection\u201d), but says Camilla is \u201ckind and straightforward in a way I appreciate more and more as I get older. I know quite a lot of women who are like her \u2013 they get things done.\u201d She has known David Cameron since they were young, and memorably described a dinner party once at which Michael Gove did some rapping. She has met Boris Johnson \u201cand I do know his sister Rachel\u201d. Are there too many privileged people in public life? She talks instead about education. \u201cMy children are in the independent school sector. I wish that we had [one universal form of] education; I wish that we could sort that out. The headteacher of my stepson\u2019s school wrote an article saying if they made it become a state school, he would rather close it because he felt that the school was independent and could do different things. I absolutely get that, but at the same time I recognise the divide.\u201d She doesn\u2019t make much of an effort to justify her own decision to send her children to private school beyond saying their father hated the London comprehensive they would have gone to (although the school is now rated outstanding). Should private schools be abolished? \u201cI think we should try to find a way,\u201d she says. \u201cThe problem is, it is a divide. It isn\u2019t a good thing, but it is so low on the list [of priorities] and after this it\u2019s going to be even lower.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3c350fa77f1e9034751260fd04f3cdb40e5f6a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3c350fa77f1e9034751260fd04f3cdb40e5f6a6/30_0_2314_2891/800..jpg\" alt=\"With Phil Spencer in Location, Location, Location in 2004.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Phil Spencer in Location, Location, Location in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Allsopp grew up in Berkshire, the eldest of four, although for a long time it was just her and her younger brother. \u201cMy parents worked very hard to give us what they thought was an idyllic childhood. We lived in the middle of the country; we didn\u2019t have any friends whose house we could walk to. It was me and my brother, and I think I was more gregarious than that. I had forgotten about that until this week, and now I feel like I did when I was a child, longing for visitors to come.\u201d</p> <p>She went through several schools, never really settling. \u201cI was a pain in the arse,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cChildren are very conventional, and I wasn\u2019t. Now I probably seem much more conventional than I was as a child, but I\u2019m not a conventional person. And school didn\u2019t work for me.\u201d She has dyslexia, and has seen one of her own children deal with a similar issue. \u201cThe London independent day-school system doesn\u2019t want dyslexics \u2013 it\u2019s all about the academics. And the focus on academic stuff, and the lack of craft, art, drama and music.

I was always very maternal and housey. I went through a stage of thinking maybe if my mother hadn\u2019t been ill, I\u2019d have gone to raves and done lots of E, and had the early 20s that a lot of my contemporaries did, but I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s true any more.\u201d One of her sisters has had a preventive mastectomy, but Allsopp decided against it (\u201cShe was younger and it\u2019s very tough surgery\u201d), even though she says she believes there is between a 50% and 80% chance of her developing breast cancer. It\u2019s not something she worries too much about, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do health anxiety. I never have, not about myself, Ben or the kids.

I wasn\u2019t interested in a career. And then what happened to me was incredibly lucky. And also it was my very domesticity which led to my job.\u201d It was the Guardian journalist Jonathan Freedland who inadvertently kicked off Allsopp\u2019s television career \u2013 she was running a property-finding company and found him a flat. He wrote about her in the paper, and a TV production company contacted her and gave her a screen test opposite Phil Spencer, another property agent it had already hired to present the show. She didn\u2019t expect to get the job long-term, but agreed to film the pilot. \u201cThey were paying me \u00a3600 a day! Can you imagine? I was self-employed, and I was paid for three days, plus travel, and they put us in a hotel. Of course I was going to say yes to that. They were going to find proper presenters for the show, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>That was 20 years ago. What does she think Covid-19 will do to the property market? \u201cNo one knows,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always put a caveat on all my predictions for property: \u2018aside from an unforeseen world event\u2019.

  "<p>Disasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible \u2013 extending workers\u2019 rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US \u2013 have already happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/27/rebecca-solnit-impossible-has-already-happened-coronavirus-hope-podcast\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope' \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The word \u201ccrisis\u201d means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word \u201cemergency\u201d comes from \u201cemergence\u201d or \u201cemerge\u201d, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word \u201ccatastrophe\u201d comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.</p> <p>We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now \u2013 especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties \u2013 is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.</p> <p>A disaster (which originally meant \u201cill-starred\u201d, or \u201cunder a bad star\u201d) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of \u201cwe\u201d might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.</p> <p>As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you\u2019re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you\u2019re working all the time, especially when it appears you\u2019re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/the-school-beneath-the-wave-the-unimaginable-tragedy-of-japans-tsunami\" title=\"\">Fukushima nuclear catastrophe</a> in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems \u2013 political, economic, social, ecological \u2013 in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what\u2019s strong, what\u2019s weak, what\u2019s corrupt, what matters and what doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it\u2019s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo \u2013 it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it\u2019s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da770de80664c79144b58547c01984bf1a40bb45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da770de80664c79144b58547c01984bf1a40bb45/0_34_2000_1200/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flooding in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life \u2013 as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power \u2013 as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-emergency-powers-abuse\" title=\"\">suspending</a> constitutional rights \u2013 and the rich seek more riches: two Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/republican-senators-sold-stocks-before-markets-plunged-on-coronavirus-fears-reports\" title=\"\">senators</a> are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).</p> <p>Disaster scholars use the term \u201celite panic\u201d to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201clooting\u201d in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it\u2019s wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it\u2019s altruistic to gather supplies to share.</p> <p>Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a \u201cshoot to kill\u201d <a href=\"http://www.sfmuseum.org/1906.2/killproc.html\" title=\"\">proclamation</a> against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans\u2019s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/19/new-orleans-reaches-settlements-for-police-shootings-after-hurricane-katrina\" title=\"\">shooting black people</a> in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.</p> <p>The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 levees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/us/decade-after-katrina-pointing-finger-more-firmly-at-army-corps.html\" title=\"\">had failed</a>; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush\u2019s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/tp-captain-corona\" title=\"\">said</a> of Brazil\u2019s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: \u201cHe represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn\u2019t care less about people\u2019s lives. They\u2019re worried about maintaining their profitability.\u201d (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)</p> <p>The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hobby-lobby-reportedly-leaving-stores-open-message-from-god-2020-3\" title=\"\">divine guidance</a> in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hobby-lobby-closes-stores-defying-coronavirus-stay-home/story?id=69975963\" title=\"\">closed</a> all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a <a href=\"about:blank\" title=\"\">memo</a> sent to Wisconsin workers said: \u201cplease do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms &amp; your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.\u201d The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/bankers-trump-economy-coronavirus-deaths\" title=\"\">said</a>: \u201cThe damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.\u201d (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)</p> <p>Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.</p> <p>The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them \u2013 this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one\u2019s whims. \u201cThis denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-evangelicals.html?fbclid=IwAR1ChJXKIYTvBcrDKcjwU3UJJ6Dj1SeAbA82KPoTvRlYR2IphLKj8qZ_dzQ\" title=\"\">wrote</a> the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.</p> <p>Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US \u2013 a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.</p> <p>For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: \u201cLet us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.\u201d We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.</p> <p>My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: \u201cWe are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.\u201d</p> <p>When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.</p> <p>Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff \u2013 medicine, medical equipment \u2013 made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.</p> <p>\u201cGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45564/the-world-is-too-much-with-us\" title=\"\">Wordsworth wrote</a>, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all \u2013 and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/universal-basic-income-ideas-are-part-of-emergency-coronavirus-plan.html\" title=\"\">basic income</a>.

What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua \u2013 that, despite the dictatorship\u2019s crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution \u2013 was unforgettable. She said: \u201cYou had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: \u2018So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.\u2019 You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It\u2019s a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.\u201d</p> <p>I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe\u2019s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights.

In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is \u201cfollowing guidelines\u201d on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/kroger-grocery-worker-in-texas-receive-pay-raises-new-benefits-during-coronavirus-outbreak/2343540/\" title=\"\">half a million Kroger</a> grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/state-ags-tell-amazon-to-boost-paid-sick-leave-during-coronavirus-crisis/\" title=\"\">told Amazon</a> to expand its paid sick leave.

The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011\u2019s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.</p> <p>We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There\u2019s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\" title=\"\">plummeted</a>. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-elephant-seals-point-reyes-20190523-story.html\" title=\"\">took over a new beach</a>, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it\u2019s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells \u2013 for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It\u2019s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid \u2013 full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.</p> <p>But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one\u2019s own interior life and the suffering around us \u2013 and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed \u2013 well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.</p> <p>Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: \u201cProvide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.\u201d It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.</p> <p>Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>This weekend, Donald Trump used his daily White House coronavirus briefings to again urge Americans to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, an anti-malaria drug that has not been shown to be safe or effective against Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat do you have to lose? Take it,\u201d the president said on Saturday as he boasted that the US had amassed 29m doses of the drug. On Sunday, facing questions from the press about his aggressive promotion of an unproven treatment, he argued against waiting for the completion of clinical trials. \u201cIn France, they had a very good test,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have time to go and say, \u2018Gee, let\u2019s take a couple of years and test it out, and let\u2019s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease doctor, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">repeatedly warned</a> that there is no conclusive evidence to support using the drug.

Belief in the drug\u2019s potential to cure patients infected with the virus followed an extraordinary trajectory from a small study conducted in France (Trump\u2019s \u201cvery good test\u201d) to Silicon Valley social media influencers, Fox News and the largest bully pulpit: the White House.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Epidemics are dangerous to rulers</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Aaron Shakow, Harvard Medical School</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But it\u2019s also a story as old as medicine itself. When an epidemic killed thousands in ancient Rome, said Aaron Shakow, a research associate at Harvard Medical School and historian of medicine, the chief physician of the emperor Nero circulated a recipe for an old miracle cure.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was an attempt by Nero to sustain his legitimacy in the midst of this catastrophic event,\u201d Shakow said. \u201cEpidemics are dangerous to rulers.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>A deeply flawed study</strong></h2> \n<p>In early March, as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated its spread around the globe, a group of scientists in Marseille, France, launched an experiment to see whether hydroxychloroquine, a well-known old malaria drug, could be what everyone was searching for: a cure.</p> \n<p>Most small scientific studies live and die within the rarified domain of academic journals, but the French trial had a much more auspicious debut. Before the study was even <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996#bib0012\">published</a>, in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA), a lawyer falsely claiming an affiliation with Stanford University appeared on Fox News\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/media/3860681\">Tucker Carlson Tonight</a> to declare the results: a \u201c100% cure rate against coronavirus\u201d. From Fox News, it was only a matter of time (hours, in fact) before the drug was being hailed as a \u201cgame changer\u201d by the president of the United States.</p> \n<p>Trump made his first endorsement of hydroxychloroquine on 19 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/can-chloroquine-really-help-treat-coronavirus-patients\">Export controls</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">shortages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-cure-kills-man-after-trump-touts-chloroquine-phosphate\">overdoses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/insane-many-scientists-lament-trump-s-embrace-risky-malaria-drugs-coronavirus\">scientific recriminations</a> rapidly ensued, but the controversy could not extinguish the power of presidentially endorsed hope. Across the globe and throughout diverse communities on the internet, hydroxychloroquine had been anointed the miracle cure for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The only problem? The study that all this fervid hope is based on doesn\u2019t show what its authors claim it does.</p> \n<p>The gold standard for a clinical trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). What this means in plain English is that the study has been designed to reduce biases that would render its results meaningless. Neither the physician nor the patients knows whether they received the drug (\u201cdouble-blinded\u201d), a safeguard that reduces the possibility that the doctor will treat the two groups differently. The researchers also do not get to choose which patients go into which group (\u201crandomized\u201d) and the makeup of the two groups is roughly equivalent (\u201ccontrolled\u201d).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c95599ea2c0b5dae6272361950eb3cdc01c1b1ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c95599ea2c0b5dae6272361950eb3cdc01c1b1ff/0_0_4000_2666/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a White House press briefing on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a White House press briefing on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The French hydroxychloroquine study did not follow any of these rules.</p> \n<p>The treatment group and the control group were drawn from separate populations: the treatment group were all patients at the institution where the researchers worked, the M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection University Hospital Institute in Marseille, while the control patients came from other hospitals in the south of France. The treatment group (mean age 51.2) was significantly older than the control group (mean age 37.3), introducing another variable that could undermine the meaning of the results. The study was \u201copen label\u201d, meaning the physicians and patients knew which treatment they were receiving. The French researchers also treated some but not all of the treatment group patients with azithromycin, a common antibiotic, another complicating factor that was not randomized.</p> \n<p>But even more important than these shortcomings in the design of the study is how the researchers chose to measure and report their results. Forty-two patients were initially included in the study. Three were transferred to the intensive care unit; one died, one left the hospital, and one stopped taking the treatment due to nausea. The other 36 eventually recovered, and those who received the drug cleared the virus from the system faster than those who did not.</p> \n<p>If you had only heard about this study from the Fox News assertion of a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d, you might assume that the four patients with poor clinical outcomes (the three ICU visits and one death) had been unlucky enough to be in the group that did not receive the \u201ccure\u201d.</p> \n<p>And yet, those four patients, as well as the patient with nausea and the one who left the hospital early, were all part of the treatment group. They were excluded from the topline results of the study because of the way that the researchers chose to measure and report the results: strictly based on the measurable presence of viruses in nasal swabs taken each day of the study. Since the patients were in the ICU or dead, their samples could not be taken and they were left out of the final analysis. Based on the nasal swabs of just the 36 patients who completed the study, those who received the drug cleared the virus from their systems faster than those who did not.</p> \n<p>This is how an experiment in which 15% of the treatment group and 0% of the control had poor clinical outcomes could end up being reported as showing a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6daee2422b4580ffef4e3864e9ec27a2d84b5a74\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6daee2422b4580ffef4e3864e9ec27a2d84b5a74/0_124_6335_3803/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Didier Raoult, corresponding author for the French study.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Didier Raoult, corresponding author for the French study.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G\u00e9rard Julien/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 3 April, two weeks after the study was first published online, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the IJAA, said in a <a href=\"https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement\">statement</a> that the group\u2019s board \u201cbelieves the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety\u201d.</p> \n<p>Didier Raoult, the corresponding author for the French study, did not respond to questions from the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Andrew Noymer, a professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, described the results of the French study as \u201cmeaningless\u201d. \u201cThey should have done an RCT,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis idea that we\u2019re all manning the lifeboats and there\u2019s no time for that is just absurd,\u201d Noymer added. \u201cThey could have already done it.

Before Raoult had even begun his clinical trial, in late February, he appeared in the press to promote the idea of chloroquine as a treatment, researchers with First Draft News found.

Rigano wrote a Google document promoting the use of chloroquine with James Todaro, a blockchain investor who received a medical degree from Columbia University but does not appear to practice.

The pair wrote that they had been treating patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and encouraged others to do so too \u201cas a matter of clinical practice\u201d once a patient tests positive. They also recommended using the drug prophylactically for healthcare workers.</p> \n<p>The doctors did not provide any data from their own patients, but referenced the French study, writing: \u201cResearchers in France treated a small number of patients with both hydroxychloroquine and a Z-Pak, and 100% of them were cured by day six of treatment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hinthorn, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Kansas medical center, responded to queries from the Guardian about the op-ed\u2019s mischaracterization of the French study: \u201cYou are correct. Any patient left out of any analysis makes us suspicious. But what this study told us was that this was a combination that might merit further evaluation.\u201d</p> \n<p>He acknowledged that it is unknown whether the drug is beneficial or harmful for Covid-19 patients, but said that since no drug has as yet been proven effective, \u201cif there is any medication that might give hope, we prefer to try it\u201d as long as it is safe. \u201cWe should know in the next few weeks whether such a regimen was a wise decision or not.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hinthorn did not respond to a follow-up question about whether the op-ed should be corrected to more accurately reflect the degree of uncertainty around hydroxychloroquine. Colyer, the former governor of Kansas and a plastic surgeon, did not respond to requests for comment. He has since written a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-update-on-the-coronavirus-treatment-11585509827?mod=e2two\">second op-ed</a> for the Journal, also promoting hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6cca4705e05e76d4d522b115db94bedbb9ec3cd1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cca4705e05e76d4d522b115db94bedbb9ec3cd1/0_0_3500_2368/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Researchers at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center investigate the drug.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Researchers at the University of Minnesota genomics center investigate the drug.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Lassig/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The idea that hydroxychloroquine is \u201cthe cure\u201d has taken off within certain online communities, including among anti-vaxxers and followers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/qanon-4chan-rightwing-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump\">QAnon</a>, a rightwing conspiracy theory.

The researchers, at Saint Louis hospital in France, followed the same regimen of hydroxychloroquine for 11 patients, and did not have similar results. \u201cWe found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of our hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOngoing randomized clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine should provide a definitive answer regarding the alleged efficacy of this combination and will assess its safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v2\">another study</a> \u2013 this time a randomized controlled trial \u2013 out of Wuhan, China, has sparked hope since it was circulated ahead of publication on 31 March. The trial of 62 patients found that patients with mild cases of Covid-19 who were treated with hydroxychloroquine recovered faster than those who did not \u2013 and none of them progressed to \u201csevere\u201d illness.

Google took down the Google document by Rigano , though the company has not responded to numerous requests for an explanation. Twitter has also <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/twitter-deleted-tweets-brazil-president-coronavirus\">deleted tweets</a> by the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, Trump attorney <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-covid-19-drugs-twitter-delete_n_5e801cafc5b661492268e789\">Rudy Giuliani</a>, and the Fox News personality Laura Ingraham that touted the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When the president of the United States does something, it\u2019s quite the endorsement</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrew Noymer, UC Irvine</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But it\u2019s hard to see how these small enforcement actions by internet platforms can have much of an impact when the president of the United States continues to use his platform to promote the drug, as he did during his daily briefings on Saturday and again on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s promotion of the drug has raised questions about his motivation, and on Monday the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-malaria-drug.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">New York Times</a> reported that the president holds \u201ca small personal financial interest\u201d in Sanofi, the company that makes a brandname version of hydroxychloroquine. (The drug\u2019s patent has expired so other pharmaceutical companies can manufacture generic versions.)</p> \n<p>As a piece of viral misinformation, the hydroxychloroquine meme has amassed an extraordinary list of validators, starting with its placement in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. (Though misinformation stemming from academia is not without precedent; the paper that touched off the false belief in a link between autism and the measles vaccine was published in one of the most respected publications in medicine, and only retracted 12 years later.) It\u2019s also very difficult to refute, because none of the hydroxychloroquine narrative\u2019s critics can or will say anything definitive about its efficacy.

One recent, tragic example is the HIV-denialism of the South African president Thabo Mbeki, who rejected the use of antiretroviral drugs for his country\u2019s citizens and instead promoted nutritional remedies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/16/dr-beetroot-dies-south-africa\">beetroot juice and garlic</a>.

By the mid-90s, prejudice and a series of disastrous failures of political will and understanding had crippled South Africa\u2019s response to the HIV epidemic, and the disease was spreading fast.</p> <p>First, Buthelezi\u2019s oldest sister fell ill. Then her mother, her father and two other sisters. Desperately sick, destitute, the family faced appalling prejudice and ignorance.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were afraid of anyone who was HIV positive. My sister was a Sunday school teacher, but they told her to stay away. The doctors and nurses didn\u2019t like us. My sister was sick. I went to them begging and crying. They said: \u2018We can\u2019t help you,\u2019 and told me to take her home and give her vegetable juice,\u201d she remembered. \u201cEven my father said it was witchcraft.

The high-level political resistance to the distribution of ARVs may have cost as many as 300,000 lives, some experts have estimated.</p> <p>The difference between Mbeki\u2019s approach and the vigorous, sweeping and rapid response of South Africa\u2019s current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and his energetic health minister, Zweli Mkhize, to coronavirus is striking.</p> <p>\u201cThe initial response is obviously in complete contrast with that to the HIV pandemic,\u201d said Dr Richard Lessells, a specialist in infectious diseases based in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal\u2019s largest city.</p> <p>Buthelezi\u2019s mother died of tuberculosis, a common killer of those with HIV. Unfounded fears of possible infection made the family social outcasts. When Buthelezi\u2019s oldest sister died, funeral workers and relatives refused to help with her corpse.</p> <p>\u201cWe were not even allowed to talk about HIV. They didn\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Buthelezi said. The failure to provide ARVs, which stop pregnant mothers transmitting the infection to their children, meant that her own daughter was born with HIV and died, in her mid-teens, in 2011.</p> <p>\u201cShe had started treatment, but too late,\u201d Buthelezi, who tested positive for HIV in 2006, said.</p> <p>Yet there has been change. Almost 15 years ago, the South African government began backing the distribution of ARVs, helped by funding from the US under a scheme to fight HIV in Africa introduced by President George W Bush.</p> <p>The year Buthelezi\u2019s daughter died, the international NGO M\u00e9dicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res began a pilot project in Eshowe, which aimed to educate the community about HIV and mobilise local people to fight the disease themselves.</p> <p>Initiatives included a massive distribution of free condoms, promotion of adult male circumcision, a schools scheme, outreach to community leaders and traditional health practitioners, mobile testing vans and the deployment of huge numbers of community health workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"905824e1fcefe700cacf83ebe234a6e0255e7169\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/905824e1fcefe700cacf83ebe234a6e0255e7169/0_0_2000_1201/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A child drinking from the river at Eshowe in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child drinking from the river at Eshowe in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Schalk Zuydam/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The experience of fighting the HIV pandemic is now informing the battle against Covid-19.</p> <p>One principal lesson from fighting HIV \u2013 and tuberculosis \u2013 is that if you don\u2019t have the community with you, you won\u2019t see the results you want.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to do this with people, not just by telling them what to do \u2026 There\u2019s been an excellent mass public information campaign.

Many of the initiatives piloted in Eshowe have been introduced elsewhere by national health authorities.</p> <p>But no one doubts the remaining challenges in the battle against HIV, or Covid-19.

  "<p>Crises have a habit of accelerating changes that were already in train.</p> <p>Some of the trends being pushed along by the pandemic are benign, or neutral, like the <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-coronavirus-may-accelerate-the-future-of-work/\">evolution of better protocols</a> around remote work and telecommuting.</p> <p>Others are more sinister, like the fast-track evolution of factions in the political right whose message may be seductive to unwary or embittered progressives.</p> <p>Coronavirus has very quickly expanded existing fissures on the right. We can see influential actors lighting out on three main paths.</p> <p>The first path is denying, minimising or deliberately courting the public health danger.</p> <p>Some from particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/america-rightwing-christian-preachers-virus-hoax\">conspiratorial or religious segments</a> of the right have claimed outright that the emergency is a \u201cpsyop\u201d intended to institute tyranny.</p> <p>Maga loyalists like the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/1246623932767141890\">ineffable Bill Mitchell</a> have been playing it down, seeing a threat to President Donald Trump\u2019s political interests.</p> <p>And locally, Andrew Bolt has <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/a-real-pandemic-would-look-more-deadly-than-the-coronavirus/video/edfd4dca3f0b8f1a823cdcdf72a4a08d\">plumbed new depths</a> in his campaign to end the various levels of social isolation now in place and get everyone back to work. It\u2019s not clear whether he derives this opinion from simple contrarianism or from his discussions with <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2020/03/23/gerry-harvey-coronavirus/\">big business figures</a> whose fortunes, and prospects, are ebbing by the day.</p> <p>In the US, the denialists and minimisers \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/trump-is-killing-his-own-supporters-coronavirus-covid-19\">including the president</a> \u2014 are about to be confronted with the grim reality of the coronavirus death toll. Even then some will find ways to keep lying to themselves and their audiences. The rightwing e-celeb Candace Owens, for example, is forestalling her own reckoning by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1246475201115758592?s=20\">putting about the idea</a> that the deaths themselves are hoaxes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/australia-can-be-a-better-fairer-place-after-the-coronavirus-if-were-willing-to-fight-for-it\">Australia can be a better, fairer place after the coronavirus, if we're willing to fight for it | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second main line of the right\u2019s response is a kind of reluctant realism. This (with some prominent exceptions) has been the path taken by many governing conservatives in liberal democracies.</p> <p>Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson botched their initial responses, with Morrison in particular giving <a href=\"https://au.sports.yahoo.com/coronavirus-scott-morrison-slammed-encouraging-footy-attendance-232028748.html\">stunningly bad public health advice</a> as the pandemic gathered steam overseas.</p> <p>But it gradually dawned on these leaders that they urgently needed to abandon habits of thought developed over a lifetime in order to save their societies\u2019 furniture.</p> <p>Both have been shoveling out money out to individuals, businesses, daycare centers, and health systems. As much as the individual welfare of their citizens, these men were looking to save their economies.</p> <p>But partial, poorly implemented and uneven their measures were, they constituted a practical admission that late capitalist systems are simply not resilient enough to withstand a crisis of these dimensions.</p> <p>The inevitability of further disasters and public health crises as our climate crisis unfolds will everywhere force the admission that the neoliberal, managerial state simply doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.</p> <p>The question is: what will take its place?</p> <p>In answering we should note that as usual in Australian politics, governments confronted with a political problem reached for authoritarianism.</p> <p>Police were issuing fines, and the army was in parks and streets before people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/we-need-to-live-restricted-lives-for-at-least-six-months-police-enforced-lockdowns-are-unnecessary\">given a decent chance</a> to cooperatively adhere to a shifting and confusing set of rules.</p> <p>Ships were denied access to ports of entry. Returning travelers were subject to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/hotel-quarantine-a-disaster-and-vulnerable-people-should-be-allowed-home-doctor-says\">mandatory confinement</a>. The Pacific solution had come home.</p> <p>This authoritarian instinct has been even more pronounced in rightwing leaders elsewhere.</p> <p>In Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n has <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/31/hungary-orban-coronavirus-europe-democracy/\">swept away the vestiges of liberal democracy</a> in the country. He has used this crisis to lock the population down, control information and scapegoat his enemies.</p> <p>These responses define the disease as a national emergency rather than a global humanitarian crisis. They are answered, to some extent, by popular authoritarianism \u2013 in Facebook groups and comment threads you\u2019ll find people baying for mass arrests of social-distancing violators and cheering for sealed borders.</p> <p>Not everyone has reacted this way \u2013 this is also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">golden age of community-level mutual aid</a> and cross-border empathy.</p> <p>But there is enough nasty sentiment around to create an opportunity for a third kind of rightwing response to coronavirus.</p> <p>This response seeks to retool conservatism, reverse liberal internationalism and globalization and use the pandemic as a springboard for global conflict.</p> <p>Its avatar is Steve Bannon, whose pandemic-focused podcast has been a rightwing standout in a sea of corona content.</p> <p>Bannon took the outbreak seriously, and he did so early. He was devoting special episodes of his War Room podcast to the pandemic from late January. He perceived it as a looming disaster, even as most other news outlets were entirely focused on impeachment and the Democratic primaries.</p> <p>And he immediately sought to blame the entire outbreak on the Chinese Communist party. A 27 January episode called it \u201cChina\u2019s Chernobyl\u201d in its title. He regularly describes the party as demonic or satanic.</p> <p>He has, in the face of small government orthodoxy, urged sweeping welfare payments and an all-out effort to smother the virus.</p> <p>He has rhetorically adopted a certain bipartisanism, praising New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and other Democrats, while also avoiding any discussion of Trump\u2019s murderous incompetence. But all of this is framed by an unyielding nationalism focused on the evil of the CCP.</p> <p>His apparent prescience on the story, and his enduring populist opposition to neoliberal orthodoxies in rightwing politics, appear to have some attraction for leftists at a time when leftwing populism appears stalled, at least in electoral politics.</p> <p>Bannon was a guest on a prominent leftwing podcast last week (that show shall remain nameless \u2013 it\u2019s had more than enough attention as a result of this).</p> <p>It\u2019s not an important development in itself but it signals a danger.</p> <p>Bannon\u2019s nationalism, anti-Chinese aggression, and his western chauvinism should deter anyone who claims to be on the left. But in a moment of frustration, his populism, relaxed attitude to government spending, and his robust approach to the pandemic may be a lure for the politically unsophisticated.</p> <p>Indeed, this is his political project.</p> <p>This goes double for the right. In Australia, too, prominent voices are <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/it-s-certain-covid-19-will-change-everything-but-this-needs-to-change-most-of-all-20200331-p54fk3.html\">making it their business</a> to ensure that this pandemic is blamed entirely on the PRC, and that this leads to a posture of conflict with that country. This will inevitably worsen the scapegoating of Asian immigrants which is being reported in majority-white countries.</p> <p>Progressives need to start forcefully making their own arguments about the meaning of the crisis. They need to offer a response that emphasises social solidarity, equity, justice and peace.</p> <p>Otherwise we may exchange neoliberalism for something even worse.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul>",

That week, I couldn\u2019t watch a full episode. My nervous system said \u201cno\u201d.</p> <p>The similarities pile up. Emma Thompson \u2013 in one of the show\u2019s strongest performances \u2013 plays populist politician Viv Rook, who\u2019s more entertainer than politician.

It was a nice conversation. We talked about pretty much this [coronavirus].</p> \n  <p>\u201cHe gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation. It lasted probably 15 minutes and it was really good, really nice. So I appreciated his calling.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump was asked by Jon Karl of ABC News if Biden offered any specific advice on handling the crisis. \u201cWe agreed that we weren\u2019t going to talk about what we said,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had suggestions. It doesn\u2019t mean that I agree with those suggestions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The soft tone was all the more striking because Trump was on irascible form with reporters. At one point he lambasted Karl, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/front-row-at-the-trump-show-jonathan-karl-book\">whom he has known for 26 years</a>, \u201cYou\u2019re a third rate reporter \u2026 You will never make it!\u201d</p> \n  <p>The president was asked if he would now make contact with predecessors Barack Obama or George W Bush to seek their advice. He will not.</p> \n  <p>And the d\u00e9tente did not last. Later in the briefing, Trump made spurious claims about the Obama-Biden\u2019s handling of swine flu and failure to stockpile equipment. Biden, meanwhile,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247296778095005696?s=20\"> tweeted:</a> \u201cFor months, I called on President Trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for election officials to receive the ballot is 13 April. The decision, which came shortly after the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F06%2Fwisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">state supreme court</a> ordered the election to move forward on Tuesday, ends days of legal fighting over the deadline for receiving absentee ballots in the state. </p> \n  <p>State law requires them to be received at election offices by 8pm on election night in order to count, but a federal judge extended that deadline to 13 April amid an unprecedented surge in requests for mail-in balloting. There was such a surge in requests that state Democrats argued thousands would be disenfranchised because they wouldn\u2019t even get their ballot until after election day. As of Monday morning, a little over 11,000 voters who had requested a ballot in the state had yet to be issued one. In an unsigned opinion, the five conservative justices on the court said it was ruling on a \u201cnarrow, technical question\u201d, and that the lower court\u2019s decision to extend the ballot deadline without requiring a postmark went beyond what plaintiffs had asked for.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe court\u2019s decision on the narrow question before the court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader question of whether to hold the election, or whether other reforms or modifications in election procedures in light of Covid\u201319 are appropriate,\u201d the majority wrote. Writing for the court\u2019s four liberal justices in dissent, Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the majority did not understand the scope of the case: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, the court\u2019s order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement.
