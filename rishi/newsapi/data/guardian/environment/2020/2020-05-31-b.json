The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 In a dramatic pivot, US president Donald Trump has postponed the Group of Seven summit that he wanted to hold in June.</strong> He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 British ministers have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d</strong> by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks. A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area. </p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 Spain\u2019s prime minister has said he will ask parliament to agree to a last two-week extension of the state of emergency</strong> lockdown until 21st June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements, newspaper El Pais reported. Pedro Sanchez told regional government leaders that this would be the last lockdown as infection rates have reduced dramatically in one of the European countries worst hit by the pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday,</strong> its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 South Korea has reported 27 new cases of coronavirus, </strong>including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u2022 Two of Islam\u2019s holiest sites have reopened as large numbers of mosques across Saudi Arabia also opened their doors </strong>for the first time in more than two months. Worshipers have been ordered to follow strict guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as Islam\u2019s holiest site in Mecca remained closed to the public. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site for Muslims after Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mecca and Medina, also reopened for prayers.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T10:34:11.232Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed381ad8f08f5e373011bde\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nina-lakhani\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T10:17:24.497Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Food insecurity on the rise in the US</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/people-are-going-to-go-hungry-pandemic-effects-could-leave-54m-americans-without-food\">A record number of Americans face hunger this year</a> as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic looks set to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families.</p> \n  <p>Nationwide, the demand for aid at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/us-food-banks-coronavirus-demand-unemployment\">food banks and pantries has s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/us-food-banks-coronavirus-demand-unemployment\">oared</a> since the virus forced the economy to be shutdown, resulting in more than 40m new unemployment benefit claims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/us-job-losses-unemployment-coronavirus\">according to the latest figures.</a></p> \n  <p>As a result, an estimated one in four children, the equivalent of 18 million minors, could need food aid this year \u2013 a 63% increase compared to 2018.</p> \n  <p>Overall, about 54 million people across the US could go hungry without help from food banks, food stamps and other aid, according to an <a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2020-05/Brief_Local%20Impact_5.19.2020.pdf\">analysis by Feeding America,</a> the national food bank network. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cb9e7fdf154c950768e1a381e5cddd7eaf57995\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cb9e7fdf154c950768e1a381e5cddd7eaf57995/0_167_5004_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wait in line to get care packages with food donations from the Food Bank for New York City in Brooklyn, New York, New York, USA, 15 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait in line to get care packages with food donations from the Food Bank for New York City in Brooklyn, New York, New York, USA, 15 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alba Vigaray/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed37d538f087122eca52bdd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrickwintour\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T09:49:00.590Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has been forced to cancel a planned face to face Summit of leaders of the <strong>G7</strong> nations in June and now wants to host an expanded meeting in September dedicated to combating China to which Vladimir Putin would be invited.</p> \n  <p>Trump revealed on Saturday he had cancelled the June G7 meeting after Angela Merkel the German chancellor told him in a phone call that she saw the summit in Washington as a health risk. Normally hundreds of journalists and officials attend the two day summits, as well as security staff. He had billed the face to face summit as a symbol of America \u201ctransitioning back to greatness\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Reports suggest the call between Merkel and Trump on Thursday was stormy ranging over German plans for Nord Stream gas pipeline, Hong Kong and the medical risks in holding a face to face G7.</p> \n  <p>Trump\u2019s new plan, outlined to reporters on Saturday, is to host an expanded meeting G7 including Russia, Australia, Korea and India dedicated to building an alliance against China. The plan is likely to be as controversial since Russia has been banned from western-led summits following Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and is not seen as a natural ally in the fight to defend human rights in Hong Kong.</p> \n  <p>Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron will also be reluctant to provide Trump with a prestigious platform, weeks ahead of the US Presidential election, to set out his China strategy. The Republicans see a tough approach to China as an election winning formula, even though his likely Democrat challenger Joe Biden is also sharply critical of the modern direction of China.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed37ac48f08f5e373011bbb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-31T09:37:53.182Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish prime minister to seek two-week extension of state of emergency</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Spain\u2019s</strong> prime minister has said he will ask parliament to agree to a last two-week extension of the state of emergency lockdown until 21st June, after which the government will no longer restrict citizens\u2019 movements,<a href=\"https://elpais.com/espana/2020-05-31/sanchez-confirma-a-los-presidentes-autonomicos-que-pedira-una-ultima-prorroga-del-estado-de-alarma-hasta-el-21-de-junio.html\"> El Pais reported.</a></p> \n  <p>Pedro Sanchez told regional government leaders during a video-conference meeting on Sunday that this would be the last lockdown as Spain\u2019s infection rates have reduced dramatically.</p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s death toll rose by four on Saturday to 27,125, the health ministry said, reflecting a dramatic decline in daily fatalities as Spain brings the outbreak under control.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s footage, tweeted by prime minster\u2019s official residence, of that meeting earlier:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/desdelamoncloa/status/1267027087954784257\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">El presidente del Gobierno se encuentra reunido mediante videoconferencia con los presidentes/as de las comunidades y ciudades aut\u00f3nomas.

He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries. I\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Key UK election battlegrounds face double hit. </strong>Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/key-election-battlegrounds-face-double-hit-from-brexit-and-coronavirus\">Brexit and coronavirus</a> should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January.

South Africa had already slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2019 before the virus arrived in March, and the rand has depreciated by 22.9% since January. Under eased restrictions, all but high-risk sectors of the economy will be allowed to reopen on Monday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 500,000. </strong>Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Los Angeles shuts down Covid-19 testing amid protests. </strong>Coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed due to safety concerns amid protests over the death of George Floyd, according to LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said the centres were being closed \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports 27 new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pope calls for world leaders to provide relief. </strong>Pope Francis implored world leaders to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cummings affair a danger to life, say experts. </strong>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.

  "<p>Britain must take the lead in co-ordinating the international response to China\u2019s efforts to impose draconian security laws in Hong Kong, seven former Conservative and Labour UK foreign secretaries have come together to declare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/hong-kong-officials-lash-out-at-trump-plan-to-strip-city-of-special-status\">Hong Kong officials lash out at Trump plan to strip city of special status</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rare cross-party initiative reflects concern that the response to China cannot be left to US president, Donald Trump, and that Britain as a former colonial power has a special responsibility to take a lead. The seven, including former Conservative foreign secretaries William Hague, Malcolm Rifkind and Jeremy Hunt, want the UK to set up an international contact group similar to the one established during the Balkans crisis in the 1990s.</p> <p>In a letter to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, they wrote: \u201cWhen it comes to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy under the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model, many of our international partners continue to take their cue from the British government. I\u2019m sure you would agree, as a co-signatory of the Sino-British joint declaration the UK must be seen to be leading and coordinating the international response to this crisis and ensuring the integrity of the treaty lodged at the United Nations in 1985 and one country, two systems.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/donald-trump-postpones-g7-summit-and-signals-wider-attendance-list-in-future\">proposed holding a one-off summit on China in September</a> involving leaders of the G7 nations, as well as Australia, Korea, India and Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/three-million-hong-kong-residents-eligible-for-uk-citizenship\">Three million Hong Kong residents 'eligible' for UK citizenship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there are tensions between the EU and the US over how to respond to China. Only one European country, Sweden, proposed sanctions at an EU foreign ministers meeting on Friday, the day Trump in a bellicose speech laid out plans for a raft of economic punishments against Beijing. A Trump-led response to China in Hong Kong, heavily influenced by Trump\u2019s re-election plans, may only divide democracies opposed to what China is doing, some of the foreign secretaries fear.</p> <p>The seven foreign secretaries, including Labour\u2019s David Miliband, Margaret Beckett, Jack Straw and the former Labour peer David Owen, say the UK continues to have a moral and legal obligation to the people of Hong Kong, despite claims by the Chinese foreign ministry to the contrary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">Hong Kong: the end of one country, two systems?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raab has so far coordinated his global response to China\u2019s actions with Canada, Australia and the US, and a joint US-UK effort to raise the issue at a virtual meeting of the UN security council was blocked by China on the grounds that it represented interference with its internal affairs.</p> <p>Raab has also promised that he will offer a pathway to citizenships to those holding, or eligible for, a British national overseas passport in Hong Kong, an offer that could mean millions of Hong Kong citizens are eligible. Raab told the BBC on Sunday that he did not expect tens of thousands to take up the offer since many in the city may not wish to leave or would go to other countries in the region.</p> <p>The letter by implication suggests the UK could have been more energetic in its response to China\u2019s plan to bypass Hong Kong\u2019s legislature to impose security laws.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lord Hague speaking to the foreign affairs select committee last month urged the foreign office to take more risks with initiatives. He said: &nbsp;\u201cIt means&nbsp;the&nbsp;Foreign Office being prepared to \u2018scratch the Rolls\u2011Royce a bit more often\u2019. </p> <p>\u201cWe always talk about the British diplomatic service as a great Rolls\u2011Royce. It hums along beautifully, keeping out of trouble. Now and again, we have to have the quick manoeuvre where the Rolls\u2011Royce gets a bit scratched but the passengers get to their destination, because if the United States is going to give less leadership in global bodies but the need for that is strong, the UK has to be prepared to launch initiatives and perhaps be a little bit more French in our approach.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe&nbsp;French do not really hold back on coming up with a new initiative and presenting it to the rest of the world, so I think we should be a little less coy about that.\u201d</p> <p>The Balkans contact group set up in 1994 was seen as a successful way of keeping the international community united&nbsp;in its discussions over the future of Bosnia and Kosovo.</p>",

But he\u2019s dangerous \u2013 he and the followers of this fanatical far-right sect are dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Dino said the new movement was inspired by <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/19/world/direct-vote-demanded-for-brazil.html\">Diretas J\u00e1</a></em> \u2013 a historic pro-democracy campaign that helped end two decades of military rule in the 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cJust as there was this broad coalition to defeat the dictatorship we believe we must now build a broad coalition to avoid a new dictatorship,\u201d Dino said.</p> <p>Lob\u00e3o, a rightwing rockstar, said he had signed up out of disgust at the \u201cgenocidal fiasco\u201d caused by Bolsonaro\u2019s response to coronavirus. \u201cWe cannot allow this mockery and this utter negligence towards public health to continue,\u201d said the musician, who voted for Bolsonaro in 2018 before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-first-six-months-right-dismayed\">regretting his choice</a>.</p> <p>The movement\u2019s foundation came as a record 33,274 new coronavirus cases pushed Brazil\u2019s total to nearly 500,000.

Such support would only re-elect Bolsonaro if his opponents remain divided.</p> <p>Dino, the governor of Maranh\u00e3o state, urged the left, right and centre to join forces to ensure democracy survived until Bolsonaro could be voted out at the next presidential election in 2022.</p> <p>\u201cWe will not allow this landscape of horrors to repeat itself.

  "<p>Greece has announced it is ready to \u201cwelcome the world\u201d, and that it will resume flights to the country\u2019s two major airports as of mid-June, including from the UK.&nbsp;</p> <p>Seeking to clarify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/29/britain-left-off-safe-list-of-countries-free-to-holiday-in-greece\">a previous announcement</a>, the centre-right government said all air links with Athens and Thessaloniki, the northern capital, will be reinstated from 15 June \u201cin a bridge phase\u201d before direct flights to mainland and island destinations restart on 1 July.&nbsp;</p> <p>The rules, however, will be strict. Passengers flying in from airports deemed by the EU\u2019s aviation safety agency (EASA) to be in areas with \u201chigh risk of transmission of Covid-19\u201d will be required to stay overnight in a designated hotel for testing. \u201cIf the test is negative then the passenger self-quarantines for seven days,\u201d said a statement released by the Greek foreign ministry at the weekend. \u201cIf the test is positive, the passenger is quarantined under supervision for 14 days.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Those found to not have the highly contagious virus could continue their journey and self-isolate wherever they were headed, but people who tested positive would be monitored by doctors in a hotel both paid for and appointed by the government, officials said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf your travel originated from an airport not in the EASA affected-area list, then you are only subject to random tests upon arrival,\u201d the statement said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The&nbsp;two-tier system will end and only spot checks will be conducted once direct international flights resume in July.</p> <p>The Greek government\u2019s decision to be guided by a blacklist of airports assembled by the EU agency reverses an earlier announcement&nbsp;described as misleading.&nbsp;</p> <p>The tourism ministry&nbsp;published a list of 29 countries on Friday whose citizens would be allowed to enter Greece \u201cand subject to random tests\u201d from 15 June. The eclectic group was said to fit an epidemiological profile with infection rates that have been kept low during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a Covid-19 hotspot still struggling to contain the disease, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/29/britain-left-off-safe-list-of-countries-free-to-holiday-in-greece\">the UK was not among them</a>. British media outlets responded by ruing the news of \u201cBrits being banned\u201d. More than 4 million UK citizens travelled to Greece last year, more than from any other nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>High-ranking officials acknowledged on Sunday that the list had sown more confusion than clarity. \u201cThere was recognition the original list was misleading,\u201d said one well-placed source, admitting it had caused unnecessary upset to the country\u2019s allies and friends. The new list, based on information that was constantly updated by EASA, sought to convey that the government\u2019s decisions were not determined by nationality but points of origin, he said. The aviation agency\u2019s latest list, effective as of 29 May, categorises ten UK airports as high risk, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester.&nbsp;</p> <p>Passengers flying to Greece from other UK airports in the bridge phase would only be subject to random testing and would not have to undergo any form of quarantine, unless they tested positive for the virus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hugely dependent on tourism, a sector that accounts for almost 25% of GDP, Greece is eager to reopen and&nbsp;capitalise on its successful handling of the pandemic. After enforcing draconian restrictions early on, Greek authorities have recorded fewer than 3,000 coronavirus cases and 175 fatalities.&nbsp;The country, which launches a global campaign this week to promote the feelings of freedom and joy associated with summer in Greece, is also keen to sell itself as a safe destination in the era of Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill.

The antibody tests will help to build a picture of how many healthcare workers have been infected with Covid-19 and could be used to get more accurate figures on the proportion who showed symptoms. It is not yet clear, however, that having antibodies guarantees immunity. Some also questioned the value of the huge push for testing over the weekend.</p> \n<p>The Health Service Journal reported that NHS pathology labs were given just two days to roll out thousands of antibody tests as part of the push to reach a 40,000 capacity target.

people outdoors.</p> \n  <p>Communities secretary <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong> said the full guidance will be revealed on Sunday, as charities called for the scientific evidence behind the decision to be made clear and urged more help.<br></p> \n  <p>Those considered extremely vulnerable will be able to go outside with members of their household from Monday, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines.<br></p> \n  <p>And those who live alone can meet outside with one other person from another household.</p> \n  <p>Reviews of the shielding guidance are expected to be made at regular points in the coming weeks.</p> \n  <p>Johnson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been looking at how we can make life easier for our most vulnerable, so today I am happy to confirm that those who are shielding will be able to spend time outside with someone else, observing social distance guidelines.</p> \n   <p>I will do what I can, in line with the scientific advice, to continue making life easier for you over the coming weeks and months.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Jenrick said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Incidence rates of coronavirus are now significantly lower than before these measures were put in place.<br></p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why we are focused on finding the right balance between continuing to protect those at the greatest clinical risk, whilst easing restrictions on their daily lives to make the difficult situation more bearable - particularly enabling the contact with loved ones they and we all seek.</p> \n   <p>We will now be providing regular updates to the shielded to guide them through the next phase and, we hope, to better and less restrictive times. In the meantime we will continue to provide the support that the shielded in our communities need.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"761d0ccbff530f887c0b55fd230f66d3a0ebf625\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/761d0ccbff530f887c0b55fd230f66d3a0ebf625/0_193_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this photo issued by 10 Downing Street, Britain\u2019s Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick speaks during a coronavirus media briefing in Downing Street, London, Wednesday May 13, 2020.

It is unclear whether the CFTC\u2019s investigation is related.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s involvement emerged after campaign group Global Witness unearthed documents relating to Brazilian prosecutors\u2019 pursuit of members of a group of businessmen called Brasil Trade.</p> <p>The papers alleged links between Trafigura and Brasil Trade member Jorge Luz, who became known as the Deacon of Bribes in Brazil and was sentenced in October 2017 to 13 years and eight months for his part in orchestrating bribes worth $20m (\u00a315.8m).</p> <p>According to the documents, Luz discussed \u201ca proposal from Trafigura\u201d with state oil firm Petrobras, under which the trading firm would lend Petrobras money in exchange for discounted oil.</p> <p>Petrobras executives rejected the plan according to the same document.</p> <p>Trafigura told Global Witness in 2018 that the proposal did not result in any agreement and that Luz was not retained to lobby for them.</p> <p>Rival commodities trading firm Glencore, which was also named in connection with the Car Wash probe, last year became the focus of a CFTC investigation into alleged corrupt practices.</p> <p>In a statement issued when it disclosed the CFTC\u2019s investigation, Glencore said it \u201cunderstands that the CFTC\u2019s investigations are at an early stage and have a similar scope in terms of subject matter as the current ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice\u201d.</p> <p>It added that it would cooperate with the CFTC.</p> <p>The CFTC and the Department of Justice both declined to say whether they were investigating Trafigura.</p> <p>Trafigura also declined to comment.</p> <p>The commodities trading firm is not a household name but it has global reach, operating in 41 countries and trading vast quantities of oil products, metals and minerals.</p> <p>The company is legally registered in Singapore but is owned by Farringford NV, a firm registered on the island of Curacao, in the Caribbean about 40 miles (65km) north of Venezuela.</p> <p>Farringford\u2019s ultimate controlling parties are not known, although Trafigura says that it is owned by its employees.</p> <p>French billionaire Claude Dauphin set up Trafigura in 1993 and the company has since grown into one of the world\u2019s largest commodities trading firms, alongside rivals such as Vitol and Glencore.</p> <p>It also shares some of its roots with Glencore.</p> <p>Before starting Trafigura, Dauphin worked for Marc Rich, a legendary commodities trader who was indicted in the US for tax evasion and for striking sanctions-busting oil deals with Iran. Rich was pardoned by Bill Clinton on his last day as president. </p> <p>Rich\u2019s company was bought out by senior employees and became Glencore, while Dauphin went on to set up Trafigura with other former Marc Rich employees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its 26-year history, the company has been implicated in several high-profile scandals, including involvement in smuggling oil out of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-african-pollution-disaster\">In 2009, the Guardian fought a landmark legal battle</a> to reveal Trafigura\u2019s links to the dumping of toxic waste&nbsp;in the Ivory Coast, causing a public health crisis that affected more than 100,000 people.

  "<p>It was 2011 when Rue Mapp was followed by a white woman in an Oakland, California, park, while out on a national campaign to get local families connected with nature. </p> <p>The woman had spotted the group en route to the park and decided to follow them. When they got off the bus, she followed them all the way through the park, and when they began to play in the dirt, she started to harass them. She claimed they were bringing \u201cinvasive species\u201d into the park.</p> <p>\u201cThe kids around me might have rightly been thinking, \u2018Is she talking about us?\u2019\u201d says Rue, who is black.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>She says the incident brought \u201cso many levels of shame, embarrassment and of not feeling welcome in nature\u201d.</p> <p>If that incident were filmed today, it would probably go viral, just as the harassment of Christian Cooper did this week. The video,<strong> </strong>circulated hundreds of thousands of times in the last week, shows Amy Cooper, a white woman calling the police on Cooper, an avid bird-watcher, after he<strong> </strong>asked her to put her dog on a leash in a popular bird-watching section of Central Park. \u201cI am going to call the police and tell them an African American man is threatening my life,\u201d she threatened.</p> <p>In the days after the video went viral, the woman lost her job and surrendered her dog \u2013 but many black people say that it is not an isolated incident.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a story beyond one person, a story beyond that park. It is a story writ large of who owns spaces, who has privileges to those spaces,\u201d says author and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1blackbirder\">black birder</a> Drew Lanham.</p> <p>Lanham wrote an essay on <a href=\"https://orionmagazine.org/article/9-rules-for-the-black-birdwatcher/\">rules for the black birder</a> in 2013. \u201cYou\u2019re an endangered species \u2013 extinction looms.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>You know all the black birders like siblings and can count them on two hands. You\u2019re afraid to have lunch with them all because a single catastrophe could wipe the species from the face of the earth,\u201d reads <a href=\"https://orionmagazine.org/article/9-rules-for-the-black-birdwatcher/\">rule nine of the former set of rules</a>. </p> <p>Jason Ward, whose popular birdwatching series Birds of North America features Christian Cooper, decides to view the injustice the same way a bird would see the world: migrating through spaces, stopping at places that benefit them and passing over ones that offer them nothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1265338098256424973\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is Christian Cooper. <a href=\"https://t.co/gOQyVztX5h\">pic.twitter.com/gOQyVztX5h</a></p>&mdash; Joshua Potash (@JoshuaPotash) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1265338098256424973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>For Ward, the places where he can\u2019t stop look like rural parts of Georgia; anywhere with Confederate flags \u2013 and yes, sometimes big cities, too. His brother, also an avid birdwatcher, has had the police called on him while birdwatching in Central Park.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unfortunate that we as birders of color have to look over the world this way \u2026 But I don\u2019t want the cops called on me or to have an unpleasant interaction so I [often] think, \u2018let me cut this outing short and come back another time.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>These are defense mechanisms that Ward and many other black nature-lovers have to employ when out in the wild \u2013 lest a situation turn sticky and they have to answer questions from a suspecting police officer. In short, in a battle of he-said-she-said, most black people know who the burden of proof falls on.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Amy Cooper proved is what many black people already know: that it is not just people in police uniforms [who have power over us]. There are ordinary citizens who take the privilege of impunity and will weaponize it instantly against you. Part of white privilege is this ability to have your words believed before black people are believed,\u201d says Lanham.</p> <p>Mapp\u2019s own encounter with racism in that Oakland city park did not put her off, it emboldened her to create <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Outdoor+Afro&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS883US883&amp;oq=Outdoor+Afro&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l4j69i60l3.256j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Outdoor Afro</a> \u2013 an organization which encourages black nature lovers into the outdoors in over 30 states.</p> <p>\u201cI am tired of the narrative of black bodies being harmed in nature and in the outdoors,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom a practical perspective, we all pay taxes on these public lands and so to enjoy them is an exercise of our citizenship. It is what being American is all about,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe experience [in an Oakland Park] crystalized the importance of creating a community for black people who want to be in nature. Having groups of people, so we can feel protected and more resilient, has been part of our model from the very beginning,\u201d says Mapp. The worst thing that could come of the incident in Central Park this week, she says, is that black people are put off from exploring nature. African Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/23/national-parks-hiking-camping-outdoor-afro-boating\">make up</a> just 7% of pass-holders at national parks, while white people make up 78%.</p> <p>It has been argued that this unequal access is the product of unequal interest, but there is a long history of public lands spaces intentionally excluding black people, including through very concrete rules <a href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2019/08/how-national-park-service-grappled-segregation-during-20th-century\">which prevented black people from accessing public lands</a>.</p> <p>Lanham goes back to his nine rules to exemplify this. When he considers going on a specific trip, alongside weighing up the many universally good factors (nature\u2019s beauty) as well as the bad (the possibility that he will get stung by a wasp or step on an ants\u2019 nest), he also has to make other decisions, mostly based on his safety.<strong> </strong>\u201cI<strong> </strong>have to make decisions about where I go, when I go, who I go with, what people will be thinking of me when I am there. I need to make sure I am wearing the right thing, that my car registration is in the right place so when I am stopped, I am not suspected of harboring something,\u201d he says. \u201cI have some complex equation that I have to figure out several times a fucking day.\u201d</p> <p>Lanham was forced to do this math recently, and the numbers did not look good for him. A good friend, a white birder, called him to tell him about a sighting of a rare bird: the <a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Connecticut_Warbler/id\">Connecticut </a><a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Connecticut_Warbler/id\">warbler</a>. Lanham describes the bird as \u201cone of my [holy] grail birds\u201d. If there was a bird-ranking chart, Lanham says it would be \u201c9.5 out of 10 on the want-list for most birders\u201d.</p> <p>But the bird was sighted in a probably all-white neighborhood, where Lanham knew he might be viewed suspiciously, more likely to be considered \u201cloitering\u201d than \u201ccasually walking\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI said, maybe the two of us could meet up and go together. I didn\u2019t want to tell him \u2013 I didn\u2019t reveal to him my fear to him of being in this place, of just going there,\u201d says Lanham. \u201cNon-birders might say, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d he muses. But that bird \u2013 which Lanham has only caught glimpses of \u2013 is one he would love to see.</p> <p>\u201cI want to go, to just sit and soak it up, but I can\u2019t because I am afraid of the unknown \u2013 not of nature\u2019s unknown, but of the unknown of what humans [might do to me],\u201d says Lanham. </p> <p>For Ward, that so many obstacles are placed in the way of being able to experience beauty is enraging and disheartening. But it is not discouraging.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I grew up, there was no one I knew in the natural world studying animals who looked like I did, at least not on television. And yet, still my love persisted,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI know that\u2019s changing now and there are people of color who are starting to make serious ground in these spaces. So for future generations I cannot afford to be knocked off track,\u201d he says.</p>",
  "<p>News on Tuesday that Tyrrells would not be renewing their title sponsorship of the Premier 15s for next season seemed on the face of it a blow for top-flight women\u2019s rugby, but with clubs having been assured that their funding from the Rugby Football Union remains ringfenced, and some in the sport not exactly mourning the crisp manufacturer\u2019s departure, mood at the top of the game remains buoyant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/26/tyrrells-end-sponsorship-womens-premier-15s-rfu\">Women's rugby at risk of RFU funding cuts after Tyrrells ends sponsorship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week the former England captain Catherine Spencer welcomed the fact that women\u2019s rugby is now free to find \u201ca more engaged sponsor\u201d that \u201cwants to be linked to sport\u201d.

Tyrrells didn\u2019t do all the things they could have done to promote the game but they gave us a title sponsor, they gave us the start and enabled us to crack on and get the product right.

One woman was filmed being pushed over by cops, before she went into a seizure and was taken to the hospital.</p> \n  <p>In response, de Blasio\u2019s main message appeared to be to keep the NYPD safe, and that violence against the police would not be tolerated. He told people they had made their point and should go home, and blamed the agitation on outsiders coming to the city. Notably, de Blasio responded to questions about the police vehicle driving into protestors with a flippant, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t have done that\u201d and complained about damaged vehicles.</p> \n  <p>The speech was a stark departure from Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, who described how she felt when she watched Floyd\u2019s killing, saying she \u201churt like a mother would hurt\u201d in a speech to her city, or Muriel Bowser, the DC mayor, who called out Donald Trump for hiding \u201cbehind his fence afraid\u201d and said she stood with the people exercising their first amendment right.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1266936605891112960\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m in Brooklyn to talk about tonight\u2019s protests. <a href=\"https://t.co/oBVXGh7JWo\">https://t.co/oBVXGh7JWo</a></p>\u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1266936605891112960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>De Blasio sounded little like the mayor of a city with a long and bloody history of officers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/nyregion/nyc-police-subway-racial-profiling.html\">brutalizing</a> people of color.

By Thursday, it was nearly gone, and last night is a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd\u2019s death or inequities or historical traumas to our communities of color.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Walz added that it <strong>was people of color who were being hit the hardes</strong>t when the protests turn to violence and looting.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause our communities of color and our indigenous communities were out front fighting hand in hand to save businesses that took decades to build. Infrastructure and nonprofits that have served a struggling community were torn down and burned by people with no regard for what went into that,\u201d Waltz added.</p> \n  <p>At the same press conference,Minneapolis mayor, <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>, added that he believes <strong>most protestors were from outside the city</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur Minneapolis residents are scared and rightfully so. We\u2019ve seen longterm institutional businesses overridden. We\u2019ve seen community institutions set on fire. And I want to be very, very clear.

Demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces.</p> \n   <p>By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them.</p> \n   <p>The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and <strong>fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers.

He said he had not set a precise date for the new meeting, but suggested it might be around the time of the annual UN general assembly in New York, which is normally held in September, but there is no guarantee it will go ahead this year. The proposed \u201cG11\u201d meeting might also be held after the presidential election, he said.</p> <p>Trump caught many capitals and White House officials by surprise on 20 May, when he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1263113203749453827\">tweeted</a>: \u201cNow that our Country is \u2018Transitioning back to Greatness,\u2019 I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David.

It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</p> <p>It contradicted the US government\u2019s previous announcement that the G7 meeting would be a teleconference as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The White House, however, confirmed within days that the meeting would be held on 25 and 26 June. It had originally been scheduled for 10 to 12 June at Camp David.</p> <p>The Japanese foreign ministry had been reluctant for the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, to travel to Washington, in part because of the so-called Dominic Cummings effect.</p> <p>Had Abe attended the summit, he would have been required either to quarantine himself for two weeks or take a Covid-19 test on his return.

  "<p>News that Rishi Sunak is planning a summer mini-budget conjures up memories of the 1970s when chancellors were constantly forced to respond to the latest economic crisis.</p> <p>Sunak is finding out what it was like to be Tony Barber or Denis Healey, who ran the treasury from 1970 to 1979. To be sure, that decade seems to be a more relevant reference point than the 16 years between 1992 and 2008 when the economy expanded continuously and inflation was low. That now looks like an aberration rather than the start of a new golden age.</p> <p>As was the case when Barber and Healey were announcing their emergency packages, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/rolls-royce-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-say-sources\">Rolls-Royce</a>, one of the UK\u2019s biggest manufacturers, is struggling. Ministers are contemplating taking a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/unions-and-business-support-sunaks-last-resort-bail-out-plans\">stake in strategically</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/unions-and-business-support-sunaks-last-resort-bail-out-plans\"> important companies</a> to stop them going bust. Sunak is forever popping up to announce the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/rishi-sunak-confirms-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-to-be-gradually-withdrawn\">latest changes to his furlough scheme </a>amid fears of mass unemployment. There is bitter argument over Europe and much loathing of the occupant of the White House. Substitute power cuts for physical distancing rules, the three-day week for the lockdown, and Richard Nixon for Donald Trump and the picture seems complete.</p> <p>Not quite, though. For the full 1970s experience, there needs to be stagflation \u2013 weak or falling activity combined with rapidly rising prices \u2013 of the sort that gripped most western economies after the oil price rocketed in 1973. Even though inflation is currently low, there are economists who think there is a real possibility of it happening.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how a potential stagflation scenario unfolds. At the moment, demand for goods and services is weak because people have been confined to their homes and can only spend their money on essentials or by shopping online. But money is cheap and plentiful, while the government\u2019s wage subsidies \u2013 mirrored by similar schemes in other countries \u2013 have protected incomes. The result will be a splurge of pent-up spending once the pandemic is over.</p> <p>Consumers will find, however, that the supply of goods and services has been hit badly by the lockdown. Firms will either have gone bust or will be operating for the foreseeable future under rules that will limit their capacity. Demand will exceed supply, and with too much money chasing too few goods inflation will go up. Workers will respond to higher prices by seeking higher pay and a wage-price spiral will ensue. Growth is weak but upward pressure on the cost of living is strong. Bingo: stagflation.</p> <p>As Rob Carnell, an economist at ING bank, has pointed out, a bit of 1970s-style stagflation would not be a bad thing in the current circumstances because it would inflate away the real value of record levels of both private and public borrowing. \u201cWith debt ratios hitting previously unimaginable highs, it could be&nbsp;an outcome to grab with both hands, not to recoil from in horror,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But as Carnell also points out, this is not not an especially likely scenario. Much the same argument was made at the time of the global financial crisis a decade ago, when it was said that the vast amount of money creation undertaken by central banks through quantitative easing \u2013 the buying of bonds in return for cash \u2013 would end in the sort of hyper-inflation seen in Germany in the 1920s.</p> <p>As it turns out, central banks have spent most of the past decade concerned that inflation is too low rather than too high. Fears that the steady fall in unemployment would enable workers to pursue inflationary wage claims have proved unfounded. A decade of QE and ultra-low interest rates did lead to stagflation, but not the sort that was expected. Wages stagnated but the price of assets \u2013 commodities, shares, bonds and property \u2013 all inflated.</p> <p>The early stages of the current crisis suggest history could repeat itself. Financial markets have, so far, been the real beneficiaries of central bank activism that dwarfs anything seen in 2008-09. The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has been unable to prevent 40 million US citizens filing jobless claims in the past two months, but it has succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/markets-rebound-after-worst-day-since-1987-amid-coronavirus-panic-ftse-100-dow-jones-wall-street\">boosting share prices</a> on Wall Street.</p> <p>For a classic wage-price spiral to develop, two things would need to happen. First, employees would have to see their living standards eroded. Second, they would need to be able to do something about it.</p> <p>Without question, millions of people around the world are going to feel poorer as a result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>. Even those benefiting from the furlough scheme in the UK will have taken a 20% pay cut all the time they remain off work, and there will be plenty of workers \u2013 including many of the self-employed \u2013 who will be even worse off. It is not just the supply side of the economy that will take a hit: demand will be softer as well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1970s, workers were in a much better position to do something about the squeeze on their incomes than they are today. Manufacturing accounted for more of the economy and trade union membership was high in Britain\u2019s factories. Many industries were state owned and domestic suppliers were more shielded from foreign competition. There was no such thing as the gig economy. Heath\u2019s government introduced threshold agreements under which workers were guaranteed wage rises when inflation rose above a certain level.</p> <p>Unions are weaker than in the 1970s, while employers are stronger. Sunak could use his mini-budget to push through an above-inflation increase in the minimum wage but will be under pressure from business not to do so. Unemployment is about to rocket and the threat of being laid off will mean whatever limited bargaining power workers have will be reduced. It\u2019s hard to see where stagflation comes from.</p>",
  "<p>Every Thursday at 8pm, millions of Britons have opened their front doors or stood on balconies to applaud the NHS. The ritual has been a weekly expression of gratitude to medical workers, and national pride in a state-run health service said to be the envy of the world.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget,\u201d Boris Johnson said in early March, near the start of the coronavirus crisis, \u201cwe already have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-3-march-2020\">fantastic NHS,</a> fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.\u201d</p> <p>Yet those who have experienced the government\u2019s emerging testing and tracing operations for Covid-19 have had limited contact with the NHS. Instead, Britons with symptoms are directed to a network of 50 drive-through testing centres, set up by management consultants at Deloitte.</p> <p>Upon arrival, patients are marshalled not by NHS staff, but workers in hi-vis jackets supplied by outsourcing companies, such as Serco, G4S, Mitie and Sodexo. Those who cannot make the drive have received postal test kits, processed by the private diagnostics company Randox and delivered by Amazon.</p> <p>When contact tracing to stop the spread of the virus finally moved up the agenda in late April, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-april-2020\">the job</a> would be done with an as\u2013yet unproven NHS app. The app has been developed by private firms for NHSX, the technology wing of the health service, which is also responsible for a Covid-19 government data operation involving tech companies Palantir, Faculty, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</p> <p>On Thursday the government finally launched its long-awaited NHS Test and Trace Service. But despite the name, many of the 25,000 contact tracers tracking those potentially exposed to Covid-19 and advising them to self-isolate will be working not for the NHS, but rather the outsourcing firms Serco and Sitel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\" data-alt=\"Testing infrastructure\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/testing-flowchart-zip/giv-3902BxUIKiVHGDMV/\">Testing infrastructure</a> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s reliance on private contractors during the public health emergency comes after a decade of public sector reorganisation, marketisation and deep cuts to services and local government in England. The Guardian has interviewed dozens of public health directors, politicians, experts in infectious disease control, government scientific and political advisers, NHS leaders and emergency planners about the years leading up to the pandemic.</p> <p>They described how an infrastructure that was once in place to respond to public health crises was fractured, and in some places demolished, by policies introduced by recent Conservative governments, with some changes going as far back as Labour\u2019s years in power.</p> <p>\u201cThe undermining of our responsiveness to a pandemic was one of my major concerns,\u201d said Gabriel Scally, a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director of public health in the NHS for almost 20 years. \u201cThere has been a destruction of the infrastructure that stops England coping with major emergencies. It absolutely explains why you\u2019re now seeing private companies being brought into these functions.\u201d</p> <h2>Councils left in the dark</h2> <p>Local authorities are the Cinderellas of government, their work often overlooked. But in the middle of a public health crisis, counties, districts and boroughs traditionally become the foot soldiers of national response. Few have been as badly hit as the east London borough of Newham, the local authority with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in England and Wales.</p> <p>Yet Newham\u2019s director of public health, Jason Strelitz, was left in the dark at the start. He had no official notification that the virus had arrived in his area in mid-March, and only found out when he logged on to the government\u2019s public coronavirus tracker web page to make his daily check on the declared numbers. Strelitz did not know who in Newham had Covid-19, where they had been tested, or which part of the borough they came from.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about the way national testing has been set up,\u201d Strelitz said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a clear picture of who is being tested in our area nor of the extent of community transmission in Newham.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02/1100_1065_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In normal times, a Public Health England (PHE) representative would be expected to contact Strelitz\u2019s environmental health teams if a case of a notifiable disease was found in the area that needed following up, enabling them to set to work tracing contacts and containing an outbreak. But the government had just abandoned community testing and tracing so local authorities were not being contacted at that point.</p> <p>Newham is among the most deprived boroughs in the country. Like all the public health directors interviewed by the Guardian, Strelitz has deep knowledge of the characteristics of his patch that make its health inequalities so stark and its residents so vulnerable to the disease. About 30,000 people have been identified by the council as being at high risk \u2013 many of them over 70, living alone and isolated.</p> <p>Even now, with large-scale community testing resumed, Strelitz said he was not receiving useful test data from the centralised, privately contracted operation created by Hancock. He also has concerns about the contact-tracing operation being set up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Nottingham has had its central government support grant cut by 80% since 2013 and, like many other councils, no longer has reserves for emergencies such as coronavirus. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has made an emergency grant of \u00a33.2bn to councils for Covid-19 costs, which the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has <a href=\"https://mhclgmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/14/response-to-lewis-goodall-newsnight-on-local-authority-funding/\">defended</a> as fair and generous. Mellen disagrees. Nottingham, he said, had been given \u00a319.8m as its share of the exceptional grant, but had already spent well over \u00a312m extra on Covid-19 while losing at least \u00a319m in revenue because of the lockdown.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson did not dispute that cuts to central government grants could have had an impact on local public health networks. However, she pointed to the \u00a33.2bn emergency funding for councils, which she said was in addition to an increase of \u00a32.9bn in councils\u2019 core spending power this year. \u201cProtecting the public\u2019s health is, and has always been, a priority for the UK government,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>A decade of austerity</h2> <p>Next month, Britain will mark an anniversary many Conservative ministers would rather forget. Shortly after 12.30pm on 22 June 2010, George Osborne stepped up to the dispatch box as chancellor of the new coalition government and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">announced</a> the longest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/23/budget-longest-deepest-cuts-ifs\">deepest period of cuts</a> to public service spending since the second world war.</p> <p>Ushering in a new age of austerity to a raucous Commons, Osborne outlined \u00a381bn of cuts over five years. His aim was twofold: to eliminate the government\u2019s budget deficit and to reduce its debt as a share of GDP. The emergency budget would, he said, bring the country back from the brink of ruin. \u201cIt pays for the past. It plans for the future. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Osborne told MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=60%25&amp;title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\" data-alt=\"60% cut in local authority funding\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=60%25&title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\">60% cut in local authority funding</a> </figure>  <p>It was the prime minister, David Cameron, who had the previous year introduced the notion of \u201cthe age of irresponsibility giving way to the age of austerity\u201d. He said he expected the public spending cuts would be permanent as the private and voluntary sectors stepped in to deliver public services better than the state could. Some government departments would be cut by a third and most public sector workers would have to accept a pay freeze.</p> <p>Along with welfare, some of the most brutal reductions were imposed on local government in England as Osborne transferred the political risk of austerity to councils. Over the next decade, local authorities had 60% of their funding from central government cut, <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.40_01_Finance%20publication_WEB_0.pdf\">according to the Local Government Association</a>. At the same time their ability to increase council tax, to try to replace the lost revenue, was capped. The cuts <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts#anounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure\">fell disproportionately</a> on those authorities with the poorest populations.</p> <p>Cameron promised he would \u201ccut the deficit, not the NHS\u201d and Osborne ringfenced its budget. It got cash increases, but these were less than 1% a year, and failed to keep pace with growing demand from an ageing population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=32%2C000&amp;title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\" data-alt=\"32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=32%2C000&title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\">32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09</a> </figure>  <p>Approximately 32,000 overnight beds have been <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/\">lost</a> from hospitals in England in just over a decade, including some lost under Labour. Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University, points out that the number of beds lost is roughly the same as the beds the NHS had to scramble <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/04/nightingale-ldn-discharges-first/\">to free up for Covid-19</a> patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=33%2C000&amp;title=hospital%20beds%20reconfigured%20for%20Covid-19%20at%20the%20end%20of%20March\" data-alt=\"33,000 hospital beds reconfigured for Covid-19\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=33%2C000&title=hospital%20beds%20reconfigured%20for%20Covid-19%20at%20the%20end%20of%20March\">33,000 hospital beds reconfigured for Covid-19</a> </figure>  <p>When the coronavirus spread to Europe earlier this year, the UK ranked 24th among European countries for its numbers of <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8/figures/1\">critical care beds</a>, with 6.6 per 100,000 population, compared with Germany, which topped the league with 29.2 per 100,000.</p> <h2>NHS fragmentation</h2> <p>Two years after Osborne\u2019s announcement, with austerity beginning to bite, the then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, embarked on a complete market-oriented restructuring of the NHS. Despite Cameron\u2019s pre-election promise that there would be no more pointless, <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/never-again\">disruptive top-down reorganisations</a>, critics argue that Lansley\u2019s 2012 Health and Social Care Act did just that.</p> <p>Labour had done its fair share of subjecting the NHS to upheaval. Its programme of building new hospitals under the private finance initiative required other hospital and community health services to close, and shrank bed numbers to help cover the high annual fees to private companies. It accelerated changes brought in by the Conservatives to mimic a market, and created NHS trusts that could operate as semi-autonomous corporate bodies. By 2006, Labour\u2019s reorganisations had created 152 primary care trusts (PCTs). Overarching priorities were set by regional strategic health authorities and the Department of Health.</p> <p>But every area still had a Public Health Observatory, which included infectious disease control teams. Under government pandemic plans, each had to identify rapid response teams for testing and tracing, and these were activated during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.</p> <p>Health authorities also had consultants in communicable disease control appointed at senior level on a par with NHS hospital consultants. An independent public body, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), provided specialist support on the threat of emerging diseases. There were critics of the structures, but in planning for emergencies there was, at least, a clear chain of command and control. \u201cLabour started the process of fragmenting public health but it was at least still integrated with communicable disease control and the NHS,\u201d Pollock said.</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s legislation did away with much of that. He abolished PCTs and strategic health authorities. Instead, existing public health structures were stripped out of the NHS and redistributed, along with their budgets and staff. In a dramatic shift, local authorities were given responsibility for public health for their areas, with larger ones being required to appoint a director of public health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c/0_200_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey took a perfectly well-functioning public health system and fractured it,\u201d said Julie Hotchkiss, a PCT director with responsibility for emergency pandemic response who moved to York city council during the changes. She said it took her a year to work out where her infectious disease control nurses had gone. \u201cNo one knew and there was no one to ask.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, argues it was right for local authorities to have a key role in tackling health inequalities, which tend to relate to people\u2019s living circumstances and socio-economic status. She regards the transfer of public health to local authorities as \u201cincredibly important and positive\u201d. But she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big job and the transition came at a time of cuts to the public sector, not just to local government, although those were huge.\u201d</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s act also created an entirely new agency that has been at the centre of the response to the coronavirus outbreak: Public Health England. It was given two primary responsibilities: improving health and reducing inequalities by tackling \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as obesity; and protecting the public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards.</p> <p>The HPA, which had previously taken a lead on infectious disease control, was folded into PHE. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues the result of all these new arrangements was \u201ca hugely weakened and fragmented public health system with consequences writ large in Covid-19\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3850m&amp;title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\" data-alt=\"\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A3850m&title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\">\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015</a> </figure>  <p>The DHSC rejected the suggestion that the system was fragmented and that changes had affected the government\u2019s ability to respond. Lord Lansley did too. He told the Guardian that an independent review of the public health changes from 2013 published by the <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> thinktank in January, \u201cconcluded that they were the right reforms, but were not supported subsequently by the right level of resources\u201d. Combating health threats, such as pandemics, was \u201cno more or less fragmented\u201d after 2013, Lansley said, and the problem was not the new structures or moving public health to local government but money. \u201cOur intention was for a real-terms increase in public health budgets alongside those for the NHS, but this was not followed through from 2015 onwards,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ringfenced annual grant for public health from central government to local authorities \u2013 currently about \u00a33.2bn \u2013 has been cut by a cumulative \u00a3850m in real terms since 2015-16, according to <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> review.</p> <p>During his two-decade career in government, Scally had been involved in emergency responses for swine flu, foot and mouth, BSE, and the fuel crisis. For previous epidemics, he said, the government took \u201ca public health approach; go in quick and hard, test, trace, isolate, throw everything at it\u201d. But, he said, \u201cthe whole system was demolished\u201d by Lansley\u2019s changes, which led him to resign.</p> <p>He then worked as an adviser for Labour\u2019s former shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, who is now the mayor of Greater Manchester. Burnham recalls Scally constantly warning him as Lansley\u2019s bill was going through parliament that \u201cwe were losing pandemic preparedness\u201d.</p> <h2>Testing time for Public Health England</h2> <p>No branch of government appears to have received more flak over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak than Public Health England. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">suggested it had failed</a> to expand testing at the right moment. Its top executive has been criticised by leading public health experts, such as Prof Anthony Costello of University College London, for being \u201cinvisible\u201d.</p> <p>Even before the outbreak, the agency was a target of complaints from across the spectrum. Leftwing critics have accused PHE of failing to be tough enough in its role of promoting better health. The right has accused it of being the instrument of a nanny state with a bloated budget. PHE has had precious few political friends. But even those who might be natural allies \u2013 like Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England \u2013 suggest it has \u201chad a bad Covid war\u201d.</p> <p>Some of this might be down to bad luck. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, caught the virus along with key advisers in Westminster, and its&nbsp;emeritus medical director and director for health protection&nbsp;until 2019, Prof Paul Cosford, has cancer and has been self-isolating, although both have been working throughout.</p> <p>However, there have also been structural challenges. The Lansley act created an agency that lacked independence from government, in contrast to its predecessor, the HPA. That has led to suspicions that some PHE decisions were politically influenced, such as the varying guidance on what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for frontline staff treating Covid-19 patients. In late March, PHE said a lower specification of protective gowns than previously advised could be used, leading <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/trust-draining-away-over-dangerous-downgrade-ppe-guidance\">unions to accuse</a> it of basing decisions on shortages of PPE, rather than evidence. This month, it <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/coronavirus/mask-guidance-downgraded-amid-reports-of-failing-stock/7027562.article\">downgraded the type of masks</a> NHS workers should use \u201cas a pragmatic approach for times of severe shortage\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bafd3dcb8d86d9d955feb8409a33bcf41955efda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bafd3dcb8d86d9d955feb8409a33bcf41955efda/0_413_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clinical staff wearing PPE as they care for a patient at the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinical staff wearing PPE as they care for a patient at the intensive care unit at Royal Papworth hospital in Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>PHE disputes that it was slow off the mark, and Selbie points out that it rolled out the details for its first diagnostic test in January, making it \u201cthe fastest deployment of a novel test in recent UK history\u201d. It says the guidance on PPE has been misunderstood: it was offering a solution in the event of extreme shortages.</p> <p>\u201cOur track record speaks for itself,\u201d a PHE spokesperson said. \u201cDuring 2018-19 alone, we responded to more than 10,000 disease outbreaks and emergencies across England, including meningitis, measles, E coli and the first ever UK case of monkeypox. Our flu vaccination programme grows every year and cases of TB have fallen to the lowest level since records began.\u201d They said that far from being invisible, Selbie had been at the coalface, helping to advise government on its decision-making.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson cited a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/661350/PHE-Evaluation_and_Recommendations.pdf\">positive report</a> by the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, which described PHE as a \u201cstrong, capable, coordinated, united and efficient public health agency\u201d. The report only examined PHE and not the public health systems devolved to local authorities. The same report pointed out that \u201cthere is scope for greater clarity in the responsibilities of PHE\u2019s local partners\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A040%25&amp;title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\" data-alt=\"40% cut to PHE operational budget\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A040%25&title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\">40% cut to PHE operational budget</a> </figure>  <p>In its defence, PHE has had to absorb disparate functions since its creation in 2013. And it too has been struck by austerity: a public health source said PHE\u2019s operational budget sustained a 40% real-terms cut between 2013 and 2019.</p> <p>It was PHE that initially had responsibility for testing, tracing and advising isolation for those who became infected. It was a huge and complicated task, but one the World Health Organization has made clear from the outset was the single most important thing countries could do to suppress the disease. The government\u2019s decision to abandon large-scale testing and tracing on 12 March remains one of its most controversial decisions.</p> <p>PHE says it reprioritised limited resources rather than abandoning tracing completely. \u201cWhen the lockdown began, our contact-tracing resource was refocused on to complex outbreaks in care homes, prisons and immigration centres,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cThe good news is, now that we have testing capacity in place and are working towards recovery, we can start mass contact tracing through the NHS test and trace programme.</p> <p>\u201cPHE\u2019s contact tracing during the \u2018\u2018contain\u2019 phase of the pandemic bought several weeks of time for the government and the NHS to prepare for what was to come, and has undoubtedly saved lives,\u201d he said.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></p></li> </ul> <p>Greg Clark, the chair of the Commons science and technology select committee, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52716828\">accused</a> PHE of choosing to \u201cconcentrate\u201d tests in its own limited number of labs rather than expanding capacity rapidly by using university and private labs, as the Germans and South Koreans had done, even though the need for mass testing was \u201cidentifiable from the beginning\u201d. PHE responded by blaming the DHSC, saying it was responsible for decisions on testing policy.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough Britain had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, it did not have the existing diagnostic base necessary to test hundreds of thousands of people each week for a new virus.\u201d She said the government had more than doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE laboratories since early March, with more than 3m tests carried out by mid-May, and that anyone with symptoms could now book a test.</p> <p>The government boasts that its new Test and Trace programme will mobilise an \u201carmy\u201d of contact tracers. But in the two months leading up to 12 March, PHE\u2019s team resembled no more than a small platoon. The Guardian has established it consisted of just 70 staff in its field services, 120 in local health protection teams, and 20 specially recruited clinical staff. In total, the contact tracing operation to manage the pandemic consisted of just 210 people.</p> <p>Documents released on Friday by the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) suggest the contact-tracing operation initially only envisaged the need to deal with a handful of cases a week. Minutes from an 18 February meeting of the group said: \u201cCurrently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).\u201d The minutes added: \u201cModelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress-tested with PHE operational colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than ramp\u2013up capacity, the government scientists instead agreed in the same meeting they would need data \u201cto feed into trigger points for decisions on when the current monitoring and contact-tracing approach is no longer working\u201d. The minutes added: \u201cWhen there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.\u201d</p> <p>PHE said&nbsp;the reference to five cases a week was based on modelling of how it would cope with tracking the contacts of imported cases of Covid-19. In a statement, it added:&nbsp;\u201cPHE&nbsp;could deal with 5 new cases a week&nbsp;and the associated isolation of 800 contacts \u2013 which was sufficient capacity at the time \u2013 and&nbsp;modelling suggested it had the capacity to scale up significantly as needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, two days later, at another Sage meeting, the advisers acknowledged \u201cindividual cases could already have been missed\u201d and again discussed when it would be appropriate to abandon the nascent operation. Appearing to acknowledge such a move would be controversial, the minutes said: \u201cAny decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.\u201d</p> <p>By the time community tracing was shelvedin mid\u2013March, PHE had \u201ccontact traced\u201d only 3,500 people who were likely to have been in close proximity with infected people on flights, cruises or other places where there were known outbreaks. Of those, only 3% tested positive for Covid-19 and were advised to self-isolate.</p> <p>In other words, PHE had managed to identify and warn about 100 people with Covid-19 who might otherwise have spread the disease \u2013 a tiny fraction of the infected people. Vallance said there were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9cf7d0-3d11-443e-a156-d111b333fd72\">5,000 confirmed</a> Covid cases when the community testing and tracing programme stopped, but epidemiologists at Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">estimated</a> 1.8 million people in Britain were infected by the end of March.</p> <p>William Hanage, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Harvard University, said the numbers of PHE staff dedicated to contact tracing in Britain in the weeks leading up to mid-March was shocking. \u201cI am sure that the people involved in this programme worked incredibly hard, and I have the utmost respect for them, tasked with doing this in the face of a global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it beggars belief to see these numbers held up as adequate.\u201d</p> <h2>The elusive 100,000 target</h2> <p>On 2 April, three weeks after capacity had been overwhelmed and PHE had abandoned testing in the community, Hancock <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-sets-out-plan-to-carry-out-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">announced</a> a five-pillar testing plan. He pledged to scale up the country\u2019s testing capacity to reach a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.</p> <p>But the architecture created in the postwar years to respond to pandemics was no longer standing. In the past, the Public Health Laboratories Service had been tasked with disease control, and with coordinating support and advice to the NHS and others. In 2003, Labour folded it into the HPA. Fifty PHLS labs that existed two decades ago have been merged with hospital labs or \u201cconsolidated\u201d by successive governments to make efficiency savings. As of January this year, just eight laboratories remained under direct PHE control, along with <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/pathology-networks/\">122 NHS labs</a> in England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6/0_49_3529_2118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hancock expected hospital labs testing patients and staff and PHE to make up 25,000 of the ambitious 100,000 target. For the other 75,000 he turned to the private sector. Deloitte, one of the big four accountancy firms, was asked to set up a network of 50 drive-through rapid testing centres, and yet more private companies, such as Serco, Sodexo, Mitie and G4S, would operate and manage the day-to-day running of them.</p> <p>A lab network to process the tests was also established. Deloitte was again given the coordinating role in the creation of new Lighthouse labs in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Belfast and Cheshire and a further facility in Cambridge, with day-to-day running entrusted to a coalition of private and public partners, including universities and drug companies.</p> <p>But Hancock\u2019s 2 April announcement made no mention of one of the main purposes of testing: tracking or tracing.</p> <p>The Guardian soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">received reports</a> from people trying to get tested of chaos at some sites, with results going astray, dangerously leaking swab samples arriving at labs, queues of more than three hours and symptomatic people being unable to book a test or told to make round trips of more than 100 miles to test centres. Many still report results taking seven to 10 days to arrive \u2013 too long to be useful for quarantine purposes \u2013 but the DHSC maintains that 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours.</p> <p>In the last week of April, the government <a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2425455/\">changed its criteria</a> for counting tests to include ones that had been dispatched, even if they had not been received, returned or processed. The date of 30 April came and Hancock missed his 100,000 target; the number of tests conducted that day was 81,611. But the next day, on 1 May, he appeared to smash it, as 122,347 tests were recorded in government data. The magic number had, by Hancock\u2019s own admission, included nearly 30,000 postal tests sent out but not yet analysed. By 3 May the number was back down to 76,496, and the government would fail to meet its target for the next seven days, before getting back on track on 11 May.</p> <p>For Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, Hancock\u2019s single-minded focus on reaching an arbitrary number cost the country another precious month. \u201cToo much of April was wasted by focusing on the 100,000 tests by 30 April target at the expense of other aspects of a clear strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe testing strategy, if there was one, got hijacked on the basis of just meeting that target when there were lots of other things that needed to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Hopson said the saga also illustrates the danger of trying to control testing from the centre. \u201cWe need to be ready to do test, track and trace in every part of the country. That can only be done effectively with greater local control.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>There\u2019s been a lot of argument about how best to handle the coronavirus pandemic, but if there are two things on which most people currently agree, it\u2019s that governments should have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">better prepared</a>, and that everyone should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/19/returning-to-work-coronavirus-rights-notice-pay-cuts-safety\">get back to work</a> as soon as it is safe to do so. After all, it seems more or less self-evident that you need to be ready for unexpected contingencies \u2013 and that it is better for the economy to function at full capacity. More PPE would have saved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/emails-reveal-doctors-plea-for-ppe-before-covid-19-death-dr-peter-tun\">doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 lives</a>; more work means less unemployment and more growth.</p> <p>But there is a catch to this, and it has been at the heart of political debate since Machiavelli. It is impossible to achieve both goals at once. Contingency planning requires unused capacity, whereas exploiting every opportunity to the full means losing the flexibility needed to respond to sudden changes of fortune.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the mid-20th century that economists started to realise that it might be better to leave a bit of slack in the economy to help cope with exogenous shocks. In the years after the Great Depression, governments saw the problem as \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Lv5DDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=idle+men,+idle+land,+idle+machines+and+idle+money&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HcgTePmsDv&amp;sig=ACfU3U24-iFOCp8pSouPgD4kRpKVMmeAag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiymN7JlcfpAhUCXRUIHXkgBOQQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=idle%20men%2C%20idle%20land%2C%20idle%20machines%20and%20idle%20money&amp;f=false\">idle men, idle land, idle machines and idle money</a>\u201d. But there were also economists, such as the Englishman <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harold_Hutt\">William Hutt</a>, who went against the Keynesian consensus and pointed out that there were some things \u2013 fire extinguishers, for example \u2013 that were valuable precisely because they were never used. Having large stocks of PPE, underemployed nurses, or a lot of spare capacity in ICUs, falls into the same category. Idle resources are what you need in a crisis, so some degree of inefficiency isn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/greening-economy-prosperity-financial-crisis-coronavirus\">We now have the proof: greening the economy doesn't come at the price of prosperity | Fiona Harvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trying to manage a pandemic in a world of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing\">just-in-time production lines</a> and precarious labour brings these issues into sharper focus. On the one hand, there weren\u2019t enough idle resources for most countries to cope adequately with the spread of the virus. On the other, the enforced idleness of the lockdown leads to calls to get the economy moving again.</p> <p>For Donald Trump, the prospect of a prolonged shutdown is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel\">particularly alarming</a> because it threatens to undermine the competitiveness of the US economy relative to other nations (notably China) that have dealt with the crisis more efficiently. That\u2019s an argument Machiavelli would have understood very well. One of his constant refrains was that idleness could lead to what he called corruption (the diversion of resources from the public good, which Trump equates with the Dow Jones Industrial Average) \u2013 and that corruption leads inevitably to defeat at the hands of your rivals.</p> <p>For Machiavelli, the contagion of corruption was spread above all by Christianity, a \u201creligion of idleness\u201d. And it is true that the Judeo-Christian tradition, with its sabbaths, jubilees, feast days, and religious specialists devoted to a life of prayer and contemplation rather than martial virtue, built a lot of slack into the system. Machiavelli thought it should be squeezed out through laws that would prevent surplus becoming the pretext for idleness, rather in the way that later economists looked to the pressure mechanism of competition to do the same.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a contradiction in Machiavelli\u2019s thinking here, because he also acknowledged that one of the things every polity needed was periodic renewal and reform, and that corruption was what preceded it. So you\u2019re in a double bind: either you can squeeze out the slack and never experience renewal, or you can court corruption and create an opportunity to start over and make things better.</p> <p>With hindsight it looks like that\u2019s one of the problems the religions of idleness tried to address, by incorporating idleness into the calendar. In ancient Hebrew tradition, there were weekly sabbaths, and every seventh year was meant to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmita\">a </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmita\">year of release</a> in which the land was left to lie fallow, debts were forgiven and slaves emancipated. The idea was picked up by the Chartist William Benbow, who in 1832 used it as the model for what he called a <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/history/england/chartists/benbow-congress.htm\">Grand National Holiday</a>, in effect a month-long general strike that would allow a National Congress to reform society \u201cto obtain for all at the least expense to all, the largest sum of happiness for all\u201d.</p> <p>Benbow\u2019s plan came to nothing, but it provides an alternative model for how the lockdown might be viewed. The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben <a href=\"https://www.journal-psychoanalysis.eu/coronavirus-and-philosophers/\">has complained that</a> the lockdown is a state of exception with an increase in executive powers and a partial abrogation of the rule of law; but the flipside is that it is the closest thing to a Grand National Holiday that most of us have ever experienced. Despite all the suffering the pandemic has caused, for many it has also meant no work, debt relief, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">empty roads</a> and a rare opportunity to live on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">free money from the government</a>.</p> <p>Generally speaking, exogenous threats like wars or natural disasters act as pressure mechanisms forcing us to redouble our efforts to combat them together. The benefit of contagion is that the only way to combat it is to do less rather than more. That has some demonstrable advantages. There has been a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">global fall in carbon emissions</a>. The only comparable reduction in greenhouse gases during the past 30 years came as the result of the decline of industrial production in eastern Europe after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/jul/14/soviet-union-collapse-in-pictures\">fall of communism</a>. That was managed exceptionally badly because neoliberal economists thought that what post-communist states needed was the pressure of free market competition. Shock therapy would galvanise the economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/29/excess-deaths-uk-has-one-highest-levels-europe\">Coronavirus excess deaths: UK has one of highest levels in Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pandemic has been a shock alright, but its effect has been the opposite of galvanising. People everywhere had to stop whatever they were doing or planning to do in the future. That provides an altogether different model of political change. The philosopher Walter Benjamin once noted that while Karl Marx claimed that revolutions were the locomotives of world history, things might actually turn out to be rather different: \u201cPerhaps revolutions are the human race \u2026 travelling in this train, reaching for the emergency brake.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone keeps saying that we are living through strange times, but what is strange about it is that because everything has come to a stop, it is as though we are living out of time. The emergency brake has been pulled and time is standing still. It feels uncanny, and there\u2019s more slack in the world economy than there ever has been before. And that means, as both Benjamin and Machiavelli would have recognised, that there is also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for change and renewal.</p> <p>For some, this might mean a shorter working week, or less air travel. For others, it might suggest the opportunity for a more fundamental remaking of our political system. A space of possibility has unexpectedly opened up, so although the lockdown may be coming to an end, perhaps the standstill should continue.</p> <p>\u2022 Malcolm Bull teaches at Oxford.

  "<p><strong>Passport details<br></strong>Lady Florence Baker, n\u00e9e Flora Barbara Maria von Sz\u00e1sz, or Sass. Born 6 August 1841 in Nagyenyed, then in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary\" title=\"Kingdom of Hungary\">Kingdom of Hungary</a>, now Aiud in present-day Romania.</p> <p><strong>Claim to fame<br></strong>The details of Florence Baker\u2019s early life are sketchy \u2013 for dramatic reasons. As an orphan she was sold into the Ottoman slave trade, and in 1859 found herself on the auction block in Vidin, in present-day Bulgaria. Blonde, blue-eyed and polylingual, she caught the eye of English traveller Samuel Baker, who bought her.</p> <p>Baker, a middle-aged widower, took her with him as he headed to Africa to search for the source of the Nile. Along the way, Florence learned Arabic, brokered peace when their team of locals mutinied, and nearly died of sunstroke. They didn\u2019t find the source of the Nile, but she and Samuel were the first Europeans to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/11/uganda-thirst-for-hydropower-raises-fears-for-environment-murchison-falls\">Murchison Falls</a> and Lake Albert in Uganda. When Samuel went back to England in 1865 to be knighted, she went with him as his wife. Explorer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2013/mar/19/scotland-malawi-davidlivingstone\">David Livingstone</a> wrote snarkily: \u201cBaker married his mistress at Cairo and by all accounts she deserved it after going through all she did for him.\u201d It\u2019s said that a scandalised Queen Victoria refused to receive them at court. Between 1870 and 1873, the Bakers made another expedition to east Africa to try to suppress the slave trade \u2013 presumably a cause Florence felt strongly about.</p> <p><strong>Supporting documentation<br></strong>Florence kept diaries of her travels in English, but has been overshadowed by her husband and still lacks a definitive biography. In the writings of others \u2013 Samuel especially \u2013 she emerges as a person of enormous resourcefulness and sangfroid, whether serving afternoon tea to guests in the jungle or preparing a last-ditch defence against the king of Bunyoro\u2019s army.</p> <p><strong>Distinguishing marks<br></strong>It may just be the long exposure times of 19th-century photography, but pictures of Florence portray an icy calm and imperturbability. </p> <p><strong>Last sighted<br></strong>Widowed in 1893, Florence lived until 1916 at Sandford Orleigh, the Bakers\u2019 estate in Devon, and was doubtless gratified when the Daily News<em> </em>called her \u201ca refined English lady\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Intrepidness rating<br></strong>Florence, like Daenerys Targaryen in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a>, was blessed with resilience that seems to require supernatural explanation: 10.</p>",

The government has finally twigged that the best way to get through to people at times like these is with drama.

His movements, surely the product of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/dec/06/andy-serkis-film-hobbit-king-kong-fungus\">Andy Serkis\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/dec/06/andy-serkis-film-hobbit-king-kong-fungus\"> inimitable amphibianesque physicality</a> (thanks Andy for stepping up when your country needs you), were projected on to a verdant garden backdrop and the character then seated himself at a simple table with a glass of water, presumably to allay any subconscious audience concerns that he needs to keep moist.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then we were in for an informative treat! Enough of the hypothetical scenarios, let\u2019s hear about what an everyday decent guy has been doing under his own unique and specific circumstances \u2013 because, in the end, everyone\u2019s circumstances are unique and specific, and guidelines can only ever be that: a guide. And rules can also only ever be that. And laws too. And the lines on a road, just guidelines, lines guiding you wherever you want to go.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of Dominic Cummings, that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">a big phlegmy trip with wife and child</a> up to his parents\u2019 property in Durham. That\u2019s a long way from his home in London, but here is the government finally showing it gets it: not everyone\u2019s family estate is in the Home Counties. Come on \u2013 wake up, media bubble! Some families have to look much further afield to be able to buy a large amount of land. That\u2019s the reality of modern Britain. Hooray that it\u2019s finally being recognised.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whatever Cummings does, Johnson\u2019s endorsement provides the punchline</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with a lot of important art, <em>Cummings and Goings</em> is rich with allegory. Durham doesn\u2019t just mean Durham. Durham is an idea, a feeling, a state of mind \u2013 a hope, a plan or a secret. We all have a Durham \u2013 that\u2019s what Cummings is saying \u2013 but it\u2019s probably not literally Durham. His Durham is Durham but your Durham may be Brighton or the outer Hebrides or a pub that still opens on the quiet.</p> <p>And of course we aren\u2019t meant to take literally the idea that Dominic Cummings drove 30 miles to a riverbank at Barnard Castle on his wife\u2019s birthday purely because all the opticians were closed.&nbsp;Nobody would be so stupid as to think that could be fact. Is it fiction then? Assuming so, like all the greatest fiction, it conveys a deeper truth. What is that truth? Well, as both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said, people need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/boris-johnson-says-people-should-make-up-own-minds-on-dominic-cummings-video\">\u201cmake up their own minds\u201d.</a></p> <p>The nuance and complexity of Cummings as a character is a testament to how much respect our leaders have for us. Not for the British a patronising clear and packaged message, but instead an unvarnished deep, insoluble human truth \u2013 pain, fear, disdain, secrecy, compromise and how scruffy a shirt can look after a comparatively short period of wearing it, all laid bare. This is a massive advance in public communication and I predict Cummings will be bigger than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/25/david-prowse-green-cross-man-darth-vader-children-road-safety\">the Green Cross Code </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/25/david-prowse-green-cross-man-darth-vader-children-road-safety\">Man.</a> We\u2019ll be buying dolls of him \u2013 little nodding ones for the dashboard, implicitly endorsing our every journey.&nbsp;</p> <p>I look forward to Cummings\u2019s future adventures whatever they\u2019ll be. Cummings saying \u201clovely bluebells\u201d when his eyesight goes weird again on the A1(M); Cummings losing his job and starting a podcast; Cummings climbing up a 5G mast to set fire to it, slipping and ending up dangling from his own beanie; Cummings taking his wife and child on a 100mph circuit of Brands Hatch in order to safely check his tyre pressure.</p> <p>And of course, the real stroke of comic genius is how Boris Johnson joins in with the fiction, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_raOZqmxYQ\">like Tony Hart did with </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_raOZqmxYQ\">Mr Bennett.</a> Whatever Cummings does, Johnson\u2019s endorsement provides the punchline. A lesser leader might excuse Cummings by saying he made a mistake but not a very serious one. But Johnson said he \u201cacted responsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d.</p> <p>Not just \u201che is in general a responsible, law-abiding person who has integrity\u201d but on this particular occasion \u2013 the Durham trip under lockdown plus eye test at the national speed limit \u2013 for that bit of his life, Cummings \u201cacted responsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. Etch that phrase on to the side of a giant aluminium penis, call it \u201cThe Treachery of Words\u201d and you\u2019d have a major contender for the Turner prize.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.\u201d Francis Bacon may have been the father of the great English empirical tradition \u2013 we arrive at truth by asking questions and assessing evidence \u2013 but when he wrote one of the most quoted lines in the language, he could mock Pilate because in 1625 it was self-evident that Jesus was the son of God.&nbsp;</p> <p>Today we are less certain about God and Jesus, but ever more certain about Bacon\u2019s greater point \u2013 that if we don\u2019t question and test the answers there is no route to truth.</p> <p>However, Bacon\u2019s conception of objective truth has long been under fire. There is no truth; there is your truth and my truth. All facts are mediated through personal experience; as even scientific theories change over time.</p> <p>It\u2019s an attitude that has spilled over into politics and journalism. Time was, when the bulk of the Tory and Labour parties could be trusted to adhere to the notion that there are truths; that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/bbc-impartiality-emily-maitliss-owen-jones\">BBC impartiality</a>, for example, could exist. However, politics has become increasingly about the fight to control the <em>narrative</em> which then, in turn, dictates \u201cfacts\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus a Brexiter politician will celebrate leading Britain into global trading relationships based on \u201cWTO\u201d terms even as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/uk-post-brexit-trade-at-risk-as-wto-top-court-shuts-down\">WTO collapses</a>. It\u2019s the story that counts, not the truth \u2013 better still if it can be captured, Dominic Cummings-like, in a three-word slogan.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s a reflex that is fatally on display in the government\u2019s management of the pandemic. Suddenly the issues are not just a party political fight to create a \u201cdominant narrative\u201d, whatever the facts, but are a matter of life and death. The government wants to portray itself as being truth-seeking, driven by \u201cthe science\u201d. But it was not science that justified the fatal weeks-long delay in launching lockdown; it was the prime minister\u2019s own libertarian instincts and accompanying indecision \u2013 looking for a scientific rationale to show mitigation was the better policy.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Covid-19 is creating a watershed moment.

There really are facts; we had better respect them if we want to stay alive. The furore provoked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/28/bbc-swamped-with-complaints-about-newsnight-intro-on-cummings\">Emily Maitlis</a>, <em>Newsnight</em>\u2019s talented and charismatic lead presenter, and her introduction&nbsp;to the Tuesday night programme spoke to the moment. All the country, she said as she opened her programme, knew that the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser had broken the lockdown rules. People \u201cfeel like fools\u201d for observing the rules when those at the top did not, and they could not understand why Johnson \u201cblindly\u201d supported his adviser.</p> <p>But was she stating the facts \u2013 or framing a narrative to support a particular truth?</p> <p>BBC managers, in receipt of thousands of both complaining and supportive emails and a call from No 10, were in no doubt. A lightening fast official BBC reprimand was issued; but not calling out any particular mistake. Maitlis volunteered for a night off, which was quickly portrayed by some as her de facto one-programme suspension.&nbsp;</p> <p>Were BBC managers right? In a battle for the narratives, her introduction certainly challenged the government\u2019s \u2013 but it was actually supported by facts aplenty. Impartiality is about asking questions in search of truth, a value the BBC must hold to the last if it is to survive, and one that needs to be expressed both on and off air. The BBC management\u2019s first instinct when under fire should have been to adopt the same judicious questioning of Maitlis off air that it expects of its presenters on air. They should have worked out a shared response based around shared values and should have done so in their own time, rather than the government\u2019s.</p> <p>This was certainly the way it worked in the 1980s when I was <em>Newsnight</em>\u2019s economics editor. I could trust that the BBC\u2019s first instinct would be my defence, and that I would be involved in the case made in reply to any complaints, from whatever quarter they came. Everything would turn not on a narrative but on whether the facts supported what I reported.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Too little attempt was made to defend Maitlis. The BBC moved, within hours, to concede that she had overstepped the mark</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is wrong about where the BBC has now landed is that too little attempt was made to defend Maitlis, involve her, or create a joint position as the BBC tried to do in the 1980s. Instead it moved, within hours, to concede that Maitlis had overstepped the mark, presumably in being a \u201cnarrative creator\u201d, without explicitly identifying what error of fact Maitlis had made. Yes, it was a tonally tough framing of the programme, and parts could have been better cast in terms of questions that needed answering, but it was framed by objective fact.</p> <p>The bigger political reality is that this was Cummings and a government baying for the BBC\u2019s head \u2013 appeasement was the order of the day. If the BBC felt that Maitlis had moved into editorialising, it needed to set that out baldly and factually. Instead, she was turned into a victim overnight, creating just the diversionary story for which Downing Street will have hoped. And, by requesting not to present, she too got sucked into No 10\u2019s game.</p> <p>The reaction was painful. The BBC, hitherto enjoying growing ratings with reports that its audience could trust, was on the back foot. Maitlis may have pushed the envelope but, substantially, she was right. We want facts. We want facts on virus testing, facts on whether there was a protective ring around care homes, facts on whether the testing capacity will work and any new app will not transgress basic human rights. There are no \u201cmy truths\u201d and no \u201cyour truths\u201d.</p> <p>Trust can only be earned in public health policy by testing answers. Evidence bending in order to justify a political position is not going to work. One of the reasons Keir Starmer\u2019s approval rating is rising is that he is in step with the times. The period of British politics in which style and storytelling triumphed over fact and evidence is ending. The tragedy is that it has taken a first-order health crisis to remind the British of the tradition that Francis Bacon pioneered \u2013 and once again to live by it.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>",

Anyone looking for details would have struggled to find them last week at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UME5egprg\">press conference</a> held by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/li-keqiang\">Li Keqiang</a>, with the Chinese premier much more focused on the ruling party\u2019s perils on the home front.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy, the world of blustering threats that Beijing has been using to bend countries to its bidding, was absent. Instead Li\u2019s focus in the 90-minute event was much more that of a nerdy economic policymaker. In the kind of minute detail redolent of the boss of a small provincial city, the premier listed an array of support measures for the economy: tax cuts for small business, reforms to medical and unemployment insurance, and support for the gig economy.</p> <p>The reason for Li\u2019s focus was obvious. China might have been the first major country out of (as it was the first into) the Covid-19 crisis, but its economy suffered a brutal contraction along the way, leaving a jobless rate of about 20%.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287/424_245_4387_2633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Li Keqiang gives a video press conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Li Keqiang gives a video press conference after the closing of the third session of the 13th National People\u2019s Congress on 28 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China News Service/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The premier\u2019s annual press conference, held at the end of the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s legislature \u2013 delayed by nearly three months because of the virus \u2013 is a keenly watched event, at home and abroad. There were no questions on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">Uighurs</a> or re-education camps in Xinjiang, China\u2019s recent border clashes with India, its trade war with Australia or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition\">detention of a Huawei executive in Canada</a>, issues the government didn\u2019t want to air. Likewise, the queries on the economy, the origins of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">Covid-19 in Wuhan</a>, deteriorating relations with Washington, and the new Hong Kong security law were all softballs for Li, who is effectively Xi Jinping\u2019s deputy.&nbsp;</p> <p>But even if <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1783859.shtml\">the questions </a>from foreign and local reporters are cleared by the government beforehand, it is still the only moment in each calendar year in which a top leader appears at length in public and has to state the government\u2019s case. The focus on the economy, then, was telling. For a ruling party that has built legitimacy on near continuous high-speed growth since the late 1970s, the current downturn is a bracing moment. Tens and perhaps hundreds of millions have lost jobs. Those still in employment have had incomes sharply reduced, cutting into consumption. With the US, Europe and Japan in deep recessions, exports cannot take up the slack.</p> <p>To be sure, Beijing has not let its regional and global ambitions lie fallow during Covid-19 and its aftermath, with navy patrols in the South China Sea and the airforce sorties around Taiwan both continuing. And in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a>, the most volatile issue on China\u2019s plate, the city\u2019s democrats have been placed firmly in the party\u2019s sights.</p> <p>With the passage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">a new national security law</a> by the NPC last week, China is making a big bet that it can stamp out its political opponents in the former British colony without killing off its vital role as a financial centre. The bill\u2019s vaguely worded offences, outlawing subversion, secessionist sentiment and foreign interference, will be interpreted widely, as they are in China itself, to round up any critics Beijing wants to target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75/752_36_2248_2810/800.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in shopping mall\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in a shopping mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">The UK\u2019s suggestion</a> that it would offer a path to citizenship for Hong Kong holders of British national (overseas) passports wanting to leave the territory prompted a sardonic thumbs-up in Beijing. \u201cThe potential UK move has won overwhelming support from Chinese internet users,\u201d said the <em>Global Times</em>, the party\u2019s tabloid attack dog. \u201c[They] said all traitors should be sent to the UK as they are unwanted on Chinese territory.\u201d</p> <p>But no one in Hong Kong thinks the fight will be over quickly, especially as Beijing\u2019s plan for its takeover of the territory\u2019s political system, and opposition to it, is so comprehensive.</p> <p>\u201cThey will send down cadres from the Chinese Communist party to supervise the government, the executive, the legislature, and more importantly, the judiciary. This is only the beginning, I tell you,\u201d Martin Lee, the barrister and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/i-wont-allow-this-to-be-the-end-of-hong-kong-campaigner-on-his-long-fight-for-democracy\">veteran democrat leader</a> said on Friday.</p> <p>In his press conference, Li offered only platitudes on the US relationship but said enough to confirm that bilateral ties between the two superpowers, one rising, the other in relative decline, will not get better soon. There is no off ramp for the US and China for the moment, as it is clear that neither country is looking for one. Washington feels it is playing catch up in muscling up to Beijing, a debate that will only be sharpened in a presidential election year. And China under Xi is programmed not to take a backward step.</p> <p>It is possible that the weakness in both countries\u2019 economies could temper their hardline positions this year, because neither wants to hurt growth any more than it has been already by Covid-19. Equally, Donald Trump might slap new sanctions on China at any time in a heated election campaign, to reinforce his narrative that he has been uniquely tough on China and that Joe Biden, his expected Democratic challenger, by comparison, will be weak. Beijing has made sure to retaliate against any economic sanctions imposed by Trump so far. It is an open question as to whether their calculation will change in an election year.</p> <p>One standout from Li\u2019s appearance before the media was his focus on the importance of the private sector to China\u2019s economic recovery. Xi\u2019s support for the state sector, and his lip service to the private economy, which drives Chinese growth and employment, has alienated many of the country\u2019s entrepreneurs. A number of wealthy business leaders who crossed Xi have been jailed. But Li, who has been overshadowed in office by Xi, took a different line, though whether support for the private sector can be sustained in a grim political climate, however, remains to be seen. Xi will not tolerate any rivals, especially in the form of rich entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard McGregor is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and is the author of numerous books on Chinese politics and foreign policy</p>",
  "<p>Years of marine conservation efforts throughout the Mediterranean are beginning to pay dividends in Tunisia, with activists expecting a further increase in the number of sea turtles visiting the country\u2019s beaches to build their nests this year.</p> <p>It\u2019s an unlikely, albeit fragile, victory. Many of the factors that pushed sea turtles on to the world\u2019s endangered list are still present and continue to threaten the survival of the species. However, activists monitoring sea-turtle nests on Kuriat Island, a vital nesting ground, have reported an increase in nests from 11, when they first started monitoring in 1997, to more than 40 annually.</p> <p>\u201cSea turtles are what we call a keystone species,\u201d says Jamel Jrijer, a marine project manager at the WWF\u2019s offices in Tunis. \u201cThat\u2019s to say, they play a critical role in making the marine environment what it is.\u201d</p> <p>Of the three species of sea turtle \u2013 green, leatherback and loggerhead \u2013 that are encountered in Tunisian waters, it is only the loggerhead that nests here.

Other problems can arise, he explains, for example with the hatchlings at Chebba, whose instinct to navigate to the sea by the moon is subverted by the cafes and roadside lights, which draw the baby turtles towards the lethal streets.</p> <p>Loggerhead turtles return to Tunisia\u2019s beaches sporadically, sometimes leaving two to three years between visits. Once on the beach, the female turtle will build three or four nests, into each of which \u2013 if left undisturbed \u2013 she will lay 80 to 120 eggs. However, despite their numbers, the odds of the young turtle\u2019s survival are already slim. Small, vulnerable and with shells barely formed, only a tiny fraction of those born on the sands of Tunisia will ever reach sexual maturity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e46807b1139a2a2969131e5341e25369d86c6cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e46807b1139a2a2969131e5341e25369d86c6cd/0_0_5010_3183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A turtle nest cordoned off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A turtle nest is cordoned off during hatching season as holidaymakers visit the beach on Kuriat Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Akim Rezgui/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the resurgence in Tunisia\u2019s nesting grounds is a success story, it is a qualified one.

However, the increasing numbers of turtles being taken to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CarettaCaretta2019/\">Sea Turtle Rescue Centre</a> by fishermen and the general public gives some cause for hope.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>50% of the turtles we see have plastic within their system</p> <footer> <cite>Olfa Chaieb</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMost of the turtles we see have been injured through contact with fishing gear,\u201d chief biologist Olfa Chaieb says. \u201cThe trawlers [which rake the sea floor] do particular damage, destroying the posidonia seagrass, which is an important source of food for sea turtles, as well as providing a habitat for other forms of marine life. Because of the turtle\u2019s dependence on air, they can drown once they become entangled in nets underwater.\u201d </p> <p>Further cause for concern is discarded plastic; sea turtles often mistake floating plastic bags for jellyfish, a staple of the their diet. \u201cAbout 50% of the turtles we see have plastic within their system.

In Afghanistan, conflict has raged on and off since the Soviet invasion in 1979. America\u2019s Afghan war is now its longest ever, part of the open-ended US \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d launched after the 2001 al-Qaida attacks.<br><br>Yemen\u2019s conflict is in its sixth pitiless year. In Israel-Palestine, war \u2013 or rather the absence of peace \u2013 has characterised life since 1948. Somalis have endured 40 years of fighting. These are but a few examples in a world where the idea of war without end seems to have become accepted, even normalised.</p> <p>Why do present-day politicians, generals, governments and international organisations appear incapable or uninterested in making peace? In the 19th and 20th centuries, broadly speaking, wars commenced and concluded with formal ultimatums, declarations, agreed protocols, truces, armistices and treaties.</p> <p>Neat and tidy endings, even if sometimes illusory, are rarer these days. According to a survey <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/press/2020/acs-2020\">published last week</a> by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 60% of armed conflicts have been active for at least a decade and peace-making prospects globally are in decline.</p> <p>Today\u2019s wars are mostly undeclared, undefined and inglorious affairs typically involving multiple parties, foreign governments, proxy forces, covert methods and novel weapons. They are conducted without regard for civilian lives, the <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions\">Geneva conventions</a> regulating armed conflict, or the interests of host populations in whose name they are fought.</p> <p>Great moral crusades, famous causes and genuine ideological struggles are few and far between. Modern wars are mostly about power and treasure. And they go on, and on, and on.</p> <p>Libya is a classic case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/from-idlib-to-tripoli-turkeys-grab-for-influence-in-libya\">a state of chaos</a> deliberately fed and manipulated by external powers, in this instance Turkey, Qatar, Russia, Egypt and the UAE. Here, as elsewhere, rival rulers claim to be upholding order or fighting \u201cterrorism\u201d while, in reality, they seek to extend national influence and economic advantage. As long as these aims remain unmet, they show scant interest in peace.</p> <p>Ambitious states have always sought to dominate neighbours in the way China, for example, is doing now. One reason this happens more frequently today, and more anarchically, is declining American engagement.</p> <p>In the Middle East and Africa, the US \u2013 no longer a global policeman \u2013 is focused on supporting Israel, squeezing Iran and selling arms, to the exclusion of almost all else. In Asia, it is in retreat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\" data-alt=\"countries with perpetual conflicts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\">countries with perpetual conflicts</a> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump, desperate for a Nobel peace prize, offered to mediate the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/12/trump-and-kim-document-analysis-singapore-agreement-denuclearisation\"> 70-year-old North Korea-South Korea stand-off</a>.

Few take him seriously. Otherwise, his administration has shown zero interest in global conflict resolution.</p> <p>A related factor is the collapse of the western-led consensus favouring multilateral, collaborative approaches to international problems. This is matched by the parallel rise of authoritarian and populist regimes that prioritise narrow national interest over perceptions of the common good.</p> <p>This trend, a regression to the pre-1914 era of competing European nation-states, undermines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-observer-view-on-the-failure-to-secure-a-global-ceasefire-during-the-pandemic\">the authority of the UN</a> and cooperative regional platforms such as the EU and African Union. Unsupported, UN peace envoys from Syria to Myanmar and peacekeeping operations across Africa struggle to make headway.</p> <p>Ineffective international law enforcement, symbolised by the inability of the International Criminal Court to deliver justice to war zones such as Iraq and Ukraine, helps freeze or perpetuate conflicts rather than justly resolve them. Demographic and physical causes also contribute to chronic instability.</p> <p>Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Sahel and Sudan is fuelled by the fact that millions of young men in Africa, where the <a href=\"https://mo.ibrahim.foundation/news/2019/africas-first-challenge-youth-bulge-stuck-waithood\">median age is 19.8</a>, lack fulfilling work or a meaningful stake in their country\u2019s future. Long-running inter-state or intra-state violence is also rooted in the climate crisis and resulting resource scarcity, poverty and dislocation.</p> <p>New technologies and weapons such as drones and cyber warfare are lowering the up-front cost of conflict while enlarging potential theatres of war. Global warming is turning the newly accessible Arctic into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/trump-greenland-gambit-sad-sign-arctic-up-for-grabs\">a vast, pristine battleground</a>. Outer space presents infinite possibilities for violence.<br><br>Religious wars are often the most bitterly fought and hardest to halt. As in the past, multiple collisions of faith, culture and values between Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and other belief systems are key elements in the early 21st century\u2019s insatiable addiction to war.</p> <p>The Muslim world is also divided internally, between the Shia and Sunni traditions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/islamic-state-is-back-and-this-time-the-west-is-ill-prepared-to-take-it-on\">fundamentalist</a> and secular interpretations of Islam. These schisms have been depicted by the Arabic noun <em>fitna</em>, which can mean both \u201ccharm, enchantment, captivation\u201d and \u201crebellion, riot, discord, civil strife\u201d.<br><br>Fitna is a fitting word for describing not only the Islamic sphere but the troubled state of the world as a whole in 2020, beset as it is by wars without end. For many people, if they are honest, war has a fatal attraction.

Since then upwards of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War\"> half a million people </a>are estimated to have died. </p> <p>The US and Europe also sought to install a friendly, pro-western government in Damascus. As Assad\u2019s grip on power weakened, Russia, supported by Iran, intervened in 2015 to stave off collapse and thwart western ambitions. Other interventions came from Turkey and from Islamic State jihadists, who declared a caliphate in Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>The war continues in the north-western province of Idlib, the last rebel-held stronghold, to which millions have fled. A current ceasefire is not expected to last. There are also fears that up to 100,000 people could die there if Covid-19 spreads in crowded refugee camps.

He uses the platform to threaten war, hire and fire staff, goad perceived foes and stoke partisan divisions. Twitter, which did not exist 15 years ago, has become one of the most famous companies in the world, the new first draft of presidential history.</p> <p>But now the relationship is on the rocks.</p> <p>For the first time, Twitter this week added a factchecking tag to two of Trump\u2019s tweets when he made unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting. The president struck back on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">with an executive order</a> threatening social media companies with new free speech regulations.</p> <p>Asked if he had considered deleting his account, Trump replied: \u201cIf we had a fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account.\u201d</p> <p>A day later, in another first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter hid a tweet</a> by Trump behind a warning accusing him of breaking its rules by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d in a message that said looters at protests in Minneapolis would be shot. The president lashed out again in \u2013 naturally \u2013 a tweet, complaining: \u201cTwitter is doing nothing about all of the lies and propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives &amp; the President of the United States.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"47a4965b02afa7b597e7ebadaa09d942a42ab76a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47a4965b02afa7b597e7ebadaa09d942a42ab76a/1674_0_2230_2788/800.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Mori/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Facebook did not remove Trump\u2019s same post from its site, with its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111961824369871\">putting clear daylight</a> between his approach, which exempts politicians from a third-party factchecking program, and that of his Twitter counterpart, Jack Dorsey. As for Trump, whose election owed much to social media, he now appears to be biting the hand that feeds him.</p> <p>\u201cI think the last thing Trump wants is to shut down Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Moonalice?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Roger McNamee,</a> author of Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. \u201cHe\u2019s completely dependent on them and, by the way, they on him. The symbiosis is complete.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I think what Twitter did relative to the looters and shooters tweet is actually very brave. It\u2019s also incredibly obvious and something they should\u2019ve done years ago, and something Facebook should do, because if you look at the public safety aspect of the terms of service, that tweet is an obvious violation and, coming from the president, it has enormous risk of causing public safety harm.\u201d</p> <p>McNamee, a co-founder of the private equity firm <a href=\"https://elevation.com/\">Elevation Partners</a> and an early investor in Facebook, Google and Amazon, added: \u201cThe fact that Facebook left it up speaks volumes about the different approaches of the two companies because how big do you think Twitter is without Trump? Is it half its current size? Is it less than that? This is a very brave thing for them to do.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of Twitter offers <a href=\"https://www.thefortyfifth.us/\">a real-time window on his consciousness</a> at all hours of day and night. Some of his posts are vivid reactions to items he has seen on the Fox News network. Others hurl insults at political foes and the media or traffic in incendiary racism. In the past month they have reached a crescendo of abuse, demagoguery and conspiracy theories, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">a baseless accusation of murder</a> levelled at a TV host.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SykesCharlie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Charlie Sykes,</a> a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cHis Twitter account has been central to his presidency and he\u2019s obviously obsessed with it. That\u2019s what makes this so strange: if he were to shut down Twitter, he obviously would deprive himself of a platform. If he succeeds in having the law changed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html\">it would backfire on him</a> because it would then make the social media platforms liable for his lies and his slanders.\u201d</p> <p>Like a much-hyped executive order in April that threatened to ban immigration, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\">turned out to have numerous exceptions,</a> the bark of Thursday\u2019s executive order is likely to be worse than its bite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It attacks legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for users\u2019 content, but a change in the law would require an act of Congress. Observers detected a blatant attempt to deflect attention from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which this week claimed its 100,000th life in America, and an outbreak of violence after the police killing of a black man in Minneapolis.</p> <p>Sykes, THE founder and editor-at-large of <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/\">the Bulwark website,</a> added: \u201cTo be attacking a private company because it factchecked him is a disturbing look, even for Trump. The willingness to use the full weight of federal government to go in and punish a private company for factchecking one of his tweets.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter did not censor his tweet. It answered his tweet with a factcheck. In other words, it answered speech with more speech, which is the way the first amendment is supposed to work.\u201d</p> <p>Trump expressed anger last year after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\">Facebook banned seven users</a> including the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, rightwing media stars Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, notorious for using antisemitic language. He and fellow conservatives have long claimed without evidence that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them.</p> <p>Twitter first announced in early 2018 that it would not block world leaders or remove their controversial tweets, though it subsequently announced that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. Despite this week\u2019s skirmishes, the prospect of the US president being banned still seems remote.</p> <p>Sykes commented: \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Banning Trump allows him to play the victim card and say, \u2018Look, I am the president and they won\u2019t let me speak\u2019. So it makes him a martyr. It\u2019s probably better to factcheck him. On the other hand, that\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. Are they going to factcheck every one of his tweets?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7/0_175_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDoes that mean they\u2019re going to be under tremendous pressure to factcheck everyone else? There\u2019s a danger for Twitter that he will drag them down the rabbit hole, that he will make their factchecking of him into another massive distraction issue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has put Twitter front and centre in public life but he is not its most followed personality. To his probable chagrin, THE No 1 spot is held by Obama with 118 million, <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/most-twitter-followers/\">according to Brandwatch,</a> ahead of singers Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, singer Lady Gaga and TV personality Ellen DeGeneres. Then comes Trump in ninth place.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickwtyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Rick Tyler,</a> a political analyst, said: \u201cHe [Trump] needs Twitter because it\u2019s his vehicle to communicate with millions of people who follow him. I\u2019m not sure Twitter needs him and, if it does need him, then it\u2019s a flawed business model because Trump one day won\u2019t be with us. He\u2019s an old man and so if Twitter\u2019s business model depends on Donald Trump, it\u2019s a very short-lived business model.\u201d</p> <p>The president\u2019s threat to terminate his love-hate relationship with social media rings somewhat hollow. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/profiles/michael-dantonio\">Biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio</a> describes him as \u201ca troll at heart\u201d who used the New York tabloids to similar effect before Twitter and Facebook came along. He said of the current feud: \u201cI think it\u2019s about Twitter being his drug and Jack Dorsey threatening to limit his supply.</p> <p>\u201cIt has the effect of a drug on him, so the pleasure that he gets from tweeting and from the response to his tweet probably gives him a rush and I think even the thought of it being constrained is painful, probably physically painful in his own body.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also him encountering someone who can hold him responsible and, as he makes clear, he\u2019s never responsible for anything, and that is enraging. It\u2019s like the kid who\u2019s been let loose in a candy store and suddenly an adult says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s all done now, it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t want to leave so he\u2019s having a tantrum.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>I still remember that first night walk in <a href=\"https://www.forestryengland.uk/kings-forest\">King\u2019s Forest</a> near my Suffolk home, two years ago. The clouds were smoking-room-thick, so there had been no visible sunset. The cold, white sky did not even blush. Instead, the light thickened and clotted as darkness began to form, seeping out from between stands of pines. It puffed from the shadows of my footsteps on the track and welled up from the deep ruts made by 4x4s.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure why I kept walking that night. Partly it was just the rhythm: the metronome swing of the legs, the freedom of having nowhere to be and no place to go. But also, I\u2019d been rallied by my 10-year-old son who, in his campaign for an ever-later bedtime, argued that an average human spends 26 years of their time on Earth asleep. His words had wormed their way into my brain. When was the last time I had been out at night? Not camping or running or toddling home from the pub, but <em>really</em> out into the dark. Was my life being only half-lived?</p> <p>And so I went into the wood. Night had always seemed a dark and gloomy place, a solid, black bookend to day. But there among the trees, as the retinal cones clicked off and the rods kicked in, I could see that night was not just one long stretch of unforgiving darkness, any more than daytime is a constant bright blue sky. No, night is full of its own subtle shades of light, capable of illuminating the landscape and inspiring in us a sense of connection and wonder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29d2f595f8aa75fff13c7277ac88e26805632016\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29d2f595f8aa75fff13c7277ac88e26805632016/0_44_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abbeygate in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk at dusk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abbey Gate in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David J Green/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the next year, I walked and walked at night. Over a number of months that spanned the seasons, I travelled across Britain in an attempt to explore the shades, subtleties and lights of the nocturnal hours. I paced the full-moon-lit coasts of Suffolk and swam in its light. I strolled through London as it tossed and turned to sleep, and I patrolled empty, suburban streets in Bury St Edmunds \u2013 even sharing a memorable cup of tea with an owl on a town centre roundabout. I went north to Scotland, a country where, in lowland woodlands, mountainous regions, cruelly cleared Highlands and on wild coasts, the dark lives.</p> <p><a href=\"https://forestryandland.gov.scot/visit/forest-parks/galloway-forest-park/dark-skies\">Galloway Forest</a> is one of the UK\u2019s handful of <a href=\"https://www.darksky.org/our-work/conservation/idsp/parks/\">International Dark Sky Parks</a>, a place where the stars still gather in large numbers and the night sky is protected for its scientific, natural, educational and cultural value. Here I learned to unpick the dot-to-dot riddle of constellations. And here I looked through a telescope into another galaxy \u2013 Andromeda \u2013 and was left reeling by both its fuzzy, spider\u2019s egg beauty and the idea that the light I was seeing had travelled for millions of years to reach me: light much older than the first tool-wielding humans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I yearn to be on Coll, an island free of streetlights, to see the Milky Way cracking across a star-filled sky</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since Covid-19 became an unwelcome satellite to our lives, I\u2019ve been thinking about these journeys a great deal. Part of it is, of course, simply an itch to travel again. I want to return to these landscapes. After weeks of shut-in, I yearn to be on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/dec/29/joanne-oconnor-isle-of-coll-london-norway\">Isle of Coll</a> (which is free of streetlights) to see the Milky Way cracking across a star-filled sky that stretches from horizon to horizon. I want to be back on the west coast of Scotland, watching meteors over Ailsa Craig, the stars dropping like gannets; or to fall asleep in the haunting shadow of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/05/never-hugged-moss-covered-boulder-time-you-did\">Wistman\u2019s Wood</a>, waking to find Dartmoor transformed \u2013 the definition of day gone and a detailed landscape rewound to a simple but exquisite pencil sketch.</p> <p>But there is something else.

Even after the eyes have adjusted, big landscapes \u2013 the miles of moor, tor and bog \u2013 are reduced to contrasts, to smells or the occasional heart-quickening fidget in the undergrowth. Yet look up and the bubble pops. The stars rush in, bringing with them a connection to the seasons, but also an almost impossible, self-shrinking sense of the universe\u2019s scale. A dizzying \u201cYou are here\u201d, an affirmation of being alive. Perhaps that is why the night skies have been so important during the lockdown: they help the largeness, the weirdness of that giant word \u201cpandemic\u201d become so much smaller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29b9a89aee6f700458602e1fee5d4a8f3fcd98be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b9a89aee6f700458602e1fee5d4a8f3fcd98be/0_0_5522_3655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Bridge across the Thames in London, festooned with lights and the moon shining through the night sky behind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Bridge across the Thames in London, festooned with lights and the moon shining through the night sky behind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Nieman/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As soon as it is safe and responsible to do so, I will start exploring the night again, seeking out the magic of darkness and experiencing the quiet joy of the land transforming into a place of subtlety and shades. But for now, I still take comfort in the night.

  "<p>The eurozone\u2019s 19 member countries are braced for a dramatic downturn. The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, warned last week that the bloc\u2019s collective GDP was likely to shrink by between 8% and 12% this year, having concluded that the ECB\u2019s \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d scenarios were the only ones worth considering.</p> <p>The economic consequences of coronavirus are dire already, with France and Italy in recession. France\u2019s GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2020, following a decline of 0.1% in the preceding three months. Italy saw its GDP fall by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, in the wake of a 0.3% decline in late 2019. As a whole, eurozone GDP decreased by 3.8% in the first three months of 2020 \u2013 the sharpest quarterly decline since records began in 1995.</p> <p>The betting is that Lagarde and the rest of the ECB board will use this week\u2019s meeting to expand its \u20ac750bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-asset-purchase-programme-boosts-euro\" title=\"\">Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme</a> (PEPP). For many ECB-watchers, this will show how important the PEPP has been during lockdown and offer proof, if that were needed, that states are struggling to revive their economies.</p> <p>The programme, which lets the ECB fund private companies and government budgets by purchasing corporate debt and sovereign bonds, will probably increase to \u20ac1 trillion and could eventually reach \u20ac1.5tn.</p> <p>Lagarde has repeated the mantra of her predecessor, Mario Draghi: the ECB will do whatever it takes to keep the eurozone economies afloat. This should reassure businesses and consumers that any financial wobbles, wherever they crop up inside the eurozone, will be confronted by the ECB\u2019s limitless supply of funds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lagarde needs to quickly address the court\u2019s concerns, or risk the programme grinding to a halt. But she will need backing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is increasing nervousness in Italy and Spain, where the ECB plays a crucial funding role, that a recent German constitutional court ruling could circumscribe the ECB\u2019s power. This month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\" title=\"\">Germany\u2019s federal constitutional court set aside a 2018 European court of justice (ECJ) ruling</a> and questioned the legality of ECB asset purchases. The German judges said the ECB had overstepped its mandate with the programme, which in turn prompted the ECJ to issue a polite reminder that it alone has the power to decide whether EU bodies are breaching the bloc\u2019s rules. It had ruled in 2018 that such a bond-buying programme was legal. And thus battle lines between Brussels and Berlin have been drawn.</p> <p>Speaking this month, an EU official said: \u201cThis raises a couple of fundamental issues \u2026 first is the authority of a judgment of the European court of justice which has definitely ruled on the validity of the decisions of the ECB. This goes to the very basis of the European Union. The European Union is based on law, on agreement, on the common rules we have.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde needs to quickly address the court\u2019s concerns, or risk the bailout programme grinding to a halt. But she will need backing. The political and economic threat of not resolving the row could be seismic, and the help of the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will be required. Merkel, the leader of the eurozone\u2019s most powerful economy, has said that a clash between Brussels and Germany can be avoided if, as per the German court ruling, the ECB illustrates the necessity of its bond-buying scheme.</p> <p>If the standoff is not resolved and the ECB\u2019s rescue programme is stymied, then the eurozone\u2019s recession will deepen and political and economic fault lines in the EU will widen. A lot is at stake at this week\u2019s meeting, and Lagarde needs the EU and Germany to square their differences.</p> <h2>Sunak must go further on furlough<br></h2> <p>The chancellor has clearly listened to demands that his main employment subsidy scheme should be scaled down gradually. A cliff-edge that loomed in August for the 8.4 million workers furloughed since April has become a gentler slope, although there are still huge risks ahead for Rishi Sunak, Britain\u2019s 32 million workers and the economy\u2019s prospects of emerging from the crisis relatively unscathed.</p> <p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme currently pays 80% of a worker\u2019s salary up to a cap of \u00a32,500 a month. Until last week, the chancellor was going to change the terms so that employers received only 60% of a worker\u2019s wages from 1 August. This would have been a huge cost to tens of thousands of shuttered businesses. Sunak has noted this. From August, employers will only need to find the money for employers\u2019 national insurance and pension payments for furloughed staff.</p> <p>Then comes the slope: from 1 September the government will pay 70% of wages. During October it will be 60%. Self-employed workers will receive a matching grant worth 70% of their average monthly trading profits to cover three months from August.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there is a missing element from Sunak\u2019s plans. There are industries that will receive very little or no income from paying customers from now until October and beyond. What is the chancellor going to do to rescue Britain\u2019s mighty tourism industry, its leisure centres, gyms, hotels, bars and nightclubs? Physical distancing will limit their recovery until, or if, a vaccine arrives.</p> <p>They should be candidates for further support after October. It would be tragic if the UK reduced subsidies before businesses can stand unaided, triggering a jump in bankruptcies and unemployment that would undermine the good work of recent months.</p> <h2>Rolls-Royce\u2019s plight signals importance of state support</h2> <p>Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s piled on the pain for the manufacturer last week, marking down its debt \u2013 after 20 years at investment grade \u2013 to junk status.</p> <p>While its defence business \u2013 making parts for fighter jet and nuclear submarine engines \u2013 is largely unaffected, the group\u2019s civil aerospace operation has stuttered alongside the grounded airlines to which it sells engines and servicing contracts. The planned cutting of 9,000 jobs, the bulk of them at UK sites including its Derby base, are a major blow to British engineering.</p> <p>The rating downgrade could have material implications. Many institutional investors are, understandably, banned from buying junk bonds, so S&amp;P\u2019s move could make it more costly for Rolls-Royce to borrow if costs continue to mount.</p> <p>It is also striking that the downgrade came after swingeing cost cuts and Rolls-Royce\u2019s professed willingness to ask for government support. The company, one of the few true global players left in UK manufacturing and a key part of UK defence plans, will be helped if needed; the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has signalled that he would back support. Rolls-Royce\u2019s stock of goodwill with government has also been aided by its involvement in Ventilator Challenge UK, the effort to build machines to treat Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>The financial crisis a decade ago showed that ratings agencies are often more weather vane than fortune teller, but when it comes to crunch time for companies, their views are still important. The junking of Rolls-Royce\u2019s rating shows that investors may not be reliable providers of help for the struggling aerospace sector.</p> <p>S&amp;P warned that Rolls-Royce could be exposed to further losses as the pandemic drags on. If things are this bad for Rolls-Royce, smaller companies, whose size does not warrant a rating agency\u2019s attentions, will be under much greater pressure.</p>",

By the time <em>Nanette</em> aired on Netflix in 2018, Gadsby, now 42, had been performing standup for more than a decade, as well as acting and writing, but her blistering honesty, and refusal to let audiences off the hook, hit a universal nerve. <em>Nanette</em> was hailed as a #MeToo-era comedy game-changer, garnering awards including the (shared) best comedy prize at the 2017 Edinburgh fringe, introducing Gadsby to America and a wider international audience, and winning fans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">Roxan</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">e Gay</a>, Monica Lewinsky and Emma Thompson.</p> <p>\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think that <em>Nanette</em> would be successful. It was the one thing my trolls and I have in common,\u201d says Gadsby wryly, when she speaks to me over the phone from her Australian home. Gadsby \u201cquit comedy\u201d onstage as part of the <em>Nanette</em> set, but clearly this wasn\u2019t meant literally? \u201cYeah, <em>Nanette</em> was not the end it claimed to be. It was a point of exasperation,\u201d she says. \u201cI was expecting <em>Nanette</em> to put me in a position where I would have to scale back what I did with my comedy. I thought it would alienate my audience. And that was the surprise of <em>Nanette</em> \u2013 what I thought would push me into a corner did the opposite\u2026 I thought, I don\u2019t have to jump, I can do what I want.\u201d</p> <p>Our phone call suffers from occasional time lags, which sometimes means I ask Gadsby a new question while she\u2019s still answering the previous one. Gadsby is good-humoured about this, and friendly and engaged. In conversation, she\u2019s still recognisable from her quick-witted stage persona, just with the voltage turned down. Was it a pressure to come back with <em>Douglas</em> after <em>Nanette</em>\u2019s huge success? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel desperate to overcome that because that\u2019s an impossible fight. I just set up camp in the shadow of <em>Nanette</em>.\u201d Later, she says dryly: \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the inevitable fall. What I figure is that \u2013 what goes up must come down. I want to be able to negotiate that as gracefully as possible.\u201d One thing that struck Gadsby was that the level of attention she got for <em>Nanette</em> could be \u201caddictive\u201d. \u201cAnd the only way you get that level of attention is you do something that has an impact. I managed to do that once but I don\u2019t expect that every time. Unless I try to stay shocking and that\u2019s not what I want to do. I made a choice \u2013 that not everything I do will make that kind of impact \u2013 and that\u2019s good.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziIwxPCeByU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ziIwxPCeByU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziIwxPCeByU\">Watch a trailer for Gadby\u2019s new show, Douglas.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The main focus of <em>Douglas</em> is Gadsby\u2019s high-functioning autism. Other themes range from chauvinism and male ownership of culture (the show is named after one of Gadsby\u2019s dogs, but also refers to the \u201cpouch of Douglas\u201d, a part of the female anatomy, named by a male scientist), America (\u201cMaking fun of Americans is still technically punching up, but that window is closing\u201d), anti-vaxxers, her now-signature art history musings (Gadsby has a degree in art history and curatorship), all the way through to golf, dog parks, Taylor Swift and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>.</p> <p><em>Douglas</em> is markedly more playful than <em>Nanette</em>: \u201cI did all the heavy lifting with <em>Nanette</em>, so I thought it would defeat the purpose \u2013 you know, dwelling,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cIt felt like a time to be more playful, show a breadth of form. I wanted to show that there\u2019s life after trauma, and more than one way to skin a cat.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Douglas</em>, she describes getting her autism diagnosis as a \u201crelief\u201d. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI was working things out for myself on a false premise. And it made me see things a lot clearer. Why I got things wrong. Why I felt like an alien dropped in from outer space. It\u2019s just good to know that I am an alien.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s very helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby says she could have dealt with autism in a traumatic way in <em>Douglas</em>. \u201cThere are stories I could tell that are heartbreaking, and very painful to me, and I could have shared those. I chose not to do that. That\u2019s not to say I was scared of doing it. I just didn\u2019t want that to be underpinning it. Too often, I think autism is expected to be a freak show. I wanted to create points of accessibility. There will be a point when I can flesh out the ways in which it is a difficult existence, but I didn\u2019t think this was the time.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby was diagnosed with autism before <em>Nanette</em> but decided against featuring it in that show. \u201cIt would just have become a way to dismiss what I was saying.\u201d Gadsby also needed time to process her diagnosis, not least because the public perception of autism remains a minefield of stigma and generalisations. \u201cI think there\u2019s just such a narrow definition of what autism is,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople want to compartmentalise difference, but it\u2019s not that easy. It\u2019s called a spectrum for a reason.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b7dcbb82388750c9ca5a01042639509344e6db2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7dcbb82388750c9ca5a01042639509344e6db2/0_722_4961_6197/801.jpg\" alt=\"Gadsby: \u2018I love learning and stories but I\u2019m not great at reading.

I never graduated from picture books.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gadsby grew up as the youngest of five children in Tasmania, where homosexuality was illegal until 1997 (in <em>Nanette</em>, she spoke about how this led to her internalising homophobia). As a small child, she felt isolated, which she now realises was due to her autism. \u201cYou know when you have a radio and it\u2019s two or three notches out of being on the right station? But there was a lot of consistency in my childhood. We lived in a fairly sheltered world, which is a good thing for someone with autism. If I\u2019d been bought up in a rich family who were able to take me to Disneyland, then <em>that</em> would have been traumatic.\u201d She laughs. \u201cEven as an adult, Disneyland is hell. It\u2019s what migraines are made of.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby suffered a breakdown in her late teenage years, and was homeless for a while, moving from job to job, working in bookshops, as a projectionist at an outdoor cinema, planting trees, picking vegetables. Eventually, she managed to apply to university, and enjoyed studying for her degree: \u201cI love learning and I love stories but I\u2019m not great at reading. Art history made the world accessible to me. Basically, I never graduated from picture books.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby found her voice in comedy, though, as much as <em>Nanette</em> was praised, it was also widely criticised, which she deals with in <em>Douglas</em>. Some claimed it \u201cwasn\u2019t standup comedy\u201d; it was performance art, a lecture, a one-woman show, group therapy, or \u201cjust wasn\u2019t funny\u201d. Some men seemed personally affronted. \u201cWell, yeah, you know people who call other people snowflakes are projecting,\u201d says Gadsby. She says in <em>Douglas</em>: \u201cYour hate is my vaccine.\u201d Does that indicate she\u2019s fairly immune to the trolling? \u201cYeah, it\u2019s the micro-dosing thing,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cEvery time one of these blokes comes in and says something that they believe is devastating, what confounds me is that they think they\u2019re original. That it\u2019s going to be the first time I\u2019ve heard this. You know? I\u2019ve lived a life. I\u2019ve heard it all before.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Gadsby expected to be attacked: \u201cYou don\u2019t do a show like <em>Nanette</em> without a tough shell. I\u2019m fairly robust when it comes to stuff like that.\u201d If anything, she was complimented: \u201cI\u2019m a student of art history. It seems like part and parcel of any shift in form necessarily comes with a resistance. It\u2019s kind of cool to be part of that in comedy. I expect other people to take what I\u2019ve done and bend it out of shape and create something new. And for me that\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p><em>Nanette</em> could be viewed as key to Gadsby\u2019s personal and professional evolution in that she dumped self-deprecation from her set, saying on stage: \u201cDo you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it\u2019s humiliation.\u201d However, Gadsby doesn\u2019t think that <em>Nanette</em> was \u201cfearless\u201d, pointing out how she briefly refers on stage to being abused as a child, and raped as a young woman, but doesn\u2019t take it further. \u201cAs brave as <em>Nanette</em> was, it wasn\u2019t that brave,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, this person I knew raped me. I couldn\u2019t say that. So I wasn\u2019t completely fearless. I made a decision. I chose a trauma that features a stranger performing violence on me. That makes it safe. I don\u2019t know how to wrangle the story on stage where I say someone betrayed me on a profound level. I don\u2019t think I did the bravest thing I possibly could have.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I live in my head. So, when I'm at home, I'm just throwing thought-orgies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gadsby wasn\u2019t ready to discuss these subjects on stage, which obviously is fine. \u201cWhen it comes to those things, I have to also look after my own trauma,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be in control of the trauma around that before it becomes public property, I believe. And I\u2019m glad I did, because the level of attention I got with <em>Nanette</em> was truly frightening. It felt unsafe.\u201d Gadsby has made references to \u201ctrauma-porn\u201d before. I wonder if that\u2019s a danger for any performer \u2013 audiences demanding more and more, darker and darker? \u201cI think it\u2019s because people want a big narrative around things to understand it. If they don\u2019t understand it, then it didn\u2019t happen. And the danger of that is there\u2019s no straight line through trauma.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby prefers to keep her personal life private (\u201cWith things like relationships, I\u2019m not just talking for myself any more\u201d). A couple of years ago, Gadsby was rumoured to be dating Jill Soloway, the US showrunner, director and writer, responsible for the Emmy-winning <em>Transparent</em>, who identifies as non-binary and non-gender-conforming, though by 2019, Gadsby said they weren\u2019t together.&nbsp;Gadsby tells me that, before the autism diagnosis, she couldn\u2019t maintain relationships. \u201cI was just terrible at relationships but I didn\u2019t know why until I was diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s made me better able to trust my own boundaries. Before I was diagnosed, I had to trust other people with personal instruction. Because I didn\u2019t understand it. Relating to someone emotionally is not something I\u2019m great at. So I would trust them and it became difficult because you can\u2019t always trust other people to take care of your boundaries.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby is at pains not to overemphasise the positives about autism. \u201cI still have to negotiate the world, and the world has been built to prioritise neurotypical people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still there. I\u2019ll never not have autism. What it\u2019s meant is when I close the door, and I\u2019m on my own, it\u2019s a better place.\u201d Right now, during lockdown, she\u2019s relaxing at home, mainly by gardening, or playing with her dogs. \u201cI don\u2019t sit and think. I do and think. I\u2019m always rearranging things. Or building things. I do a bit of woodwork. I garden. I\u2019m very active.\u201d Is she able to switch off fairly easily? \u201cI live in my head. So, when I\u2019m at home, I\u2019m just throwing thought-orgies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf584cc1ab4297de7529c4d52379746c523f5d2/1_0_1335_801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gadsby on stage with her previous show, Nanette, which brought global attention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gadsby on stage with her previous show, Nanette, which brought global attention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben King/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gadsby remains concerned that too many talented women in comedy don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve. And, while she\u2019s glad that #MeToo saw the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/harvey-weinstein\">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bill-cosby\">Bill Cosby</a> convicted, she doesn\u2019t feel that\u2019s the end of it: \u201cWhat needs to change is the toxic culture that enables that behaviour. These men could not have done those things without the power structures and the yes-men and the silent people around them. These are kind of cultish scenarios where good people turn a blind eye, and almost convince themselves that they didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s a cultural thing.\u201d</p> <p>Gadsby refers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/07/sincerely-louis-ck-review-standup-comedy-me-too\">Louis CK</a> in <em>Douglas</em> (\u201cHe is like the anti-vaxx of comedy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d) . After finally admitting to repeated grave sexual misconduct, Louis CK was further criticised for attempting a comeback. \u201cHe\u2019s just digging his own grave,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cHis whole career was built on how he liked to talk about really dangerous things. And that was what was interesting about it. That took an enormous amount of skill. And with that, the audience had to trust him. Nobody trusts him any more.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re almost out of time. While live comedy is as affected by the coronavirus pandemic as everything else. Gadsby now has <em>Douglas</em> and <em>Nanette</em> out, and her memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Steps-Nanette-Hannah-Gadsby/dp/1911630237/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KWUETO6WLGRO&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=ten+steps+to+nanette&amp;qid=1590073740&amp;sprefix=ten+steps+to+%2Caps%2C138&amp;sr=8-1\">Ten Steps to Nanette</a></em>, is to be published next year. She tells me that, creatively, she\u2019s still driven, she still wants to take risks, she\u2019s still drawn to subjects because she wants to understand them: \u201cGenerally my thoughts are occupied with things that grab my curiosity. And that\u2019s a real privilege of success. <em>Nanette</em> changed my life,\u201d says Gadsby. \u201cIf anyone knows me, more likely than not, it\u2019s because of <em>Nanette</em>. I had a fairly small sphere of influence before <em>Nanette</em>, and now I have a large one. That has to be acknowledged. You have to acknowledge that that\u2019s how people define you. You also have to let those people accept how you define yourself.\u201d</p> <p><em>Douglas is out now on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81054700\">Netflix</a></em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to correct the publication date of Hannah Gadsby\u2019s memoir</p></li> </ul>",
