  "<p>Cognac makers are considering overturning longstanding tradition and turning to new grape varieties, as the main cultivar required to make the spirit struggles with the effects of global warming.</p> <p>Cognac\u2019s star grape, Ugni blanc, which accounts for 98% of the vines in the Cognac region, is ripening quicker and losing acidity as summers become hotter and drier.</p> <p>The rules that govern the French brandy are among the strictest in the drinks world, and are subject to controlled appellation of origin (AOC) specifications.</p> <p>Each stage of the spirit\u2019s production, including the types of grapes that can be used, is outlined in its AOC. Cognac can only be made in one 78,000-hectare area of France, using grapes grown in six regions, or crus. This means distillers cannot move production to another part of the country to escape rising temperatures. </p> <p>The spirit is, broadly, made from wine that is distilled into a liquid called eau-de-vie and aged in oak casks, often for decades. The result is cognac, with Hennessy, Martell, Courvoisier and R\u00e9my Martin among the best known brands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec51f1b262deeaef8007278c3d5cc5eb5ad12610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec51f1b262deeaef8007278c3d5cc5eb5ad12610/0_0_5248_3588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damaged vines in a vineyard after a storm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vines damaged and without leaves in a vineyard in Cognac following a violent storm in the region during 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These brands, and many more, are now working to find sustainable solutions to manage the effects of climate change. Extreme and unpredictable weather has blighted the region: in 2018, powerful hailstorms caused serious damage to 3,500 hectares of vineyards in the Cognac area. Hail and heavy rain also reduced the 2016 harvest, while 2017 was marred by frost.</p> <p>\u201cThere is more extreme weather in Cognac than there used to be,\u201d said Patrick Raguenaud, president of the BNIC, the governing body of Cognac. \u201cWe would sometimes have hail, but not this big.\u201d</p> <p>The changing climate has also thrown out the timings of production. \u201cThe grapes are ripening much sooner than they used to,\u201d said Baptiste Loiseau, cellar master at R\u00e9my Martin. \u201cWhat is key is the balance between sugar and acidity. In cognac we need a lot of acidity to maintain the conservation of the wine because we are not using sulphur.\u201d</p> <p>Winegrowers have shifted harvest dates forward, and Cognac\u2019s grapes are now removed from their vines in September rather than October. However, this raises concerns that other key flavour characteristics risk being lost. \u201cWhen we harvest early, we are able to have a correct level of acidity and \u2026 sugar,\u201d said Pierre Boyer, deputy cellar master and estate manager at Hine. \u201cBut the problem is we are going to have less aromatic components in the grapes.\u201d</p> <p>Cognac houses and their partner winegrowers are seeking longer-term solutions. According to Loiseau, while Ugni blanc has been the best grape variety for Cognac for more than a century, this may not be the case in the coming decades. \u201cWe have to prepare the future for the next generation, to allow them to take the right decisions depending on the conditions of weather,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A number of estates across the region, overseen by the BNIC, are testing grape varieties that are not currently permitted under the AOC to see if they prove more resilient to global warming and resistant to disease.</p> <p>R\u00e9my Martin is working with the Monbadon cultivar and, five years ago, planted vines in test sites. After two harvests, Loiseau notes that the grape\u2019s ripeness develops at a slower pace than the Ugni blanc vines, which have been planted in an adjacent plot.</p> <p>\u201cThe role of the trial is to have these two plots and see how they behave year after year, vintage after vintage,\u201d said Loiseau.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c889686a9f4c53243e8a712e520e20ed6566dbe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c889686a9f4c53243e8a712e520e20ed6566dbe7/43_56_3248_2423/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of grapes hanging from a vine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cognac makers are engineering completely new varieties of grapes that are more resistant to disease and extreme weather conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charbeau St\u00e9phane/BNIC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martell, meanwhile, has partnered with the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) to create new cultivars through natural breeding. \u201cWe have fantastic small new vines, which are quite promising,\u201d said Pierre Joncourt, vice-president of cognac at Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt. \u201cThey are definitely resistant to the disease so far, and they have slower growth.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, the BNIC is naturally engineering completely new varieties of grapes with the help of the INRA, using different plants to Martell. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to prepare as an industry to be resilient and we need to manage long-term actions \u2013 we need to experiment,\u201d said Joncourt. \u201cThen, we need to engage all the stakeholders, all the winegrowers \u2026 to \u2026 do something really consistent at a regional level.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson will seek to shore up public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Monday by holding the first of what are intended to be daily ministerial press conferences on the crisis.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, who had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/johnson-urged-to-launch-daily-coronavirus-press-briefings\">under growing pressure to start holding daily briefings</a> amid criticism of his response to Covid-19 and the media strategy used to explain it, will personally chair many of the daily briefings, which No 10 says will continue \u201cas long as necessary\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Monday afternoon he will also chair another Cobra meeting, where ministers will discuss measures that would dramatically escalate the steps being taken by the UK to tackle the virus.</p> \n<p>They are expected to discuss a planned ban on mass gatherings, proposals to ask whole households to stay at home when someone falls ill and the move, expected within weeks, to ask the over-70s to stay at home for up to four months. They are also due to discuss the modelling used by the government to determine its overall strategy, which is due to be published soon.</p> \n<p>The daily briefings, which are intended to focus on informing the public \u201con how to protect themselves\u201d, will also routinely feature Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser.</p> \n<p>Johnson, who for most of his time in office has shown little enthusiasm for exposing himself to media scrutiny, announced the plan after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said daily briefings were needed to ensure people got \u201cmuch clearer guidance\u201d on what the government was doing and why. All three Labour leadership candidates and Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had also demanded greater clarity.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Johnson is also due to hold a conference call with British manufacturers, who will be urged to switch production to start making the ventilators required by hospitals, and he will participate in a conference call with fellow G7 leaders in which he will be calling for global action to fight the disease and its economic impact.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Calls for a daily ministerial press conference intensified over the weekend, following at least three incidents of Whitehall giving out contradictory messages over coronavirus, with the uncertainty compounded by the fact that some key reporting was based on unattributable sources.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised\">UK coronavirus crisis 'to last until spring 2021 and could see 7.9m hospitalised'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Friday morning Vallance gave an interview defending the government\u2019s decision not to ban large sporting events \u2013 only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">would soon be implemented</a>.</p> \n<p>In his interview Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of herd immunity to coronavirus. But his comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus.

He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to \u201cstay self-isolated\u201d at home for four months, but his use of the term \u201cself-isolate\u201d was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether.</p> \n<p>Although Johnson\u2019s decision to front many of the daily press conferences himself will be seen as testimony to the seriousness with which he is approaching the crisis, former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, said it would be better for the chief medical officer to chair the daily government briefings.</p> \n<p>Burnham added that this was what happened when the government was handling swine flu during his time in office and that everything became \u201ca bit calmer\u201d when the official briefings were no longer entangled with politics.</p> \n<p>Although a poll at the weekend suggests 53% of voters trust the government to deal with the pandemic, ministers have come under pressure to explain why the UK is not matching some of the tougher measures being taken in other European countries, where bars, restaurants and non-essential shops have been closed, as well as schools.</p> \n<p>In an interview on Sunday, Hancock rejected the claim that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are similar to many countries,\u201d he claimed. \u201cFor instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time. We are prepared to take, if we need to, all the sorts of measures [discussed], but we will do it based on the science.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Monday the Department for Work and Pensions will also be announcing that face-to-face assessments for people claiming sickness and disability benefits will be suspended for three months.

  "<p>The public health response to a serious epidemic is laid out simply and clearly by the World Health Organization (WHO). Test intensively, trace contacts, quarantine and maintain social distancing. When Covid-19 got out of control in Wuhan, after three weeks of public health inaction, the Chinese authorities mounted a proper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/more-surveillance-tighter-controls-chinas-coronavirus-crackdown\" title=\"\">campaign to control the virus</a>. They listened to the WHO. They tested extensively, setting up mobile testing centres, and getting the test result time down from four days to four hours. They cut the time from onset of symptoms to lab result from 12 to three days. They identified family clusters (the virus spreads mainly through extended close contact so family members are most at risk) and arranged isolation centres for contacts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-coronavirus-cases-how-many-are-in-your-area\">Coronavirus UK cases: find out how many are in your area</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above all, they mobilised communities.

Yes, Wuhan was in lockdown, but across the country local authorities had high autonomy to help people abide by these best public health principles. This was not a terrorised population but one passionate about tackling an existential threat. They also used apps and smartphones to get messages across, to share information about local clusters and for data collection. Everyone in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, ordered their food online, and had it delivered. And the strategy worked. In seven weeks China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">stopped the epidemic</a> in its tracks. It now reports only 10 to 20 new cases per day in a population of nearly 1.4 billion. Deaths have plummeted. Several other countries, including South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan, have copied this strategy, with local modifications, with similar results.</p> <p>Now they realise they must face the challenge of how to loosen up, and whether allowing the economy to recover will lead to more outbreaks, but they have a nationwide system to jump on new clusters and outbreaks to keep this under control. The aim is to wait and hope for drugs and vaccines to emerge in the next 12 months to enable them to treat cases and to build proper herd immunity from a vaccine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Won\u2019t this strategy ensure that the spread of the virus is intense and will cause more infections and more deaths in the near term?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had assumed that the UK would do the same, that the authorities would be building their resources and plans around nationwide testing, contact tracing, quarantine and a progressive policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-is-it-risky-to-go-to-the-pub-or-gym\" title=\"\">social distancing</a>. I assumed they would inform the public they had a two- to three-month \u201ccontain and delay\u201d strategy to get the epidemic under control, and mobilise communities everywhere to provide local support. But from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/johnson-urges-top-uk-tech-firms-to-join-coronavirus-fight\" title=\"\">press conferences last week</a>, the government is not following the WHO strategy. They appear to have concluded that it is inevitable most people would get the disease, so we should let the epidemic proceed to allow 60% of the population to become infected and build herd immunity through the wild virus. What is the scientific justification for this departure from WHO policy? I have questions:</p> <p>Why have they abandoned population testing and contact tracing to identify and seclude clusters of infections? They recommend only testing cases in hospital. Won\u2019t this strategy ensure that the spread of the virus is intense and will cause more infections and more deaths in the near term?</p> <p>Why do they recommend self-isolation only for people with symptoms when Maria Van Kerkhove of the WHO reports that \u201cit seems that people shed more virus in the early phases rather than the late phases of disease\u201d? Asymptomatic contacts may be highly infectious, so they should be tested, isolated and followed up in the community. Will they set up quarantine centres to help those who have no family support or are homeless, or need social care?</p> <p>What are their plans for national, district, municipal, village and community mobilisation? \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Nudge</a>\u201d is not enough. We need to devolve power and autonomy to allow locally intelligent decisions around a coherent national strategy. What is their detailed strategy for screening of infected people in the home, and provision of CT scans for those with early signs of pneumonia and to identify those at high risk? Without an all-out national mobilisation for social distancing, are the behavioural and nudge strategies really evidence-based to flatten the peak? Or simply based on models?</p> <p>Why are we emphasising herd immunity now? Does coronavirus induce strong herd immunity or is it like flu, where immunity remains weak and new strains emerge each year? We have much to learn about Covid-19 immune responses. Doesn\u2019t this contradict WHO policy? Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">declaring a pandemic</a>: \u201cThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t we wait to see the China situation? They have contained the epidemic after seven weeks of intensive national effort. Will epidemics break out again in new states? Maybe. Will their strengthened systems not contain them quickly and effectively? What is their herd immunity to date? We don\u2019t have the data available but new tests are coming online. It might be substantial, without a massive epidemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c41496f193067b5f70035a03c8dbdd99dfe3ed4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c41496f193067b5f70035a03c8dbdd99dfe3ed4d/0_282_6356_3814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Beijing has her temperature checked before entering a shopping mall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shouldn\u2019t we wait to see the China situation?

Is it wise or ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of uncertain future benefit?</p> <p>What is the policy to promote social distancing? How can we promote advice for families, mass gatherings, schools, workplaces, restaurants, theatres? And can we make it locally relevant?

  "<p>The coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior NHS officials reveals.</p> \n<p>The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS.</p> \n<p>It also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time.</p> \n<p>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population \u201care expected\u201d to contract the virus.</p> \n<p>The document says that: \u201cAs many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-health-experts-fear-epidemic-will-let-rip-through-uk\">Coronavirus: health experts fear epidemic will \u2018let rip\u2019 through UK</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The briefing sets out the latest official thinking about how severely the infection could affect both the public\u2019s health and that of personnel in critical services such as the NHS, police, the fire brigade and transport.</p> \n<p>It has been drawn up in recent days by PHE\u2019s emergency preparedness and response team and approved as accurate by <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.hopkins\">Dr Susan Hopkins</a>, PHE\u2019s lead official dealing with the outbreak.

But that figure isn\u2019t well appreciated or understood,\u201d added Hunter, an expert in epidemiology.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>The admission that the virus will continue to cause problems for another year appears to undermine hopes that the arrival of warmer weather this summer would kill it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work \u201cin essential services and critical infrastructure\u201d will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care.</p> \n<p>However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: \u201cIt is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.\u201d Under revised health advice Boris Johnson unveiled last Thursday, anyone with a cough should self-isolate for at least seven days.</p> \n<p>The document also states that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are \u201cunder significant demand pressures\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.</p></li> \n <li><p>Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>A senior NHS figure involved in preparing for the growing \u201csurge\u201d in patients whose lives are being put at risk by Covid-19 said an 80% infection rate could lead to more than half a million people dying.</p> \n<p>If the mortality rate turns out to be the 1% many experts are using as their working assumption then that would mean 531,100 deaths. But if Whitty\u2019s insistence that the rate will be closer to 0.6% proves accurate, then that would involve 318,660 people dying.</p> \n<p>Experts advising governments worldwide on the way epidemics grow and eventually decline say there will be a rapid rise in cases to a peak \u2013 and then a falling off. Whitty, who has seen the modelling done by UK and global scientists, says the case numbers will go up fast over the next 10 to 14 weeks.</p> \n<p>That will mean a peak at around the end of May to mid-June, when the NHS will be under great pressure. The strategy of all countries is to delay that peak and stretch it out over a longer period of time, so that health services are better able to cope. There is also the possibility that new treatments will be available by then.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After the peak, case numbers and deaths are expected to drop for 10 weeks or more, until they reach a fairly low level, which may not be zero. In the summer months especially, the case numbers are expected to reduce because people spend more time out of doors and are less likely to be confined at close quarters in small rooms in a house or office with people who are infected.</p> \n<p>There is still a worry that the virus could resurge in the autumn or winter months, which means planning for the long term will be necessary. Until a vaccine is developed, perhaps in 18 months, health planners cannot be sure of being able to protect people from the disease.</p>",

  "<p>The Oscar-winning producer David Putt\u00adnam has warned Britain will be eclipsed as a movie powerhouse unless there is an urgent push to tackle a skills shortage and to recruit new talent.</p> <p>Before a speech this week at the National Film and Television School (NFTS), the celebrated filmmaker highlighted research by industry body ScreenSkills which says growth will stall and other countries will step in unless there is an immediate \u201cstep change to solve the skills issues\u201d.</p> <p>Calling for film studios and investors to support new talent both in front of and behind the camera, Lord Puttnam said: \u201cWe still don\u2019t seem to understand that you have to feed the beast.

This faith is shaken when the public sees other countries taking more drastic steps. There may be good reasons for a divergence of policy response, but it is worrying that ministerial explanations do not convince many experts. The government had resisted clamping down hard with strict quarantine and social distancing of the kind <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\" title=\"\">successfully implemented</a> in China, because ministers said this would lead to fatigue and allow the virus to make a comeback. Yet on Sunday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said emergency laws to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-uk-over-70s-to-be-asked-to-self-isolate-within-weeks-hancock-says\" title=\"\">quarantine</a> people deemed a threat to public health would be put forward. The other model for tackling Covid-19 is South Korea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/03/13/south-korea-sees-coronavirus-slowdown-without-a-lockdown-but-with-nearly-250000-tests/#6b078ef7576b\" title=\"\">massive</a> free testing and treatment, which has corralled the disease and kept new infection rates low. In the UK, government MPs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aliciakearns/status/1239111738802548738\" title=\"\">claim</a> the concern is that the testing is inaccurate and that a false result may lead to more infections. If the past few weeks are anything to go by, ministers will be walking back from this too.</p> <p>The government policy to combat Covid-19 should be guided by science, but is ultimately a political decision. There will be an imperative to avoid an epidemic peak that overwhelms the NHS and to soften the blow to the economy. Both pose ideological questions for the government. How far and fast does it intervene to requisition beds in the private sector to increase capacity is a question that exposes the <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/winter-pressure-hospital-bed-numbers\" title=\"\">shrunken state of the health service</a>. A prime minister who has in the past treated business as a nuisance now finds he needs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-uk-manufacturers-urged-to-consider-switching-to-making-ventilators\" title=\"\">industry</a> to help address the shortage of ventilators. While the headlines scream of a war footing, the government appears hesitant and unsure in the face of a crisis.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s response compared with the speed and aggression of that pursued by other European countries carries political dangers. The first is that the government reaction does not match the severity of the threat the nation faces. The second is that experts have underestimated the public\u2019s stamina and resilience to maintain discipline in a lockdown \u2013 or in a mass testing regime. The third is that the government has not specifically said the state will ensure the burden of the coronavirus outbreak will be borne equally. It might be that relying on the market and appealing to the public\u2019s good nature and understanding is enough. But if it is not, as the historian <a href=\"https://jonathanboff.wordpress.com/2020/03/13/crisis-management-for-beginners-lessons-from-two-world-wars/\" title=\"\">Jonathan Boff notes</a>, \u201cthere is more at risk, from what will look with hindsight like complacency and a lack of concern with equal sacrifice, than Mr Johnson\u2019s political future\u201d. The country needs firm leadership \u2013 and needs it now.</p>",
  "<p>The only thing on Yannick Maden\u2019s agenda at the beginning of last week was tennis, yet instead he found himself caught up in the rapidly shifting foreign policy of a world changed by coronavirus.</p> <p>Ranked 149th on the ATP, Maden planned his travel to Nur-Sultan, the capital city of Kazakhstan, to compete in a \u20ac48k ATP Challenger event. Doubts were already swirling around the tournament as he considered whether to take his flight \u2013 a German ATP tournament supervisor had already recused himself from the event \u2013 but Kazakhstan had yet to record a significant number of cases so the decision seemed to be simple.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-sport-a-list-of-the-major-cancellations\">Coronavirus and sport \u2013 a list of the major cancellations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI waited and waited, and then on Monday there was no news, everything the same,\u201d Maden told me during a phone interview. \u201cSo I took the decision to fly. Everything there was calm, and there were two German guys there already that told me this, which was normal.\u201d</p> <p>Normality eventually dissolved through the screen of Maden\u2019s phone as he viewed a screenshot sent by a friend. The rumours that Kazakhstan\u2019s authorities would put Germans, Italians and the French into a mandatory quarantine appeared to be true. Maden was scheduled to compete on Wednesday, yet by Tuesday night he and two other pros from France and Germany were calling around consulates and embassies, trying to figure out if they were to be stuck in a foreign country for 14 days.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until lunchtime on Wednesday that they received an answer. As the warm-up for his impending match approached, Maden learnt he likely had just half a day to leave the country before he was locked down in his hotel room. Within hours he was at the airport and tearing out of the country on a flight to Moscow and then home in Stuttgart. His was one of an unprecedented nine non-medical withdrawals throughout the week in Kazakhstan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc6fe51594ba0c4f3c0ba712444d6bde863ecc54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc6fe51594ba0c4f3c0ba712444d6bde863ecc54/89_0_3205_1924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The professional tennis tours never stop - even when top players such as Novak Djokovic take their annual four-week break.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The professional tennis tours never stop - even when top players such as Novak Djokovic take their annual four-week break.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmed Jadallah/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt the end, we were at the airport for our 4.30pm flight when I heard from some Austrian guy that, for sure, we would have been put in quarantine from midnight. In the end, it was the right decision,\u201d he said. He paused and then laughed. \u201cOr the wrong decision for me to even fly there. We were not extremely stressed in the way that we were fearful, but we did not want to be put in quarantine. That was the main goal.\u201d</p> <p>The essence of tennis is that it never stops. The full professional calendar spans 51 weeks of the year. Even when the likes of Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are far from the courts for their own paltry four-week off\u2011season, there is normally always somebody, somewhere competing in a live streamed tournament and being awarded points under the same ranking system.</p> <p>As a result, the domino effect of tennis coming to a halt has been a worldwide phenomenon. In Indian Wells, 200 of the best male and female players were blindsided by the news that it had been called off. After days of debates between the players stranded in the Californian desert, both across the grounds and in mammoth Whatsapp groups, the ATP, WTA and ITF suspended the tour for 5-6 weeks.</p> <p>Jack Draper, Britain\u2019s best young player, did not even have the opportunity to contemplate his future. The 19 year old was 1hr 44min into his quarter-final match against Tobias Simon at the Potchefstroom $35k challenger in South Africa when rain began to pour and they were hauled off the court with Draper leading 5-4 in the third set. The ATP announced the immediate suspension of the tour during the delay and they never made it back to the court. The match was cancelled and promptly erased from the record books. \u201cWas just about to get the break as well,\u201d Draper tweeted afterwards.</p> <p>The political manoeuverings borne out of coronavirus affected countless players. Dayana Yastremska, a highly rated 19-year-old, panicked after Donald Trump announced his European travel ban. In the fear that she would be trapped in the US, she immediately flitted to the airport and back to Ukraine.</p> <p>Zhu Lin, a Chinese player who lives in Beijing, did not buy a plane ticket out of California until Friday. The uncertainty of Chinese athletes abroad was reflected in her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ratazana/status/1238531338795442183\" title=\"\">asking her fans on Weibo</a> where on earth she would go if she couldn\u2019t make it back home: \u201cI bought my plane ticket but flight might be blocked,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf I change flight to other countries, I would get sent to quarantine. Feels too risky to stay in the US. Please give me some suggestions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/12/andy-murray-portrait-by-maggi-hambling-to-go-on-show-in-london\">Andy Murray portrait by Maggi Hambling to go on show in London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maden says his current ranking, which peaked at 96 last year, has earnt him enough money for a worry-free six weeks. He will be fine. But tennis players are self-employed and earn money when they play. Like so many workers in affected areas around the world, some lower-ranked players face an extremely difficult time ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because there is no income coming in and no chance of income. That would be the uncertainty, that would be the most frustrating or unsure aspect,\u201d says Maden.</p> <p>Although tennis set the tone early on with its cancellations, the other sports slowly followed last week. The discourse and decision making seem to reflect the widespread consideration of sports as an escape from the real world, rather than part of it. Almost all of the discussed coronavirus contingency plans in the NBA, Premier League and elsewhere focused on how to manage fans without ever taking into account the fact that the athletes themselves might contract the virus anyway.</p> <p>At the very least, the historic past week should be a reminder that sports and the athletes within them cannot be separated from the world around them and that is how people should always write, think and talk about them.</p>",

  "<p>People over 70 will soon be asked to stay at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the risk of contracting coronavirus, the UK health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\">Matt Hancock</a>, has said.</p> \n<p>Ministers are also not ruling out ordering the closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.</p> \n<p>Such drastic measures would go beyond what the government anticipated in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan/coronavirus-action-plan-a-guide-to-what-you-can-expect-across-the-uk\">its coronavirus action plan</a>, but countries such as France have ordered closures on this scale and Hancock said the government would do whatever was necessary to protect life.</p> \n<p>Hancock confirmed the government will soon tell people over 70 that they will need to self-isolate at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the disease \u2013 but his terminology caused some confusion, leading Scottish officials to stress that elderly people would not be asked to avoid all contact with other people.</p> \n<p>In an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Hancock said asking the over-70s to stay self-isolated would be \u201ca very big ask\u201d, but that it was part of the government\u2019s action plan because it would be necessary to protect them. He said this would be announced in the coming weeks.</p> \n<p> Jason Leitch, the national clinical director for the Scottish government, which is working with the Westminster government on a UK-wide coronavirus strategy, subsequently said on Twitter there was no plan to ask the over-70s to \u201ccompletely socially isolate\u201d and that the proposal for older people would be to minimise social contact, not end it.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonleitch/status/1239158887540043777\">a tweet</a>, he said: \u201cWe are working on guidance for the over-70s to be asked to REDUCE social contact for their safety. So no bingo, no pubs \u2026 BUT family visits and neighbours etc.\u201d</p> \n<p>The term self-isolation has been used by health officials to refer to the very strict isolation routine supposed to be followed by people with coronavirus, but on Sunday morning Hancock seemed to be using it in the looser sense that has become commonplace \u2013 referring to staying at home and minimising social interaction.</p> \n<p>The health department said guidelines saying exactly what the new advice for the over-70s would mean in practice would be published in due course. </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>In the Marr interview, Hancock was asked if the government would follow countries such as France and Spain, where bars, restaurants and shops have been closed, apart from supermarkets and pharmacies.</p> \n<p>Hancock replied: \u201cWe have not ruled that out.

  "<p>When Linda Erskine looked outside her window last week, she saw an intense flare from the Mossmorran petrochemical plant in Fife. The flaring, which she says collapses night into day, can be seen more than 20 miles away in Edinburgh.</p> <p>Erskine, a local Labour councillor, describes living in Lochgelly, a former mining community neighbouring Mossmorran, as unpleasant. \u201cWhen that flare goes, the house does vibrate. For me it\u2019s something akin to a Nimrod [maritime patrol plane] landing on top of your house. The first time I went out to see if there\u2019s a helicopter flying overhead.\u201d</p> <p>Residents, who formed a local action group, are calling on the government to set up an independent inquiry into the health, social, and environmental impact of what they describe as an \u201cageing\u201d plant, but this demand has been ignored. For the local community, the flaring has come to symbolise a disconnect from the Scottish government\u2019s rhetoric about the climate emergency and what it does on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/21/time-oil-industry-snuff-out-flares-pollutionwatch\">Time for the oil industry to snuff out its flares</a> </p> </aside>  <p>ExxonMobil\u2019s Fife Ethylene Plant at Mossmorran began production in 1985. Flaring, a process that burns off gas that cannot be processed, can last for several days. As well as planned flaring events, unexpected flaring also occurs as a safety mechanism. It\u2019s legal on the site that ExxonMobil shares with Shell Fife NGL, but the company has a duty to mitigate the impact it can have on local communities.</p> <p>Last April, the Scottish environmental agency (Sepa) launched a criminal investigation into ExxonMobil because of unplanned flaring. The investigation follows \u201cfinal warning letters\u201d issued to ExxonMobil in April 2018 regarding flaring that was found to be \u201cpreventable and unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn our bedroom, which faces towards Mossmorran, it\u2019s impossible to keep the light out. It\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d said Joe Purves<strong>, </strong>a 69-year-old recently retired accountant who has lived in Lochgelly for 45 years. He believes the frequency and severity of the flaring has got worse over the last few years.</p> <p>\u201cThe community are told when there\u2019s going to be planned flaring, but it\u2019s the fact the emergency flaring keeps on taking place,\u201d said Linda Holt, an independent councillor at Fife council. \u201cThey always say it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199651450.001.0001/acref-9780199651450-e-2288\">\u2018process upset\u2019</a> but everyone knows it\u2019s because something has gone wrong. And things have gone wrong more in the last few years because the plant is ageing.\u201d</p> <p>Last summer, the plant was shut down to address the mechanical issues the company was having with its boilers and implement preventive work to improve the plant\u2019s reliability. But unexpected elevated flaring occurred within a month of the plant reopening in February, sparking widespread anger.</p> <p>Chris Dailly, Sepa\u2019s head of environmental performance, said the watchdog had made it clear ExxonMobil needed to invest further in flaring mitigation technologies and given the company a timeline for compliance. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that flaring has been unacceptable and that compliance with Scotland\u2019s environmental rules is non-negotiable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While 42-year-old James Glen, a graphic and web designer who set up the Mossmorran action group in 2017 with Holt, welcomes Sepa\u2019s investigation, he argues it\u2019s not enough. The action group calls for an independent inquiry that looks at health, site safety, and social issues. More than 2,000 people have written to the Scottish environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, echoing the action\u2019s group demand.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Scottish government said that as Sepa was concluding its investigation, it \u201cwould not be appropriate nor helpful for ministers to interfere in independent regulatory decisions, particularly while enforcement investigations are ongoing\u201d.</p> <p>Glen accuses the Scottish government of \u201chiding behind Sepa\u201d and said it should come to meet the community to discuss their concerns. Erskine said Holyrood is already losing credibility on the issue. \u201cWe should be looking after our constituents, not big business. Our job is the safety and wellbeing of the people that live here. If that plant had been any place near Edinburgh, it would have been shut down.\u201d</p> <p>Glen says the community\u2019s concerns about their health had long been dismissed until a 2019 NHS Fife report, which he believes just scratches at the surface, concluded \u201cit is clear that the degree of physical and psychological disturbance caused to people in the vicinity of Mossmorran has been considerable\u201d.</p> <p>The report noted the most common health-related concerns among local residents were anxiety, respiratory issues such as asthma, sleeping difficulties, and headaches. It found no evidence of higher than expected cancer rates, while 32 Sepa\u2019s air quality reports demonstrate no breach of the UK air quality standard.</p> <p>Stuart Neill, the plant\u2019s public affairs manager, said: \u201cWe very much regret any concern that flaring may have caused to members of the local community. The safety of our people and neighbours is our most important priority and the ability to flare is a critical part of the plant\u2019s multiple safety mechanisms.\u201d</p> <p>Neill added that the plant is one of the youngest facilities of its kind in Europe and as well as investing \u00a320m annually in maintenance, this year the company would be investing an additional \u00a3140m to upgrade infrastructure to improve operational reliability and reduce flaring.</p> <p>Glen set up an impact map so residents can report health, social or environmental issues related to Mossmorran. There have been 363 incidents added so far. One report from a resident in Edinburgh notes: \u201cI genuinely thought tonight that there had been an explosion at the plant given the intensity [of the flaring].\u201d Another writes: \u201cIf we see it as far away as North Berwick what must it be like up close?\u201d</p>",

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/10/arron-banks-mps-call-for-police-investigate-russia-links\">allegations of Russian interference</a> in the Brexit referendum, to the frustration of MPs who believed a full investigation was necessary.</p> <p>Officials said the revised position about Russian interference was set out by Earl Howe, the deputy leader of the House of Lords, <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Lords/2020-01-08/HL239/\">in a parliamentary answer earlier this year</a>, when he was asked if there were plans to investigate interference by foreign governments in December\u2019s election.</p> <p>The peer said the government was determined to protect the integrity of the democratic process in the UK. \u201cAs you would expect, the government examines all aspects of the electoral process following an election, including foreign interference, and that work is ongoing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Stephen Kinnock, a Labour MP, said the government was being slow in acknowledging the disinformation threat from Russia. \u201cFrom the hacking of NHS emails to the St Petersburg troll factories and bot farms, it\u2019s clear that the Kremlin is pursuing a deliberate strategy of online disinformation and manipulation that is undermining our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Security sources said that Russian strategy of \u201chack and leak\u201d and \u201cdisinformation and misinformation\u201d \u2013 which first came to prominence with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/13/russia-indictments-latest-news-hacking-dnc-charges-trump-department-justice-rod-rosenstein\">hack of Democratic emails</a> in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election that handed victory to Donald Trump \u2013 was becoming widespread internationally.</p> <p>Last month, the Foreign Office said Russia\u2019s GRU spy agency had carried out a series of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russias-gru-over-georgia-cyber-attacks\">\u201clarge-scale, disruptive cyber-attacks\u201d in Georgia</a> \u201cin an attempt to undermine Georgia\u2019s sovereignty, to sow discord and disrupt the lives of ordinary Georgian people\u201d.</p> <p>But despite the strong words in support of an ally in the Caucasus, ministers had been reluctant to publicly call out any Russian disinformation efforts in the UK \u2013 and there has been little public acknowledgement of the NHS hack during the election, first reported by the Guardian.</p> <p>The scale of the Russian threat will be examined in the long-awaited report on Kremlin infiltration into British politics from the independent intelligence and security committee, which cannot be published until Downing Street appoints a new set of members following the election.</p> <p>Earlier this week, it emerged that among those in the frame were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/11/chris-grayling-to-head-body-that-will-have-final-say-over-russia-report\">error-prone former transport secretary Chris Grayling</a> and recently sacked environment minister Theresa Villiers.</p> <p>The NHS emails are believed to have been hacked from an adviser\u2019s personal Gmail account, and were <a

practically standing on her knees working on a trade agreement with the US\u201d.</p> <p>Initially ignored, the documents covering six rounds of UK-US trade talks were eventually picked up by Labour

The same goes for retailers, many of them hanging on by their fingertips even before Covid-19. Britain has a new chancellor of the exchequer in Rishi Sunak and, from Monday, a new governor of the Bank of England in Andrew Bailey, and they will both be aware that the risks of doing too little too late are far greater than those of doing too much too soon.</p> <p>So, in the coming weeks the Bank can be expected to cut interest rates to 0.1% \u2013 the lowest they have ever been \u2013 and to resume its QE programme.

The supply of goods and services is impaired because factories and offices are shut and output falls as a result. But demand also falls because consumers stay at home and stop spending, and businesses mothball investment.</p> <p>Conventional policy measures \u2013 such as cutting the cost of borrowing or reducing taxes \u2013 tend to work better when there is a demand shock. There is a limit to what they can do in the event of a combined supply and demand shock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ea1961b0f57d3a7772b0d36871557708650bb26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ea1961b0f57d3a7772b0d36871557708650bb26/19_22_5530_3318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy is in lockdown because of the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy is in lockdown because of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Policymakers know that, which is why Sunak stressed in his budget speech that the economy faced a tough period. The aim is make the downturn as short and shallow as possible, even though the chances of this look vanishingly small.</p> <p>One reason for that is because the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 is enormous. Entire countries \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/11/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-leaves-streets-deserted-in-pictures\">Italy </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">Spain </a>\u2013 are in lockdown. The problems facing airline companies are symptomatic of a crisis facing the global travel industry, from cruise companies to hotels that cater for tourists. Discretionary spending by consumers appears to have collapsed in recent days.</p> <p>Despite globalisation, much economic activity remains local but here, too, there will be an impact as people cancel appointments at the dentist, put off having their hair cut and wait to put their house on the market.</p> <p>Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has estimated that output in Britain will shrink by 2.5% in the second quarter but says a 5% fall is possible. The more pessimistic estimate looks quite plausible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s more, in a service-sector dominated economy much of the lost output is never going to be recovered. If people do not go out to their weekly meal at their favourite local restaurant for the next two months they are not going to eat out four times a week when the fear of infection has been lifted.</p> <p>It also seems likely that the economic pain will go on for longer than originally estimated. Having imposed bans and restrictions, governments and private-sector bodies will be cautious about removing them. Countries such as Italy will be wary of opening their borders while there is a fear of reinfection. The idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-football-league-suspended-until-4-april-coronavirus\">Premier League football</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-british-football-set-for-shutdown-due-to-coronavirus-live\"> </a>will be back by early April is fanciful.</p> <p>There is also a question of how long it will take consumer and business confidence to recover. Policy action by central banks and finance ministries can help in this respect but only so much. The chances are that the imminent recession will be U-shaped: a steep decline followed by a period of bumping along the bottom. There will be recovery but it will take time and only after much damage has been caused.</p>",
  "<p>Mae Martin is an addict. At the age of six, she was addicted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bette-midler\" title=\"\">Bette Midler</a>. It was a curious, grand, important feeling and one she knew she must indulge alone, in her room after dinner. At 11, after she was invited up on stage to pretend to be a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy, and there felt the full force of an audience\u2019s laughter, Martin became addicted to standup comedy, leaving school three years later to perform full-time. She would walk onstage at 14 with a cigarette to complicated silences, and spend her evenings with adults, and their alcohol, and their cocaine. At 16 she was addicted to drugs and her parents kicked her out. Now 32, having been through rehab and moved from Toronto to London, she has used her 10,000-plus hours of standup to carve out a unique place in British comedy where she talks about all of these things; a place that is warm and clean and wise, and very funny.</p> <p>Shrugging off her jacket on a winterish afternoon last month, Martin was cautious but charming. White-haired, wide-eyed, she appeared freshly hatched. She\u2019d just come from having a new suit fitted \u2013 the answer, hopefully, to her long-standing anxieties over how to dress in order to feel like herself. Except, the tailor kept referencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ellen-degeneres\" title=\"\">Ellen DeGeneres</a> when she had been quite clear that he was to cut the suit with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\" title=\"\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> in mind, and only Leonardo DiCaprio. I could clearly picture the conversation: her polite insistence that he accept who she told him she was, rather than impose his own ideas.</p> <p>This will not be her first suit. As a child, she wore a three-piece suit and bow tie, and it was in this divine little outfit that her parents first took her to see the standup shows that would change her life. \u201cWatching comedy for the first time I felt absolutely on fire. I just couldn\u2019t believe there was this environment where people were being applauded for the weirdest things about themselves,\u201d she says, opening her eyes even wider. \u201cEspecially feeling like an outsider at school, and then finding this community where I could own those things and be applauded for them. People who would laugh with me instead of at me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74cc5b557e21ca2a8c9363816eeca538a433b390\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74cc5b557e21ca2a8c9363816eeca538a433b390/171_269_5589_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin at the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mae Martin at the Laughing Horse at City Cafe Free Festival at the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRZ9-xDZ14w\" title=\"\">video on YouTube</a> of her performing at 16, in character as a competitor in a public-speaking competition about \u201cwomen in media\u201d. The audience seems equal parts dazzled and confused by the combination of lonely desperation and <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> obsession she presents, in cropped hair and pinafore dress. These days audiences are less confused; instead of leading with her awkwardness, she explores it, performs it and invites us to laugh at it with her. Her most recent standup tours were Us, in 2015, about sex and gender identity, and Dope, in 2017, about addiction \u2013 both were turned into BBC radio shows.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a slow process of getting closer and closer to my actual personality on stage. And now there\u2019s very little separation. I definitely find the more open and vulnerable I am, the more people enjoy it,\u201d she grins in understatement.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I saw Mae\u2019s work,\u201d the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ellenpage\" title=\"\">Ellen Page</a> says via email, \u201cI not only laughed so hard, I was struck by her honesty, vulnerability, intelligence and ability to tell personal stories that render them relatable to us all. I am inspired by Mae,\u201d she adds, \u201cand lucky to call her a friend.\u201d</p> <p>Today audiences treat Martin with a similarly delicate awe. Usually. \u201cWell, I got heckled the other night. I was talking about gender identity and this woman shouted, \u2018No one cares!\u2019 It was so harsh, but I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Partly because I was in control and partly because, well, I replied something like, \u2018The problem is that people actually care too much!\u2019 There\u2019s so much hysteria around gender, hysteria that comes from a place of misinformation and fear.\u201d She shrugs. Chuckles. Once, a therapist warned her that if she completed therapy, she\u2019d probably stop being funny. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I disagree.\u2019 I knew my job was not mutually exclusive to happiness. I think she was romanticising that tortured-artist thing, which I don\u2019t buy into any more. Really. If you\u2019re unhappy, you can\u2019t make anything.\u201d</p> <p>Dope, her show on addiction, took longer to brew. \u201cYeah, I needed enough distance from that time in my life to\u2026 retrospect. I approached it pretty academically and did tonnes of research and tried to make sense of it. And then I started telling my stories on stage and hoping the punchlines emerged.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a11c20b9312c900501ddd44beac89ff167ad7b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a11c20b9312c900501ddd44beac89ff167ad7b2c/175_360_4258_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Adrian Lukis and Lisa Kudrow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel Good comedy: (from left) Mae Martin, Charlotte Ritchie, Adrian Lukis and Lisa Kudrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What did she learn? \u201cI guess the big realisation was that addiction isn\u2019t really about substances. The definition that I use is from [writer and physician] Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9, which is: addiction is something that you crave, find relief from and can\u2019t give up, despite knowing the negative consequences.\u201d Imagine, she asks her audiences, that they\u2019ve just realised they\u2019ve left their phone in the bar \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t burst into tears, but the nagging anxiety, the need to touch it again, would mean they wouldn\u2019t laugh for the rest of the show. \u201cRight? His is such a broad definition and resonates with so many people, whether it\u2019s our phones or food or sex or relationships. Things that we know are bad for us, but that soothe us when we\u2019re finding the present moment difficult. Hearing that was kind of a breakthrough for me.\u201d</p> <p>Why? \u201cBecause I think I was patting myself on the back for getting off drugs and not realising, actually, that addictive behaviour was still permeating my life in a lot of ways. So that\u2019s what the TV series is about.\u201d</p> <p>The TV series, yes. We are here to discuss <em>Feel Good</em>, a new Channel 4 comedy, co-written by and starring Martin as a comedian called Mae, navigating the sensitive dynamics of her NA group, a relationship with a straight girl (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/29/charlotte-ritchie-funniest-things\" title=\"\">Charlotte Ritchie</a>), and a strained bond with her mother, performed magnificently by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/lisa-kudrow\" title=\"\">Lisa Kudrow</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am. It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe character Mae is where I was about 10 years ago. So it\u2019s a pretty tenuous grip on sobriety, just fresh out of the depths of addiction and super manic. I have a pretty good hold on my life now \u2013 I\u2019m pretty stable. But I definitely feel like, in a way\u2026 I miss her.\u201d The old Mae is seen on screen as a panicked romantic who lies awake at night with her hands hovering in fists above her chest. \u201cShe\u2019s a mess, with all her agony and ecstasy, but I do miss the optimism and naivety. I don\u2019t miss the lows, but losing those sometimes means you don\u2019t get the highs.\u201d</p> <p>Five years ago Martin transferred her addictive obsession on to this script, this series, and she digs her hands into her knees at the thought that soon it will be out, in the world, with all the judgment and mainstream fame that might mean. She wants to be clear: it is comedy, not therapy. \u201cNo this is not purely some cathartic therapeutic exercise for me. Me and Joe [Hampson, her co-writer] really just wanted to write a good comedy that had a lot of heart. It\u2019s a work of fiction. But it\u2019s got an emotional truth, because it\u2019s based on experiences I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve dated lots of girls who\u2019ve never been with a girl before, for instance, which makes for quite a romantic and painful dynamic.\u201d</p> <p>And for all the pain of bleeding her own life into six half-hours, the surprise agony actually came from acting for the first time. \u201cI sort of thought acting was just about arranging your face into emotions. I didn\u2019t realise it was about actually allowing yourself to feel the feelings, then letting your face follow. That was a big learning curve.\u201d</p> <p>Actually allowing herself to feel the feelings has been a lesson in more ways than one. Since discussing her childhood and addictions on stage, Martin\u2019s life has expanded, along with her career. \u201cIt\u2019s enriching and cathartic to share things that your gut tells you are not all right to say. To say things that you\u2019re embarrassed or ashamed of, and then have everybody go: \u2018Me too.\u2019 And the more specific and embarrassing, the more people seem to connect.\u201d During her show about gender and sexuality, she witnessed lots of teenagers coming out to their friends and family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d3fadef21021e5c9b275e3d854a8ab99611bb21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3fadef21021e5c9b275e3d854a8ab99611bb21/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie in Feel Good\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a work of fiction.

But I\u2019m not a licensed family therapist, so it was also quite scary. Especially because then they wanted to go out to a club. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna pass.\u2019 With the next show, Dope, I saw a lot of addicts or people who have family members struggling with addictions. That was pretty wild. But I love it all.\u201d</p> <p>Last year she wrote a book for teenagers, a guide to 21st-century sexuality. \u201cI had to constantly remind people that I\u2019m just writing about my experiences. It\u2019s different for everyone \u2013 the most important thing is not to be squeamish. Talking about sexuality and gender right now is so politicised, but imagine being a teenager in your first relationship, and how stressful it would feel if you were seeing your identity debated on <em>Newsnight</em>. And so I try to take a lighter look, and remind people that it\u2019s supposed to be fun and also, that you don\u2019t have to feel pressured to pick a certain label.\u201d The book\u2019s title is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/can-everyone-please-calm-down-9781526361653.html\" title=\"\">Can Everyone Please Calm Down?</a></em></p> <p>As well as belly laughs, Martin\u2019s audiences have become accustomed to feeling something slightly higher up: a light pressure on their heart, for example, or a tightening of the throat, or a small nudge on the brain. Her favourite comedians can, she says, \u201cDo both \u2013 be really hilarious while also sneaking in a social message.\u201d On stage she offers a critical analysis of contemporary obsessions, stories from her own life weaving through a theme, resulting in yes, punchlines, but also tight political conclusions \u2013 such as her insistence that we should eliminate labels like gay, straight, or bi.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone needs to take a deep breath and look at the facts and not the headlines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m all for people identifying however they want. But I\u2019ve found that sometimes those labels bulldoze over nuance. My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am! It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part. Apparently 40% of people under 25 don\u2019t identify as gay or straight any more. So I feel like that\u2019s where we are heading. If we just assume everyone\u2019s a bit gay, then we wouldn\u2019t have to go through that quite harrowing process of declaring yourself to be something else. Yeah, I see a lot of benefits to not expecting everyone to declare who they are.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder whether researching her own life for a show has brought up any surprising realisations. \u201cWell, one thing I found interesting is this false impression that gender fluidity or \u2018dismantling the gender binary\u2019 is a recent millennial fad, when, for centuries of human civilisation, there have been variances in gender. It\u2019s actually quite a recent western thing to have such a strict gender binary. In 2018, India decriminalised homosexuality, and we celebrated it over here. But, England went into India and criminalised homosexuality in 1856! It\u2019s the gaslighting that gets me. It\u2019s like setting somebody\u2019s house on fire and then going, \u2018Argh, it\u2019s taking me so long to put the fire out, like, it\u2019s <em>sooo</em> hard.\u201d</p> <p>She is fun to sit with. An afternoon discussing social politics with a comedian more brusque or earnest than Martin would be a slightly exhausting prospect. But she treads so lightly and with such conviction that the segues from her coconut allergy to the reaction to strap-on dildos in <em>Feel Good</em> to trans rights carry me gently and jollily through our conversation. It\u2019s only later, transcribing, that it strikes me how radical her post-identity politics might be.</p> <p>\u201cI totally understand people feeling overwhelmed, or feeling a sense of vertigo about how quickly things are changing. But everyone needs to take a deep breath and look at the facts and not the headlines.\u201d She searches quickly for an example from life. \u201cI remember when I first learned algebra and I got into this real angry panic because I was like, \u2018I just figured out numbers \u2013 and now they\u2019re introducing letters again?\u2019\u201d That was when she left school. \u201cI think that\u2019s the kind of thing people feel is happening now, and they\u2019re panicking. But it\u2019s actually not that confusing, if you listen properly.\u201d Then she says something that, in 2020, feels oddly like the most radical concept of all. Martin leans in. \u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of the idea that ambiguity, of the idea that not knowing\u201d \u2013 who you are, who you love, where to put your hands when you sleep, or why Bette Midler stirred such longing in a six-year-old Canadian child \u2013 \u201cis fine.\u201d Unexpectedly, I laugh.</p> <p><em>Feel Good starts on 18 March at 10pm on Channel 4</em></p>",

It is a twist that is also a dare. The circumstances are improbable, the conclusion risks staining the action with sentimentality. To work, <strong><a href=\"https://trafalgar-studios.com/shows/on-blueberry-hill/\" title=\"\">On Blueberry Hill</a></strong> needs a leap of faith from the audience. I leapt.</p> <p>Two men in prison uniforms, perched or sprawling on bunk beds, deliver monologues. In Sabine Dargent\u2019s set, bright pages \u2013 the colour of the Gaelic Bible \u2013 dangle from the ceiling: the bunk beds are in a kind of limbo. Niall Buggy is canny and comic as the man who has said yes to everything from crane-driving (when he didn\u2019t know how) to women (when he had more than enough already). David Ganly is reflective as a former seminarian shaken by his love for another man, slowly coming to terms with the deed that has imprisoned him. They tell their stories separately. At first they meander through luscious recollections of childhood and mothers, and falling in love. Then comes acknowledgement from both that they have committed murder: one of them, in a singularly chilling admission, says he acted on what felt like a whim.</p> <p>Their stories converge. That strains credibility, but still more so does the movement in a short play from terrible violence to behaving like turtle doves. How does Barry pull it off? By giving us a new vocabulary in which to think about his characters. As they reminisce, they accidentally describe themselves and their circumstances. They are \u201charsh but radiant\u201d: like the woman, both adored and betrayed, who is \u201cshining with beauty\u201d and has an accent \u201cthat would mash spuds\u201d.</p> <p>Jim Culleton\u2019s rapt production for <a href=\"https://www.fishamble.com/\" title=\"\">Fishamble</a>, which has already been seen in Ireland (including Dublin\u2019s Mountjoy prison) and New York, wonderfully captures the idea of bullseye moments, of episodes of an electric awareness \u2013 the cell \u201cvibrates\u201d with the energy of the two men \u2013 but also a stately mythology, the bringing of shades to life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/01/katherine-parkinson-felicity-kendal-wellies-the-good-life-the-it-crowd-actor\">Katherine Parkinson: \u2018Felicity Kendal\u2019s wellies are big ones to fill\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>EV Crowe has come up with a terrific title. <strong><a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/shoelady/\" title=\"\">Shoe Lady</a></strong> casts a shrewd glance at the way almost any noun slung in front of the word \u201clady\u201d becomes an insult: think \u201cbag\u201d, think \u201ccat\u201d \u2013 and compare \u201cbat man\u201d. She has also brought serious legwork and fancy footwork to the subject of one woman\u2019s unravelling. Shoes \u2013 on your uppers, well-heeled \u2013 are one of the quickest guides to status. And they carry a fairytale history of horror. I might like to think I\u2019d have been Cinderella but, lacking dainty feet, I\u2019d more likely be one of the Ugly Sisters, hacking off part of her heel to get it into the glass slipper. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auAYWfsV0OU\">Crowe</a> hints at all this in her story of an estate agent who loses a shoe and with it her equilibrium: she has for a time more in common with a street-dwelling cider drinker (also down to one shoe \u2013 a flattie) than with her boss, whose high heels are glimpsed under a lavatory door. She hobbles, her foot bleeds, she is \u201cshort of normal\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b4faca163eafb4a52bbdb21a4fde240ad8fc506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b4faca163eafb4a52bbdb21a4fde240ad8fc506/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Parkinson in Shoe Lady.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Losing a shoe and her equilibrium\u2019: Katherine Parkinson in Shoe Lady.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/01/katherine-parkinson-felicity-kendal-wellies-the-good-life-the-it-crowd-actor\" title=\"\">Katherine Parkinson</a>, for the most part alone on stage, is magnetic.

Sinking into darkness, she is often surrounded by hyper-brightness in Chloe Lamford\u2019s set and with Natasha Chivers\u2019s lighting. Director Vicky Featherstone keenly enhances the eeriness \u2013 and towards the end stages a musical number in the form of a wonderful trudging chant.</p> <p>There is plenty to intrigue but not enough to satisfy. The politics are insubstantial. Crowe has interestingly cited Arnold Wesker as an influence, alongside Caryl Churchill. A touch of Wesker-style documentary might have bolstered the episode with the rough sleeper. Disturbance sometimes fades into ditziness.

  "<p>At 82, Carley P Angell falls in the category for those at risk of serious illness if exposed to coronavirus. In two weeks, she could also end up in the same category as the tens of thousands in California who are at-risk and homeless.</p> <p>Public health officials are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">issuing warnings</a> for those in her age range to stay home and self-isolate, but Angell and the 11 other seniors remaining at the Brookdale San Pablo assisted living facility still face eviction at the end of the month.</p> <p>\u201cWe are scared,\u201d Angell said. \u201cWe realize we are a very vulnerable population. We\u2019re the ones that coronavirus is hitting the hardest, and here we are, being forced out on to the streets with no place to go.\u201d</p> <p>When a global pandemic hits a state already gripped by a housing affordability crisis, the impact is both devastating and far-reaching. Those on the margins bear the brunt the hardest, forced to venture out to fight for their housing when public health warnings are discouraging people from social contact. \u201cWe\u2019re caught between anxiety and terror,\u201d Angell said. \u201cSome of us don\u2019t have places to go. We\u2019ve been looking and we can\u2019t afford them and the places we can afford are so awful, we and our children would not want us to go there.\u201d</p> <p>In a state with sky-high rents, more than are willing to admit teeter on the edge of housing insecurity. Self-quarantine without the option to work from home, or getting sick without paid sick leave could mean not being able to pay the bills. Fewer work shifts because no one is going out to eat, or a cancelled gig because the governor recommended postponing large gatherings could mean not being able to make rent. \u201cSo many of us are just one or two paychecks away from not being able to afford one of our basic needs, which is housing,\u201d said Lupe Arreola, the executive director of Tenants Together.</p> <p>In a state with 17m renters, more than 55% are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Arreola said she\u2019s concerned that many more will end up homeless in California because of coronavirus \u2013 and before the outbreak is under control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85ee269a7e96489a72ef6fa80a1b0d228a18db9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85ee269a7e96489a72ef6fa80a1b0d228a18db9a/0_118_3538_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street performer sits alone at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco, 12 March 2020.

London Breed, the San Francisco mayor, issued a moratorium on Friday, and and Oakland is working on a similar measure as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of this is far and far-reaching,\u201d said the San Francisco lawmaker Dean Preston, who introduced the legislation there. \u201cThere\u2019s lost income for a lot of folks.

  "<p>The \u201ccyclist-first\u201d city of Utrecht is constructing the Netherlands\u2019 first high-density, car-free residential district for more than 12,000 people, making it one of the largest of its type in the world.</p> \n<p>The 24-hectare site, located between two canals in the middle of the city, is a business park but by 2024 it is hoped the area will enhance Utrecht\u2019s reputation as a bicycling capital of Europe.</p> \n<p>The Dutch city built the Netherlands\u2019 first bike lane in 1885 and last year it unveiled the <a href=\"https://www.utrecht.nl/city-of-utrecht/mobility/cycling/bicycle-parking/bicycle-parking-stationsplein/bicycle-parking-stationsplein-utrecht-largest-in-the-world/\">world\u2019s largest multistorey bike park</a> area with space to accommodate 12,500 bicycles of all shapes and sizes.</p> \n<p>The new-build Merwede district of 6,000 homes is expected to be serviced by about 20,000 bicycles.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt should be easier to get a bike than it should be to get a car,\u201d the project\u2019s architect, Marco Broekman, said of the philosophy behind the development.</p> \n<p>Construction on the first homes is expected in 2022. Two new primary schools and health centres, a high school, a sports centre and shops and businesses will also be built on the site, which will be accessible to the rest of the city, the fourth largest in the Netherlands, by bike lanes and trams.</p> \n<p>Only four dead-end roads of 60 metres in length will protrude into the car-free idyll to allow \u201clogistical\u201d access for petrol-guzzling vehicles into the district\u2019s outer fringes.</p> \n<p>Underground garages alongside the \u201clogistical roads\u201c will offer 1,800 parking spaces for those who cannot quit their addiction to the car, equating to one car for every three households.</p> \n<p>The parking spaces will be available for use at a heavy cost and are to remain unassigned to dissuade use. Alongside them will be 300 shared cars for residents\u2019 use. The closest alternative parking will be 3km away.</p> \n<p>For shopping deliveries, and for the removal of rubbish from the new car-free streets, it is expected small electric vehicles will be deployed to trundle from the \u201clogistical roads\u201d to the homes and back.</p> \n<p>The Merwede district will boast the largest underground heat and cold storage facility in the Netherlands, using water from the Merwedekanaal to cool it. The roofs of the district\u2019s buildings will be filled with greenery or solar panels, which would cover three hectares if put side to side.</p> \n<p>Broekman said he and his collaborators had been inspired by smaller-scale projects in Paris and a 600-home development in Amsterdam\u2019s Gemeente Waterleiding district, but that he believed the scale of the project was unique.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cBy having this car-free area, we can design spaces without the straitjacket rules of the car, and thus focus on essentials for a high-density area, which is the quality of public space, city on eye level, green, biodiversity, climate adaptation and meeting places for social interaction.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kees Diepeveen, the alderman responsible for the city district, known as the Merwedekanaalzone, said Utrecht was rapidly growing and the behaviour of its citizens was changing as quickly.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe have the highest number of shared cars [per capita] in the Netherlands. It is amazing to see how the average household is changing its habits. This especially counts for the younger generations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Merwede, a third of whose land is owned by the municipality with the rest belonging to private entities, follows the example of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/mar/23/freiburg.germany.greenest.city\" title=\"Vauban in Germany\">Vauban in Germany</a>, which is home to more than 5,000 people.</p> \n<p>Residents there must confirm once a year that they do not own a car or otherwise purchase a space in a multistorey car park on the edge of the district. A space was initially provided for every two households, but car ownership has fallen over time, and many of spaces now lie empty.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Books: Rachel Cooke</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Zoo of the New</strong>, edited by Nick Laird and Don Paterson. Such an anxious moment surely calls for the consolations of poetry. What you need is this fat anthology, in which Rosemary Tonks nestles up to Tennyson, and Sappho sits in close proximity to Seamus Heaney. Or what about <strong>The Prelude</strong>, Wordsworth\u2019s epic autobiographical poem? Even if you can\u2019t leave the house, its hundreds of pages will transport you swiftly and elegantly to the Lakeland fells \u2013 and, perhaps, to the happier times of your own childhood.</p> <p><strong>Middlemarch</strong> by George Eliot. Maybe you want a novel. This is a book so capacious and wise it cannot fail to suit a period of quarantine.</p> <p><strong>Chips: The Diaries of Sir Henry Channon</strong>. Not only are these journals, written by the snobbish, American-born Conservative MP for Southend, witty, gossipy and completely engrossing; they also cover the blitz and, as a result, come with a built-in sense of perspective. These bad times, like other bad times before them, will surely pass in the end.</p> <h2><strong>Podcasts: Miranda Sawyer</strong></h2> <p><strong>My Dad </strong><strong>Wrote a Porno</strong>. If you\u2019ve never got round to listening to this, now\u2019s the time. With loads of episodes, every one hilarious, ridiculous and with no relevance to real life, this podcast will cheer anyone up.</p> <p><strong>The Allusionist</strong>. This is about language, and never fails to engage: clever, witty, distracting.</p> <p><strong>In the Dark: </strong><strong>Season 2</strong>. One for true-crimers. It\u2019s about a Mississippi man who faced trial for the same murders six times: a shocking miscarriage of justice case, doggedly and brilliantly told. (Season 1 is also excellent, but it\u2019s about child abduction and I found it quite distressing.) </p> <h2><strong>TV: Euan Ferguson</strong></h2> <p><strong>Detectorists</strong> (iPlayer/Amazon). Nothing happens. But this gentle tale of treasure-seekers, penned by Mackenzie Crook, who co-stars with Toby Jones (left), contains sublime depths and sharp humour amid the whimsy. Let Johnny Flynn\u2019s achingly soft music wash over you as you watch the meadows, old stone and butterflies of England, and wonder when it\u2019ll be safe to leave the house again to seek them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1311efac5ee1261fc48e57e51d766a0ffcecf927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1311efac5ee1261fc48e57e51d766a0ffcecf927/83_44_1046_628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Jones, left, and Mackenzie Crook in Detectorists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Jones, left, and Mackenzie Crook in Detectorists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Money Heist (Netflix)</strong>. It sounds much better in the original Spanish (<em>La Casa de Papel</em><em>,</em> or House of Paper) but it\u2019s still the best subtitled/dubbed thing around. Combines a series of ingenious thefts with, for once, truly three-dimensional characters. You\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll cry, you\u2019ll fall in love. And series 4 lands in April.</p> <h2><strong>Classical music: Fiona Maddocks</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mendelssohn: Octet (1825)</strong>. As exuberant and joyful as music gets; eight string players jostle for attention, chipping in like a witty dinner-table argument. Mendelssohn was only 16 when he wrote it.</p> <p><strong>Bach: Goldberg Variations (1741)</strong>. Sharpen your brain with one of the greatest works of all time, Bach\u2019s \u201caria\u201d and 30 variations supposedly written to amuse an insomniac count. Fit to refresh the most jaded spirits.</p> <p><strong>Wagner: The Ring (1876)</strong>. Wagner demands time, in the case of his epic four-part Ring cycle (<em>Das Rheingold</em>, <em>Die Walk\u00fcre</em>, <em>Siegfried</em>, <em>G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung</em>), about 15 hours. All human life is there, and gods, valkyries and dragons, too.</p> <h2><strong>Film: Simran Hans</strong></h2> <p><strong>An Elephant Sitting Still (2018)</strong> on BFI Player. In a time of global emergency, frivolity can feel inappropriate. That mood has me inclined towards something more sombre and reflective, like the late Chinese filmmaker Hu Bo\u2019s searching, rageful four-hour drama.</p> <p><strong>The Matrix (1999)</strong><strong> </strong>on Amazon Prime.

Most of the city\u2019s 7.5m people have been practising various forms of social distancing for months.</p> <p>Shops and restaurants are empty, already struggling in a recession after nine months of teetering on the brink of revolution.</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from last year when one in four people took to the streets in protest marches that stretched for kilometres, tightly packed between the towering highrises.</p> <p>In Hong Kong the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 illness, has infected about 130 people.</p> <p>It\u2019s an extraordinarily low number, given Hong Kong\u2019s proximity to mainland China, where the outbreak started. The city learned hard lessons during the Sars outbreak of 2003, when 299 Hong Kongers died.</p> <p>After a rocky start, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">the response to Covid-19 has been comprehensive</a> \u2013 schools and public attractions have been closed for months, and there are tight restrictions and laws on incoming travellers. Working from home is common, as is the enthusiasm for wearing masks, avoiding germs, and staying away from public gatherings.</p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">tentative talk that containment efforts are working</a> and because of that, there is also speculation over what this means for the protesters who spent months demonstrating against Hong Kong\u2019s authorities.</p> <p>The protests were sparked by an extradition bill which would have allowed suspected or accused criminals to be sent to mainland China. It went to the heart of Hong Kong concerns about the region\u2019s impending return to Beijing control in 2047, and current intrusions on their freedom and democracy.</p> <p>The bill was eventually withdrawn but not before the protests escalated and four new demands were made: true universal suffrage for Hong Kongers, an inquiry into police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters, and a retraction of the government\u2019s classification of protesters as \u201crioters\u201d.</p> <p>Only one of the movement\u2019s five demands have been met and members are still subject to waves of crackdowns.</p> <p>\u201cI think the government is gaining confidence that it is getting better control over the situation and is gradually prodding to see how far it can go with its crackdown,\u201d says Kong Tsung-gan, a writer, educator and activist who participated in the Umbrella movement.</p> <p>\u201cQuestion one is when and if people will feel that the coronavirus epidemic is under control. My sense is that the period of panic is over and confidence is growing.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Junker, honorary assistant professor with The Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s sociology department, says the protests \u201clost steam\u201d, due to both the virus seizing public attention and the movement reaching something of a peak in November, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/hong-kong-police-enter-campus-despite-pleas-from-protesters\">the traumatic university sieges</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">success of pro-democracy candidates at the local elections</a>.</p> <p>Even before then, protests had entered a new phase which turned away some of the public, evolving from mass public marches to \u201cwarrior style disobedience\u201d \u2013 short, sharp, unauthorised protests seeking to provoke police into overreactions which would drive support and media attention to the movement.</p> <p>A social media administrator of a popular protest-update account tells the Guardian they and friends remained committed to getting back out on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cTo us, of course protecting ourselves from the coronavirus is vital. But when it comes to seeing our home being destroyed by tyranny in every way possible, values we have been upholding are twisted and devastated, the virus seems too minor an issue to hinder us from guarding our home,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe will never back off. We are willing to do everything to fight against injustice and expose the truth even if our efforts seemed small and powerless.\u201d</p> <p>There is widespread acceptance that the fear of infection at mass gatherings has played a part in the diminished numbers.</p> <p>However it has also driven its own protests.</p> <p>The already low support and trust in the Hong Kong government and chief executive, Carrie Lam, were compounded by early missteps in responding to the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThe wrong and inefficient allocation of resources [eg masks] and slow border closures incited hatred in our community too,\u201d the administrator says, in reference to protests and strikes over Lam\u2019s reluctance to close borders or place restrictions on travellers from mainland China.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government had closed the border, we could have been able to stop the epidemic spreading in Hong Kong even more effectively.\u201d</p> <p>Kong says the policing of protests during the outbreak has been \u201cmore oppressive than ever\u201d.</p> <p>Alleged police brutality and mass arrests continue, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">three high-profile pro-democracy figures</a> on charges which observers said could apply to almost any protester, as well as hundreds of others at smaller events since.</p> <p>Last Sunday, police were filmed pepper-spraying journalists and bystanders at a demonstration against the establishment of a Covid-19 clinic in a high-density residential area. Just hours later they were again accused of excessive force in trying to shut down a vigil for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/hong-kong-protests-student-who-fell-from-parking-lot-during-demonstrations-dies\">a young man who died when he fell from a car park during a protest in November</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday the US State Department accused the Hong Kong government of an <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2020/03/12/hong-kong-govt-warns-foreign-interference-us-report-details-human-rights-concerns\">\u201capparent unwillingness to criticise the police force\u201d</a> or investigate alleged breaches of civil liberties. Hong Kong dismissed the report as foreign interference.</p> <p>Albert Ho, a solicitor and high-profile pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong, says it is clear there have been fewer confrontations and clashes since the virus, and authorities appear to be using the quiet time to round up key figures and organisers.</p> <p>\u201cI think they have come to a stage where they can say they have clamped down on these movements by the youngsters,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSo they have to do everything to deter the social organisers from continuing to organise marches and demonstrations on a big scale.\u201d</p> <p>Views differ within the movement on whether another organised, police-approved rally could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/18/hong-kong-huge-rally-china-condemns-us-gross-interference\">draw people out in their millions again</a>.</p> <p>Junker says it looks like the movement is now trying to re-energise, but there\u2019s \u201ca lot of fatalism at this point, saying nothing is working\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has all the resources and institutional levers to follow up in these retributional ways.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s hard to predict.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a weird kind of effervescent chemistry where [if] the right things converge and boom, you have two million people out on the street.\u201d</p> <p>Kong says: \u201cOne thing is certain \u2013 distrust and anger with the government has only grown, and people\u2019s views haven\u2019t changed: we\u2019re sick of an unrepresentative and unresponsive government. We want democracy. How that manifests itself is hard to say.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world\u2019s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? \u201cYou just take these magic beans and...\u201d Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. \u201cI realise it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but, still\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Back then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn\u2019t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn\u2019t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn\u2019t production, it\u2019s what happens next.</p> <p>We waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it\u2019s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced \u2013 approximately 1.3bn tonnes \u2013 is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it\u2019s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46b4dc549a0062ba01d7159c3bc59bfcc1b15d22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46b4dc549a0062ba01d7159c3bc59bfcc1b15d22/868_396_2542_4476/568.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it\u2019: James Rogers, CEO of Apeel.\" width=\"568\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it\u2019: James Rogers, CEO of Apeel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehakver/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: \u201cAll fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.\u201d That insight \u2013 so simple, so true \u2013 struck him like a lightning bolt. \u201cThe problem,\u201d he recalls, \u201cis you\u2019re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.\u201d Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science\u2019s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him.</p> <p>He decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn\u2019t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado\u2019s shelf life by two to three times.</p> <p>The company Rogers founded, <a href=\"https://apeelsciences.com/\" title=\"\">Apeel Sciences</a>, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight \u2013 the big switch in his interests and research. \u201cSweetie,\u201d she said to him. \u201cThat sounds really nice. But you don\u2019t know anything about fruit and vegetables.\u201d</p> <p>Apeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company\u2019s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose \u2013 building prototypes for entry into the human body \u2013 to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit\u2019s skin.</p> <p>\u201cThis room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,\u201d says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. \u201cIt\u2019s still being set up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still putting wires into things.\u201d Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel\u2019s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'This is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet'</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Costanza</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel\u2019s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce.</p> <p>Costanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel\u2019s spray is in the mix. It\u2019s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. \u201cImagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,\u201d Costanza says. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. \u201cThis is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one\u2019s really able to replicate it \u2013 we don\u2019t really have competition.\u201d</p> <p>They do, really. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hazeltechnologies.com/\" title=\"\">Hazel Technologies</a>, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food\u2019s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called <a href=\"https://www.itsfresh.com/\" title=\"\">It\u2019s Fresh</a>, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from <a href=\"https://www.agrofresh.com/\" title=\"\">AgroFresh</a>, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look.</p> <p>There\u2019s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30048d4d9dd2bb104aa8703e22f5e9c230bed203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30048d4d9dd2bb104aa8703e22f5e9c230bed203/0_288_6516_3910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelf life: Apeel\u2019s HQ in California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelf life: Apeel\u2019s HQ in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehak/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number \u2013 $218bn \u2013 is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste.</p> <p>People have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they\u2019ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant.</p> <p>What sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology \u2013 the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company\u2019s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state\u2019s largest organic apple growers.</p> <p>Greathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it\u2019s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant \u2013 much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards \u2013 but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed.</p> <p>We arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team \u2013 the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable\u2019s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel\u2019s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years.</p> <p>Now we\u2019re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room.</p> <p>Finally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like moisturiser,\u201d Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, \u201cMaybe I can shave with this.\u201d In fact, she adds, \u201cThe reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss \u2013 same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>James Rogers, the CEO,<em><strong> </strong></em>has an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. \u201cThe joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,\u201d he says. But: \u201cWhen you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,\u201d because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. \u201cI know it\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s just my favourite,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they go bad so quickly.\u201d The company is a few years into R&amp;D on that one. \u201cWhen I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\u2019s when I know we\u2019ll have made it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"164cdd5714c278448bce7ed10019b119a8321f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/164cdd5714c278448bce7ed10019b119a8321f6b/169_0_4175_5529/755.jpg\" alt=\"Building the future: inside the lab at the Apeel.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Building the future: inside the lab at the Apeel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Chehak/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it\u2019s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter?</p> <p>Within every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel\u2019s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because \u2013 yes \u2013 while it\u2019s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up.</p> <p>Where things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn\u2019t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel \u2013 stay firm and unripe quite as long \u2013 like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn\u2019t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it\u2019s essential for our future food security.</p> <p>Just up the road from Apeel\u2019s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it\u2019s known as a caviar lime. The farm\u2019s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they\u2019ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what\u2019s working, and what\u2019s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer\u2019s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets.</p> <p>The caviar limes weren\u2019t Rogers\u2019 idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses. The weird limes were actually the very first product Apeel brought to the market. \u201cThank God no one listened to me on that one,\u201d he says, smiling, thinking back on it. It taught him another important lesson, one he carries forward now. \u201cThe shorter the shelf life, the bigger the opportunity.\u201d</p>",

With doubt surrounding the continuation of the league, the Phoenix are proposing to spend at least six-straight weeks in Australia in pursuit of a maiden title.</p> <p>Wellington will host Melbourne Victory on Sunday at Sky Stadium, hours before travel restrictions take effect at midnight on both sides of the Tasman. Phoenix general manager David Dome said his third-placed team had all but bought into playing out their campaign on Australian soil under extraordinary circumstances. They couldn\u2019t play for 14 days while undergoing mandatory isolation, and then would have an intense run of games, probably in empty stadiums.</p> <p>Wellington would be unable to play road games scheduled next week, against Sydney FC on Wednesday and Newcastle on Sunday. They would bank on FFA rescheduling both games, while two matches - which were to have been played in Wellington in April - would need to be relocated to Australia.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to capitulate and not play out. We had to play out; we had to do our best to get into the finals series,\u201d Dome said. \u201cThe disappointing thing for us is that the fans won\u2019t be there to enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>Dome said the team would likely self-isolate in central Sydney accommodation and emerge only for controlled training sessions. Dome said players would have the choice to commit to a full Australian stay of at least six weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to force players to go.

  "<p>Confronted by the coronavirus menace, politicians and governments around the world are thrashing about wildly, trying to decide what to do for the best. \u201cPolitics isn\u2019t working\u201d is a common refrain among disaffected citizens in the modern era. But at this uniquely stressful moment, it really does appear to be true. While they mean well, most leaders haven\u2019t got a clue.</p> <p>The dawning realisation that national politicians cannot be relied upon to do the right or sensible thing, whatever that may turn out to be, has serious long-term implications for democracy and the principle of democratic consent. If the crisis is protracted, a catastrophic loss of confidence in the way the pandemic is managed could lead to unpredictable social disruption across many countries.</p> <p>As is the case with victims of the disease, underlying conditions and vulnerabilities in politics too are being painfully exposed.</p> <p>It\u2019s becoming clear, for example, that healthcare systems, even in wealthy countries such as the US, are chronically under-resourced and unprepared. Confusion reigns widely, fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\" title=\"\">conflicting official advice in different countries </a>about public gatherings, travel, and self-isolation.</p> <p>Some leaders may emerge with their reputations enhanced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\" title=\"\">For others, the opposite holds true. </a>The virus has already made fools of the world\u2019s two most powerful men. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has faced unprecedented criticism over his handling of the first recorded outbreak in Wuhan. He initially steered well clear of the problem \u2013 an early example of social distancing.</p> <p>But Xi has struggled since to contain the political and human fallout. The death from Covid-19 of Li Wenliang, a young doctor who sounded the alarm in Wuhan in December but was gagged by Communist party officials, sparked an online revolt. Xi finally ventured to the city last week, lavishing praise on its beleaguered residents in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/asia/coronavirus-china-xi-jinping.html\" title=\"\">what almost sounded like an apology</a>.</p> <p>Predictably, Donald Trump\u2019s reaction has been all about him. Among other inanities, he suggested the pandemic was a fake Democrat plot to harm his re-election chances. Ignoring the science and minimising the threat, he claimed his Mexican border wall had somehow immunised Americans, and likened the \u201cforeign virus\u201d to an alien invasion. It\u2019s embarrassingly obvious Trump is not up to the job.</p> <p>Both Trump and Xi could pay a heavy price. The US leader may have survived impeachment, but come November many voters will not forget or forgive this failure of leadership in a crisis. Xi\u2019s aura of paternal infallibility has shattered. Trust has gone. To restore his grip, it is suggested, he may resort to more intrusive social controls, surveillance and censorship. Yet increased repression could prompt a career-ending backlash.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s knee-jerk reaction in pulling up the drawbridge and blaming others is not unique. Fear not facts has led European leaders such as Austria\u2019s Sebastian Kurz to act alone, hastily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-several-eu-states-ban-mass-events-after-italian-lockdown\" title=\"\">closing borders</a> and barring people from specific countries. These divisions recall Europe\u2019s chaotic response to the 2015 migrant crisis when governments failed to agree a collective approach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b320fb642e353579aad3eef59b20532e1e147abd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b320fb642e353579aad3eef59b20532e1e147abd/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Kurz of Austria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Acting alone\u2019: Sebastian Kurz of Austria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisi Niesner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the European Union, the pandemic is turning into a political nightmare. The commission in Brussels is struggling to keep up, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu/eu-to-give-states-spending-leeway-to-tackle-virus-fallout-on-economy-idUSKBN21016P\" title=\"\">relaxing rules</a> on deficit spending that have already been broken. Piecemeal, national-level policy-making is a gift to Eurosceptics, not least rightwing populists keen to exploit splits, and could have lasting consequences for European cohesion. Public confidence may take a big hit.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt politicians face genuine dilemmas. In Italy, Europe\u2019s worst-affected state, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was initially attacked for doing too much, by ordering widespread testing in Lombardy, and subsequently for doing too little. What is certain is that Italy has received little help from the rest of Europe \u2013 the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/italy-criticises-eu-being-slow-help-coronavirus-epidemic\" title=\"\">bitter complaint</a> last week.</p> <p>Now that Italy is in total lockdown, it is being studied like a laboratory guinea pig. Boris Johnson, aware, like other leaders, that his reputation is at stake, treads a fine line between similarly drastic measures and \u201ckeep calm and carry on\u201d stoicism. If it all goes wrong, his defence will be that he followed medical advice. Suddenly, experts are back on top in Britain \u2013 if only as potential fall guys.</p> <p>Many look for leadership to Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s unflappable chancellor and Europe\u2019s most respected politician. Yet her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/europe/coronavirus-merkel-germany.html\" title=\"\">assessment</a> last week, that Covid-19 would infect two out of three Germans and there was not a lot governments could do about it, was less than reassuring.</p> <p>Merkel called for \u201csolidarity, common sense and open-heartedness\u201d. But her emphasis on Europe-wide cooperation carried a whiff of hypocrisy. Germany and France have limited exports of protective masks and equipment to safeguard domestic supply \u2013 hardly an act of solidarity with the neighbours. Nor is Berlin rushing to bail out floundering eurozone partners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Looked at globally, the politicians\u2019 performance to date has been mostly unimpressive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The parallel absence of an effective, joined-up global strategy is also casting multilateral institutions in an unflattering light. The World Health Organization, the lead UN agency that might be expected to wield decisive influence, appears strangely diffident at times \u2013 fearful, perhaps, of provoking a political backlash from heavy-hitters such as China.</p> <p>Global financial institutions are not doing any better. The IMF has <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/04/sp030420-imf-makes-available-50-billion-to-help-address-coronavirus\" title=\"\">thrown $50bn</a> at the problem. Interest rates have been randomly cut and emergency budgets announced. But compared with the 2008 financial crisis, when governments and central banks collaborated to stave off a banking collapse, international coordination to calm markets and reduce risk is lacking. Virus-related economic damage may thus be worse, and longer lasting, than might have been the case.</p> <p>Despite all the angst, the WHO\u2019s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, complained about \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by politicians \u2013 and it seems many governments remain in denial. That may be due to vanity (in the case of North Korea\u2019s defiantly face-mask-free Kim Jong-un) or incapacity (in the case of poorer countries). Iran repeatedly denied it had a problem, until its leaders started dying. Now it is reportedly digging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-iran-mass-graves-qom\" title=\"\">mass graves</a>.</p> <p>Unscrupulous politicians stand accused of using the pandemic as cover for furtive power-grabs. The timing of last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/saudi-arabia-releases-images-king-salman-amid-purge-royals\" title=\"\">high-level purge</a> by Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and a constitutional coup by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, may be coincidental. Or maybe not.</p> <p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is manoeuvring to stay on as prime minister, despite his corruption trial and his lack of a parliamentary majority, in the face of what he now deems an exceptional national threat. It\u2019s conceivable Trump could use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/us-launch-airstrike-iraq-retaliation-rocket-attack-killed-three-britain\" title=\"\">new clashes</a> with militia in Iraq to revive his Iran vendetta \u2013 and distract attention from his viral incompetence.</p> <p>The crisis also raises the danger of governments taking so-called temporary emergency powers and imposing sweeping, illiberal constraints on citizens, journalists and social media that subsequently become permanent. That\u2019s what happened after the 9/11 convulsion, when the US and allies decided to largely ignore international human rights protections in the name of fighting terrorism.</p> <p>Looked at globally, the politicians\u2019 performance to date has been mostly unimpressive. Yet the fundamental question raised by the pandemic is not one solely for them. It concerns each individual, community, and nation. Will the challenges posed by the virus be allowed to drive us further apart \u2013 or used to help bring us closer together? The answer hangs in the balance. It could go either way.</p>",

She is also heavily critical of the way the Jersey authorities and its financial services industry have investigated her claims.</p> <p>Dick vigorously disputes his daughter\u2019s allegations. He regards her and her husband as \u201cwholly unreliable\u201d and untrustworthy, citing, among other things, both criticism she received in a Jersey court and the number of court proceedings in which the couple are involved in the US. </p> <p>Dick\u2019s lawyers also say his daughter does not have the authority to bring the case against her father as the company bringing the action is in receivership, and therefore litigation should be controlled by the receiver.</p> <p>They point out that none of the trusts\u2019 other beneficiaries, including her own brother, John Dick II, share her views. The entire Dick family, not just Tanya, has been the victim of an audacious fraud, they say.</p> <p>Lawyers for Dick-Stock deny allegations that she is untrustworthy and insist she is entitled to bring a separate personal claim against her father.</p> <p>A spokesman for Dick-Stock said the case was due to be heard on 6 July.</p> <p>This may seem just a story about a wealthy family\u2019s spectacular implosion in a British Crown Dependency that prizes its independence from the mainland: think <em>Bergerac</em> meets <em>Succession</em>. But the father-daughter battle which, until now, has gone largely unreported, affords a rare glimpse of how the secretive offshore trust system, set up to protect assets from the taxman, can be exploited for fraudulent purposes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8930118a4f6512f4e2a0db5fa27d8693874d196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8930118a4f6512f4e2a0db5fa27d8693874d196/0_90_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanya Dick-Stock and Darrin Stock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanya Dick-Stock and Darrin Stock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, while there is now almost nothing upon which Dick and his daughter do agree, both believe that a massive fraud has been perpetrated in Jersey, the scale of which has yet to be truly appreciated. Some view the row as a wake-up call for the island.</p> <p>Lurking in the shadows, out of sight of regulators and law enforcement, the offshore trust system appears ripe for manipulation, with beneficiaries often unaware of how their assets are being used. Anonymous trusts that are trustees of other trusts based in different tax havens shuffle money and assets around like cards, using them as security for loans.</p> <p>Frank Casey, the financial analyst who blew the whistle on the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/madoff/interviews/casey.html\" title=\"\">Bernie Madoff scandal</a>, drew comparisons between the conditions under which the disgraced financier was able to operate his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/16/ponzi-madoff-business-scams\" title=\"\">ponzi scheme</a> and the way the system functions in tax havens around the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe similarities are really striking,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe basic elements are a lack of transparency and no reportability.\u201d</p> <p>This in turn raises an important question: if trusts\u2019 beneficiaries are not always aware of what is happening to their assets, what hope is there for external regulators and law enforcement agencies trying to stop them being used to launder money for kleptocrats, mobsters and drug cartels?</p> <p>The clearest indication that there was trouble in paradise came last month when St John\u2019s Manor was sold after languishing for two years on the market, the asking price having been <a href=\"https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2020/02/18/st-johns-manor-sold-after-two-years-on-the-market/\" title=\"\">slashed from \u00a322m to a reported \u00a317.5m</a>.</p> <p>The estate agent\u2019s sales brochure describes the 11,000 sq ft pile, which dates back to the 14th century, as having \u201cmagnificent\u201d landscaped grounds, a \u201cstunning\u201d Japanese water garden, stables, a swimming pool, a squash court and a falconry. It also has a chapel where Tanya and Darrin were married and underneath which Dick intends to be buried.</p> <p>Dick-Stock alleges that, down the years, Dick family trusts have had claims over St John\u2019s Manor as well as other properties including flats in St Petersburg, Jersey and Mayfair, a farm, a fleet of luxury cars and even a vintage doll collection.</p> <p>She also claims to have seen documents that show the trusts once owned a Botticelli painting worth an estimated $20m, a claim categorically denied by her father.</p> <p>But it is the fabulous house that is at the centre of the row. Both father and daughter agree that St John\u2019s Manor was used to fraudulently secure a \u00a36.5m loan from HSBC Jersey. It is claimed that a trustee of the Dick family trusts, an obscure offshore services company called PanTrust, played a key role in the alleged fraud before misappropriating the HSBC loan.</p> <p>If true, PanTrust\u2019s actions run counter to everything a trustee \u2013 a person or body who has a duty to protect a trust\u2019s assets \u2013 is supposed to do, in this case represent the interests of the entire Dick family.</p> <h2>The Panama connection and the shady financial adviser<br><br></h2> <p>But then PanTrust is not your average trustee. The company featured prominently in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>, the massive leak of confidential documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca that revealed how hundreds of wealthy individuals and companies had parked their money offshore, in some cases illegally.</p> <p>Banned from operating by the Panamanian regulator in February 2015, PanTrust was found to have set up a complex ponzi scheme in which scores of fake accounts were paying fictitious rates of interest with the results that scores of trusts were fleeced of millions of pounds.</p> <p>The Panamanian regulator also ruled that the firm had failed in its duty to prevent money-laundering and terrorist financing. To this day it has the distinction of being the only company in Panama to ever lose its trust licence.</p> <p>PanTrust was run by a man called Richard Wigley, who managed Dick\u2019s financial affairs for 30 years until his fraudulent acts were discovered. And it is the relationship between the two men that is now at the centre of the dispute between father and daughter. Was Wigley acting independently of Dick or, as his daughter insists, on his behalf?</p> <p>A Royal Court of Jersey judgment refers to a memo prepared by Wigley which claimed that Dick would receive a share of PanTrust\u2019s income. But Dick\u2019s representatives insist that he has never received an income from PanTrust. They say that it was Dick who drew PanTrust to the attention of the Panamanian regulator and that Wigley abused his position and defrauded the Dick family over three decades.</p> <p>It was during court proceedings to have him removed as a trustee that Wigley\u2019s lawyers made a bombshell admission. They acknowledged that he had created 24 fraudulent loans worth $30m involving a series of trusts set up for the Dick family.</p> <p>Then events took an even more extraordinary turn.</p> <p>According to Dick-Stock\u2019s legal action against her father, filed in 2018 in the district court, Denver County, Colorado, where one of the family trusts was established, it was only after Wigley had been removed as a trustee that she claims she discovered \u201cJohn W Dick was not a victim of \u2026 Wigley, but instead a confederate\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she suspected her father it was like <em>Friday the 13th</em>, when the mask slips and you find out who Jason really is,\u201d Stock said.</p> <p>To say Dick denies the claim would be a serious understatement. A representative said: \u201cJohn Dick and his family dispute the entirety of Tanya\u2019s alternative history.\u201d</p> <p>Last June, the Dick-Stocks wrote to HSBC Jersey, informing it that the Jersey police and the US authorities had been alerted to allegations that the loan against St John\u2019s Manor had been secured fraudulently. Dick\u2019s representatives say they are not aware of any investigations. A spokeswoman for HSBC Jersey said: \u201cWe can\u2019t comment due to client confidentiality.\u201d</p> <p>A team of financial experts hired by Dick-Stock are examining whether other trusts linked to PanTrust \u2013 and two related trust companies \u2013 have also been plundered. There are claims that hundreds of millions of pounds may have been looted without the trust beneficiaries being aware of what had happened.</p> <h2>Question marks over the whistleblowers<br><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f20cb1552381b17c19e53aae9bd8dec9e2208880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f20cb1552381b17c19e53aae9bd8dec9e2208880/0_167_580_348/500.jpg\" alt=\"John W.

Dick with his wife Mickey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jersey Evening Post</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is for this reason that Dick-Stock and her husband present themselves as whistleblowers. They have approached the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) and the island\u2019s financial crime unit, the JFCU, seeking their help in securing an investigation into the HSBC loan and their wider allegations of fraud, misappropriation and corruption. They claim to have handed over to the island\u2019s authorities and its police force thousands of pages of documents relating to hundreds of offshore trusts, which would make explosive reading, should they ever become public.</p> <p>But some are sceptical about their allegations and the sceptics have evidence to back their claims. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the couple, including for unpaid debts. They have also fallen out with their original lawyers and other members of the extended Dick family.</p> <p>Dick-Stock\u2019s credibility as a witness was also heavily criticised in related proceedings brought in the Royal Court of Jersey. The court said, among other things, the evidence she gave was \u201cat odds with what she has said on oath to other courts in other places and she has frequently changed her case and evidence\u201d. It concluded \u201cwe did not find Tanya\u2019s evidence reliable nor did we find reliable evidence called on her behalf.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the JFSC confirmed that it was aware of the couple\u2019s allegations and referred to the judgment above which raises serious questions about Dick-Stock\u2019s credibility and that of her claim as a whole.</p> <p>The JFSC spokeswoman said: \u201cIt is important to note that our role, as the regulator, is not to investigate allegations of fraud, as fraud is a criminal offence.\u201d</p> <h2>Compendium: Miami, money laundering and a mafia link<br><br></h2> <p>It\u2019s not the first time Dick has found himself up against a family member in a lengthy court case.</p> <p>In the early 90s, while embroiled in divorce proceedings with his second wife, Elizabeth, he was reportedly held in a Jersey prison for 22 days until her alimony payments were resolved. However, in reality he ended up living under house arrest in his mansion for health reasons.</p> <p>The divorce, which was notable for the fact that it took seven years to conclude \u2013 two years more than the marriage lasted \u2013 shone light on a secretive Jersey-based trust called Compendium which, it transpired, was the trustee of a John Dick trust.</p> <p>Compendium, the US authorities discovered, had been used by a Miami-based lawyer, Lawrence Freeman, who was indicted for laundering money for the mafia and drug runners. At the time, the court heard suggestions that the Dick family fortune was worth an estimated $1.2bn, a figure Dick\u2019s representatives now describe as \u201cwildly inaccurate\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s like launching nuclear bombs. No one will win\u2019<br><br></h2> <p>A copy of the divorce settlement also confirmed that the Dicks listed a Jersey-based company, Sandsend Financial Services, among the assets in which they had a shared financial interest. The company, which was dissolved in 1999, was accused of receiving millions of dollars plundered from US savings and loan firms in the 1980s. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that it had received $7m of funds from a looted savings association called Vision Banc \u201cfor no apparent reason\u201d.</p> <p>There is no suggestion, nor was there any suggestion at the time, that Dick knew Sandsend or Compendium were being used for illegal purposes. But now, almost 30 years after his high-profile divorce garnered headlines, Dick once again finds himself in the spotlight.</p> <p>Ultimately the family feud, a modern-day Jarndyce v Jarndyce, may end in mutually assured destruction, just as it does in <em>Bleak House</em>, with only the lawyers celebrating.</p> <p>Dick\u2019s son, John Dick II, foresaw this possibility in a 2017 email he sent himself as a memo. While praising his sister for her \u201cmiraculous efforts\u201d in trying to unpick the Dick family\u2019s tortuous financial problems, he warned \u201cboth parties have the fiscal and mental fortitude to wage a war against each other but it would be the equivalent of launching nuclear bombs in which case neither party would win. The fallout would destroy what\u2019s left of the assets as well as greatly impact the lives of everyone around them\u201d.</p> <p>Not to mention Jersey\u2019s gilt-edged reputation for protecting the financial interests of the rich and powerful.</p> <p>Too bad.</p>",
  "<p>A pandemic is testing global leadership and its capacity to rise to the challenge of \u201cthe worst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. To some surprise, the man who said that is addressing the emergency in a more mature fashion than many anticipated when it first began to unfold. Boris Johnson has abandoned the \u201cinvisible man\u201d act for which I mocked him a fortnight ago and located the serious side of his character. The pantomime Johnson has been retired from public spectacle and replaced with the sombre Johnson we now see at news conferences. At his most recent, he struck an appropriately sober tone when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\" title=\"\">he warned</a>: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d, words prime ministers usually don\u2019t expect to utter outside wartime. Candour, not a quality always associated with this prime minister, is essential. Fear, panic and conspiracy theories are fomented when people suspect that their leaders are not telling them the truth. The Opinium poll that we publish today suggests that more people than not have confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but the margin is not a very solid one.</p> <p>The prime minister has been flattered by comparison with Donald Trump. His multiple flaws are being pitilessly highlighted by a crisis that a man who does not believe in scientific evidence or international cooperation is hopelessly ill-equipped to handle. Variously dismissing the coronavirus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/trump-calls-coronavirus-outbreak-a-hoax-and-links-it-to-immigration-at-rally\" title=\"\">a hoax</a>\u201d cooked up by his opponents to deny him re-election or no worse than the flu, he has swung from juvenile denialism to blaming it on foreigners and Democrats. Then he suddenly announced travel bans and declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\" title=\"\">\u201cnational emergency\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The ineffable American president is the quintessential example of a stretch of world history in which populist blowhards have prospered at the ballot box by stoking division, promoting polarisation, scorning expertise and championing ignorance. This crisis, one that now touches every continent on Earth apart from Antarctica, demands leaders who are willing to listen to professional advice, capable of fostering national cohesion at a time of emergency, and skilled at seeking international cooperation. The luckier countries will be those blessed with competent, honest and intelligent leadership. One of the possible positives to come out of this crisis \u2013 I put it no higher than possible at this stage \u2013 is that it will decrease the public appetite for bombastic charlatans and increase demand for serious leaders who respect expertise. If it does, that will be bad for populist hucksters more generally.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service isn't overwhelmed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mr Johnson has often aped Trumpian populism when he has seen political advantage in doing so, but he is smart enough to grasp that something more grown up is now required. People present at Cobra meetings and other decision-making moments generally report being impressed by the way he conducts himself. I asked one witness, who is not an instinctive cheerleader for this prime minister, how they thought he was doing. The reply came: \u201cPretty well. He is listening intently to the science.\u201d In this respect, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser and a fervent admirer of science, is acting as a positive influence on the prime minister, rather than a baleful one. Whenever he addresses the country from the state dining room, he has come flanked by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Thrust into the spotlight in a way neither man can have anticipated, they have both impressed with the clear and calm way they have talked to the nation. They can explain the reasoning for the strategy and how it is evolving with much more credibility than any politician. The polls tell us they will be much more likely to be believed. The government\u2019s senior scientists also serve as the prime minister\u2019s human shields against accusations that he is acting out of ideological fixations or for partisan advantage. No wonder he is clinging to them.</p> <p>The past few days have brought both more clarity and more controversy about their strategy. There is still consensus around one key component \u2013 to try to spread out the rate of infection: \u201cflattening the peak\u201d. The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service is not overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care. In his budget, an event all but eclipsed by the crisis, Rishi Sunak promised the NHS \u201cwhatever it takes\u2026 millions or billions\u201d to tackle the coronavirus, but you can\u2019t spend that money overnight. The NHS needs to increase its intensive care capacity, but that requires more staff, more equipment and more time. The crisis in Italy, whose leadership was slow to realise that they had a problem and who have now imposed an almost total lockdown of the entire country, has shocked ministers. It is widely assumed that Britain is about four weeks behind Italy in terms of infection, though that doesn\u2019t mean we have to end up in the same grisly place.</p> <p>There is not consensus, but mounting controversy, about another critical element of the government\u2019s strategy. Britain has adopted a strikingly different approach to the many other countries that are implementing faster and more sweeping programmes to curtail human contact. These include Ireland, France and Belgium, all close neighbours.</p> <p>That has fuelled the rising pressure on the prime minister to take much more stringent steps here. The pressure is coming both from Labour and from within the government\u2019s own ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has been the loudest voice asking why we are not seeking to emulate Asian states, such as Singapore and South Korea, that seem to have had some success in snuffing out the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The government is moving towards banning sports fixtures and other mass gatherings, but is still resistant to a more comprehensive shutdown. The scientific reasoning behind Britain\u2019s approach is that more draconian steps won\u2019t make that much difference at this stage, are not sustainable over the longer term, and may well turn out to be counterproductive because it will lead to a second wave of infections when restrictions are eased \u2013 possibly in winter, when the NHS is most stretched.</p> <p>Sir Patrick has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">lucidly explained</a> what the strategy is designed to achieve. It expects those on whom the disease has mild effects, the great majority, to be gradually exposed to the virus, building up \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Over time, this will lower the risk of infection for the vulnerable. While this is going on, they will do what they can to protect those for whom the coronavirus could be fatal. Perhaps the most important advice given by the government last week was the simplest. That was to tell people who have flu-type symptoms, however slight, that they should stay at home for seven days. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial,\u201d says one of those involved in this decision. \u201cThat is a significant amount of social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with an invisible menace with extremely visible impacts, a clamour for instant and total shutdowns is understandable. But it comes accompanied by the danger that kneejerk responses by frantic governments can end up doing more harm than good. One scientist drew my attention to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/japan-lifts-evacuation-order-futaba-town-fukushima-disaster\" title=\"\">Fukushima</a> nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011. Later studies found that around 20 people died from radiation. Many more, about a thousand, lost their lives as a result of the decision to evacuate: casualties of car crashes, heart attacks and other medical emergencies triggered by trying to clear the area in a rush. Sometimes the obvious reaction to a crisis will not be the correct one.</p> <p>Many lives depend on getting this right. The government can\u2019t be blamed for the virus, but there will be fierce scrutiny of its responses. There are risks with the strategy it has adopted \u2013 and huge ones for the reputation of Mr Johnson if the public concludes that his handling of the crisis led to avoidable deaths. There are hazards, too, with the alternative approaches. Various models for tackling the pandemic are now being live trialled around the world by governments of many different complexions and levels of competence. It will likely be a year or so before we will gain an understanding of which of the plans was the smartest. My conversations have convinced me that the British approach is rooted in scientific logic and a careful calibration of the different risks. I\u2019m no epidemiologist so I won\u2019t pretend to be a qualified judge of whether they are doing the right thing. I am persuaded that they are sincerely endeavouring to do the right thing.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>The selfish gene. The Big Bang. The greenhouse effect. Metaphors are at the heart of scientific thinking. They provide the means for both scientists and non-scientists to understand, think through and talk about abstract ideas in terms of more familiar objects or phenomena.</p> <p>But if metaphors can illuminate, they can also constrain. In his new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-idea-of-the-brain-9781781255896.html\" title=\"\"><em>The </em><em>Idea of the Brain</em></a>, zoologist and historian Matthew Cobb tells the story of how scientists and philosophers have tried to understand the brain and how it works. In every age, Cobb shows, people have thought about the brain largely in terms of metaphors, drawn usually from the most exciting technology of the day, whether clocks or telephone exchanges or the contemporary obsession with computers. The brain, Cobb observes, \u201cis more like a computer than like a clock\u201d, but \u201ceven the simplest animal brain is not a computer like anything we have built, nor one we can yet envisage\u201d.</p> <p>Metaphors allow \u201cinsight and discovery\u201d but are \u201cinevitably partial\u201d and \u201cthere will come a point when the understanding they allow will be outweighed by the limits they impose\u201d. We may, Cobb suggests, be at that point in picturing the brain as a computer.</p> <p>The paradox of neuroscience today is that we possess an unprecedented amount of data about the brain but barely a glimmer of a theory to explain how it works. Indeed, as the French neuroscientist Yves Fr\u00e9gnac has put it, making ample use of metaphor, it can feel as if \u201cwe are drowning in a flood of information\u201d and that \u201call sense of global understanding [of brain function] is in acute danger of being washed away\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just in science that metaphors are significant in shaping the ways in which we think. In 1980, the linguist George Lakoff and philosopher Mark Johnson set off the modern debate on this issue with their seminal work, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Metaphors-We-Live-George-Lakoff/dp/0226468372/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\" title=\"\"><em>Metaphors We Live By</em></a>. Metaphors, they argued, are not linguistic flourishes but the fundamental building blocks of thought. We don\u2019t simply talk or write with metaphors, we also think with them.</p> <p>It\u2019s a view fiercely contested by other psychologists and linguists. But even critics don\u2019t deny the significance of metaphors. There is an episode of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> in which the Starship Enterprise encounters an alien race called the Tamarians who speak only in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/\" title=\"\">metaphors and allegories</a>. The Earthlings find it very difficult to communicate. Humans are not Tamarians. Nevertheless, there are few areas of life in which metaphoric use is not deeply embedded. Some studies suggest that one word in every 25 we use is a metaphor. And there is much evidence that the choice of metaphor can shape the way we perceive the world and act upon it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social and political discusses are steeped in metaphors from 'trickle-down economics' to the 'red wall'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a series of experiments, two psychologists, Paul Thibodeau and Lera Boroditsky, gave participants one of two reports about crime in the <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016782\" title=\"\">fictional city of Addison</a>. The reports were identical, except that in one crime was described as a \u201cwild beast preying on the city\u201d and in the other as a \u201cvirus infecting the city\u201d. When asked for solutions, those who read the first report suggested mostly tougher law enforcement and punishments, while those presented with the second were more willing to propose social reforms such as economic or healthcare improvements. Participants who identified as Republicans were 8-9% more likely to favour harsher punishment than Democrats. But the metaphor used made a difference twice as large \u2013 18-22%. Metaphors, Thibodeau and Boroditsky observe, \u201chave profound influences on how we conceptualise and act with respect to important societal issues\u201d.</p> <p>Social and political discussions are steeped in metaphors from \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d to the \u201cred wall\u201d. They help frame the issues, and hence our responses, too. When politicians compare the national economy to a household budget, they are pushing us to think in particular ways about national debt or policies of austerity. Similarly, when politicians talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/30/david-cameron-migrant-swarm-language-condemned\" title=\"\">\u201cswarms\u201d of migrants </a>or describe countries as \u201cshields\u201d against them, the language aims to elicit particular public responses. The coronavirus is both a physical threat and a metaphor for everything from the failures of globalisation to the menace of foreigners.</p> <p>The role that metaphors play in science and politics is subtly different. Many scientists accept that metaphors can be limiting, but insist, too, that they are an essential tool for thinking. In political and social debates, metaphors are primarily ways of framing issues, and of shaping the ways in which people think about them.</p> <p>Metaphors can expand our vision and provide insights denied to more literal thinking. But, whether in science or in politics, we need to pay greater attention to the metaphors we wield.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

Yet despite the slew of professional organizations taking action to protect public health and safety, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, has no intention of deviating from its upcoming schedule and has instead decided to move some of its shows to Las Vegas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/ufc-fight-night-brasilia-coronavirus\">UFC holds fight card in Brasilia amid coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the coronavirus \u2013 officially known as Covid-19 \u2013 spreads across the United States, a growing number of states have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak, which allows states the authority to establish curfews, shut down public spaces, and a host of other restrictions. Among those states are Oregon, Ohio and New York, where the UFC was scheduled to hold events over the next few weeks. The organization has since <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/12/21177822/ufc-coronavirus-response-london-card-not-cancelled-las-vegas-apex-mma-news\">announced</a> that those shows (28 March in Columbus and 11 April in Portland) have been moved to the UFC\u2019s Apex facility in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art arena space that sits adjacent to the UFC\u2019s headquarters, and will go ahead without fans.</p> <p>The UFC also revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/ufc-fight-night-brasilia-coronavirus\">Saturday\u2019s show in Brasilia</a>, where Charles Oliveira submitted Kevin Lee by guillotine choke in the main event, would be limited to staff and personnel after the city\u2019s governor declared a ban on large gatherings. However, it appears that the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission \u2013 the regulatory body responsible for fighter safety \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guicruzzz/status/1238201943916494852?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1238201943916494852&amp;ref_url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/13/21177823/commission-watch-coronavirus-concerns-need-to-be-addressed-in-brazil-ufc-mma\">was not intending on testing fighters for COVID-19</a>, a troubling development given the contagious and unpredictable nature of the virus.</p> <p>Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), which is a virus related to Sars. The infection spreads via respiratory droplets from airways like coughing or sneezing, while the onset of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and headache is between two and 14 days. However, given that the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days (averaging five to six days), it is possible for asymptomatic individuals to spread the virus, which makes it highly contagious and difficult to control.</p> <p>As of Saturday, there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases resulting in about 5,800 deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6140f45877b55953ff37e5a1599b5a2a13f820\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6140f45877b55953ff37e5a1599b5a2a13f820/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UFC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UFC staged a full card on Saturday at the Nilson Nelson Gymnasium in Brazil\u2019s capital city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buda Mendes/Zuffa LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Due to the infectious nature of the virus, global health organizations including the WHO have published preventative measures to reduce the chance of spreading the infection in locations with outbreaks. These include practicing respiratory hygiene, social distancing and staying away from large-scale public gatherings. While sports organizations have interpreted this as an ethical obligation to suspend their seasons and cancel events, the UFC has no intention of canceling any upcoming shows.</p> <p>\u201cI talked to the president and the vice president about this, and they\u2019re taking this very serious,\u201d UFC president Dana White said during an appearance on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Be cautious, be careful, but live your life and stop panicking.\u2019 Everybody is panicking, and instead of panicking, we\u2019re actually getting out there and working with doctors and health officials and the government to figure out how to keep the sport safe and continue to put on events.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDXlSPu7Vy8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YDXlSPu7Vy8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>White added that the UFC plans to screen incoming fans with \u201cinfrared technology\u201d that would detect spikes in body temperatures such as those caused by fever. However, this policy is remarkably shortsighted given that Covid-19 can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which means that those infected do not even have to show symptoms or feel unwell to be contagious to those around them. The UFC president also cited Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-president-trump-criticized-over-incompetent-response-to-coronavirus/\">heavily criticized</a> for the lack of available testing compared to other industrialized countries around the world. Given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/16/ufc-dana-white-donald-trump-relationship\">longstanding friendship between Trump and White</a>, it comes as little surprise that the UFC brass is basing its reaction entirely on the president\u2019s blundered response to the outbreak.</p> <p>It should be noted that several other MMA promotions have already taken steps to cancel upcoming shows. Euro-African promotion ARES FC postponed an upcoming event in Belgium. ONE Championship followed suit and postponed its 20 March show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after hosting its previous event in Singapore behind closed doors. Combate Americas announced a \u201cproactive plan\u201d that included postponing upcoming shows and scheduling new ones on a closed-set TV studio, while Bellator <a href=\"https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2020/03/bellator-241-coronavirus-prompts-postponement\">postponed</a> its Friday show hours before the event was set to begin.</p> <p>Interestingly, White and the UFC have failed to address the status of UFC 249: Khabib v Ferguson, which is still scheduled to take place on April 18th at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. New York State governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York state last Saturday and has since <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/new-york-gov-cuomo-bans-gatherings-of-500-or-more-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">placed a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people</a>. New York mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city on Thursday and revealed that locations such as the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden could be closed for months to deal with what \u201c<a href=\"https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/3/12/21177470/mayor-deblasio-barclays-center-madison-square-garden-could-be-closed-for-months\">could easily be a six-month crisis</a>.\u201d While the UFC will likely move its anticipated pay-per-piew event from Brooklyn to the Apex facility, it remains to be seen whether that will serve as a long-term solution for the promotion, especially given that Nevada has also declared a state of emergency.</p> <p>White\u2019s reaction to the outbreak over this past week, which includes the claim that he doesn\u2019t \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronbronsteter/status/1236553733405736962\">give a shit about the coronavirus</a>\u201d, suggests that the UFC will continue to push ahead with their planned events irrespective of concerns regarding public safety. During a time of crisis, the UFC\u2019s stubborn insistence that <em>the show must go on</em> is not only a prime example of corporate greed but a betrayal of its responsibility towards its staff, its fighters and the public at large.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector,\u201d <a href=\"https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/\">said</a> Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a media briefing declaring Covid-19 a pandemic. \u201cSo every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Last Thursday evening, Boris Johnson appeared at a press conference in No 10 flanked by England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance.</p> \n<p>Johnson looked uncharacteristically grave while the two experts stood expressionless, a choreography that was intended to project a sense of calm, reassuring authority during a national crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b7e32464-f444-4a08-abb9-e6a2cf8d9b80\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA-MsoqRY5k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI must level with the British public,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u201cMany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d</p> \n<p>While he recognised that the spread of coronavirus now amounted to the \u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\u201d, Johnson wanted the UK to know the nation\u2019s best experts \u2013 and its politicians \u2013 were in control of the situation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a clear plan,\u201d he said. Those with persistent coughs or fevers should, from that point on, stay at home for seven days. The elderly would soon be told not to venture out, and families soon be quarantined if one member had a cough.</p> \n<p>But if the message was clear, it is not obvious that it was shared and agreed by others. When asked whether mass gatherings should be outlawed, the two experts were adamant that this was not necessary, in the short term at least. Banning large crowds would not have a \u201cbig effect\u201d on slowing transmission of Covid-19, said Vallance. Indeed, people were more likely to spread the virus watching football in a pub than at an open-air match, however big the crowd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3589c53962af85c985e4f0be7f18dd678599758a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3589c53962af85c985e4f0be7f18dd678599758a/624_301_2642_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But within a few hours, these calm assurances began to look shaky. The Premier League, Football League and Scottish Football Association announced they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-football-league-suspended-until-4-april-coronavirus\" title=\"\">suspending all their seasons </a>until early April. The Wales v Scotland Six Nations Rugby match was also delayed. The government had little option but to follow, and Whitehall sources began briefing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\" title=\"\">mass gatherings would, after all, be banned from next week</a>.</p> \n<p>This change of heart was also spurred by some robust interventions from a number of politicians and commentators. Former Tory minister Rory Stewart, who is now hoping to become mayor of London, called for schools to be closed. \u201cEvidence from other pandemics is that closing schools and large gatherings earlier rather than later stops the peaks of this kind of disease,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the <em>Lancet</em>, said the government was \u201cplaying roulette with the public\u201d, while Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the decision to hold off cancelling large gatherings was \u201csurprising and concerning\u201d.</p> \n<p>Look at Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, said the critics. There, Chinese authorities blocked all outdoor activities and halted the escalation, they argued. And, as the week wore on, and the number of deaths and sufferers across the world grew, more and more senior figures slowly began to question a British approach to coronavirus that began to look out of kilter with the responses of other countries including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.</p> \n<p>These criticisms were not just confined to politicians. \u201cSocial distancing has worked in China, Singapore and other countries,\u201d said Alan McNally, professor of microbial evolutionary genomics at Birmingham University. \u201cThere needs to be a combination of social distancing and extensive testing, followed by the quarantining of infected individuals to contain the epidemic \u2013 and that quarantine should not be at home, where we will see large levels of familial transmission, but in dedicated quarantine facilities.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Significant disruptions need high population compliance.

They continue to dismiss the idea that Britain should proceed immediately with major shutdowns, maintaining support for carefully controlled interventions. However, in doing so, they expose an alarming schism in the nation\u2019s attitudes to Covid-19 and the attempts to control it.</p> \n<p>A clear warning is provided by global health expert Dr Michael Head, of Southampton University. \u201cThe UK population have significant control over their daily life,\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cYou choose when to pop out for a pint of milk or go to a concert. Significant disruptions greatly reduce that control and thus need high population compliance. You won\u2019t get that over a long period of time.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople already can\u2019t be trusted to buy toilet roll properly, so how about long-term compliance when significant levels of freedom are removed and there\u2019s a need to stay indoors for long periods of time? The evidence, as we have it right now, suggests it will decline.\u201d</p> \n<p>This point was echoed by Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Let\u2019s just do what Wuhan did\u2019, but the actions there have involved a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/post-apocalyptic-how-coronavirus-has-altered-day-to-day-life-wuhan-north-england\" title=\"\">change to daily life that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/post-apocalyptic-how-coronavirus-has-altered-day-to-day-life-wuhan-north-england\" title=\"\">has been unimaginable</a> in scale and impact.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8a1c3f06ee0a2eeac04746876c57507c48b18a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a1c3f06ee0a2eeac04746876c57507c48b18a8/51_129_3712_2228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Ashworth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Ashworth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Measures there included a lockdown on nearly 60 million people in Hubei and strict quarantine and travel restrictions for hundreds of millions of people \u2013 both citizens and foreigners. \u201cChina cannot sustain them indefinitely,\u201d added Kucharski.</p> \n<p>In addition, the vast majority of the population in Wuhan is likely to remain susceptible to Covid-19, he added. \u201cAs soon as control measures are lifted, there is the risk of new introduced cases and another outbreak. In addition, countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which for so long have managed to contain Covid-19, now seem to be seeing a rise in transmissions, as infections continue to be introduced.\u201d</p> \n<p>Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University agreed. \u201cIt is now very difficult for those countries that have gone into total lockdown to know under what circumstances they can come out of it. And, to the best of my knowledge, none of those countries has a clear plan \u2013 an exit strategy \u2013 through which they can relax their measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woolhouse added that the World Health Organization \u2013 which has been pushing for strict lockdown measures across the globe \u2013 had provided no advice on how these measures could be ended. The lesson for the UK is clear, say experts.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, pressure is building on the government to act more forcefully. Yesterday, Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, told the <em>Observer</em> that public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the crisis was fragile and questions were increasingly being posed about key aspects of its strategy.</p> \n<p>\u201cDelaying the spread of this virus has to be a priority so as not to overwhelm our already overstretched NHS. But people are increasingly questioning if the UK is following international best practice. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-39025RScOtAt04QY/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-39025RScOtAt04QY/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhy are we no longer testing those with symptoms who are advised to stay at home, when the World Health Organization recommends continued testing, for example?

We need total clarity to maintain public confidence.\u201d</p> \n<p>In general, Johnson has steered clear of politicising the coronavirus scandal, although the tension between playing politics and managing a national emergency was evident in last week\u2019s budget. For the first 10 to 15 minutes, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, struck a sombre note as he announced that every financial resource possible would be directed to minimise the coronavirus crisis. After that, however, Sunak turned the event into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/rishi-sunak-budget-fiscal-policy-economy-power\" title=\"\">pantomime of crowd-pleasing gestures</a> for Tory MPs, which robbed it of the seriousness it merited.</p> \n<p>Last week, opposition parties \u2013including Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems \u2013 began questioning the government\u2019s approach and raised \u201cgenuine concerns\u201d that the UK was not doing as much as other EU countries. And yesterday, a senior Labour source said that there was a gathering sense of unease among MPs that more needed to be done. \u201cThe political consensus is not going to hold for much longer at this rate,\u201d said the source.</p> \n<p>The loss of that consensus could have dramatic and long-lasting consequences. This point was summed up by medical researcher Michael Head of Southampton University. \u201cMore stringent interventions will come, and potentially very soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that.

  "<p>As coronavirus grew from a Chinese outbreak to a global pandemic, the aviation industry was at the leading edge of the accompanying financial crisis. Since the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\" title=\"\">intercontinental travel ban</a> imposed by President Trump last week, the disastrous potential extent of the crisis for airlines has become clear.</p> <p>A drop-off in demand, as businesses cut back on travel and passengers deferred holidays, is being replaced by government decrees and mandatory public health measures. If much lost trade has so far come in the quiet months for western carriers in the northern hemisphere, the prospect of losing spring and summer bookings is another scale of financial loss altogether.</p> <p>Already, major airlines \u2013 even the likes of British Airways and German carrier Lufthansa, let alone the financially precarious Norwegian \u2013 have made it clear that this is now a challenge to their very survival. The speedy escalation of the crisis, with major hubs such as Madrid now following Rome in being declared off-limits to non-essential travel, makes it impossible to predict whether this is a hiatus \u2013 or if measures announced as temporary could last for much longer.</p> <p>As British Airways\u2019 boss, Alex Cruz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/ba-says-jobs-will-go-as-airline-industry-faces-crisis-worse-than-9-11-coronavirus\" title=\"\">told 45,000 staff on Friday</a>, for airlines this is already bigger than the Sars epidemic, the aftermath of 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis. In extraordinary times, the normal rules will no longer apply. Flag carriers have swiftly appealed for state aid. Layoffs could be temporary, or permanent. Already a glut of planes are mothballed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Airline seats are perishable goods, and most of the revenues will never be recouped</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The withdrawal of most scheduled international air travel, even for a short time, no longer looks improbable as much of Europe approaches the kind of shutdown so far seen only in Italy. Indeed, the idea of shuttling vast numbers of people anywhere, let alone between infected countries, has rapidly started to look reckless.</p> <p>Yet it is worth noting that public transport continues to function in Italy; people still need services, food and goods. And a plane flying in Chinese medics and supplies was warmly welcomed to Rome on Friday. That flight was another reminder of how aviation remains an essential part of our world; why governments have long subsidised flag carriers, at vast expense.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s emergency measures included the cancellation of international sporting fixtures \u2013 taking away another small but significant slice of life that is dependent on air travel. But before the latest escalation, planes had been flying almost empty, with many of the dwindling numbers of passengers deciding not to show up \u2013 something that made clear how many airline trips are entirely discretionary.</p> <p>Perhaps, if and when normality returns, there could be a glut of pent-up demand from societies forced to work from home or self-isolate. But airline seats are perishable goods, and most of the revenues will never be recouped; many of those who might have booked holidays can expect to see annual leave used up to care for children sent home from school, or sick relatives. Business travel that has been postponed for health fears may end up looking like an unaffordable expense for many firms, should coronavirus lead to recession.</p> <p>A sustained pandemic could vastly alter the industry. Far smaller shocks have caused weak airlines to go under; but even the big players are likely to have their wings clipped. The appetite for travel may be an ancient human urge, but global hypermobility is only a couple of decades old. Action on climate change may have restricted aviation; higher fares from reduced competition might yet do more. Now, societies forced to do without flying may also start to question whether the habit was worth it.</p> <p>Even before coronavirus, protectionism in trade and the political willingness to erect fresh borders with neighbours had re-emerged to a startling extent. A world haunted by viruses arguably needs globalised structures more than ever, but is meanwhile ever more ready to slam international doors. Airlines, so often the canary in the coalmine for the global economy, may never fly quite so high again.</p> <h2>Saudi ruthlessness on display once more<br></h2> <p>It was not so long ago that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hoped to convince the global financial community that Saudi Arabia was a respectable modern economy, home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/nov/18/saudi-aramco-flotation-is-a-failure-before-it-has-even-begun\" title=\"\">Saudi Aramco</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s most profitable listed company \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/30/russia-saudi-arabia-extend-deal-opec-oil-output\" title=\"\">a power broker</a> in stabilising oil markets.</p> <p>But if Prince Mohammed had expected to establish a reputation as a moderniser and visionary, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\" title=\"\">waging an oil price war</a> during a deadly pandemic might not have been his most considered move.</p> <p>The world\u2019s largest oil exporter triggered the worst day in the financial markets since 1987 last week after firing the starting gun on a race to pump more oil than the global market can absorb.

If the oil market is a game of money and power, he is playing for the latter.

It is a race Russia is willing to run, but there is no doubt that this is a race to the bottom.</p> <p>At least there is one constant in the markets: the ruthless impetuousness of the Saudi regime.</p> <h2>Intu must auction off the crown jewels<br></h2> <p>Shopping centre owner Intu is unlikely to last until the end of the year in its current form, despite boasting nine of the UK\u2019s top 20 malls, including Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex.</p> <p>A \u00a32bn loss, postponement of an emergency cash call, questions about its status as a going concern, and a share price down more than 90% over the past year \u2013 the group\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/08/intu-unknown-retail-landlord-fundamental-threat\" title=\"\">debt problems are mounting</a>.

Most analysts believe Intu won\u2019t reach that date without drastic action.</p> <p>The company\u2019s management is putting on a brave face, insisting they have options.

Sanders not only lost Texas but a string of other contests that stripped him of his briefly held status as frontrunner, returning him to a more familiar role: long-shot insurgent chasing the establishment favorite.</p> \n<p>In frank but defiant remarks on Wednesday, Sanders acknowledged that he was \u201closing\u201d to Joe Biden after a stunning reversal of fortune. Biden, snatched only days before from the jaws of defeat, had just racked up four more victories, including in Michigan, a state that revived Sanders\u2019 presidential bid four years ago and where he had pinned his hopes of a comeback.</p> \n<p>Later that evening, Sanders folded himself into an armchair on the set of NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show in New York City.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d host Jimmy Fallon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flGJ4FxC33M\">asked</a> gingerly.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Sanders sighed. \u201cCould feel better.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders had promised </strong>to build an unprecedented \u201cmulti-generational, multi-racial coalition\u201d of young people and working-class voters that would \u201csweep this country\u201d and transform American politics.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou cannot beat Trump with the same old same old kind of politics,\u201d he told supporters at a Super Tuesday rally in Vermont, where he had expected a celebration.</p> \n<p>But that night, voters in 10 of the 14 states holding primary contests disagreed, choosing instead a candidate who represents a return to the pre-Trump years. It was Biden, not Sanders, who expanded the Democratic electorate, bringing in non-voters and suburban voters while boosting turnout among African Americans.</p> \n<p>Sanders\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/bernie-sanders-latino-voters\">commanding support among Latinos</a> helped him notch two consequential victories in Nevada and California.

In the same interview, he reiterated past remarks that were complimentary of certain aspects of Fidel Castro\u2019s communist government, sparking backlash among Democrats in the battleground state of Florida.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of Bernie\u2019s strengths is his consistency \u2013 he\u2019s been delivering the same message to some degree since the 70s,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cBut it also inhibited him in the sense that it limited his potential for growth.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7657cbb068d1ead68e316a5c78e1a275034c1590\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7657cbb068d1ead68e316a5c78e1a275034c1590/0_86_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders shakes hands with former Vice President Joe Biden after the tenth Democratic 2020 presidential debate at the Gaillard Center in Charleston, South Carolina, U.S. February 25, 2020.

Swing-district Democrats warned Sanders would hurt their chances of re-election, while members of the Democratic National Committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/democratic-superdelegates.html\">plotted</a> to stop him if he arrived at the convention shy of the delegates needed to win the nomination outright.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the beginning, we knew this was going to be the fight of our lives,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019re taking on not only the corporate elite of this party but the billionaire class, the pharmaceutical industry, the prison industrial complex, Wall Street, the insurance companies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even so, the rapid alignment behind Biden, first by his former rivals and then by millions of voters, caught the campaign off guard. In a matter of days, the field shrank from seven top contenders to just two.</p> \n<p>Moderates, once paralyzed over which candidate to support, suddenly rallied behind the former vice-president. On the eve of Super Tuesday, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/joe-biden-rally-amy-klobuchar-beto-orourke\">won the endorsements of three former opponents</a> and more followed in a dramatic show of force that his team compared to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kbeds/status/1236680535013015553?s=21\">the Avengers assembling.</a> Notably, Elizabeth Warren, Sanders\u2019 closest ideological ally, has not yet backed anyone.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn candor, the consolidation of candidates behind Biden happened sooner than anyone expected \u201d said the congressman Ro Khanna, one of Sanders\u2019 national co-chairs. \u201cThere was simply not enough time to build more broadly.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders entered the primary with more built-in advantages </strong>than any of his rivals. His name recognition was sky high, he had an enviable list of small-dollar donors, an unshakable base of support and the experience of having just run a presidential campaign. Little changed from 2016, not the message nor the mission, not even the \u201cBernie\u201d logo. It would be a \u201cclass-conscious\u201d campaign for people who felt left out of the political process.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe represents the people who have been written off for much of their lives,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cFor the people who feel they haven\u2019t been heard, who feel marginalized, who feel the system hasn\u2019t been working for them, he is their voice.\u201d</p> \n<p>A heart attack in October nearly derailed his presidential bid. With Warren on the march and Sanders slumping, his candidacy appeared to be in freefall. But his loyal troops rallied to his side. A strong debate performance and a coveted endorsement from the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez paved the way for a remarkable comeback.</p> \n<p>It proved to be a clarifying moment for the campaign. Sanders used the experience to connect more deeply with his supporters. At intimate town halls and on social media, his team elevated the economic struggles of people who couldn\u2019t afford medical treatment or prescription drugs. It was the foundation of the campaign ethos, \u201cNot me, us.\u201d</p> \n<p>But political reality set in after voting began. Despite his successes in the first three contests, Sanders struggled in a fractured field to retain the support he garnered four years ago. After the centrist vote coalesced behind Biden, he lost state he had won in 2016, when he was far less of a political force than he is today.</p> \n<p>Democrats\u2019 overriding priority in 2020 was to defeat Trump. And on that front, Sanders was losing to Biden.</p> \n<p>\u201cI cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u2018I like what your campaign stands for,\u201d Sanders said soberly from his hometown of Burlington last week. \u201c\u2018I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Black voters have decided the Democratic nominee</strong> in every primary election since 1992. And this year, as in 2016, African Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-south-carolina-primary/\">overwhelmingly</a> chose Sanders\u2019 opponent. In South Carolina, black voters propelled Biden\u2019s triumph and set in motion a turnaround that greatly narrowed the senator\u2019s path to the nomination.</p> \n<p>Supporters believe that Sanders\u2019 effort to make inroads with black voters over the past four years was obscured by Biden\u2019s longstanding ties to African American communities and his eight years as Barack Obama\u2019s loyal lieutenant. After being walloped in the south on Super Tuesday, Sanders\u2019 campaign <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gcY2Fhr5wo\">released</a> an ad that featured Obama praising the senator and saying emphatically \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d But it did not yield the results he hoped.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental disconnect if folks still don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s the one who they can put their faith in after four years,\u201d said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77/0_165_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ahead of the Michigan primary, Sanders earned the endorsement of the Rev Jesse Jackson, in what those close to him said was a deeply meaningful moment. In 1988, Jackson became the first black presidential candidate to win millions of votes on a similar platform of universal healthcare, a federal jobs guarantee and taxing the rich. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was one of the few white public officials to endorse him.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ideas resonate with black folks,\u201d Albright said. \u201cMedicare for All, free college, debt forgiveness, criminal justice reform, on those issues black folks are far closer to Bernie than to Biden. So it\u2019s not the ideas. It\u2019s this issue of electability.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Sanders now faces a legacy-defining decision: </strong>does he stay in a race that has become increasingly difficult for him to win or does he bow out now to begin the delicate process of unifying the party?</p> \n<p>Many supporters are not ready to see Sanders exit. Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant and chairman of his political non-profit, Our Revolution, acknowledged the senator faces long odds but urged him to keep competing. Every delegate Sanders accumulates in the primary, he argued, will be \u201ccritical to negotiations over the rules and party platform\u201d at the convention in Milwaukee this summer.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf he drops out now, those ideas are left with the delegates that he\u2019s won,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey\u2019re the voice for these issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Further complicating the course ahead is a new challenge: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">running for president in midst of a global health emergency</a>. The coronavirus outbreak has forced Sanders to abandon the stadium-size rallies that are a feature of his campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way and that\u2019s hurting us,\u201d he told reporters during a brief press conference in Burlington, where he has spent his time since cancelling an election night rally in Cleveland last week amid concerns about the virus.</p> \n<p>Yet the senator has signaled in recent days that he is unlikely to battle Biden to the bitter end. But he also made clear that there are issues on which he still intends to confront his opponent \u2013 and on which has the leverage to do so.</p> \n<p>On Sunday Sanders will appear at the next presidential debate, a long-sought one-on-one with Biden. At a press conference, he previewed a litany of policy questions that he planned to press Biden on: \u201cJoe, what are you gonna do?\u201d he intends to ask on issues from income inequality to student loan debt.</p> \n<p><strong>When Sanders launched his campaign in February </strong><strong>2019,</strong> he was asked what would be different this time. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/19/bernie-sanders-announces-2020-run-presidency\">Sanders replied,</a> with the blunt assurance that thrills so many of his supporters.</p> \n<p>By his own admission, he is falling short of that goal. As Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy, there is also the sense that he has already accomplished more than he could have imagined in his nearly 50-year political career.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d907cf5a90875b1ff42418617685d6dbcb0c3696\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d907cf5a90875b1ff42418617685d6dbcb0c3696/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders speaks during a rally in St Louis, Missouri, last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders speaks during a rally in St Louis, Missouri, last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Michael Kazin, a historian and co-editor of Dissent magazine, said Sanders has already achieved what many nominees and presidents never do: he has fundamentally shifted the ideology of the Democratic party on everything from healthcare and climate change to raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich. Sanders, Kazin said, was likely the \u201cmost leftwing candidate\u201d to make it this far in American political history.</p> \n<p>That a 78-year-old democratic socialist has come within striking distance of the nomination is an \u201castounding success\u201d in its own right, marveled Bill Press, a progressive talkshow host who helped launch Sanders 2016 campaign from the living room of his Washington home.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a very real sense,\u201d he said, \u201cBernie has already won the primary.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019re going.\u201d</p> <p>Cocktail d\u2019Amore is one of a handful of landmark Berlin parties that have made the German capital a centre of LGBTQ+ youth culture over the past two decades. It took place in a venue called Griessmuehle, an old East German grain mill that people enjoyed because one moment you might be kissing on shower tiles, the next dancing in a silo. Sadly, it is to be demolished this spring to make space for a resort hotel. It certainly wasn\u2019t an architectural jewel like the Berlin Philharmonic concert hall or Museum Island \u2013 but clubs, along with cheap studio space and vibrant subcultures, are what made Berlin the city so many love today.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s sad to see corporate event planners selling clients a Berlin lifestyle that they are so instrumental in damaging</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the 1990s, Berlin still conjured up thoughts of the second world war for many Europeans. Rarely did people come here to dance. But then something miraculous happened: the city\u2019s empty buildings provided the global queer community with a home where low rents and large studio spaces drew in creatives from around the world. Artists and musicians turned cavernous buildings into dance clubs, and those dance clubs were fabulous. This helped resuscitate Germany\u2019s image abroad, because Berliners showed they could welcome a diverse group of people and allow these creatives to help remake the city for a new century.</p> <p>That\u2019s why now it is so distressing that club spaces are closing or under threat as Berlin\u2019s gentrification intensifies. Despite the fact that clubs in the city draw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/berlins-nightclubs-fight-for-same-cultural-status-as-opera-houses\" title=\"\">3 million tourists a year</a>, and generate nearly \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) in annual revenue, more than 100 venues have closed over the past 10 years as property prices have <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-02-04/no-city-hates-its-landlords-like-berlin-does?srnd=businessweek-v2\" title=\"\">more than doubled</a>. In addition to Griessmuehle, About Blank, Else and Wilde Renate are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/germany-love-fast-cars-runs-into-berlin-radical-ravers\" title=\"\">facing closure</a> as officials push for the building of highways and luxury housing developments on parcels of land that investors once shunned. Cocktail d\u2019Amore has found a new venue, but if this pattern continues the city\u2019s parties will inevitably run out of venues.</p> <p>In the early years of reunification, East and West German youths met for the first time, danced together and formed lifelong friendships in ramshackle Berlin clubs staged in former bank vaults, disused kindergartens and collapsing supermarkets. Clubs served as a kind of neutral ground on which the <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/music-forges-a-new-berlin/av-18045545\" title=\"\">two societies could recombine</a>. The soundtrack was often provided by African American GIs who were stationed in Germany, or Germans who came back home after living in London and New York. They inspired a new generation of homegrown DJs with their house and techno records.</p> <p>Berlin\u2019s economy never really took off in the 90s, meaning low rents continued into the 00s, making it an appealing prospect for artists and creatives looking to escape unaffordable lives in other major cities. Still, when I first spent time in Berlin over a decade ago, locals continually asked me why I would ever want to live there. Apparently I was experiencing their city in a way they weren\u2019t.</p> <p>In the late 90s, two gay German entrepreneurs started Ostgut, the forerunner to Berghain, their now wildly successful, internationally renowned club. No story about Berlin\u2019s transformation into a queer mecca can be told without recounting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/berghain-club-bouncer-sven-marquardt-memoirs-berlin\" title=\"\">tale of Berghain</a>. But since that\u2019s been rehashed so often, I\u2019ll just explain how I think it fits into the larger narrative.</p> <p>At first, Ostgut suffered the same fate as Griessmuehle today. It was a venue living on borrowed time, in a rented warehouse that would later be yanked down and turned into a sports arena. When it reopened in 2004, inside a former power station straddling the no-man\u2019s neighbourhood that was the Friedrichshain/Kreuzberg border, Berghain\u2019s owners set about buying the building to assure their club\u2019s longevity. It was a smart move because, as anyone who has seen this parcel of land knows, Berlin\u2019s growth as a city ended up taking place around Berghain: in the span of 15 years, a Metro superstore, a shopping mall, hotels and offices sprang up next door.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/03/berlin-clubbing-cocktail-d-amore\">Down the Cosmic Hole: are Berlin's 56-hour party people facing their last dance?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But because the owners managed to buy the property, Berghain is still here. Moreover, its arts programming during the week has cemented its place in the city\u2019s cultural life. And it has been willing to take on the city (and win) when it feels wronged. The city\u2019s tax court agreed with Berghain that VAT on the club\u2019s weekend musical programming \u2013 essentially the door price \u2013 should be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/12/berlins-berghain-nightclub-classed-as-culturally-significant-venue\" title=\"\">set at a rate of 7%</a> (like opera and classical music events) rather than at 19% (like movies and other goods). Though the ruling applies to all clubs now, the 12% margin has made a life-or-death difference for queer spaces throughout the city.</p> <p>The model that Berghain perfected shows there is a way to protect queer spaces in major cities. Can we help more spaces adopt that model? As we danced inside Griessmuehle\u2019s underground pit for the last time, I felt sad that we as a queer community have let another one of our spaces slip away, just as happened in New York and London.</p> <p>It\u2019s all the more sad, then, to see marketing materials for luxury apartment buildings or corporate event planners selling clients a Berlin lifestyle that they are so instrumental in damaging. If they continue to close the clubs that the queer community and its allies helped create, the city they so eagerly market will no longer exist.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Scaturro is a journalist based in Berlin</p>",
  "<p>Life as we know it is about to change dramatically. And when the world eventually emerges from this pandemic, it is likely to be irrevocably altered. In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p086hjgc\" title=\"\">words of one public health expert</a>, Professor Graham Medley: \u201cThis is the kind of event that is going to live on for decades.\u201d It will either cause illness or death on a scale most of us have not experienced in our lifetimes, or it will take huge changes to the way we live our lives in order to avoid that. The social impact will be more momentous than anything Britain has experienced since the two world wars.</p> <p>This weekend, ministers have warned that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-boris-johnson-tougher-restrictions\" title=\"\">stringent measures</a> will be introduced on people\u2019s movements in the coming days and weeks, and that they are likely to be in place for months. More of us will be asked to self-isolate or to reduce the contact we have with other people for long periods of time. Many will be asked to work from home for weeks, if not months. Travelling abroad will become increasingly restricted. Major sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled, with others likely to follow. In an unprecedented move, local and mayoral elections have been delayed by a year. But by far the most devastating likely impact of this pandemic was hinted at by the prime minister last Thursday. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\" title=\"\">Many more families are going to lose loved ones,</a>\u201d he said at a press conference. This is the frightening truth about what the government\u2019s top scientists believe is to come.</p> <h2>Policy under scrutiny<br></h2> <p>Amid rising public anxiety, there is more scrutiny than ever of the government\u2019s decision to move from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\" title=\"\">\u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase </a>of its strategy. The emphasis has shifted from tracing and testing all those who have been in contact with people confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, to asking all those with symptoms to self-isolate. The government also announced some further limited measures to limit social contact: from next week, mass events with more than 500 people will be banned. But it has faced strong criticism from some public health experts for not taking more stringent action, such as larger-scale closures of places where people congregate, restrictions on public transport, closure of schools and asking more people to self-isolate.</p> <p>The government says it will phase in more stringent restrictions in the coming days and weeks, and that it is not looking at this point to suppress the spread of the virus altogether. There appear to be two interrelated reasons for this. The first is that the government\u2019s experts are concerned that asking people to observe strict social distancing measures for long periods of time, such as widespread self-isolation even for those with no symptoms, could backfire. Like all governments, it is trying to minimise the extent to which demand for critical care exceeds maximum capacity in the NHS, in order to keep death rates from the virus as low as possible and to give the NHS time to do what it can to extend that capacity, already low by European standards. There is clearly a worry that it is untenable to ask people to fundamentally alter their lifestyles for very long stretches of time and that to introduce some measures now would be to risk a significant peak in cases further down the line if people were to abandon those lifestyle changes later on, for example, because they no longer believed they were needed, or could not afford to do so.</p> <p>Second, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said that its strategy is driven by the objective of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">developing herd immunity</a>, which occurs when a sufficient number of people in a population are immune to a disease, to offer some level of protection to everyone. He has said that the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-millions-of-britons-will-need-to-contract-covid-19-for-herd-immunity-11956793\" title=\"\">working assumption</a> is that about 60% of the population will need to catch the disease in order to achieve that.</p> <p>This implies the government is assuming that, even with social distancing measures in place, it is inevitable that a large proportion of the population will contract coronavirus before a treatment or vaccine becomes available, and the best it can do is to manage the flow of people requiring hospitalisation in order to protect those who are most vulnerable. This sits in stark contrast to the strategy deployed by a country such as South Korea \u2013 whose lead most other countries are following \u2013 which is to delay the rate at which the virus spreads as much as possible, using much more stringent social distancing measures and a more comprehensive testing and isolation regime.</p> <h2>Public confidence<br></h2> <p>This difference has prompted serious questions about why the government\u2019s strategy differs from much of the rest of the world. Would 60% of the population contracting the virus be enough to offer any meaningful level of population immunity? Is it even right to assume that people contracting the virus will develop long-term immunity? On what sort of evidence is the government basing its assumption that the public will only tolerate stringent social distancing for so long? Why does it appear that there have been few measures and little guidance to protect those most vulnerable to the symptoms of Covid-19 \u2013 older people and those with underlying medical conditions \u2013 as the disease spreads? On the other hand, there are huge uncertainties and risks involved in trying to halt the spread of the disease as much as possible at this time. What would happen if people broke quarantine before a treatment or vaccine was developed? What might be the impact on the NHS of a large peak in cases as we move into next winter? What would be the impact of immediately closing schools, given that grandparents are likely to pick up the childcare slack and children are more likely to mix outside school the longer closures go on? This would significantly affect the availability of those doing critical jobs in the NHS, care homes and the food supply chain.</p> <p>This is why anyone who expresses with absolute certainty that the government has got this entirely wrong should be treated with some scepticism. There is no surefire way to combat the virus: there are too many unknowns for that. It is however, absolutely right that public health experts are asking questions about why this strategy is so divergent from the overall recommendations of the World Health Organization. The government must be far more transparent about the evidence and assumptions on which it is basing its decisions, or risk undermining public confidence in its actions.</p> <p>There are other problems beyond a lack of transparency. Ministers have said they will seek to legislate for sweeping emergency powers that will last for two years, including giving the police the power to detain suspected victims of the virus, and reducing standards in care homes to allow for staff shortages. Such powers should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and should initially be introduced on a more temporary basis to avoid significant incursions on our liberty and a watering down of basic standards becoming the new norm. Moreover, after a decade of austerity that has put services like the NHS and social care under intolerable strain, and eroded tax credits for families, there are questions to be asked about whether last week\u2019s budget went far enough in terms of channelling additional resources to public services and protecting low-income families from the forthcoming massive economic shock.</p> <h2>International cooperation<br></h2> <p>The contrast between the approach taken by the UK and the rest of the world has also prompted questions about the lack of coordination at an international level, both in relation to the public health or the economic response. \u201cOur willingness to cooperate is becoming inversely related to our need to do so,\u201d Gordon Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">wrote last week</a>. He is right: this pandemic is exposing the extent to which the international organisations and networks that exist to promote global cooperation are fraying as a result of the spread of populism. At a moment when the US might once have provided global leadership, President Trump is flailing; having spent weeks denying the existence of a looming pandemic, he has now politicised the crisis, erratically introducing measures that seem designed to bolster his America First re-election campaign rather than protect citizens. Coronavirus may be the most pressing and immediate global challenge we face; but there are plenty more to come, from microbial resistance to the climate crisis. Effective solutions will only be found if countries rediscover a willingness to work in concert.</p> <p>International cooperation may be proving elusive, but we should take hope from one comfort that might emerge from this crisis: it is heartening to see so many individuals pitching in to help neighbours, or offering to support older people who may be isolated and lonely. This pandemic may leave us a legacy of social action and civic engagement that we should seek to sustain long after its worst threat has subsided.

Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d</p> <p>The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.</p> <p>Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, boasting of his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.</p> <p>On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers\u2019 estimation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">an unmitigated disaster</a>, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct.</p> <p>Then came Friday\u2019s rose garden reset. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">declared a national emergency</a> that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available.</p> <p>His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative.</p> <p>\u201cThis day should be an inspiration to every American,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we\u2019re bringing an all-of-America approach.</p> <p>\u201cMr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China \u2026 throughout this process, Mr President, you\u2019ve put the health of America first.\u201d</p> <p>It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work?</p> <p>There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points \u2013 its biggest point gain ever.</p> <p>Furthermore, there are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump\u2019s supporters.

It isn\u2019t just cleaners who are badly paid; some of my neighbours employ male Polish gardeners for much the same wages as cleaners. Many people (it\u2019s not just women) hire a cleaner because they are working themselves and have children who need their parents\u2019 free time.</p> <p>Domestic cleaning is a respectable job that deserves decent pay and conditions, but these are increasingly a luxury across the economy now. The figures quoted by feminist academic Arianne Shahvisi would be way above the income of many mothers of young children trying to return to work, but unable to do so because they don\u2019t earn enough to break even paying for childcare, let alone a cleaner.</p> <p>The low pay of women compared with men is a feminist issue. The low pay of cleaners and other workers is a political and economic problem worsened by the spread of the gig economy, but it\u2019s not a feminist issue for female employers. To suggest so seems to be falling into the anti-feminist trap \u2013 that cleaning the house is a woman\u2019s job.<br><strong>Judith Fage</strong><br>London N20<br></p> <h2>The rich get richer\u2026<br></h2> <p>Torsten Bell\u2019s article was almost exclusively concerned with income inequality, which is only part of the picture (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/inequality-myths-left-right-stop-us-seeing-true-story\" title=\"\">The myths of both left and right stop us seeing the true story of inequality</a>\u201d, Comment).

The car will still be built of steel and each tonne of steel produced generates around two tonnes of carbon dioxide. Global production of steel currently runs at about 1.8bn tonnes per annum. It will still require road infrastructure, much of which requires concrete. Each tonne of cement produced generates more than a tonne of carbon dioxide. Global cement production is currently around 4bn tonnes per annum. Steel and cement production account of around 20% of global CO2 emissions. Transport accounts for a further 25%.</p> <p>The production of rechargeable electric vehicles requires millions of tonnes of lithium. The greatest deposits of lithium are in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. Lithium is now being called \u201cwhite oil\u201d and one suspects it will do to Argentina, Bolivia and Chile what oil has done to the Middle East, that is, distort economies and disrupt politics.</p> <p>Part of the answer to climate change, and to cleaner air in our cities, is better public transport, particularly the use of trams and trolley-buses.

His first novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/narcopolis-9780571275786.html\" title=\"\"><em>Narcopolis</em></a> (2012), chronicled life in the opium dens of Mumbai in the 1970s and 80s.

He subsequently makes a trip to Mumbai to scatter her ashes, and to find a way to extinguish the afflictions \u2013 insomnia, anxiety, hepatitis, heroin addiction \u2013 that have characterised his past. As Ullis puts it: \u201cThe only thing possible now was oblivion, with the aid of certain powdery or liquid substances.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/09/jeet-thayil-interview-man-booker-narcopolis-book-chocolate-saints\">Jeet Thayil: 'I have a liver condition, I'm reckless and I'm very aware that time is limited'</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Soon, we find him enthusing over a cheap and unsafe new drug known as \u201cmeow meow\u201d, which fills the user with a sense of profound disconnection. With his attachment to this drug in place, we follow Ullis around Mumbai for two days. During this time, \u201ccoming apart in slow motion\u201d, he lurches around city slums, fretting about the impending destruction of the environment, obsessing over the incompetence of Donald Trump, and encountering an array of untrustworthy addicts who encourage him to navigate \u201cthe byways and highways of meow\u201d.</p> <p>The resulting story is often tender and moving, not least when Thayil\u2019s characters reflect on the nature of suicide and grief. When Ullis recalls Aki talking of her wish for death, the \u201clow\u201d that gives the book its title and constitutes \u201cthe great constant\u201d of her life, her words have a disarming simplicity: \u201cAs I grow older, I think about it more and more. I want to die.\u201d And when Ullis reflects on the nature of bereavement, he does so in a way that registers the intimation of levitational otherworldliness that loss can engender (\u201cHe felt separated from his body\u2026 as if he\u2019d been insufficiently anaesthetised\u201d).</p> <p>There also also moments of vibrancy and lyricism.

Ullis\u2019s wit often comes across as tawdry sarcasm. And Thayil sometimes diminishes the intensity of his descriptions by slipping into cliche: things are made \u201cabundantly clear\u201d; characters have \u201cnothing to lose\u201d.</p> <p>On the whole, however, this is a vigorous and enjoyable book that carries the reader along with pace and exuberance.

Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</li> \n   <li><strong>Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. </strong>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy.\u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. </strong>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</li> \n   <li><strong>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday.</strong> Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. </strong>Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. While Morocco has banned flight to and from as many as 25 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths. </strong>As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>.

on the situation in Colombia and Venezula from my Bogota-based colleague <strong>Joe Parkin Daniels</strong> :</p> \n  <p>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation, a move that is likely to have lasting ramifications given the scale of Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis.</p> \n  <p>About 4.5 million people have fled Venezuela which, despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela.</p> \n  <p>Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home.</p> \n  <p>The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning.</p> \n  <p>The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the country\u2019s legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders.</p> \n  <p>Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. </p> \n  <p>\u201cColombia\u2019s overnight decision to \u2018close\u2019 its porous border with Venezuela won\u2019t stop the flow of people,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GRamsey_LatAm/status/1238832345916071936\">tweeted</a> Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBut it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, Colombia\u2019s president, described the closure in a statement as \u201ca measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].\u201d</p> \n  <p>M\u00e1rquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents.</p> \n  <p>All measures are expected to last until 30 May.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:41:21.305Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d11628f085c6327bbff36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:21:57.821Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/newborn-baby-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-london\">earlier today</a>. </p> \n  <p>The child\u2019s mother, who was taken to a north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.</p> \n  <p>Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises \u201cconcerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He told PA Media:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. </p> \n   <p>It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected.</p> \n   <p>Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation.</p> \n   <p>The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. </p> \n   <p>The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d10118f088d75755936d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:14:19.548Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data.

Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</p> <h2>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus</h2> <p>The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of patients. Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</p> <h2>Lockdown announced in Spain</h2> <p>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follow the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential\u201d public places from midnight on Saturday. Restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos will be closed under the measures. Pharmacies and places selling other basic necessities will be exempted.</p> <h2>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus</h2> <p>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</p> <h2>Israel proposes use of anti-terrorism tracking tech</h2> <p>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <h2>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners</h2> <p>Colombia closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela \u200bconfirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela \u2013 with fewer cases \u2013 as a possible centre\u200b of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</p> <h2>State of emergency announced in Libya</h2> <p>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.</p> <h2>Number of African countries to report Covid-19 cases rises</h2> <p>Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. Morocco has banned flights to and from as many as 25 countries.</p> <h2><strong>Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths</strong></h2> <p>As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>.

Some expect the Bank to cut the cost of borrowing close to zero when its rate-setting monetary policy committee meets on 26 March under the new governor\u2019s command. Last week, the central bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-bank-of-england-makes-emergency-interest-rate-cut\" title=\"\">cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25%</a> in its first emergency cut since the financial crisis, as part of a coordinated intervention alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/key-points-from-budget-2020-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s first budget as chancellor</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard the last from the Bank of England,\u201d said George Buckley, chief European economist at the Japanese bank Nomura. \u201cMuch will depend on the speed with which the virus and economic fallout progresses.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged that another cut could come on 26 March. \u201cOur central case, however, is that March may prove too soon, May might be too late, and that another emergency meeting will be required to deliver these measures some time in April.\u201d</p> <p>Drawing on 30-plus years at the Bank, and having known and worked closely with the last four governors in various roles, Bailey is viewed as a safe pair of hands. However, given the troubled times, the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, Mel Stride, has questioned whether someone more dextrous might be a better fit to replace Carney. After all, Bailey was rumoured not to be the preferred<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/choosing-safe-hands-bailey-suggests-pm-less-than-upbeat-over-brexit\" title=\"\"> candidate of Boris Johnson</a>, and the man who hired Bailey \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a> \u2013 is no longer chancellor.</p> <p>Under scrutiny against the backdrop of a crisis, Bailey responded by saying he helped oversee the 2008 bailout of the financial sector, and had been far from sluggish then. \u201cI think I can say that I have quite a strong history of doing things very quickly and of having to change course very quickly,\u201d he told Stride at a hearing of the Treasury committee.</p> <p>In the longer term, the new governor will need to continue Mark Carney\u2019s work to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/17/mark-carney-tells-global-banks-they-cannot-ignore-climate-change-dangers\" title=\"\">tackle the fallout from the climate emergency</a>.
