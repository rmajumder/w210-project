More than 5,500 Italians are testing positive every day, with the average age of those dying 78.5.</p> <p>Supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and post offices are among businesses that will be permitted to keep trading under the new rules. On Sunday, Italians were also banned from moving across municipalities other than for \u201cnon-deferrable and proven business or health reasons or other urgent matters\u201d, the health ministry said.</p> <p>Police squads in Rome were checking documents and fining those outside without a valid excuse. People who were out shopping were forced to wait in line at the entrance to make sure the store was filled with only a handful of shoppers at a time. Joggers were asked to limit their runs to laps around the block.</p> <p>People out for a walk were fined if they broke the rules and wandered into a park or stopped to take pictures of historic scenes of a city without any people.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister told the country it was facing its gravest moment since the second world war and that all businesses and factories that were not \u201cstrictly necessary, crucial [or] indispensable\u201d would close until 3 April.</p> <p>\u201cWe will slow down the country\u2019s productive engine, but we will not stop it,\u201d Giuseppe Conte said late on Saturday. His comments came shortly after it was announced that 793 Italians had died from coronavirus, the most in a single day anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Another 651 Italians died on Sunday, bringing the overall toll to more than 5,400. Nearly 60,000 people across the country are confirmed to have the virus.</p> <p>In other developments on Sunday:</p> <ul> <li><p>The first cases were confirmed in Gaza and Syria, intensifying existing fears about how their health systems would cope with an outbreak of the virus.</p></li> <li><p>The death toll in Spain climbed past 1,720 people, exceeding the official figures of more than 1,600 killed in Iran, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, warned \u201cthe worst is still to come\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>More than one billion Indians were asked to observe a one-day curfew, as Australia introduced curbs on commercial activity.</p></li> <li><p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/uk-could-face-italy-style-lockdown-warns-boris-johnson\">gave his most explicit warning yet</a> that the UK might face an Italian-style lockdown amid mounting criticism of a mixed message from the prime minister\u2019s office.</p></li> <li><p>At least 23 people died and dozens more were injured as Colombia\u2019s prisons were rocked by riots and protests by inmates demanding better protection from the virus.</p></li> <li><p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was quarantined after it emerged that one of her doctors had tested positive, while Rand Paul became the first US senator to test positive.</p></li> <li><p>Spanish opera star Pl\u00e1cido Domingo announced on Facebook that he had contracted the virus.</p></li> </ul> <p>Italy\u2019s civil protection service chief, Angelo Borrelli, voiced cautious optimism over Sunday\u2019s figures, telling reporters: \u201cThe figures announced today are lower than those for yesterday. I hope and we all hope that these figures can be borne out in the coming days. But do not let your guard down.\u201d</p> <p>But Saverio Chiaravalle, vice-president of the order of doctors in Varese, Lombardy, said \u201cthe numbers are still going up too much. Maybe there was a slight decrease today but we can\u2019t be enthusiastic yet because until yesterday there were remarkable increases. It is early to be optimistic \u2013 there are emergency units in Lombardy that are still overwhelmed. For a month we\u2019ve been trying to fight this like crazy and we haven\u2019t yet seen a major result.</p> <p>\u201cIn many cities there are people who still don\u2019t understand the importance of staying at home,\u201d Chiaravalle added. \u201cWe need strict rules, all medics agree with the rules as one of the only weapons we have to fight this is to isolate. It is a sacrifice by all, for all, to try and overcome this situation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/italychina_deaths-zip/giv-390232AFWYuIbB9H\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/italychina_deaths-zip/giv-390232AFWYuIbB9H\">Graph</a> </figure>  <p>Italy accounts for more than a third of the world\u2019s total of about 13,000 deaths.

The chancellor had earlier announced that Germany would ban public meetings of more than two people, amid a raft of further measures. \u201cThe great aim is to gain time in the fight against the virus,\u201d she said, citing an agreement between the federal government and regional states. For at least the next two weeks, people will not be allowed to form groups of three or more in public unless they live together in the same household, or the gathering is work-related, she added.<br></p> <p>India\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases grew to 341 on Sunday and the government ordered lockdowns in 75 districts to contain the spread. Delhi was among several cities to ban all gatherings in the capital and close all but non-essential businesses. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said the curfew observed on Sunday \u2013 marked with a raucous applause and banging of pots at 5pm to thank emergency service workers \u2013 was important but a long fight lay ahead.</p> <p>China, which recorded its first new domestic case for four days, still has the most cases with 81,346, <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">according to Johns Hopkins University</a> but the US has the third-highest number of cases.</p> <p>Coronavirus cases in the US increased to more than 30,000 on Sunday.

Sunday saw a record rise in confirmed cases, with backpacker parties in Bondi and disembarking cruise ship passengers blamed for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-australia-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-largest-daily-rise-cases\">steep uptick in numbers</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>A second financial stimulus package worth $66bn offers the unemployed an extra $550 a fortnight</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/what-australias-189bn-coronavirus-economic-rescue-package-means-for-you\">effectively doubling the rate of Newstart</a>, and increases the wage subsidy to struggling small businesses to $100,000.

Downing Street has called the allegation a \u201chighly defamatory fabrication\u201d. In France, tributes have poured in for the country\u2019s first doctor to die from the virus.

He also warned there could be increased risk of athletes suffering injury and said that athletes could put their health and the health of their families at risk by continuing to train.<br> <br>Meanwhile the sports minister Nigel Huddleston also said he welcomed the news that the IOC was seriously considering postponing the Olympic Games. \u201cThe health and safety of athletes, sports fans and officials due to work at the Games is absolutely paramount,\u201d he added. \u201cWe would welcome the IOC making a definitive decision soon, to bring clarity to all those involved.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, in a statement released after its executive board met on Sunday the IOC confirmed it would look at \u201cmodifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games\u201d.</p> <p>The statement added: \u201cOn the one hand, there are significant improvements in Japan where the people are warmly welcoming the Olympic flame. This could strengthen the IOC\u2019s confidence in the Japanese hosts that the IOC could, with certain safety restrictions, organise the Olympic Games in the country whilst respecting its principle of safeguarding the health of everyone involved.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, there is a dramatic increase in cases and new outbreaks of Covid-19 in different countries on different continents. This led the executive board to the conclusion that the IOC needs to take the next step in its scenario planning.\u201d</p> <p>However, the IOC stressed that any delay to the Tokyo Olympics would not be straightforward. \u201cA number of critical venues needed for the Games could potentially not be available any more. The situations with millions of nights already booked in hotels is extremely difficult to handle, and the international sports calendar for at least 33 Olympic sports would have to be adapted. These are just a few of many, many more challenges.\u201d</p> <p>Several countries have already called for the Games to be postponed, including the Brazilian Olympic Committee which cited \u201cthe notorious worsening of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d and \u201cthe consequent difficulty for athletes to maintain their best competitive level\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to Olympic organisations, Bach said the health of everyone involved in the Games was the most important factor. \u201cHuman lives take precedence over everything, including the staging of the Games,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IOC wants to be part of the solution. Therefore we have made it our leading principle to safeguard the health of everyone involved.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/21/usa-track-and-field-tokyo-olympics-postponed\">USA Track and Field joins swimming in calling for Olympics postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile UK Sport, the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association have announced they will hold a conference call on Tuesday to discuss whether the Olympics should be delayed.</p> <p>A number of sports including athletics, swimming and boxing are in favour of postponement because of the impact coronavirus has had on their training regimes \u2013 and they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/tokyo-olympics-should-be-postponed-says-uk-athletics-chairman\" title=\"\">supported by the BOA</a>.</p> <p>In a statement welcoming the IOC announcement the BOA chairman, Sir Hugh Robertson, urged rapid decision\u2011making for the sake of athletes facing significant uncertainty. \u201cRestrictions now in place have removed the ability of athletes to compete on a level playing field and it simply does not seem appropriate to continue on the present course towards the Olympic Games in the current environment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The full impact of coral bleaching across the Great Barrier Reef will become clearer this week as aerial surveys of hundreds of reefs are completed in the bottom two thirds of the world\u2019s biggest reef system.</p> <p>An aerial survey carried out last week over almost 500 individual reefs between the Torres Strait and Cairns revealed some severe bleaching of corals closer to shore, but almost none on outer reefs.</p> <p>From Monday the spotter plane will head south over reefs where satellite observations and temperature readings have shown corals are likely to have undergone higher levels of heat stress than those in the north.</p> <p>Scientists fear those corals could be found to have been badly bleached, as they are less used to higher temperatures and had escaped major impacts in 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>The chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dave Wachenfeld, told Guardian Australia that whatever the survey concluded, the current bleaching should sound \u201ca very loud alarm bell\u201d on the plight of the reef under global heating.</p> <p>Heat stress has been building across the length of the reef this summer with many anecdotal reports from tourism operators, tourists and recreational diver of severe bleaching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ProfTerryHughes/status/1240984604841926660\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Day 4: We have now completed assessment of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coral?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coral</a> bleaching between Cairns and northern Torres Strait. <br><br>Today, we saw extreme levels of bleaching on coastal reefs from Lockhart River to Cairns.

Scientists have said the world\u2019s oceans are gathering heat due to accumulating levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mostly from burning fossil fuels.</p> <p>Corals bleach if they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Survival from bleaching depends on how high and for how long temperatures get.

They don\u2019t have a lot of corals on them and the corals that are there have managed to survive 2016 and 2017, and so they are tough.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes said it \u201cremains to be seen what will happen in the south\u201d but there were more coral species in those areas \u2013 including staghorn and table acroporas \u2013 that would be more susceptible to bleaching.</p> <p>Some of those central and southern reefs \u201chave accumulated a lot of heat, particularly near the coast,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is shaping up to be strongly coastal \u2013 2016 and 2017 were cooler in the south and, this time around, it is not cool in the south.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes said: \u201cEven if it turns out to be a relative moderate event event compared to 16 and 17, it is still cumulative and because the footprints are different, the cumulative amounts of the reef that\u2019s affected severely or moderately will go up.\u201d</p> <p>Townsville-based Dr William Skirving, of the US government\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the agency\u2019s analysis showed how localised the heat stress had been. But whether that heat stress had translated to severe bleaching would be be answered by the aerial surveys.</p> <p>He said according to his agency\u2019s analysis, one area of Swains Reefs off Townsville had showed some of the highest levels of heat stress across the entire reef, but some of the lowest levels had also been in the same group.</p> <p>This was one reason, he said, why the aerial surveys were important. He held concerns for the corals in southern areas.</p> <p>He said: \u201cLet\u2019s cross our fingers that the corals were not as susceptible as they were in the past.\u201d</p> <p>Wachenfeld told Guardian Australia that whatever the final assessment was \u201cthese are still significant events that are sounding a very loud alarm bell about what\u2019s happening to the reef in the face of climate change.\u201d</p> <p>He said there had been reports of \u201cat least moderate bleaching\u201d from Magnetic Island, near Townsville, and Heron Island, off Gladstone.</p> <p>\u201cBleaching does not necessarily mean death and that some people do misunderstand that,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, the reef is in trouble, but what that means is that it needs more help.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gbrmarinepark/status/1240875249069064192\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Aerial surveys this week of the Ribbon Reefs, above Cairns, show little to no bleaching.

  "<p>Music, said <a href=\"http://www.catholicplaylistshow.com/quotes/aquinas-music-quote-1\" title=\"\">Saint Thomas Aquinas</a>, can be defined as \u201cthe exaltation of the mind derived from things eternal bursting forth in sound\u201d. Faced with the stresses and difficulties of the coronavirus outbreak, it should come as no surprise that so many people have found a response to the pandemic in music. Our bodies may be doing the right and responsible thing by remaining at home, but our minds are not so easily locked down. Things eternal still need to burst forth somehow, and in the face of the Covid-19 virus, music has become one of humankind\u2019s most defiant public assertions that life must continue in harmony.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/16/classical-music-opera-livestream-at-home-coronavirus\">'Quarantine soirees': classical music and opera to stream at home</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nowhere has this musical expression of the will to survive been more inspiring than in Italy. A week ago, a few Italians began to open their windows in the evening and venture out on their balconies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/solidarity-balcony-singing-spreads-across-italy-during-lockdown\" title=\"\">to sing</a>. Neighbours opened their shutters and joined in. The music went viral and caught on. They sang Italy\u2019s national anthem, local folk songs and popular melodies. Musicians joined in with their instruments. The non-musical banged pans. In towns lucky enough to be home to an opera singer, live renderings of Verdi and Puccini arias have echoed through the empty streets.</p> \n<p>Not every country in Europe is as musical as Italy. Not every country has narrow streets lined by houses with balconies either. But Italy is not alone in turning to music in its time of trouble. Singing and live music has been reported across Europe from Spain to Sweden. In Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/bono-coronavirus-song-italy-let-your-love-be-known\" title=\"\">Bono</a> responded on social media with his first new song since 2017. With concerts mostly abandoned everywhere, livestreaming of all forms of music has snowballed in every country and across Europe\u2019s closed borders. It is almost as though music has suddenly become the expression of the way we wish the world was, even while the lockdowns are the embodiment of the world as, for the present, it actually is.</p> \n<p>When people look back on the pandemic of 2020, they will remember many things. One of them ought to be the speed with which human beings, their freedom to associate constrained, turned towards music in what may almost be described as a global prisoners\u2019 chorus. In music, supply has been quick to respond to demand. The Berlin-based concert pianist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/igorpianist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Igor Levit</a> plays a sonata live on Twitter each evening from his living room. Singers including <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/pink-performs-concert-self-isolation-during-coronavirus-pandemic-t176135\" title=\"\">Pink</a> and Miley Cyrus have done the same on Instagram.

  "<p>\u201cIt was another one of those nights and I went in to the local chicken shop, as you do,\u201d Rory Best says as he remembers a drunken time long before he won the first of 124 Test caps. Despite being a Protestant from Ulster, and a man once derided for his background and body shape, Best captained Ireland 38 times, with his final game being the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/new-zealand-ireland-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">World Cup quarter-final defeat against New Zealand</a> last year. He is the most capped forward in Irish rugby history, and only Brian O\u2019Driscoll and Ronan O\u2019Gara have played more times for Ireland. But I like the fact that Best can bring us back to a Belfast chicken shop \u2013 from where, in his early 20s, he stumbled home and caused unintentional havoc.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/irelands-calling-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-a-rugby-powerhouse-donald-mcrae\">Ireland's calling: a journey to the heart of a rugby powerhouse  | Donald McRae</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back and sometimes I brought keys, sometimes I didn\u2019t. At the place I was staying you could put your foot to the corner of the door and give it a nudge, and it sprung open. When I got back I tried to do that but the door didn\u2019t open. So I battered it. Eventually it burst open and I walked in. I saw this flowery wallpaper. I took two steps back because there was no flowery wallpaper in my house. I panicked, dropped everything and ran outside. I saw my house was the one next door. I raced upstairs and just fell asleep on my bed.\u201d</p> <p>When he woke the next morning Best saw his KFC takeaway littered around his neighbour\u2019s garden. He liked the old man who lived next door but, stricken with guilt, he escaped to his parents\u2019 farmhouse in Poyntzpass in County Armagh. When he returned a few days later, the neighbour opened his repaired front door and strolled over to tell young Rory he should watch out because there had been an attempted burglary. \u201cIt was a little heads-up from this lovely fella that I needed to be careful,\u201d Best says, \u201cbut really it was his way of saying: \u2018We know you\u2019re a good lad but please don\u2019t let this happen again.\u2019 I was like: \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember only one terrible incident in the village. Two best friends, a Protestant and a Catholic, were shot dead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A sheepish Best turned away, only to be called back by the neighbour who handed him his credit card which had been found in the garden. Best shakes his head in embarrassment. \u201cIn those days I just thought you played the game hard, and partied hard. I had to find it in myself to change. Some people never find it. And some people are lucky like me \u2013 they discover it early enough in their career to change.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.hodder.co.uk/titles/rory-best/my-autobiography/9781529362428/\" title=\"\">his new autobiography</a> Best is bracingly honest about his youthful ill-discipline \u2013 which makes his subsequent dedication even more impressive. He played his first game for Ulster in 2004 and remained loyal to his province for 15 years. Best made his Test debut, coming off the bench, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/nov/14/rugbyunion.sport6\" title=\"\">against New Zealand at Lansdowne Road in 2005</a> and the first of many damning comments about him wearing an Ireland shirt appeared in print.</p> <p>Neil Francis, a former international whom he had cheered on as a schoolboy, described how \u201cRory Best waddled on to win his first cap\u201d. Best, who is an amiable man, says: \u201cI was not in very good shape. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time. At that stage it was the greatest day of my rugby life and so to get a former player saying that did hurt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong><br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Best endured more abuse than most Irish players.

But he still remembers the tweet which said: \u201cNo affence [sic] but how can a fat Protestant like you captain our country, you don\u2019t even sing the anthem?\u201d Best retweeted it while saying: \u201cNone taken. FYI, it is \u2018offence\u2019, not \u2018affance.\u2019 But thanks for your constructive feedback.\u201d</p> <p>Best is surpassed only by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/irelands-calling-a-journey-to-the-heart-of-a-rugby-powerhouse-donald-mcrae\" title=\"\">Willie John McBride</a> as an Ireland captain from Ulster. \u201cWillie Anderson was captain for a little bit,\u201d Best points out, \u201cbut, yeah, there hasn\u2019t been too many. I\u2019m very proud of the fact I come from Ulster. And I\u2019m very proud of the fact that the only international team I\u2019ve ever supported is Ireland. So I\u2019m incredibly proud to have captained Ireland. The beauty of the Irish rugby team is that there\u2019s a lot of respect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5207a8e1337bb37b26646cb1df418bd400c20de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5207a8e1337bb37b26646cb1df418bd400c20de8/130_183_2966_1780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Best is congratulated on his 100th cap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Best is congratulated on his 100th cap by his teammates after captaining Ireland to victory over Australia in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI respect the Irish\u2011speaking element of it. The national anthem. I respect all of that. They respect where I come from. We slag each other for fun but there\u2019s mutual respect. When you look at soccer, Northern Ireland really struggle to get to the major tournaments. So do the Republic. But in rugby, as a combined all-Ireland team, we got to No 1 in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Best also points out that rugby can unify communities \u2013 even if it is played predominantly by middle\u2011class Protestants in Ulster. His dad united Best\u2019s primary school side at Poyntzpass with St Joseph\u2019s, a Catholic school. They formed a cross-community mini-rugby team.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal in our village,\u201d Best says. \u201cIn terms of the Troubles I remember only one terrible incident in the village. Two best friends, a Protestant and a Catholic, were shot dead. The village still wears the scar to this day.\u201d</p> <p>In March 1998, when Best was 15 and just weeks before the Good Friday agreement was signed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/feb/03/northernireland.nicholaswatt\" title=\"\">Philip Allen and Damien Trainor were killed</a> while they shared a couple of pints in the pub. Such a tragedy, Best remarks, put his own pain as a rugby player into perspective.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That sick side of you goes: \u2018What is being said?\u2019 Once you read it, you can\u2019t unread it, much as you wish you could.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reading his book, it is striking how Best was haunted and then driven by insecurity. \u201cPeople have different ways of motivating themselves. I have a younger sister but I was the youngest of three boys. Simon played Irish Schools, and for Ireland, so he was the rugby one. Mark was a very good rugby player, but he excelled academically. I was like, \u2018What do I excel at?\u2019 You almost develop this chip on your shoulder and it drives you on. That\u2019s where this need to prove myself started. It is doubt. But you almost generate the doubt, to prove them wrong. I used to say in the Irish team room, \u2018I might get dropped this week\u2019, and they\u2019d laugh at me. Whenever you get laughed at in an Irish context, by fellow players, you\u2019re in a good position. But I needed that little push.\u201d</p> <p>In the buildup to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/17/ireland-new-zealand-autumn-international-match-report\" title=\"\">Ireland\u2019s famous defeat of New Zealand</a> in Dublin in 2018 \u2013 beating the All Blacks under Best\u2019s leadership for the second time in three matches, having never tasted victory against them before \u2013 he told his wife he was about to pull on the green shirt for the final time. There had been so much criticism of Best, as being too old and slow, he was certain Schmidt would drop him.</p> <p>\u201cYou allow people to convince you that you\u2019re done,\u201d Best says. \u201cAll I wanted was a win for Ireland and I wondered if they might have a better chance without me. But, deep down, I knew Joe would\u2019ve been the first one to tell me. You say to everyone: \u2018Don\u2019t read the papers.\u2019 But you\u2019ve got well-meaning friends and family. They send the odd text going, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to the papers. We know you can do it.\u2019 Now I\u2019m going to have to look at the papers.

But have they discussed why Ireland lost their way?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that we haven\u2019t talked about,\u201d Best admits. \u201cWhen we spoke it was making sure he understood the headline gave the wrong impression. He was totally fine \u2013 but we haven\u2019t really chatted about the World Cup.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things the Irish Union could do \u2013 looking ahead to the next World Cup \u2013 is listen to our viewpoints. I have a big regret that, from a captaincy point of view, I didn\u2019t phone Brian O\u2019Driscoll or Paul O\u2019Connell. I played in four World Cups but I didn\u2019t ask Brian what he had learned in 2007 and 2011. If Johnny Sexton\u2019s the captain at the next World Cup that would be one thing you\u2019d encourage him to do \u2013 to ask what we would all do differently as past captains. I think the union has a bit of fear involving recent former players.

As the effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic became increasingly apparent in Australia, state governments moved to action. South and Western Australia joined Tasmania and the territories in closing their borders \u2013 it was a decision that made professional sport not just a logistical nightmare but increasingly an irrelevance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/afl-nrl-and-a-league-press-on-despite-restrictions\">AFL suspends season and cancels AFLW amid coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McLachlan\u2019s explanation was clear, his action decisive. But it put rival winter codes on the horn of a dilemma. Given the trans-national nature of its competition, the call to suspend the Super Rugby at the end of last weekend\u2019s matches was unavoidable. But for the NRL and the A-League an already fraught pathway towards lumbering on has become virtually impossible.</p> <p>With an operating surplus last year of $458m, the AFL has something its rival codes simply cannot match: cold, hard, cash. Over the decade just gone, the AFL built revenues from $367m to $794m. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/afl-faces-most-serious-threat-in-100-years\">It even amassed a $120m future fund</a>. With clubs dating back over 150 years the foundations of the game are solid.</p> <p>The coronavirus may well prove as McLachlan claimed \u201cthe most serious threat to our game in 100 years\u201d \u2013 the ramifications of the competition\u2019s immediate cancellation for commercial contracts, broadcast deals, club memberships and operational cash flows are utterly mind-boggling.</p> <p>But the mere fact the AFL can make this call means it believes it can endure whatever lies ahead.</p> <p>For Football Federation Australia, the A-League competition is the overwhelming revenue driver for the whole of the game, outside of the four-year national team cycles, hedged against World Cup qualification. Just 15 years old, the league simply doesn\u2019t have the reserves to meet \u201c100 year\u201d threats, especially after club owners accumulated loss-leading deficits of <a href=\"https://books.google.ee/books?id=Yge6CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;lpg=PT58&amp;dq=a-league+tumultous+club+owner+losses&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aGElSUa5lo&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Bpf6KYR519gm5iQdM8V9rvPR8nw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwievLLBua7oAhX6IbcAHWQ0DdUQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=a-league%20tumultous%20club%20owner%20losses&amp;f=false\">between $150m-200m across the competition\u2019s first decade</a>.</p> <p>For new FFA chief executive James Johnson, it\u2019s an unenviable choice: face untold financial losses in immediately suspending the competition or run the risk of earning widespread opprobrium for flaunting public health protocols in the face of a pandemic.</p> <p>That football\u2019s various stakeholders are well aware of the public health ramifications of playing on \u2013 not just to players and staff but to the nation more broadly \u2013 has been acknowledged. The 11th<sup> </sup>hour logistical hoops the game\u2019s administrators have already leapt through over preceding weeks to keep matches taking place has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p> <p>Wellington Phoenix staff and players can already attest to the incredible challenges of having five months in the off-season to plan a campaign, and then suddenly mere weeks in the middle of it to completely redraw flight, accommodation and training plans. With the announcement of border closures in South and Western Australia, Perth Glory and Adelaide United now share their headache.</p> <p>Immediately following McLachlan\u2019s press conference both <a href=\"https://www.a-league.com.au/news/covid-19-impact-20192020-hyundai-a-league-season\">FFA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nrl.com/news/2020/03/22/nrl-reaffirms-commitment-to-play-on-as-afl-suspends-competition/\">ARL</a> provided updates regarding their respective codes \u2013 effectively, pending intervention from the government or chief medical officer, games would proceed.</p> <p>The language from NRL\u2019s chairman Peter V\u2019landys has been bullish. Well might rugby league point out it doesn\u2019t have teams in WA or SA, but given the rapid acceleration of Covid-19 infections across Australia day-on-day, events may quickly overrun the code\u2019s eastern coast heartland.</p> <p>For FFA, the hopes of finishing the competition, even under a revised schedule, have effectively evaporated. Whereas even a week ago one or two more rounds of games might have resolved at least the issue of the premiership, Asian Champions League positions, finals spots or the newly introduced FFA Cup 2021 playoff berths for the bottom two clubs will not be resolved. After Monday some teams will have played 20 games, others 23.

  "<p>About 25 years ago, \u201cface time\u201d was a <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=facetime\">new phrase</a>. In 1994 or thereabouts, news came that in cutting-edge workplaces of the US, the term denoted time actually spent in the company of other human beings \u2013 and was, by implication, a symbol of how that most basic aspect of human interaction was being lost. As they became immersed in email and the nascent worldwide web, it was rumoured that the most modern people were increasingly removed from even their friends and families \u2013 something crystallised in Douglas Coupland\u2019s 1995 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/nov/10/fiction.douglascoupland\">Microserfs</a>, which moves from Microsoft\u2019s HQ near Seattle to Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Midway through the book comes an angst-ridden email written by one of the key characters. \u201cSo many people no longer have lives that you raeally [sic] have to wonder if some new mode of existence is being created which is going to become so huge that it is no longer on the moral scale \u2013 simply the way people ARE,\u201d he says. \u201cI only need 2 hours of people a day. I can get by on that amount. 2 hours of FaceTime.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As so many of life\u2019s fundamentals fall away, this is the one kind of human interaction that will be strengthened</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a pointer to the future, it was hardly misplaced. There is grim symbolism in the fact that \u201cFaceTime\u201d eventually lost its original meaning, and became the name of the video-phoning app launched by Apple in 2010 \u2013 ironically enough, a mere approximation of face time in its original sense. But in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, this is how millions of us, of all ages, are living.</p> <p>For the foreseeable future, ours is a world in which extended, in-person social contact is simply reckless, and the replacement of socialising with time spent online is an everyday fact. And beyond all those newly ubiquitous platforms for video calling and conferencing, arguably our single greatest collective tool is also the one people like me have spent the last four years maligning as increasingly monstrous, out-of-control, badly led, central to many countries\u2019 journeys away from liberal democracy, and damagingly addictive to boot.</p> <p>For Facebook and its senior management, all those things remain in play. Beyond the current pandemic, the company\u2019s culture and practices are being tested once again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/trump-election-facebook\">by the looming </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/trump-election-facebook\">US election</a>. But life is never without contradictions and ambivalences, and we all know the positive things Facebook can facilitate, arguably as never before. The Covid-19 moment demands a means of bringing people together while they largely stay in their homes, and ensuring that whatever limited time they can spend in the real world is used as constructively as possible. Given that 2.5 billion human beings have Facebook accounts, the solution has arrived as a matter of inevitability.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s PR people are keen to big up its new <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/facebook-coronavirus-information-center-zuckerberg/\">\u201cinformation centre\u201d</a> that puts reliable material about the virus at the top of people\u2019s news feeds. Its moderating machine, they emphasise, is aggressively tackling misinformation about the virus \u2013 though its systems have already mistakenly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184445/facebook-marking-coronavirus-posts-spam-misinformation-covid-19\">clamped down on legitimate material</a>, and the weeks to come will surely test them to the limit. Facebook-owned WhatsApp is another means of communication that the outbreak has made indispensable, although there are questions to be asked about the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/18/tech/whatsapp-coronavirus-misinformation/index.html\">misinformation</a> people are using it to spread.</p> <p>But here is some unalloyed good news: in the UK alone, Facebook has facilitated the formation of an estimated 300 local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">Coronavirus support groups</a>, whose combined membership now totals more than a million people.</p> <p>Late last week, I spoke to Edd Withers, a 33-year-old resident of Canterbury, who is one of three administrators of a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/canterburyresidents/\">Facebook group</a> called Canterbury Residents. It was founded in 2014, with the intention of bringing together a small university city, and \u201cbridging the gap between the student population and the resident population \u2013 getting over this kind of clash of worlds\u201d. The group now has 37,000 members. \u201cIt\u2019s had a massive impact on the whole way the city learns and communicates about news, and what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The group has now spawned a Facebook offshoot called Canterbury Coronavirus Assistance, which has gained more than 1,000 members in a week. In the immediate moment, Withers told me, lots of people were volunteering to run errands and check in on others. \u201cBut there will still be people who are self-isolating in six months\u2019 time. Things might calm down, but there will still be really vulnerable people feeling the effects of all this.\u201d He emphasised how important it is that these assistance networks operate safely: \u201cIt\u2019s not about going in gung-ho and introducing stranger A to vulnerable person B.\u201d With that in mind, he and his colleagues are linking people to already-existing local charities and community organisations. Via a Facebook chat group, he is also being advised by a group of wise heads that includes the leader of the council, and representatives of local churches.</p> <p>Whatever Facebook\u2019s serial transgressions, there is something at the heart of such initiatives that holds out the prospect of a kind of social organisation beyond the \u201ctraditional\u201d state and the paternalism of charity. It is one of the most remarkable sociological aspects of this crisis that as so many of life\u2019s fundamentals fall away, this is the one kind of human interaction that will be strengthened. And yes, there is a cruelty in the fact that as so many large and small businesses hit the wall, Facebook and the other titans of big tech will probably emerge from this crisis even more powerful. This issue was pre-emptively answered by Facebook\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-investing-100-million-in-small-businesses-hit-by-coronavirus/\">to use a $100m fund to help small business in 30 different countries</a>; but the problem will still likely flare up again as the economic crisis triggered by the virus deepens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">Community aid groups set up across UK amid coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In early 2017, amid the first stirrings of a conversation about Facebook\u2019s mismatch of power and responsibility that would go nuclear later that year, Mark Zuckerberg began to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10103508221158471/\">zero in on the theme of community</a>. He talked about \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d, and how important it is to feel \u201ccomfort that we are not alone and a community is looking out for us\u201d. In his <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/mark-zuckerbergs-speech-as-written-for-harvards-class-of-2017/\">commencement address that year at Harvard University</a>, he sounded positively evangelical: \u201cChange starts local. Even global changes start small \u2013 with people like us. In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest opportunities, comes down to this \u2013 your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Very quickly, this stuff felt like so much cover for the arrogance and oversights that would be decisively revealed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But in the midst of such awful global events and the way millions are responding to them, Zuckerberg\u2019s words also just about ring true, and underline what Facebook enables millions of us to do. Sooner or later, we will have to resume the conversation about whether the company \u2013 along with the other tech giants \u2013 should exist in its current form, whether to forcibly pull its social functions away from advertising, and all the rest. But for now, our world is inescapably cast in its corporate blue and white, and millions of us know one thing as a matter of daily experience: that without it, even more things might fall apart.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

In arriving at a decision many hoped might have been made last week, league bosses suspended the men\u2019s competition until 31 May and scrapped the AFLW season mid-finals, with no premiership to be awarded. </p> <p>The best-case scenario, that the AFL competition resumes from 1 June, is bad enough for the code. The real possibility, that measures taken to limit the spread of Covid-19 will push that date back further or wipe out the entire season, could be disastrous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/afl-nrl-and-a-league-press-on-despite-restrictions\">AFL suspends season and cancels AFLW amid coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo say this is the most serious threat to our game in 100 years is an understatement,\u201d AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said on Sunday. \u201cThe AFL industry is facing its biggest financial crisis in our history. Our industry provides livelihoods for thousands and thousands of people but our key focus at the moment \u2013 like every organisation in the country \u2013 is to do everything that needs to be done to help slow the spread of this virus and to keep people as healthy as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The&nbsp;AFL&nbsp;has a&nbsp;future fund&nbsp;of over $120m at its disposal to cushion the blow. Industry estimates put the figure needed to absorb the damage caused by the coronavirus crisi at five times this figure at least. </p> <p>The knock-on effects will be immense and far reaching. Poorer clubs will struggle to make ends meet, the shape of the AFLW competition will no doubt be impacted and this will all leave state leagues and grassroots footy vulnerable.</p> <p>So now the AFL goes into damage control. It will spend the coming days consulting with clubs on methods of best practice with regards to health and cost cutting. Pay cuts will be routine, jobs might be lost, livelihoods of lower earners threatened. </p> <p>\u201cOur focus over the coming days is working with the clubs to embed medical protocols, to finalise the operating model during the temporary suspension period and to work with our funding partners to secure a line of credit to fund cash falls across the industry, while allowing the best chance to a return to football matches,\u201d McLachlan said.</p> <p>With state borders closing and non-essential travel banned, conducting a national sporting competition became untenable. \u201cIt was the right decision to start the season, and clearly it is now the right decision to stop. That is why we have acted immediately to take this step to play our role in the community and to protect the long-term future of our game,\u201d McLachlan said.</p> <p>Amid the uncertainty, the AFL remains committed to squeezing out a 17-round season if, and when, organised sport gets the green light to resume. But, with politicians talking about containment measures remaining in place for six months or longer, realism is becoming the default setting. </p> <p>Jeff Kennett, the Hawthorn president, is already looking towards next year. \u201cWe at Hawthorn support the decision and our focus must be on surviving to be able to play a full season in 2021,\u201d Kennett said.</p> <p>For better or worse round one did take place, serving at the very least to satisfy our curiosity for post-apocalyptic footy. It was as if the game had landed a leading role in a sequel to The Omega Man. Goals kicked into empty stands, acts of brilliance almost unacknowledged, a player celebrating his 200th game chaired off the ground to near silence. The only things missing were zombies and tumbleweed.</p> <p>Players looked to be giving their all. In fact, with shorter quarters and longer intervals, it could be argued their intensity was cracked up a notch. Scoring levels, not far off totals reached in round one 2019, would suggest this was the case. </p> <p>Coaches might be used to telling their troops to play like there\u2019s no tomorrow; this time they meant it. But without the backdrop of an audience, without the audio and visual boost that fans afford live sport, the action looked flat at times, as if the players were acting out a training drill that somehow had four premiership points attached. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/no-crowd-no-atmosphere-only-footy-as-afl-season-makes-muted-bow\">No crowd, no atmosphere, only footy as AFL season makes muted bow | Jonathan Howcroft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The conclusion drawn from round one seems in accord with other sports around the world: fans who attend games might be spectators, but bystanders they are not. In some ways they are as pivotal to the live experience as the players themselves. You can have Vegemite on toast without the butter, but it\u2019s a pale imitation of the real thing.</p> <p>The players themselves recognised this. All the talk in changing rooms was about \u201cmaking our own noise\u201d and \u201cgenerating our own energy\u201d. They needed to. When Jake Stringer drilled a major from outside 50 against Fremantle at Marvel Stadium, he was greeted with the sound of nothingness, save for the back-slapping and whooping of his teammates. </p> <p>When Sydney\u2019s Tom Papley dribbled one home from the pocket at Adelaide Oval, he wheeled around, left arm extended horizontally, in anticipation of high-fives from fans at the fence that would normally follow such wizardry. But, again, there was nothing.</p> <p>The fans were watching, just from home. And they were watching in enormous numbers. More than 1.1m people in the capital cities and on Pay TV tuned into Thursday night\u2019s clash between Richmond and Carlton, the highest number for a season opener in four years. Social media was awash with pictures and videos of supporters in team colours, social distancing nowhere to be seen, posts adorned with hashtags that capture the zeitgeist of sport\u2019s place in these troubling times: #wearewatching, #footyathome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JessCarroll2002/status/1241192083844546560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AFL</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/footyathome?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#footyathome</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wearewatching?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wearewatching</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gopies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gopies</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CollingwoodFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CollingwoodFC</a> \ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0d\ud83c\udfc9\ud83d\udcfa <a href=\"https://t.co/tPgAqPlOaw\">pic.twitter.com/tPgAqPlOaw</a></p>&mdash; Jess (@JessCarroll2002) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessCarroll2002/status/1241192083844546560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Broadcasters were thinking on their feet. With the hum of the gathered masses nowhere to be heard, effect mics were instead deployed to pick up the sounds of the game: the marshalling, directing, the urging and the chitter chatter that conduct the flow of the game. Intermittently, commentators would be silent for extended periods so viewers could watch and listen, encumbered by the descriptive intrusion of a third party. Richie Benaud would be proud. These were blissful moments that should become de rigueur for AFL broadcasts, even after the scourge of the coronavirus has been conquered and stands are once again filled.</p> <p>There will be those who opine that, by commencing a season in the grips of a global health crisis, the AFL was guilty of a gross act of social irresponsibility, waving a two-fingered salute to those suffering, and to those actually trying to do something about Covid-19. But that criticism is wide of the mark. In pulling stumps now, the AFL has shown it is taking the threat seriously. </p> <p>The only certainty right now is that the immediate future of the AFL, and society as a whole, is up in the air. At least AFL fans got one round in. For a few fleeting days, it was the kind of distraction, the kind of therapy, we needed.</p>",

A riot not just of colour, but of ideas too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHAgoT4FZbc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KHAgoT4FZbc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHAgoT4FZbc\">Watch the video for Amarillo by J Balvin</a></figcaption> </figure>",

  "<p>Just over a week ago, our world looked very different from how it does today. The shift has been so rapid and frightening, it feels as if the ground beneath us has given way. It is disorienting, as if normal life is just over there, out of reach. I have been through two major bereavements, close together, and this has the same unanchored feeling of grief.</p> <p>The human brain is not wired to tolerate uncertainty, but it is wired to be alert to any threat. So, if you are feeling pandemic panic, it is only natural. Blame your brain. For most of us, life has never felt more uncertain, and uncertainty is, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/uncertainty-stressful-research-neuroscience\">a 2016 study by neuroscientists at University College London</a>, an even more stressful state to be in than actually knowing something bad will happen. It may explain \u2013 if you\u2019re young-ish and otherwise healthy \u2013 why you may be almost hoping to contract Covid-19, just to get out of that will I-won\u2019t I? mental tussle. Those of us who are older or more vulnerable don\u2019t have such a privilege.</p> <p>According to Robert Leahy, the director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-worry-cure-9780749927240.html\">The Worry Cure</a>, we are all locked in \u201can international human trauma, where everybody has a sense that their life, or the lives of people they love, is threatened\u201d. When we are anxious, he says: \u201cWe tend to equate uncertainty with the worst outcome. For example, after 9/11, I heard so many people say it\u2019s inevitable that there\u2019s going to be another major attack on New York City, or a nuclear attack by al-Qaida. That never happened. When we\u2019re anxious, we tend to treat the uncertainty as a bad outcome. But uncertainty is neutral \u2013 we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We want to be assured the way our world looks when we get up in the morning is the way it will look when we go to bed</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Daniel Freeman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We can look to what has happened in other countries with understandable horror, but we can also hold on to the fact that measures such as testing, social distancing, quarantining and travel restrictions seem to have some effect, and that at some point, there will be potential treatments. None of this is to underplay the seriousness of the pandemic, and the many lives that have already and will be lost. But the point is that at the moment, nobody really knows what is going to happen.</p> <p>Most of us crave stability. \u201cWe want predictability,\u201d says Daniel Freeman, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cWe want to be assured that the way our world looks when we get up in the morning is the way it will look when we go to bed. And if change occurs, we prefer it to be on our terms.\u201d But sometimes life has other ideas.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to come to terms with such uncertainty,\u201d he says. After all, we already live with plenty of uncertainty and lack of control, even if it is on a much smaller scale, such as driving a car or being a passenger in one. \u201cWe have to accept that no action is 100% risk-free and that we can\u2019t totally control events, no matter how much we try. No matter how much we worry, we can\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for us. And we can\u2019t prevent problems happening just by worrying about them. In the end, it is best to concentrate on what is meaningful in our lives.\u201d</p> <p>As a lifelong catastrophiser, and despite knowing with hindsight that in every instance, my imagined worst-case scenarios didn\u2019t come true, my worry doesn\u2019t feel unwarranted at the moment. The question is: how helpful is it? Not very. \u201cWe know that this is a dangerous virus,\u201d says Natasha Page, a therapist and member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u201cBut are we catastrophising about some things? Are we trying to predict what the outcome is going to be? It can be helpful to think about what the best-case scenario could be as well. Anxiety can be a helpful emotion to have \u2013 it can help us to keep safe and do the right things \u2013 but fixating on the worst outcome is not a healthy thing to do.\u201d (Unless, of course, you\u2019re one of those in charge of stopping the spread.)</p> <p>Constantly checking the news may feel like a way of asserting control over events, says Freeman, but it can exacerbate anxiety. \u201cKnowledge is power. So make sure you get your information and advice from the very best sources. You\u2019ll also have to keep checking in to make sure your plan fits with the expert advice. There is an obvious temptation to seek out information all the time, but although this may be helpful as you first orientate yourself to what is going on, a moment comes when we need to put limits on it.\u201d</p> <p>He advises creating a plan in order to make it easier to deal with anxious thoughts so \u201cwe have formed our response and know what to do. A little time worrying isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, as it may alert us to modifications we need to make, but too much time spent worrying skews our thinking. We catastrophise when we worry, leading to less measured responses.\u201d Freeman suggests constraining worry to one or two set periods each day. \u201cWhen worry comes at other times, just note the thoughts down, then don\u2019t fight them but let them go. Notice the worry, acknowledge it, but don\u2019t let it distract you. Stay as calm as you can, focus on what you\u2019re doing and not what you\u2019re thinking, and watch the worry recede into the distance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"970f953195c88ed52b19ccdd8e6fa193f4ec7e3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970f953195c88ed52b19ccdd8e6fa193f4ec7e3f/0_29_5211_3127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Blatchford/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With understandable concerns about job security and how you will survive financially, \u201ctry to take as much control as you can over the situation,\u201d says Page. \u201cWe know there are things being set up in order to help people with mortgage or rent payments, and help for businesses. Get yourself well-informed and think about what you might need to plan for.\u201d</p> <p>If you are reading this piece, chances are you are currently healthy. \u201cRemind yourself that in this moment you are safe and well,\u201d says the therapist Eve Menezes Cunningham. \u201cAnxiety is defined by fears around the future. With a pandemic, no one\u2019s imagining that future is going to be all sunshine and rainbows but at the same time we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to pan out.\u201d When we\u2019re anxious, she says, we typically try to control more, but so much is now beyond our control. \u201cWe can only control what we are doing \u2013 staying at home for the sake of more vulnerable populations, if you\u2019re not already self-isolating because you are part of a more vulnerable population \u2013 not stockpiling. Be kind to yourself \u2013 anxiety is a normal reaction to have in a really unusual situation.\u201d</p> <p>Can you dare to think about the future? What if you had big plans that are now suddenly on hold \u2013 going to university, trying for a baby, moving house or changing career? Nobody can tell you what the best decisions for your life are right now, and it might be better to think no further ahead than a day or a week. \u201cDon\u2019t deny reality but remind yourself that this will pass, although we don\u2019t know when,\u201d says Cunningham. \u201cFor some people, being at home all of a sudden, there is time and space to think about what we want to do with our lives. A lot of people will be looking for more purpose and meaning. It might not be the best time to make big changes, but thinking about a happy future in which you\u2019re doing work that you love or you have the family you\u2019ve longed for will help. When we\u2019re stressed and creating cortisol, it perpetuates stress.\u201d Too much cortisol also compromises our immune systems. \u201cWhen we think happy thoughts \u2013 imagining the love we\u2019ll have for our future baby or the fulfilment we\u2019ll have in our future career,\u201d she says, \u201cwe might not only feel better, but we should also be boosting our immune function.\u201d</p> <p>Be aware that our emotional estimate of risk, says Leahy, \u201cis extremely high. What we tend to do when we\u2019re emotional is think about anecdotes, not probabilities. This is human nature \u2013 we\u2019re not evolved to calculate baselines and probabilities. So we think about stories and how they\u2019re related to us personally. The question is: what is the absolute probability that I\u2019m going to die from Covid-19?\u201d He believes someone is more likely to eventually die from cancer or heart disease. In China, which has a population of around 1.5 billion, at the time of writing 3,245 people have been killed by Covid-19 (and, Leahy points out, China has reported no new domestic transmissions). I\u2019m not sure how comforting this is, especially for those of us who are vulnerable \u2013 the virus still seems an unknown quantity, and we still don\u2019t know how much havoc it will wreak, how overwhelmed our healthcare system will get, or (if we do get a handle on it) when it will spring back again once the restrictions on our lives are lifted. So it comes back to building tolerance for uncertainty.</p> <p>\u201cThere are things you can do to boost your ability to cope in these uncertain times,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cOur lives are becoming much more restricted, so it is absolutely crucial that we have enough activities that we really want to do. Ideally these activities will be meaningful to us and build on our strengths. We need to think about new ways to connect with and support our friends, family and neighbours. In these times, our relationships with others become even more important.\u201d</p> <p>Anxiety is contagious, as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453014001243]showed\">a 2014 study by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences</a> in Germany shows. \u201cEmpathetic stress\u201d increased as a result of witnessing someone else in distress, whether they were a loved one or a total stranger. When we see worrying on a global scale, it is not surprising that we will be affected. So try to be the person who calms a friend or partner down, and you should both benefit. Don\u2019t buy everything in the supermarket, don\u2019t go out with symptoms, check on your neighbours, help each other out \u2013 because <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kindness-contagion/\">kindness</a> is contagious, too.</p>",
  "<p>Societies gripped by cataclysmic wars, depressions or pandemics can become acutely sensitive to power and privilege.</p> <p>Weeks before the coronavirus virus crushed the US stock market, the Republican senator Richard Burr apparently used information he gleaned from his role as chairman of the Senate intelligence committee about the ferocity of the coming pandemic to unload 33 stocks held by him and his spouse. They were estimated at being worth between $628,033 and $1.72m , in some industries likely to be hardest hit by the global outbreak.</p> <p>While publicly parroting Trump\u2019s happy talk at the time, Burr confided to several of his political funders that the disease would be comparable to the deadly 1918 flu pandemic.</p> <p>Then the market tanked, along with the retirement savings of millions of Americans.</p> <p>Even some pundits on Fox News are now calling for Burr\u2019s resignation.</p> <p>When society faces a common threat, exploiting a special advantage is morally repugnant. Call it \u201cBurring\u201d However tolerable Burring may be in normal times, it isn\u2019t now.</p> <p>In normal times, corporations get special favors from Washington in exchange for generous campaign contributions, and no one bats an eye. Recall the Trump tax cut, which delivered $1.9tn to big corporations and the wealthy.</p> <p>The coronavirus should have altered business as usual. But last week\u2019s Senate Republican relief package, giving airlines $58bn and billions more to other industries, is pure Burring.</p> <p>The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, tried lamely to distinguish it from the notorious bank bailouts of 2008. \u201cWe are not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We are talking about loans, which must be repaid, for American employers whom the government itself is temporarily crushing for the sake of public health.\u201d</p> <p>But the airlines are big enough to get their own loans from banks at rock-bottom interest rates. Their planes and landing slots are more than adequate collateral.</p> <p>Why do airlines deserve to be bailed out? Over the last decade they spent 96%of their free cashflow, including billions in tax savings from the Trump tax cut, to buy back shares of their own stock. This boosted executive bonuses and pleased wealthy investors but did nothing to strengthen the airlines for the long term. Meanwhile, the four biggest carriers gained so much market power they jacked up prices on popular routes and slashed services (remember legroom and free bag checks?).</p> <p>United\u2019s CEO, Oscar Munoz, did his own Burring on Friday, warning that if Congress doesn\u2019t bail out the airline by the end of March, United will start firing its employees. But even if bailed out, what are the odds United would keep paying all its workers if the pandemic forced it to stop flying? The bailout would be for shareholders and executives, not workers.</p> <p>While generous toward airlines and other industries, the Republican bill is absurdly stingy toward people, stipulating a one-time payment of up to $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. Some 64m households with incomes below $50,000 would get as little as $600. This will do almost nothing to help job-losers pay their mortgages, rents and other bills for the duration of the crisis, expected to be at least the next three months.</p> <p>The Republican coronavirus bill is about as Burring as legislation can be \u2013 exposing the underlying structure of power in America as clearly as Burr\u2019s stock trades. In this national crisis, it\u2019s just as morally repulsive.</p> <p>Take a look at how big corporations are treating their hourly workers in this pandemic and you see more Burring.</p> <p>Walmart, the largest employer in America, doesn\u2019t give its employees paid sick leave, and limits its 500,000 part-time workers to 48 hours paid time off per year. This Burring policy is now threatening countless lives. (On one survey, 88% of Walmart employees report sometimes coming to work when sick.)</p> <p>None of the giants of the fast-food industry \u2013 McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Duncan Donuts, Wendy\u2019s, Taco Bell, Subway \u2013 gives their workers paid sick leave, either.</p> <p>Amazon, one of the richest corporations in the world, which paid almost no taxes last year, is offering <em>unpaid</em> time off for workers who are sick and just two weeks paid leave for workers who test positive for the virus. Meanwhile, it demands its employees put in mandatory overtime.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the most Burring thing of all: these corporations have made sure they and other companies with more than 500 employees are exempt from the requirement in the House coronavirus bill that employers provide paid sick leave.</p> <p>At a time when almost everyone feels burdened and fearful, the use of power and privilege to exploit the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of others is morally intolerable.</p> <p>We are all in this together, or should be. Whatever form it takes, Burring must be stopped.</p>",

A senior figure in the government\u2019s research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he was applauded after he corrected the president about how quickly a coronavirus vaccine could be made available.</p> <p>Fauci, who has reported to six presidents, told Politico earlier this month: \u201cYou should never destroy your own credibility.

But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The Brooklyn-born doctor has been at the NIH since 1968, turning down repeated requests to lead the agency. In 1984, he was made head of its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which researches infectious diseases such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and Ebola.</p> <p>Some of Fauci\u2019s most influential work contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body\u2019s defences.

His father, who was shot dead in Athens when Whitty was a teenager in an apparent case of mistaken identity, worked for the British Council.

It took the fight against Hitler to finally eradicate the high unemployment of the 1920s and 1930s. Britain had full employment and would have had rising inflation had it not been for rationing and price controls.</p> <p>Contrast that with today. There are as yet only estimates of the likely hit to the economy from Covid-19, but they range from very bad to catastrophic. The consultancy Capital Economics has estimated a 15% drop in output in the second quarter of 2020 but said it could be 20%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">A hundred years on, will there be another Great Depression?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead of production being scaled up, it is being scaled back. There are a few sectors where activity is rising \u2013 food production and healthcare \u2013 but those increases will be dwarfed by the lost output elsewhere. Around a third of workers in the UK have jobs in the sectors most affected by the pandemic: retail, restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels, cinemas, theatres, gyms, sport \u2013 and they are all closed for business, possibly for months to come. This is not 1940, with factories working round the clock. It\u2019s more like a neutron-bomb attack that targets the people but leaves the buildings unscathed.</p> <p>Nor, unlike 1940, is it just a question of holding on until the Americans get involved. The US was never at threat of being invaded and was able to put its enormous economy on a war footing.</p> <p>But the US is not immune from the coronavirus. On the contrary, it is going to suffer grievously. This is in part because Donald Trump was in denial about the risks, in part because the public healthcare system is so poor, and in part because the social safety net is so weak. Given its size and place at the heart of the global financial system, the US will still have a vital role to play in any recovery, but the number of jobs lost as large parts of the economy go into hibernation is going to be colossal. The country is currently where it was in 1930, when the dole queues were lengthening after the Wall Street crash, rather than in its much more robust state a decade later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/uk-state-support-for-business-and-workers-reaches-new-heights\">UK state support for business and workers reaches new heights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those seeking parallels with the second world war need to broaden their perspective. One way of looking at today\u2019s events is to see the 15 years before the financial crisis of 2007-08 as the equivalent of the years leading up to the first world war. Although this seemed a peaceful, prosperous period \u2013 the so-called long Edwardian summer \u2013 things were not quite as benign as they seemed. The global balance of power was changing, and there was political unrest and growing class conflict. The first few years of the 21st century, marked by debt-fuelled growth and financial market anarchy were just as delusional.</p> <p>The financial crisis shattered the mood of complacency just as the outbreak of war did in 1914. Winning the struggle in both cases proved harder than expected, and in both cases there was an attempt once victory had been declared to go back to business as usual: balanced budgets and a return to the gold standard in the 1920s; balanced budgets, debt-driven growth and financial speculation in the 2010s.</p> <p>But turning the clock back proved impossible. Political discontent and anger grew as economies struggled. Trust in the democratic process frayed. There was little international cooperation.</p> <p>Then, around a decade and a half later in both cases, there was a second shock: the collapse of the financial bubble in 1929; the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. If history is any guide, it is the second shock that makes fundamental change possible.</p> <p>Four big things happened in the 1930s and 1940s. First, the old economics was abandoned. Countries came off the gold standard and states began to pump-prime growth, albeit timidly in most cases. Maynard Keynes\u2019s general theory inspired an entire generation of economists and policymakers.</p> <p>Second, there was an attempt to inject equity into economies through enhanced power for trade unions, more progressive taxation and the expansion of welfare states.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Third, work began early on this progressive agenda. In Britain, the Beveridge report, the Butler education act and the white paper on employment all emerged while the second world war was still raging.</p> <p>Finally, there were attempts to build a new international architecture through the creation of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which was intended to avoid the policy fragmentation of the 1930s.</p> <p>How close are we to a repeat of all this? Just consider, a model that has failed not once but twice has been ditched. Governments recognise they have to support their citizens through this. New ideas such as universal basic income are being championed, and without multilateral cooperation there will be no victory against Covid-19. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-crisis-ignites-bonfire-of-conservative-orthodoxies\">Sunak is right.</a> This is different, perhaps more fundamentally so than he thinks.</p>",

And get this: it\u2019s all going to be powered by electric vehicles\u2026\u201d Back in the 1970s, 94% of British households bought their milk this way, but by the 2000s, for the vast majority, it was part of the weekly supermarket shop. It wasn\u2019t technology that killed the centuries-old tradition so much as economic forces: deregulation of the dairy industry and supermarkets pushing plastic bottles. However, milk rounds still account for 3% of milk sales and they are growing in popularity. The revival is mostly down to the \u201c<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/25/plastics-revolution-marine-life\" title=\"\">Blue Planet</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/25/plastics-revolution-marine-life\" title=\"\"> effect</a>\u201d \u2013 glass is much more environmentally friendly than plastic. A typical glass milk bottle is reused 25 times. Come to think of it, why aren\u2019t we reusing Coke bottles, too?</p> <h2>Pagers</h2> <p>Pagers became popular in the 1980s as a fast way of sending a message to someone\u2026 who couldn\u2019t message back. You might imagine that the text message would have killed the pager. PageOne, the country\u2019s remaining service provider, stresses that the pager remains the most reliable and cost-effective way of sending out thousands of messages at a time, with far greater coverage than the mobile phone network (including on aeroplanes). Fire and ambulance services use them widely, with the NHS accounting for an estimated 10% of use worldwide \u2013 thanks to the 130,000 or so doctors who use them while on call. Many doctors say it\u2019s quicker and easier paging in emergency situations \u2013 mobile reception is patchy in many hospitals and paging doesn\u2019t interfere with electric equipment \u2013 and if it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it?</p> <h2>Google Glass</h2> <p>No gadget encapsulates the turn against the tech companies better than Glass, the eye-mounted computer launched by Google with great fanfare in 2013. It was sunk almost immediately amid privacy concerns and snarky people calling early adopters \u201cGlassholes\u201d. But it has an afterlife as a medical research tool. An MIT start-up called Brain Power builds software for Glass that helps children with autism and ADHD to build socio-emotional skills. Google also expanded its Glass at Work programme, which seeks business applications for the device.</p> <h2>Cassettes</h2> <p>The resurgence of vinyl is well-documented \u2013 records now outsell CDs \u2013 but last year, cassette tapes also surged to 19% growth in the US. OK, we\u2019re talking low baseline \u2013 from 99,400 to 118,200, a far cry from the mid-1990s when sales hit hundreds of millions. But the magnetic cassette is establishing a niche. The American company National Audio manufactures 18m blank cassettes annually, selling to 3,500 record labels across the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/16/international-cassette-store-day-announced-september-2013\" title=\"\">Cassette Store Day</a>, launched at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/23/rough-trade-new-york-store\" title=\"\">Rough Trade</a> in London in 2013 in response to the resounding success of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/record-store-day\" title=\"\">Record Store Day</a>, has since become an international event. Tapes are prized because they are affordable, easy to use and personal in a way that Spotify playlists are not. If you cannot imagine how you might have otherwise found a girlfriend/boyfriend without mixtapes, it is cheering.</p> <h2>Cheques</h2> <p>America is supposedly the world\u2019s leader in all things financial, but its retail banking systems look mediaeval to travellers from Europe, Africa and Asia. Direct bank transfers and online payments have been slow to catch on, chip and pin is seen as witchcraft, and cheques are still widely used. A 2018 study by the Federal Reserve found that consumers used cheques for 10% of purchases \u2013 more than electronic payments, which accounted for 8.9%.</p> <p>The UK government has been more proactive in phasing out cheques \u2013 but has still met fierce resistance from banks and customers (elderly people like them, so do charities). Cheques still accounted for \u00a3550bn worth of spending in 2018, the year the UK Payments Council had promised to phase them out by. Instead, the UK Payments Council has itself been phased out. Its replacement, <a href=\"https://www.wearepay.uk/\" title=\"\">wearepay.uk</a>, promises to phase them out under the New Payments Architecture project, due in 2024, at the earliest.</p> <h2>Dictaphones, calculators and maps</h2> <p>The stand-alone dictaphone, ideally reel-to-reel, remains an essential item for most journalists \u2013 despite apps that do the same thing on phones. The dictaphone is seen as more reliable. It doesn\u2019t stop recording when you take a call. It\u2019s easier to transcribe. And it doesn\u2019t do that heart-stopping thing where you hit \u201csave\u201d and your file disappears into the Cloud. \u201cSomething about the specific purpose of dictaphones, as opposed to a phone\u2019s multiple functions, makes them feel more secure,\u201d says one hack.</p> <p>The same is true for many of the functions supposedly outsourced to phones. Accountants remain attached to calculators. \u201cMuch quicker than opening an app for a quick sum and more pleasant to use,\u201d says one accountant. Walkers refuse to forego real maps \u2013 Ordnance Survey reports growing sales for both paper and digital versions \u2013 and the <em>London A-Z</em> doesn\u2019t lose reception on the Tube. An actual alarm clock doesn\u2019t bombard you with irritating messages when you wake up.</p> <h2>Dumbphones</h2> <p>The Nokia 3310 was the AK-47 of mobile phones \u2013 ubiquitous, utilitarian, nigh on indestructible. Introduced by Nokia in 2000, it soon became one of the world\u2019s most popular mobile phones, selling over 120m. Its chat feature and built in \u201capplications\u201d \u2013 such as a calculator! \u2013 were considered revolutionary. Then it secured affection thanks to the game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/feb/15/nokia-3310-back-snake-retro-basic-mobile\" title=\"\">Snake II</a>. But its week-long battery life and sheer durability made it a long-term winner \u2013 until Apple decided to make phones out of glass and overload them with apps so the batteries run out in a day.</p> <p>The Nokia 3310 was relaunched in 2017 to widespread acclaim and ushered in a new wave of \u201cdumbphones\u201d or \u201cfeature phones\u201d. Their cheapness, battery life and durability are key selling points \u2013 particularly in India, the Middle East and Africa \u2013 while westerners are embracing them as a cure for distraction.</p> <h2>Tamagotchi</h2> <p>The term \u201cTamagotchi effect\u201d was coined in 1997 to describe the complex emotional relationships that humans form with machines. It took its name from the Japanese virtual pet craze that inspired millions of children (and adults) to nurture digital aliens on egg-shaped devices in the hope that they would evolve into an adorable Mametchi \u2013 and hopefully not a stinky Tarakotchi. At the time, there were reports of bereft schoolchildren burying dead Tamagotchis in graveyards or skipping school to keep their Tamagotchis alive. Recent relaunches have failed to revive the craze, but there remains a devoted Tamagotchi community on the website <a href=\"https://www.tamatalk.com/\" title=\"\">Tama Talk</a>. \u201cI find that whenever I need to do something a little bit stressful or daunting, I tend to start up a new or old virtual pet as a way of getting through it,\u201d one user told the <em>Happy Reader</em> last year.</p> <h2>DVD rental</h2> <p>DVDs: who needs them? Well, Netflix announced that it had made $200m from its video rental business in the US, where 2.7 million of its customers still elect to receive DVDs through the post. The streaming giant started life as a DVD rental company in America (LoveFilm, now owned by Amazon, occupied the niche in the UK) and apparently has no plans to abandon the service until at least 2025. One reason is that internet coverage is so unreliable in rural areas. But might the poor selection of films on Netflix and other streaming services also help nurture demand?</p> <p>DVD rental shops are still relatively common in Paris where <a href=\"http://jmvideo.fr/\" title=\"\">JM Vid\u00e9o</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/boutiquepotemkine/\" title=\"\">Potemkine </a>are prized by cin\u00e9philes who point to a lack of decent movie streaming sites. And a few well-loved establishments cling on in the UK. Bristol\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.20thcenturyflicks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">20th Century Flicks</a>, for example, hires out its screening room for parties and film clubs, and its staff recommendations beat an algorithm any day.</p> <h2>Shorthand</h2> <p>There is still a strong school of thought on news desks that dictaphones themselves are an unnecessary encumbrance \u2013 never mind iPhones or fancy AI transcription apps. Pete Clifton, the editor-in-chief of PA, Britain\u2019s largest news agency, recently announced that a shorthand speed of 100 words per minute was an \u201cabsolute requirement\u201d. \u201cAny application without it goes straight in the bin,\u201d he told <em>Press Gazette</em>. Not only is it essential for court reporting \u2013 where reporters are forbidden from making recordings \u2013 but Clifton also asserted: \u201cAny reporter who can take a rapid note on the doorstep, then read it straight back to the news desk or write it into a story, is always going to beat someone who has to listen back to a recording.\u201d</p> <h2>Faxes</h2> <p>The NHS is reckoned to be the world\u2019s foremost purchaser of fax machines \u2013 9,000 were still in use in 2018. Matt Hancock, health secretary, has demanded that trusts stop using the \u201carchaic\u201d devices by the end of this month, citing inefficiencies and security risks. Still, if you\u2019ve ever sat in your GP\u2019s surgery while they refer you to a hospital appointment, you will know that a fax remains the communication device of choice.</p> <p>But once a particular technology is embedded, it\u2019s not so straightforward to remove. In Japan, millions of faxes are still sent daily to apply for job interviews, send restaurant orders ahead and RSVP to parties. Japan is a famously tech-forward nation. It also has three alphabets and an ageing population, many of whom find it easier to write the characters out by hand. Rather endearingly, the art critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/19/brian-sewell\" title=\"\">Brian Sewell</a> wrote all his reviews by typewriter and faxed them to the <em>Evening Standard</em> until he died in 2015.</p> <h2>Analogue film</h2> <p>Kodak is arguably the most famous casualty of the digital era. The once giant company continued to push analogue film cameras long after its competitors had moved on \u2013 and collapsed as a result.</p> <p>Sales of camera film dropped from nearly 1bn rolls per year in 2003 to about 20m last year. However, like vinyl and cassette, the market has stabilised and 35mm photographic film has witnessed a mini-revival among the Instagram generation, many of whom are rooting around in their parents\u2019 attics in search of unused rolls and frantically bidding on eBay for affordable cameras. When everyone else is applying the same digital filters, you can make your photos stand out by using film. \u201cIt\u2019s honest and unprejudiced, not simply a part of the batch of replicas that digital photography can produce,\u201d writes one enthusiast. Meanwhile, an unlikely secondary market has developed in used film, which can go for up to \u00a3100 on eBay. Fans develop the mystery rolls and share the often disquieting results on the Reddit forum <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/forgottenfilm/\" title=\"\">r/forgottenfilm</a>.</p> <h2>Polaroid</h2> <p>Polaroid was the Apple of its day. The SX-70 collapsible instant camera, unveiled by Edwin Land in 1972, was an instant revolution in photography. It was camera and dark room in one. Andy Warhol made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/18/strictly-analogue-polaroids-past-present-and-future-a-photo-essay\" title=\"\">Polaroids</a> central to his process, as did David Hockney with Polaroid \u201cjoiners\u201d. Until digital cameras appeared in the 1990s, a Polaroid was the only way you could see what you\u2019d just snapped instantly. The original corporation went bankrupt in 2001 and the company that took on the Polaroid brand went bankrupt in 2008. But the technology lives on under the Polaroid Originals brand and has found a whole new audience, especially when rephotographed with a digital camera and popped up on Instagram. The hip-hop photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stillz/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@stillz</a> has won an avid following for her Polaroids. Digital age gratification + analogue age authenticity = an irresistible combination.</p> <h2>Texting</h2> <p>The basic text message or SMS (short messaging system) has been steadily falling out of use in the smartphone era from a global peak of 8tr messages per year in 2012. We are still messaging each other \u2013 more than ever \u2013 it\u2019s just that we\u2019re mostly using OTT (over-the-top) services like Messenger, Telegram and WhatsApp.</p> <p>However, texts have been having a mini-resurgence: Three UK, for example, reports a 30% increase in text volumes last year. With lots of us on different apps, a text message is usually the safest way to ensure your message arrives with the requisite \u201cping\u201d. It\u2019s one reason SMS is increasingly popular with marketers and businesses. According to one commercial survey, 90% of texts are read within three minutes; texts have a 209% higher response rate than phone, email or Facebook; more people can receive texts than any other type of message; and people are just happier to receive them, too. The Future Laboratory describes SMS as \u201cthe surprising underdog as brands are looking for other ways to grab people\u2019s attention\u201d. More personal than a chatbot too. So prepare to receive a lot more marketing texts in the next few years.</p> <h2>Public payphones</h2> <p>There are still 10,000 or so red telephone boxes on Britain\u2019s streets, including Sir Giles Gilbert Scott\u2019s 1924 Kiosk 2 prototype, which you will find outside the Royal Academy on Piccadilly in London. The K2 was voted the greatest British design of all time in 2015. But what is to be done with them in the age of the smartphone? Some have found new life as mini-libraries, many house defibrillators, others are used as coffee stands and most are purely decorative. But given the excess supply and declining demand, why are thousands of brand new phone kiosks being built? InLinks kiosks, which combine advertising screens, CCTV, public wifi and surveillance technology, are now a common sight in London. They are made by a consortium of BT, advertising company Primesight and \u201csmart cities\u201d firm Intersection, which is owned by Alphabet. Archaic planning laws make it hard for councils to object. Citizens may not need phone boxes \u2013 but surveillance capitalists do.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if you\u2019re nostalgic for the days when telephone boxes were handsome, useful items of street furniture, you can buy a K6 box for \u00a32,750 (plus VAT and delivery) through BT\u2019s approved reseller <a href=\"https://www.x2connect.com/\" title=\"\">X2Connect</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Germany\u2019s relatively low mortality rate continues to intrigue experts as Covid-19 spreads across Europe, with some questioning the methodology behind its data gathering while others argue the country\u2019s high testing rates allow a more accurate approximation of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus.</p> \n<p>While the pandemic has hit Germany with full force, with Johns Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">noting</a> 22,364 confirmed infections by Sunday morning, only 84 people are so far reported to have died.</p> \n<p>This means Germany currently has the lowest mortality rate of the 10 countries most severely hit by the pandemic: 0.3% compared with 9% in Italy and 4.6% in the UK.</p> \n<p>The contrast with Italy is especially surprising because the two countries have the <a href=\"https://www.prb.org/which-country-has-the-oldest-population/\">highest percentage of citizens aged 65</a> or over in Europe. If anything, the <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/healthiest-countries/\">Bloomberg Global Health Index</a> would suggest Italians have a healthier lifestyle than Germans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the government\u2019s central public health body, has said he does not expect there to be a significant difference in mortality rates between Italy and Germany in the long run.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say whether Germany is better medically prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic than other countries,\u201d said Marylyn Addo, who heads the infectiology department at Hamburg\u2019s University Medical Centre.</p> \n<p>One likely explanation for the discrepancy in figures, Addo suggested, was that while northern Italy\u2019s hospitals are being overrun with new patients, Germany\u2019s are not yet at full capacity and have had more time to clear beds, stock up on equipment and redistribute personnel.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne advantage Germany has is that we started doing professional contact tracing when the first cases were reported,\u201d Addo said. \u201cIt bought us some time to prepare our clinics for the coming storm.\u201d</p> \n<p>Crucially, Germany started testing people even with milder symptoms relatively early on, meaning the total number of confirmed cases may give a more accurate picture of the virus\u2019s spread than in other states.</p> \n<p>According to Germany\u2019s National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the country has capacity for about 12,000 Covid-19 tests per day, while Wieler has claimed it has capacity for 160,000 tests per week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While Germany has not tested its citizens at the same high rate practised in South Korea, guidelines have been in place for more than a month for people to be tested even if they have early-stage symptoms but have either had contact with an infected person or recently visited a \u201chigh-risk area\u201d such as Lombardy in Italy or Wuhan in China.</p> \n<p>The age profile of those affected in the first few weeks has also been younger than in other countries, many of them fit and healthy people returning from skiing resorts in Austria or Italy, which would also help explain the low mortality rate.</p> \n<p>\u201cI assume that many young Italians are or were infected without ever being detected,\u201d Christian Drosten, a virologist at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital, <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2020-03/christian-drosten-coronavirus-pandemic-germany-virologist-charite\">told the newspaper Die Zeit</a>. \u201cThis also explains the virus\u2019s supposedly higher mortality rate there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Drosten, who has been advising the German health ministry, has also warned that Germany\u2019s mortality rate is likely to rise in the coming weeks as high-risk areas become harder to identify and testing capacity becomes stretched.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will appear that the virus has become more dangerous, but this will be a statistical artefact, a distortion. It will simply reflect what\u2019s already starting to happen: we\u2019re missing more and more infections.\u201d</p> \n<p>The methodology behind Germany\u2019s data gathering could also play into the discrepancy between Italian and German figures.</p> \n<p>If a patient is tested positive for Covid-19 in Germany, the doctor will notify the local health authority, which will then digitally transfer the data to the Robert Koch Institute. The lag in this process explains why the RKI\u2019s daily figures have been consistently lower than those from Johns Hopkins University, which updates its data tables more frequently. By 10am on Sunday morning, for example, the RKI only notes 55 fatalities in Germany.</p> \n<p>Unlike in Italy, there is currently no widespread postmortem testing for the novel coronavirus in Germany. The RKI says those who were not tested for Covid-19 in their lifetime but are suspected to have been infected with the virus \u201ccan\u201d be tested after death, but in Germany\u2019s decentralised health system this is not yet a routine practice.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>As a result, it is theoretically possible that there could be people who may have died in their homes before being tested and who do not show up in the statistics.</p> \n<p>Practising medical specialists such as Addo do not believe this number of unreported cases to be statistically significant. \u201cI have yet to see any data that would suggest a large number of untested corona-related deaths that don\u2019t show up in the statistics,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cClinics dealing with respiratory illnesses have been on high alert about the virus for weeks, so I would be very surprised if there was a significant figure of uncharted deaths.\u201d</p> \n<p> The RKI\u2019s official mortality figures include both people who have died of the virus as well as those infected and with underlying health problems, where the precise cause of death could not be determined.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain sees deaths rise by almost 400 and more than 3,600 new cases</h2> <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus deaths in Spain has risen by almost 400, or 30%, in 24 hours, as the government is reported to be extending its state of emergency by another 15 days.

measures.</p> <p>With Victoria lining up to close schools early on Sunday, Morrison repeated his earlier arguments that widespread closures of schools \u201cwould seriously impact and disrupt the health workforce that is needed to save lives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe would only take further measures based on medical advice because, at the same time that we are trying to protect lives, we are also trying to protect the livelihoods of Australians and that means acting on medical advice.\u201d</p> <p>However, the prime minister said the measures agreed by all state and territory leaders set a \u201cbaseline\u201d, and individual states would still prepare \u201ctailored\u201d responses, based on their individual circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cYou will see more regional focus to this, more targeted responses from states and territories and that will be done at their instigation, based on their health advice,\u201d Morrison said.</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, also said that different states could go it alone, even though the prime minister was \u201cvery keen on keeping a federal national approach\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEach of the states and territories have their own particular issues they need to deal with,\u201d Kelly said on Sunday.</p> <p>On the new travel restrictions, Morrison said that after consultation with state leaders, the government advice had been elevated to recommending that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/non-essential-travel-what-do-australias-latest-coronavirus-restrictions-mean\">all non-essential travel should be cancelled</a>.</p> <p>He said essential travel could include work-related travel or travel on compassionate grounds, but that \u201csensible decisions\u201d needed to be made to protect the broader community, including the cancellation of Easter holiday plans.</p> <p>\u201cTravel needs to be reduced to stop the spread of the virus across the country,\u201d Morrison said.</p> <p>As a result of the changes, the prime minister said it might not be physically possible to convene Parliament over the next six months, with an \u201cemergency mode\u201d of operation being considered.</p> <p>Morrison said more government assistance would be forthcoming as the crisis unfolded. \u201cThere will be more packages and more support,\u201d Morrison said.</p> <p>The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was focused on shielding the economy from the shock of the downturn, which was now expected to be \u201cdeeper, wider and longer\u201d than first anticipated.</p> <p>\u201cEvery arm of government and industry is working to keep Australians in jobs and businesses in business and to build a bridge to recovery on the other side.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

More than 2,700 people were allowed to disembark from the Ruby Princess at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay, despite more than 150 cases of illness being logged onboard. The Ruby Princess now accounts for 26 confirmed cases of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>The statement appears to, at times, shift the blame to the federal government.

Here it is in full:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>NSW assessments on cruise ships entering our ports has exceeded Federal Government protocols and was doing so, well in advance of the National Protocol*, that was issued on March 6 2020.</p> \n   <p>Notwithstanding that, the Federal Government has not increased any protocol procedures relating to cruise ships since March 6.</p> \n   <p>Today, the NSW Government further enhanced its procedures to minimise the risk of passengers with any respiratory conditions whatsoever from departing cruise ships until COVID-19 tests can be carried out on onshore laboratories.</p> \n   <p>Since February 14, NSW Health has applied assessment procedures to all 63 ships entering Sydney Harbour. The National Protocol does not direct jurisdictions to do such assessments but instead, leave it to the State\u2019s discretion.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to some public statements made, every cruise liner that has entered NSW ports has been the subject of an assessment well beyond Federal requirements.</p> \n   <p>The National Protocol states \u201cprovided there are no concerns about the COVID-19 risk profile of a ship or suspected COVID-19 cases reported, the human bio-security officer may advise the bio-security officer that pratique can be granted and the ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health undertook a full assessment of the Ruby Princess, notwithstanding under the National Protocol in place, it could have chosen not to do an assessment.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health again followed the National Protocol that states \u201cthe ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>However, as of midnight March 22, NSW Health will go even further beyond the National Protocol and its current own State protocols and will hold all cruise ships in port until any patients highlighted as having respiratory issues are tested for COVID-19.</p> \n   <p>The increased testing regime follows 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Ruby Princess, including 17 passengers and 1 crew member diagnosed in NSW, and 8 passengers diagnosed interstate (as of 8 pm yesterday).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T08:03:05.716Z\">at 8.03am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7717978f08e0999e6b7e97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:49:13.922Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Carlton and United Breweries, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/cub-55-workers-have-won-all-demands-in-industrial-dispute-says-union\">whose mistreatment of 55 workers</a> prompted national outrage in 2016, says it is <strong>concerned about brewery jobs</strong> after the Victorian government announced its shutdown of non-essential industries. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Carlton and United Breweries are worried about brewery jobs and beer supplies. \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/abcmelbourne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@abcmelbourne</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://t.co/69gJxiWQvb\">pic.twitter.com/69gJxiWQvb</a></p>\u2014 Richard Willingham (@rwillingham) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7710948f08a08573fbf303\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:30:28.308Z\">7.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ACT says schools will be 'pupil free' from Tuesday</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just back to the ACT momentarily, the government has also announced it <strong>will be shifting rapidly to online learning in schools</strong>.

The SA police commissioner will also declare a major emergency in that state \u2014 that replaces the public health emergency that was previously declared, and means that emergency provisions are authorised under the Emergency Management Act and not the Public Health Act. </p> \n  <p>Police are responsible for enforcing that act, so the emergency management response will now be coordinated by the police commissioner. This is similar to what Tasmania announced on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said the measure was announced after<strong> a number of cases in SA in recent days were of people who had contracted the virus after returning from interstate, or contracted it from people visiting from interstate.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has forced our decision to close our borders in South Australia. We make this decision in the interest of public health in South Australia. <strong>People that are coming into South Australia, whether they are visitors or whether they are South Australians returning, will be required to undertake 14 days of self isolation.</strong> This is no longer something which is optional. It is mandatory. It is the social responsibility of every single person in this state to make sure that they are abiding by these rules. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The laws will come into force on 4pm on Tuesday. Border control stations will be set up at the airport, at train stations, and on roads entering SA \u2014 repurposing heavy vehicle inspections stations and biosecurity stations that already exist on the border.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When people come into South Australia, from four o\u2019clock onTuesday afternoon, they will be required to understand precisely the orders that will be in place. <strong>They will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self isolate and they will be required to provide SA Police with information on where they will be undertaking their self isolation</strong>. There will be tests on this important declaration and this commitment individuals regarding this very, very important Public safety initiative. </p> \n   <p>There will be some arrangements put in place along borders because we know that in country South Australia, sometimes two towns on either side of the border have a high level of interaction ... People that do live in those communities will be allowed to move between those communities once they have been identified as somebody in on of those communities but, I stress, if there is any reason to believe that there is an outbreak on the immediate other side of the border, then that\u2019ll have to also be curtailed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Marshall said there would be some \u201clogical exceptions\u201d to the quarantine requirements, particularly around freight.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:38:01.470Z\">at 3.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e76d8078f08a08573fbf24c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:17:00.864Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW premier says she will introduce a 'more comprehensive' lockdown of non-essential services</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the full statement from the NSW premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, on a \u201cmore comprehensive lockdown of non-essential services\u201d in NSW.<br></p> \n  <p>The statement reads:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>Tonight I will be informing the National Cabinet that NSW will proceed to a <strong>more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services.

The rate for a single person with no children will now be <strong>$1,115.70 a fortnight</strong>. </p> \n  <p>That will be accomplished with a <strong>massive $550 per fortnight top-up payment </strong>to everyone on JobSeeker Payment.

What this means is, while your dole payments will be <a href=\"https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/jobseeker-payment/how-much-you-can-get/income-and-asset-limits\">tapered according to your earnings</a>, as long as don\u2019t earn $1,100 in a fortnight (which means you lose your payments all together), you will still get the full $550 supplement.</p> \n  <p>This will be crucial for casual workers and sole-traders, the government says. </p> \n  <p>The government is also waiving the liquid assets waiting test, meaning people will not have to whittle down their savings before accessing Jobseeker Payment.</p> \n  <p>People on <strong>Youth Allowance JobSeeker, Parenting Payment, Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit</strong> will also get this $550 fortnightly top-up payment.</p> \n  <p>Notably, disability support pensioners (who currently receive a maximum rate of $944 a fortnight) do not appear to be eligible for the extra payment, according to the press release. </p> \n  <p>On top of the temporary boost to income support payments, there is also an <strong>extra $750 stimulus payment from 13 July 2020 to around 5 million welfare recipients</strong>, veterans and eligible concession card holders.

  "<p>For most Britons and Americans, the cold war means images of central European cities in the 1950s, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/what-cuban-missile-crisis\" title=\"\">Cuban </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/what-cuban-missile-crisis\" title=\"\">missile </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/what-cuban-missile-crisis\" title=\"\">crisis</a>, Checkpoint Charlie and spies in Berlin in the 60s, armies lined up on northern German plains in the 70s, the apparently imminent prospect of nuclear destruction and Reagan\u2019s \u201cstar wars\u201d in the 80s \u2013 followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union liberating a restive eastern Europe and leaving a triumphant US, the leader of the \u201cfree world\u201d, as the undisputed victor.</p> <p>In recent years, this vision has been challenged by new research and writing. No longer just a binary confrontation, the cold war is being reframed as something much more global and complex; a set of interrelated battles that touched hundreds of millions of lives on every continent.</p> <p>Lorenz L\u00fcthi\u2019s ambitious <em>Cold Wars</em> is the latest major work to suggest that our understanding and collective memories of the conflict should be reassessed. With 700-odd pages of dense, dry text, it is a heavyweight contribution. Many works by serious modern historians have successfully bridged the gap between the lecture theatre and the airport bookshop without sacrificing intellectual rigour. L\u00fcthi\u2019s book is not among them. This is a shame, because his powerful insights deserve a bigger audience.</p> <p>One of the main achievements of the new writing about the cold war is to revise ideas of the relationship between the superpowers and local actors. Fifteen years ago, Odd Arne Westad, a Yale historian who grew up on a cold war frontline in Norway, published an important academic work (<em>The Global Cold War</em>) showing how regional leaders were not simply puppets but effective opportunists who played on the needs, hopes and ignorance of officials in Washington or Moscow.</p> <p>A second aim of this new thinking is to overturn the idea that the feud brought \u201ca long peace\u201d, as suggested by an earlier generation of largely US-based academics. Paul Thomas Chamberlin, a historian at Columbia University, argued in <em>The Cold War\u2019s Killing </em><em>Fields</em> (2018) that while Europe and, particularly, North America remained largely untouched by real conflict, that was not the case elsewhere.</p> <p>Chamberlin sees a crescent running from north-east china and Manchuria through south-east Asia, across South Asia and into the Middle East as the primary zone of cold war confrontation, and discerns three separate waves of violence. The first, in the 1940s and 50s, ravaged east Asia and was closely tied to the collapse of the Japanese empire and the Chinese Revolution. The second was a consequence of ideological battles and superpower competition in the Asia Pacific region. The third wave, shaped in part by the Iranian Revolution, was focused on the Middle East, though by the 1980s the ideological conflicts of earlier decades had evolved into skirmishes based on ethnic or sectarian identity. Massacres such as that committed by US soldiers at My Lai in Vietnam were far from aberrations and Chamberlin describes the mass violence committed in successive theatres of conflict in harrowing detail. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The cold war is being reframed as something far more global; a set of interrelated battles that touched millions of lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As befits a specialist in international relations, L\u00fcthi\u2019s book views the world through this discipline \u2013 or at least its more traditional practitioners. This has its uses. The scope is vast and the detail impressive. Passages dealing with the fairly disastrous foreign policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/charles-de-gaulle\" title=\"\">Charles de Gaulle</a> in the 60s and the rise of a new conservatism in Europe and the US in the early 80s are fresh and welcome.</p> <p>But such a focus on states and statecraft has drawbacks. This is world history as a giant game of Risk. The only voices in the book are those of powerful men, and we barely hear even those among the descriptions of pacts, alliances, diplomatic initiatives, conferences, agreements or treaties. Women are almost entirely absent (exceptions being Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir ). So too are the weak, the disenfranchised and the victims of the conflicts that L\u00fcthi describes. Nor was the cold war fought only in chancelleries. Among the most potent weapons of the \u201cfree world\u201d were rock music and denim. The socialist armoury did not just comprise SS-20 missiles but gymnasts and chess grandmasters. Neither features.</p> <p>With such an ambitious and serious book, it seems churlish to point out errors. But one of the risks of writing history on such a scale is that factual mistakes are almost inevitable. For example, it was the Black September organisation, led by men who were close to Yasser Arafat, that was responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/may/02/50-stunning-olympic-moments-munich-72\" title=\"\">terrorist attack</a> on the Munich Olympics in 1972, not the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Equally, the most recent research suggests that the so-called \u201cArab Afghans\u201d, the foreigners who fought with the mujahideen against the Soviets and their local auxiliaries in Afghanistan, numbered around 7,000, not 25,000. This is important today, when we attempt to work out the potential threat posed by the many more such fighters who joined Isis.</p> <p>L\u00fcthi convincingly argues that the cold war was effectively over much earlier than the moment marked by the fall of the Berlin Wall. It had ended in the Middle East by the late 1970s, and in Asia by the early 80s. In Europe, the economic exhaustion of the socialist camp, growing integration of Soviet satellite states into the global economy and the surging wealth of western nations meant the conflict was effectively over well before the frenzied scenes of celebration in Germany\u2019s capital.</p> <p>A long-term consequence of the cold war in Europe was resurgence of ethno-nationalism and national conservative movements and parties, L\u00fcthi writes. The EU deserves criticism for many things, but populist enemies exploit its weaknesses for short-term political gain, forgetting that the process of western European integration has guaranteed peace and prosperity since 1945. This is an achievement that should not be easily gambled away, he warns. The winners and losers of the cold war are still being counted and its ghosts are with us still.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Cold Wars: Asia, the Middle East, Europe</em> by Lorenz L\u00fcthi is published by <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cold-wars/9A581A5A18BE15169D34FE39D2D962E1\" title=\"\">Cambridge University Press</a> (\u00a326.99)</p>",
  "<p>Much has been written about Britons who fought in Syria, but little truly explains who these characters were, what made them tick. Or what actually happened when they disappeared into the byzantine politics of its brutal war. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/no-return-9781783351817.html\">No Return</a></em> tracks five teenage friends from Brighton who stepped into its chaos. All were killed except one. The survivor, Amer Deghayes, is the longest-serving Briton in Syria since the fighting began and offers a unique account of a ceaseless, shifting conflict.</p> <p>Equally crucial are those he left behind. I learned that more than 30 Brightonians \u2013 the largest identified group of potential jihadists in western Europe \u2013 had discussed plans to join him. All were between 13 and 18 years of age, some were girls, most were white, working-class Islamic converts from the forgotten estates of east Brighton.</p> <p>Investigating what had happened to these youngsters I discovered the Hillstreet Gang (HSG), whose members had converted to Islam in a makeshift gym. For several years the police considered them the most notorious street gang in Brighton. A hidden, violent side of the city revealed itself.</p> <p>Throughout the summer of 2018 I tracked down prominent members one by one, knowing that approaching the group would mean instant rejection.</p> <p>But like their friends who had disappeared in Syria, key figures would vanish from Brighton, often into prison. One central member of HSG who appears in <em>No Return</em> was jailed for 20 years, so I didn\u2019t get the chance to interview him.</p> <p>Soon after another of the book\u2019s key figures, Amer\u2019s brother Abdul, was killed in an alleged drugs dispute.</p> <p>It was a death as sudden and savage as that of his friends who had entered Syria. But Abdul\u2019s vulnerability, like the others, had been signposted long before, raising questions over how we view those seen as different. Do we try to understand or do we push them further to the margins, deeper into violence?</p> <h2>Extract from No Return: The True Story of How Martyrs Are Made</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cfd197262e7334d214b8f264d77edfacb030532\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cfd197262e7334d214b8f264d77edfacb030532/0_0_3500_2329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saltdean in Brighton, East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saltdean in Brighton, East Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Hasson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was calm on Saltdean beach, the hum of the A259 drowned out by the surf. As a young teenager, Amer Deghayes would come here for peace and stand up to his ankles in the water, peering into the sea.</p> <p>Peace was a fleeting concept when you lived with four younger brothers. The nearest in age to Amer were twins Abdullah and Abdul. Next came Jaffar. Mohammed, the youngest, was the quietest. Accompanying them would be their mother Einas, a timid woman whose parental strategy was geared towards kindness with as little confrontation as possible. Her husband, Abubaker, was a thickset alpha male with a prayer bump on his forehead that proved his piety.</p> <p>Amer was named after Abubaker\u2019s father, Amer Taher Deghayes, a lawyer who had pioneered trade unions in Libya, and decades later remained a celebrated figure among a slice of the country\u2019s liberal intelligentsia. He was also co-founder of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Ba%27ath_Movement\">Ba\u2019ath movement</a> that challenged Libya\u2019s leader Muammar Gaddafi for power. It was a perilous, courageous move. And one that meant Amer never met his grandfather. Amer senior was arrested by Gaddafi\u2019s security officials 14 years before his grandson was born, and died in custody.

They bought a house in the Sussex village of Saltdean, a conservative place of net curtains and neat flowerbeds a short walk from the beach. They were its only Muslim family. Abubaker studied business at Lewes College, ran an old people\u2019s home and married his cousin, Einas Abulsayen.</p> <p>Abubaker\u2019s brother Omar, inspired by their father, became a lawyer with ambitions to represent the oppressed. After graduating in law from the University of Wolverhampton, Omar, 31, travelled to Afghanistan on a round-the-world trip to experience Islamic cultures. There he was embroiled in the US invasion that followed the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Captured by mercenaries and sold for a reported $5,000 to US intelligence, he was deported to Guantanamo Bay in a case of mistaken identity, confused with a Saudi jihadist who was later killed by Russian forces.</p> <p>Omar spent almost 2,000 days inside the gulag, where he was tortured and lost the sight of one eye. By the time he returned to Brighton in 2007 his wife, whom he had met on his travels, had divorced him. He had lost everything.</p> <p>Abubaker, who devoted years to getting his brother released, and remained traumatised by the loss of his father, was a figure who corroborated the thesis that violence flows down generations. Einas felt her husband had unaddressed mental health issues. Whatever the truth, documents from police and social services suggested that for years the family privately endured his volatile temper.</p> <p>Things came to a head in November 2010 when the emergency helpline of a local charity for victims of domestic abuse received a call from a friend of Einas, gravely concerned for her safety and that of her five sons. In detail, the caller recounted how Abubaker had that weekend become \u201cvery physically aggressive, smashing up mobile phones and other items. Family had to lock themselves in one room and call the police,\u201d stated a summary of the call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"498ac3e637e5738db57c9833680ce2e650a2bc6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/498ac3e637e5738db57c9833680ce2e650a2bc6f/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Omar Deghayes, who was held in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years and subjected to torture that left him blind in his right eye.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Omar Deghayes, who was held in Guantanamo Bay for more than five years and subjected to torture that left him blind in his right eye.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three days later police received another call; the details were macabre. Amer and the others were allegedly lined up and \u201cwhipped with electrical leads or computer cables\u201d by their father, who contests the claims against him.</p> <p>In light of these allegations, the five boys received a child protection order forbidding Abubaker contacting them. But their troubles were far from over. At Longhill school the four younger boys were subjected to racist comments and bullying. The attacks were daily, merciless and unrelenting. Water was lobbed over the twins as they queued for lunch in the canteen. Bread buns were hurled at them as they ate. Taunts of \u201cPaki\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d followed them around the playground. They were cornered and beaten on the school bus back to Saltdean.</p> <p>Even when they made it to home turf, there was no respite. Anti-Islamic graffiti began appearing on the quaint seafront promenade, 200 metres from the family home. Adjacent to their house lay Saltdean Oval, the park where the Deghayes boys played football on summer evenings. It was their favourite pastime, until the bullies from Longhill began targeting them there. They stopped playing football, a decision that upset all the brothers. At night, their attackers would mass at the Oval and creep up the hill towards their home where they would stand in the small front garden, shouting obscenities, the familiar favourites of \u201cPaki\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d. Bricks would hit the house. Some of the gang would start kicking the front door. When they grew bored, they would leave. Then the family would quietly shuffle to bed, too petrified to venture downstairs.</p> <p>According to local activists, police gave the impression they were happy to abandon the family. The twins in particular felt the police did not respond to the racism and that reports of harassment and antisocial behaviour against them were not investigated, according to one of their case workers. Behind Brighton\u2019s progressive image of green politics, veganism and tolerance was a competing, ugly reality.</p> <p>During the spring term of 2010 the twins made a pact that the bullies wouldn\u2019t win. They installed boxing equipment in their parents\u2019 Saltdean garage and spent hours pummelling punchbags they pretended were the torsos of their adversaries. They worked out every night, buoyed when their arms and necks started to thicken.</p> <p>Their transformation from bullied children to ringleaders was rapid. Those present at the Deghayeses\u2019 third child protection conference in mid-July 2011 were startled. Though the meeting had been convened to determine if the boys were safe from their father, it became evident that the tables were turned. Officials were alarmed by the speed of the power shift. \u201cThe five boys would now take on their father and not be abused by him. They have become both a powerful group in the community and in the family home,\u201d their assessment concluded.</p> <p>Over the next couple of years, while Amer remained a diligent student, Abdullah, Abdul and Jaffar were routinely excluded from school. The twins enrolled others who were ostracised from mainstream education and formed the Hillstreet Gang, which Jaffar also joined. HSG quickly became notorious for violence, dealing weed and troublemaking throughout the city, resulting in a blanket ban for all members from most of the city\u2019s shops, bars and public spaces in May 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7060a83f8cc155371f4f8dcabd49f22c4eba9964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7060a83f8cc155371f4f8dcabd49f22c4eba9964/0_0_306_435/306.jpg\" alt=\"Jaffar Deghayes.\" width=\"306\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaffar Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around this time Amer set up a rudimentary gym at the al-Quds mosque, where Abubaker had just become a trustee. And, in part because their reputation meant no other gym in the city allowed them entry, HSG joined a cohort of teenagers who were gathering there daily</p> <p>The police monitoring the Deghayeses and others viewed the popularity of the mosque gym \u2013 dubbed the Brothers\u2019 Gym by the gang \u2013 as an unequivocally positive development. Jaffar\u2019s attendance at the mosque had, after all, coincided with an abrupt fall in his offending.</p> <p>Amer, who was now commuting daily to London\u2019s Oxford Street to a job in Specsavers, was delighted that so many of his brothers\u2019 friends were turning to Islam. The converts learned how to prostrate themselves, kneeling with their foreheads pointing towards Mecca. They were taught Arabic phrases, such as \u201c<em>As-Salaam-Alaikum</em>\u201d, meaning \u201cPeace be unto you\u201d.</p> <p>Twelve months previously the twins had seldom identified as Muslims; now Islam became the gang\u2019s identity. By March 2013 at least 20 of the group called themselves Muslim. For many in the gang it was the first belief system they had.</p> <p>But the largely positive energy inside the gym was about to change. The group often watched videos on their phones and a film about the Syrian civil war had electrified Amer. A German film-maker had spent weeks inside Aleppo, documenting its civilian population under siege.</p> <p>Screened on <em>Channel 4 News </em>on 25 March 2013, it followed a group of exhausted kids working in a makeshift hospital. They attempted to keep other children, pale and bloodied, from death. One boy was no more than 12, a doctor\u2019s coat drowning his frame. He had an 11-year-old friend, Yusef, who helped him tend to the wounded. The film closed with Yusef lying dead, open-mouthed, in the place where he once helped others. He had been killed by a Syrian army bomb.</p> <p>Amer was overcome with a sensation that felt unusual: rage. Others were asking how Bashar al-Assad could get away with killing his own people, the country\u2019s children. Even the twins, preoccupied with their own combat zone on the streets of Brighton, railed against Assad.</p> <p>Something else in the Channel 4 film caught Amer\u2019s eye. Standing against Assad in the absence of western intervention was an Islamist group called Jabhat al-Nusra. The programme followed them handing out food and clothing to Aleppo\u2019s stranded civilians, giving spiritual guidance, relaxing after a firefight by playing <em>Fifa</em>. Amer began investigating al-Nusra, watching grainy footage of men carrying AK-47s marching behind tanks and shouting <em>Allahu-Akbar </em>after every victory.</p> <p>March had been the bloodiest month of the Syrian war with 6,000 deaths. Amer said it was obvious the <em>ummah </em>\u2013 the community of Muslims \u2013 needed defending. He said that every Muslim in the group, including the converts, had a duty. The gang agreed there was a need to fight back. One Islamic concept was starting to appeal: jihad.</p> <p>Over the summer he spent hours studying the cleric <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/anwar-al-awlaki\">Anwar al-Awlaki</a>, who two years earlier had been killed in a US drone strike in Yemen\u2019s tribal badlands. Al-Awlaki lived on in more than 70,000 YouTube videos, and part of his potency was that he preached in English. With no Arabic required, just internet access, it gave him enormous reach to Muslims in the west \u2013 and all those in the Brothers\u2019 Gym.</p> <p>In one video, shot in Yemen in 2010, Awlaki warned: \u201cThe west will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d The horrific experiences of Omar in Guantanamo Bay were familiar to everyone in HSG. They all knew what was possible.</p> <p>On 29 August 2013 the British parliament rejected a plan for military strikes against Assad. Then Barack Obama asked Congress to postpone a vote to authorise a US military strike on Syria. It seemed clear to the Brothers\u2019 Gym that doing something was the only option. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the person just standing on the sideline and watching,\u201d said Amer. He knew what his grandfather would have done.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each day, more refugees arrived, all with fresher, more brutish accounts of Assad\u2019s men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amer\u2019s father had maintained connections with the Muslim humanitarian sector since the Bosnian war. One charity was called the Albayan Foundation, based in the predominantly Muslim area of Sparkhill, Birmingham. The organisation had been among the first to deliver aid to Syria after the conflict began two years earlier. Albayan\u2019s next convoy would be heading for Syria soon, in less than a month. Amer told his father that he needed to help Syria\u2019s beleaguered civilians. His schoolfriend, Mo Khan, was also keen to come along for the ride.</p> <p>On the eve of their departure, Amer told his mum that he was going to Libya to see relatives and she let him have his passport. Mid-afternoon the next day, 8 October 2013, two white lorries that had travelled from Birmingham picked him and Mo Khan up, along with Abubaker, sucking a Rothmans cigarette.</p> <p>Two hours later they reached Calais and from there headed south-west into Germany. After six days and 3,000 miles they reached the Turkish border. On 14 October, the two white lorries entered Syria via the Bab al-Hawa crossing.</p> <p>Close up, the Atmeh refugee camp was wretched. Recent rains had ravaged the site and its paths had become quagmires. Amer watched families struggling uphill, slipping in mud mixed with excrement. The camp\u2019s 25,000 occupants had been forgotten. Winter approached, but it had no running water, no electricity, no heat, no sewage systems and no UN relief convoys. Each day, more refugees arrived, all with fresher, more brutish accounts of Assad\u2019s men.</p> <p>Armed men, AK-47s slung over their shoulders, could be spotted outside the camp. The refugees called them \u201cthe spicy crew\u201d. They were the jihadists, Jabhat al-Nusra. The surrounding hills belonged to them. From Atmeh, Amer could see their black banners, trembling in the breeze. Amer and Mo Khan planned to join them. But the charity workers wouldn\u2019t let them out of their sight. After a week, their tasks almost done, they were no closer to becoming jihadists. Finally, the Birmingham charity workers said they were finished. They were all going home. Reluctantly, Amer and Mo helped pack up and climbed in a van. On 22 October they left Syria.</p> <p>As they drove towards Turkey\u2019s Hatay airport, Amer and Mo Khan hatched a yarn about flying to Libya to see Amer\u2019s family. Outside the departure terminal they said goodbye to the charity drivers and watched them trundle off in the direction of Birmingham. The instant they disappeared Amer and Mo turned towards the taxi rank. \u201cThe border please,\u201d said Amer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b84676f83ec61bf7ab3dd99cfbab6c36d78729e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b84676f83ec61bf7ab3dd99cfbab6c36d78729e6/0_0_2499_1666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cilvegozu border crossing between Turkey and Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cilvegozu border crossing between Turkey and Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crossing the border was effortless as it was controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra. Amer and Mo Khan simply told the border guards they wanted to join the jihad against Assad. They were escorted to a truck and taken south to an al-Nusra training camp.</p> <p>The camp was highly professional. Not only were there huge stockpiles of weaponry, but massive reserves of manpower. Foreign fighters were flooding in from across Europe, most arriving via humanitarian convoys.</p> <p>Training began with a dawn prayer and an hour run led by a Chechen special forces officer. Then it was tactical tutorials, ambush training and simulated attacks, followed by prayers and lectures by Islamist teachers. Amer and Mo learned basic firing techniques and assault tactics, how to clean a rifle, tie a tourniquet and clean a deep flesh wound. In two weeks, they learned how to be jihadists.</p> <p>Back in Sussex, on the morning of 11 November, a meeting of senior police, counter-extremism chiefs, youth justice bosses and representatives from Prevent gathered to ascertain if Jaffar was at risk of being radicalised following a recent diatribe he had made in public about Americans being terrorists. During the meeting, the family\u2019s former social worker revealed that Jaffar\u2019s oldest brother, Amer, was now in Syria. The revelation prompted little urgency. Not a single expert at the meeting believed the 16-year-old was vulnerable. \u201cThere are no risks of radicalisation,\u201d was the final, unanimous verdict.</p> <p>Had they taken even a cursory look at his phone, they would have quickly learned that Jaffar was in frequent touch with his 19-year-old brother. From there, they would have rapidly discovered that Jaffar and a large number of his friends were discussing travelling to Syria.</p> <p>At the start of 2014 there was a major Brothers\u2019 Gym meeting to discuss who was prepared to make the journey. Jaffar was driving the plan. His friend Ibby had already put his name down and Abdullah decided to go too. Like Jaffar, Abdullah felt he had run out of rope in Brighton. \u201cThey were thinking that they couldn\u2019t do anything with their lives, there was no point in staying, that they couldn\u2019t get a job,\u201d said Abdullah\u2019s friend Bill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8310a9e33f59692ff9352f4c0853fe4a3bc077ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8310a9e33f59692ff9352f4c0853fe4a3bc077ae/0_0_1390_1357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaffar Deghayes\u2019s friend Ibby Kamara.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"976\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaffar Deghayes\u2019s friend Ibby Kamara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They bought three one-way \u00a359 tickets to Istanbul, sitting together. They half-expected to be raided by police in the hours following the transaction. Nothing happened.</p> <p>The security staff on duty at Luton on 28 January 2014 could not have missed the three teenagers; the towering pipe-cleaner figure of Ibby framed by the squat physiques of Jaffar and Abdullah. Everything was against them. Ibby was carrying the passport of his 15-year-old brother, a person who looked nothing like him and who was not allowed to fly without an authorised adult. Jaffar was on an extremist airport watchlist. Abdullah, 17, one of the most notorious faces in his force area, was not only on bail but due in court in several weeks. Police also had intelligence that Abdullah and Jaffar\u2019s eldest brother was currently fighting for an al-Qaida-affiliated group in Syria. Finally, they had bought one-way tickets, at a stroke compromising their cover story of a sightseeing trip to Istanbul. A rookie mistake.</p> <p>Shortly after 2pm they checked in and approached passport control. They waltzed through. It was the same story at Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk airport. As the number one arrival point for foreign fighters headed for Syria in early 2014, the airport\u2019s border officials had received instruction to profile Muslims arriving from the west \u2013 especially those with no return tickets. But the three teenagers from Brighton skipped through security without a hitch.</p> <p>They could never have envisaged how straightforward it would be to enter Syria. Jabhat al-Nusra had seized control of the crossing six weeks earlier and the three boys, including the youngest British jihadist who would enter the Syrian conflict, were almost dragged over by the welcoming guards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71c8f0f42db75f373142da3635b7b7a60acf2cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71c8f0f42db75f373142da3635b7b7a60acf2cdd/0_0_3508_4000/877.jpg\" alt=\"Abdullah Deghayes.\" width=\"877\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullah Deghayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 5 April 2014, Abdul and Abdullah spent their 18th birthdays three time zones apart. For Abdul it was a fairly low-key day at the mosque gym. Abdullah celebrated his arrival to adulthood at the frontline of the al-Nusra offensive, occupying a trench south of the village of Salma in Syria\u2019s Latakia province. Most of the rebel fighters were weary and cold; supply lines were stretched. Syrian artillery had started shelling their positions, but Abdullah had boundless energy. The more they were targeted, the more he seemed invigorated.</p> <p>Over the days that followed the fighting intensified. At least 40 foreign recruits died. The Brighton contingent found themselves three-quarters up Mount Chalma. Their unit commander took them aside. A force of enemy troops had gathered on the other side of the mountain. \u201cHe just said: \u2018Let\u2019s go around the army and surround them\u2019,\u201d said Amer. They set off, the Mediterranean glittering below them in the late afternoon sun.</p> <p>A ferocious burst of firing erupted from a line of trees just ahead. The al-Nusra fighters crouched as the weight of fire intensified. To his left, Amer noticed a figure moving ahead, Abdullah, out on his own, chasing the regime troops down the scree of the steep mountainside. He could hear his younger brother shouting, pursuing the enemy like he once chased rival gangs along Marine Parade. Then Amer heard a sharp crack, a sniper rifle. He watched his younger brother tumble heavily to the ground. By the time they reached him, it was too late. Abdullah Deghayes was dead. He was 18 years and six days old.</p> <p>Einas was the first to receive the news. She initially refused to believe it. Soon after, an image surfaced on Facebook. Shot at dusk and taken from the chest up, it showed Abdullah lying on his back in a combat jacket. He looked serene, as if he was sleeping. Abdul and Mohammed, who had been lugging the belongings of their three brothers in Syria into their new temporary council home in Portslade, heard their mum\u2019s wailing. Abdul broke down uncontrollably when he learned his twin was dead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What made me angry was that nothing was done about it. My son was just another dead jihadi. They let them go to die</p> <footer> <cite>Khadijah Kamara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Within six months another brother and two friends were also dead. Mo Khan had been killed by a Russian explosive, Ibby by an American cruise missile, and Jaffar by Syrian army regulars. His body was never found.</p> <p>Ibby\u2019s mother, Khadijah Kamara, wrote to the Home Office asking why her eldest boy had been allowed to travel using not just the wrong passport but that of a 15-year-old. \u201cAs a mother I feel that I am owed an explanation,\u201d she wrote. But no explanation was forthcoming. \u201cWhat made me angry was that nothing was done about it. My son was just another dead jihadi. They let them go to die.\u201d</p> <p>The city put a lid on the case, hoping that no one would pry too closely. Within the council and police, the fact that the scale and scope of the extremism had not been exposed was a source of relief. Rather than drilling down into the issues \u2013 the injustices and ignorance that caused the problem \u2013 officials walked away, keen to move on.</p> <p>Abubaker\u2019s temper landed him in trouble again. In the summer of 2018 he faced trial for assaulting his wife. He was found not guilty of assault, but sentenced to 18 months in prison for attempting to prevent Einas testifying against him. Abubaker joined his youngest son in jail. Four months earlier Mohammed had been sentenced at Lewes crown court. The court heard that he was caught in a catch-22. The teenager was trapped in a cycle of dealing to repay the debts he had accrued by using drugs as \u201ca much-needed escape from everything going on around him\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Abdul, the twin who had stayed at home, is alleged to have<strong> </strong>evolved into a serious criminal, with a string of convictions for violence, robbery and drug-dealing. In September 2017, he was jailed after police raided the home where he lived with his mother and found scales, deal bags, burner phones, wads of cash, even a safe. And a lot of drugs: cocaine, ketamine, MDMA and amphetamines with a combined street value of \u00a32,250.</p> <p>Amer spoke to him from Syria shortly after he was set free the following summer. Abdul sounded contrite, almost remorseful. He promised his older brother he had changed his ways. But the 22-year-old, who had come so close to travelling to fight in Syria, embraced the only life he knew. He fell back into leading Hillstreet.</p> <p>In February 2019, Abdul is said to have met up with a cocaine dealer known as Frank. What happened next is the subject of a murder trial. Abdul was stabbed eight times. A knife sank nine centimetres into his body, skewering a kidney and slicing the femoral vein and artery in his left leg, a grievous wound. For eight hours doctors at the Royal Sussex county hospital fought to save Abdul. But at 6am, the sky still black, specialists agreed his injuries were \u201cuntreatable\u201d. Abdul Deghayes was dead.</p> <p>His brother Mohammed was allowed out of prison to attend Abdul\u2019s funeral. Abubaker addressed the mourners. His son was venerated, he said, recounting his recent spell in prison when he was afforded hero status by so many inmates because he was \u201cAbdul\u2019s dad\u201d. But Abubaker\u2019s central message was that Abdul\u2019s death must act as the catalyst for his friends to mend their ways. \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn the corner,\u201d said the 50-year-old and stared at the gang. Some lowered their heads. And he said that it was time to go clean. \u201cNo more intoxication, no more getting high. It\u2019s time to chase the super-high of Islam.\u201d Then he pleaded for calm, no more bloodshed. \u201cPlease no revenge, no retribution. In Islam we show peace to everyone, wherever they are. Wherever they come from,\u201d said Abubaker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2fd0ebfedd454bd7ff0867486c539b4f510eb8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2fd0ebfedd454bd7ff0867486c539b4f510eb8b/0_0_5066_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abubaker Deghayes at home in Saltdean, Sussex, April 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abubaker Deghayes at home in Saltdean, East Sussex, April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Einas, who had now lost three of her sons, kept a low profile in Saltdean, living in a quiet street close to where the family first arrived in the UK. Occasionally friends saw her in the city, always meticulous in her hijab, but she was shy, leaving most to speculate how she coped with what had happened to her five boys.</p> <p>Six years on, Amer is the only one of the five to remain in Syria. Having arrived fresh-faced in the autumn of 2013 with the aim of toppling Assad, the 25-year-old had not imagined he would still be there. After the death of Jaffar, Abdullah and Mo Khan, he sought refuge in family life. He had married Natalie, a Syrian national, in 2015, and they had a daughter, Sham. They moved to a modest home in an Idlib suburb whose roads were lined with rubble and pock-marked with craters. Nearby was a gym and mosque and he had friends, including six British jihadists. Mostly, he enjoyed spending time with his wife, watching CBeebies on YouTube with his daughter.</p> <p>But the defeat at Aleppo had dramatically curbed the ambitions of the jihadists. Shoehorned into a sliver of land in the north-west, all their hope of an Islamic emirate had faded. The only good news, said Amer, was that Islamic State were finally routed.</p> <p>He had started contemplating his future and towards the end of 2019 he was sounding different in his calls home. Once he described himself as \u201cbeaten\u201d and he began feeling homesick. He wanted his family to meet Sham and Natalie. He missed the sea, the squawk of seagulls.</p> <p>But the issue of Syrian returnees following the defeat of the Islamic State had turned toxic. Ministers threatened severe consequences for anyone attempting to return from Syria. In May 2019 the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave British citizens in Idlib province an ultimatum: leave within 28 days or face a 10-year prison sentence if they attempted to return to the UK.</p> <p>Amer was worried, fearful of what it meant for him and his family. He occasionally wondered what the UK security services thought of him. But it was the answer to another question that he most wanted.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be OK to come home?\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This is an edited extract from <em>No Return: The True Story of How Martyrs Are Made</em> by Mark Townsend (Guardian Faber, \u00a312.99).

Like a ghoulish reboot of a television show, some of the same people have returned. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">Deborah Birx</a>, a longtime HIV doctor in the US military who later became the United States Global Aids coordinator, now serves as the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus task force. Anthony Fauci, an immunologist, has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.</p> <p>\u201cWe had another silent epidemic: HIV,\u201d Birx said at a White House press conference on Monday. \u201cAnd I just want to recognize the HIV epidemic was solved by the community: the HIV advocates, and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d</p> <p>Her words are unmistakably direct, but for many, the comparison is a cautionary one. HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, roughly 700,000 of the victims were Americans \u2013 almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco. The coronavirus has not proven nearly as lethal. Contracting it is certainly not the death sentence that HIV was for so many years, and some advocates are reluctant to push the analogy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83a11d3471e40ef0f00ee859218acd30a1dd2f88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a11d3471e40ef0f00ee859218acd30a1dd2f88/47_387_2825_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HIV has killed nearly 40 million people worldwide since the early 1980s, almost 20,000 of them in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Read/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both viruses, obviously, and there are some overlapping parts of this that obviously can be compared,\u201d says John Cunningham, the executive director of the National Aids Memorial in San Francisco, which had been set to debut the quilt in early April, for Golden Gate park\u2019s 150th anniversary. \u201cBut in totality, I would never want to draw that direct comparison. That being said, the National Aids Memorial and the Aids Quilt take very seriously our responsibility to share the stories of the epidemic and the stories of a tragic virus that befell a community.\u201d</p> <p>That the Bay Area is a focal point in both epidemics is not lost on longtime Aids activist Cleve Jones. When the city of San Francisco got involved in the fight against HIV, it was spending more than the federal government was, he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe most glaringly obvious similarity is that both pandemics began with Republican administrations and a Republican president who did not acknowledge the gravity of the situation,\u201d Jones says. \u201cAnd the failure of a strong early response led to tragic consequences.\u201d</p> <p>The similarities extend to nomenclature. In the early days, before the term \u201cacquired immunodeficiency disease\u201d, Aids was known as Grid, for \u201cgay-related immune deficiency\u201d \u2013 when it wasn\u2019t simply called the \u201cgay cancer\u201d or the \u201cgay plague\u201d, that is. When Donald Trump insists on tweeting about the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, he claims to be playing tit-for-tat with Communist party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">propaganda that the virus is of U</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\"> origin</a>.

It has two panels, upper and lower. The upper one reads, \u201cStraights: I can\u2019t believe the government would just ignore an epidemic that threatens thousands of lives.\u201d The lower panel reads, \u201cGays: You don\u2019t say...\u201d superimposed over a picture of the Aids Memorial Quilt spread out over the National Mall in Washington DC.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit harsh and oversimplified, maybe. But the question it presupposes is a valid one in a region on near-lockdown \u2013 because for some people, HIV and coronavirus aren\u2019t separate at all. The fear among long-term survivors of HIV/Aids is potent, according to Dr Lary Abramson, a retired San Francisco physician who treated patients during that epidemic\u2019s early phases.</p> <p>\u201cI can tell you that the people I know who are currently on meds for HIV, who have survived our plague, are taking extreme precautions,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to get anywhere near this coronavirus and are doing all they can to follow the guidelines the NIH is promulgating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dadff0d84d96f5c96d93fe2db6d964ce38a9a9dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dadff0d84d96f5c96d93fe2db6d964ce38a9a9dc/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lone rose sits at the World Aids Day Ceremony at the National Aids Memorial Grove in Golden Gate park on 1 December 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lone rose sits at the World Aids Day Ceremony at the National Aids Memorial Grove in Golden Gate park on 1 December 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Paul Morris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For younger generations, the instinct is essentially the opposite: to come together in tough times. Even though social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has arguably never been higher, queer people reflexively seek refuge in queer spaces. Juanita MORE!, a well-known San Francisco drag performer whose parties have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various LGBTQ+ causes, has to balance her advocacy for nightlife against a consistent message of \u201cStay the fuck home!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a mother to so many people in San Francisco, I have noticed that a lot of people are having a hard time \u2013 and did all the way up until the quarantine was instated \u2013 staying in,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we were in that first year of the Aids crisis, that was also hard for a lot of people, and the reason was that everyone had just come to San Francisco. They had just gotten free and come out, and were told again they couldn\u2019t. Those comparisons, to me, are the same.\u201d</p> <p>As of Thursday, some 70 San Franciscans have tested positive for coronavirus, while approximately 15,000 are living with HIV. For Cunningham of the National Aids Memorial, the trauma lingers.</p> <p>\u201cI lived in the Castro during the darkest days of the epidemic,\u201d Cunningham says, referring to San Francisco\u2019s famous gay neighborhood. \u201cAnd since Covid-19 came upon the scene, there has been a building wave of emotion inside of me and others. I\u2019ve had many conversations and it\u2019s bringing up a lot of unresolved grief and anger.\u201d</p> <p>But, he says, the noble impulse to help one another \u2013 within the strictures of a shelter-in-place order \u2013 are a welcome parallel between HIV and the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWhat gave hope and galvanized individuals to step forward out of what was a tragedy, with the discrimination and prejudice and the lack of a response from the government, we saw some of the best in humanity. We saw neighbors helping neighbors. \u2026 Some of the best examples of what it means to be a community were born there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"abd0b3f7593f000bb6292acff866073d3178dad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd0b3f7593f000bb6292acff866073d3178dad1/0_167_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If people can\u2019t feed one another, we can always check in with a phone call or by Zoom. Regarding public-health leadership under a conservative Republican presidential administration, Cunningham observes that it\u2019s \u201cironic that two of our heroes, Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, were there in the days of the Aids crisis and are here today\u201d.</p> <p>Jones notes the surreality of their presence as well.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that almost every longtime survivor I know has commented on is how eerie it is to see them up there smiling and nodding while this fool blathers on,\u201d he says. \u201cOne can only imagine what is going on inside their head. I think both of them are, every day, probably laying out the degrees of harm: If they were to overly criticize Trump, they would be fired.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Fauci has been conspicuously effusive in his praise for the president. But for nurses at Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital like Sasha Cuttler, the reassuring presence of capable figures at the top doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into an adequate response on the ground. There, too, a resemblance to the Aids crisis years is unsettling.</p> <p>\u201cWhat strikes me is the casual disregard of the voice of nurses and others on the frontlines. That [comparison] is not off at all,\u201d Cuttler says, adding that they\u2019ve been removed from field nursing in retaliation for speaking with the media about a lack of urgency and coordination in testing for Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88841707ce18084d1ec84debf457febd672991e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88841707ce18084d1ec84debf457febd672991e2/0_42_1006_604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People march down San Francisco\u2019s Market Street for the 10th international Aids candlelight march in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People march down San Francisco\u2019s Market Street for the 10th international Aids candlelight march in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Poroy/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it was with Aids patients during the 1980s at the hospital\u2019s experimental and nurse-led <a href=\"https://ari.ucsf.edu/clinical-care/ward-86\">Ward 86</a>, the frontline caregivers are \u201cpredominantly women and queer people\u201d, Cuttler adds. \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing it with love and caring, making it clear to the patients that we do this job because it\u2019s our job \u2013 and we\u2019re not afraid of them or judging them. Both epidemics are used to blame people for their own illness and doing something bad to spread it.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, misinformation has continued unabated, much of it from prominent voices. Displaying considerable ignorance of why residents of the Bay Area were urged to remain at home \u2013 and of how contemporary HIV medications work \u2013 the conservative commentator Mark Steyn remarked on Rush Limbaugh\u2019s show that \u201cIt\u2019s a big gay town, San Francisco, and they\u2019re the ones with all the compromised immune systems from all the protease inhibitors and all the other stuff.

Yet others may need to take care of their ailing family members and have to delay their exams entirely.\u201d</p> <p>They called on the university to allow those due to graduate this summer to restart the final year in September or at Easter 2021, and to offer alternative assessments, such as vivas conducted via video, a portfolio of essays or coursework instead of exams, or postponing deadlines until after social distancing and quarantine measures have been relaxed.</p> <p>Similar letters signed by 1,200 students at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBFYVPGmFMA3sz3bhiLdQDlgTGTUUAQFFK5SGd2s6yY/edit\" title=\"\">Edinburgh University </a>and 1,000 from the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NUmw0yIin8TisF5hp8jgEmFtDASpke5LqXVGJRFM8g/mobilebasic\" title=\"\">Bristol University</a> said students should be able to choose to take a mark based on their existing assessments or do an exam or essay if they wanted to improve it.</p> <p>Those concerns were echoed by <a href=\"https://epi.org.uk/team/rt-hon-david-laws/\" title=\"\">David Laws</a>, the former education minister and now executive chairman of the Education Policy Institute. EPI research shows that by the time students finish their GCSEs, those eligible for free school meals are 18.1 months behind their classmates in English and maths attainment.</p> <p>\u201cChildren from disadvantaged backgrounds are the ones who benefit the most from being in a school environment, where their needs can be supported,\u201d Laws said. \u201cThey are the children who, when they go home because of the school closures, will face the most challenging learning circumstances because of a comparative lack of books, learning resources, IT and parents with the capacity to help. There is a real risk that if there is a prolonged school closure, it is going to hit the more vulnerable children the most.\u201d</p> <p>Yet universities also need to keep high standards, according to Katrina Smyth, head of quality and recognition at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, a position shared by other professional bodies, such as the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very clear to universities that we will be flexible in our approach,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cWhat we would say is that standards have to be maintained. There must still be an assurance that students have met the learning outcomes in the modules.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/\" title=\"\">University and College Union</a>, which represents lecturers, said they needed to be involved in designing the new system.</p> <p>\u201cStaff, rather than managers with little or no experience in the classroom, must be central to the designing of any new systems as they know what will work best,\u201d said Jo Grady, UCU\u2019s general secretary. \u201cAs well as dealing with the academic challenges, we need to consider the extra demands on staff time for pastoral care and student welfare.\u201d</p>",

That means (pending last-minute cancellations) our rundown looks something like this...</p> <p>The <strong>AFLW</strong> contains the most important action of the afternoon with Carlton hosting Brisbane in the last semi-final from 1.10pm.</p> <p>The <strong>AFL</strong> men\u2019s competition continues its opening round with North Melbourne taking on St Kilda at 1.05pm, Hawthorn renewing hostilities with Brisbane at 3.40pm before West Coast round everything off at 6.40pm with the visit of Melbourne. </p> <p>The <strong>NRL</strong> still has unfinished business with Wests Tigers and the Knights doing battle from 4.05pm followed immediately afterwards (6.15pm) by the Titans and Eels. </p> <p>Alongside this, inevitably, there will be news filtering through during the day as the impact of the latest government-imposed measures to restrict the spread of Covid-19 filter through. </p> <p>If you want to get in touch, I\u2019m available on email at <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a> on Twitter. </p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>It is one of the world\u2019s great conservatoires, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/benjamin-britten\" title=\"\">composer Benjamin Britten</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/11/dame-joan-sutherland-obituary\" title=\"\">singer Dame Joan Sutherland</a> are among those who trained there. But for decades the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/01/milein-cosman-sketches-britten-stravinsky-bernstein\" title=\"\">Royal College of Music</a> has struggled to showcase its star power and its collection of instruments in headquarters that have been described by some as forbidding and drab.</p> <p>Now, following a \u00a340m transformation \u2013 funded in part by donations from artists including the Italian tenor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/andrea-bocelli-battle-blindness-film\" title=\"\">Andrea Bocelli</a> \u2013 the RCM is unveiling an ambitious new look. The redesigned buildings \u2013 due to be officially opened later this year \u2013 include London\u2019s newest state-of-the art concert halls and a museum featuring more than 15,000 treasures, including the world\u2019s oldest guitar. Professor Colin Lawson, the RCM\u2019s director, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cPeople have walked past here without really knowing whether they\u2019re allowed in or not. It was pretty forbidding at one time. The redesign is all about opening up everything.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the makeover, a disused courtyard in South Kensington has become a vast, light-filled conservatory that leads off to two concert halls and a museum, as well as dozens of additional practice rooms, recording and digital facilities and a large cafe where recitals will also be staged.</p> <p>A glorified 1960s hut that used to house the museum has been demolished. The RCM can now do justice to its collection, which covers music-making over more than five centuries, from the earliest stringed keyboard instrument (a 1480s clavicytherium) to Mozart\u2019s score for his Piano Concerto No 24 in C minor, complete with his doodles in the margin.

Its alumni include the composer Gustav Holst, the conductor Sir Colin Davis, and the flautist Sir James Galway. Today it trains around 800 students from 55 countries. In 2019, it was ranked as the UK\u2019s top institution for the performing arts in the QS World University Rankings. \u201cIn 2020, we\u2019re also number one in Europe and number two in the world,\u201d Lawson said.</p> <p>The public is already able to attend concerts and masterclasses, but the new buildings will increase access and expand programmes, mostly with free entry.</p> <p>Masterclasses are by international stars such as Maxim Vengerov, the violin virtuoso.</p> <p>Lawson said: \u201cThe thing about a Vengerov masterclass is that the students sound absolutely wonderful until he picks up the violin and then suddenly \u2018wow, this is what\u2019s possible\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Transforming the RCM\u2019s Grade&nbsp;II-listed home has taken two-and-a-half years in a project headed by John Simpson, whose work on historic buildings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,1169,719009,00.html\" title=\"\">includes the Queen\u2019s Gallery</a> at Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>He is a favourite architect of Prince Charles, president of the RCM\u2019s fundraising campaign, which has seen one of its biggest investments. Bocelli is among those who have donated money, along with the National Lottery Heritage Fund, trusts and foundations.</p> <p>Simpson\u2019s approach uses updated traditional forms to respond to contemporary requirements. He has done exactly that at the RCM, with light and airy spaces. Joanna Wachowiak, director of John Simpson Architects, said: \u201cThe idea was to provide space for people to practise, space for people to eat and congregate, space for audiences to come and space to teach.\u201d</p> <p>The RCM says that the performance hall and studio \u2013 seating 150 and 90, respectively \u2013 have been designed for the highest standards of music-making with the most sophisticated technology. A beautiful white lattice-work decorates the hall\u2019s walls, but serves a purpose that goes beyond the aesthetic, namely \u201csound-scattering\u201d. The walls incorporate sound-absorbent banners, which can be adjusted to suit different types of performance, while advanced air-handling and climate-control enable the most delicate instruments from the museum to be played. \u201cEvery bit of the design or decoration has a purpose,\u201d said Simpson.</p> <p>Fundraising continues, partly for scholarships. Up to 70% of RCM students receive some support.</p> <p>Lawson said: \u201cWhen the college opened, the future king was proud of the fact that the daughter of a brick-maker was a student. We\u2019ve carried on that tradition but of course we\u2019re in a very competitive environment.

  "<p>It\u2019s going to get easier, I think to myself, as I lie in bed in the darkness, one hand gripping tightly the edge of the mattress, the other pressing hard on the spot where my head just thudded loudly, again, into a wall. In the bunk below, my cabinmate Oleg is dozing deeply. I might not be sleeping yet, but I will once I\u2019ve found my sea legs. I\u2019ve come a long way, I try to reassure myself, considering it\u2019s only my fourth night at sea.</p> <p>When I arrived on board my temporary new home, <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greenpeace</a>\u2019s MV Esperanza, even successfully navigating my way to the bathroom along the ex-Soviet firefighting ship\u2019s labyrinth of narrow corridors had seemed impossible. The environmental NGO had invited me to join them on a month-long polar expedition departing from Patagonia, the final leg of a year-long project to draw attention to the existential threats facing the world\u2019s oceans. The crew had set off from London, before travelling from pole to pole.</p> <p>Now though, after a series of briefings, tours and tips from seasoned crew members, I know where to do laundry, where to shower, where to muster in case of emergency. I can quickly put on an immersion suit. I understand three different types of alarm. I\u2019ve scoped out the best hiding spots for when I\u2019ll need some privacy: the cubbyhole library; two nets on the boat\u2019s stern where you can sit as the vast expanse of ocean stretches out behind you; and if all else fails, the floor of the linen closet. I can even use the correct maritime terms to describe the different types of wild, sudden movement the boat is making as we cross the notoriously rough Drake Passage into Antarctic waters: \u201cpitching\u201d up and down, or \u201crolling\u201d from side to side. Still, there\u2019s little anyone can do to help with the tiredness, nausea and bumping into an endless number of metal things that comes with the all-consuming seasickness that has long settled in.</p> <p>Cruising along the Beagle Channel on our first morning \u2013 the calm, breathtaking 240km strait of water we\u2019d sailed through after departing from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jan/06/take-the-long-view-chile-revisited\" title=\"\">Ushuaia</a>, on the southern-most tip of Argentina \u2013 had lulled me into a false sense of security. \u201cIt is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers,\u201d Charles Darwin wrote of the strait, after an expedition here in the 1830s. He was right. Mainland Argentina on one side, Chilean islands on the other, we\u2019d been smoothly delivered from the final frontiers of South America towards Cape Horn and out into open oceans, passing snow-capped mountains and luscious greenery \u2013 albatrosses, whales and dolphins escorting us from above and below.</p> <p>I\u2019d taken a single motion-sickness tablet as a precaution, after warnings from people who\u2019d made the journey. Honestly? I didn\u2019t understand the fuss. But it turns out that the Beagle\u2019s waters are somewhat more sheltered than those of the wild and exposed Southern Ocean. Only a few days later I\u2019m counting down the minutes until I can pop the next pill. Wave-hits-boat means head-hits-wall, again. That one was probably pitching, I mutter under my breath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48ec2f8ad82a671c75e7c8095372d385683ec5bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48ec2f8ad82a671c75e7c8095372d385683ec5bf/0_83_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two ships side by side, lit up at night, between two icebergs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frozen assets: secretive \u2018transhipping\u2019 between two boats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s sunlight creeping in through the porthole now. For days, I\u2019ve seen nothing but water. Staring out to the horizon is the only remedy for my unrelenting unease. I clamber quietly down from my bunk and head out for the relief some much-needed fresh air might bring.</p> <p>Stepping out into the crisp morning, though, a surprise is waiting. Three huge, jagged icebergs, somehow both deep blue and ghostly white in the orange light of dawn, jut out from the water right in front me, almost welcoming me into a corner of the world I imagined I\u2019d only ever see on screen. A raft of penguins swims alongside. I\u2019m channelling David Attenborough through my delirium. My stomach stirs with excitement \u2013 my first encounter with the Earth\u2019s last great wilderness is all that I\u2019d hoped for.</p> <p>In the distance, the peaks of the remote South Orkney Islands are appearing. I stand transfixed, the butterflies inside growing ever more restless. And then I run to the bathroom. What I thought was awe and wonder in my gut is, in fact, a sign that I\u2019m about to puke.</p> <p><em><strong>While landscapes come</strong></em> and go, and weather switches from blissful summer sunshine to blizzard and back again with little warning, the routine on board remains reassuringly constant. At 7.30am there\u2019s a wake-up call while a help-yourself-breakfast wraps up in the mess. From 8 to 9am everyone pitches into the cleaning, and then the crew of 30 heads off to work. On the decks below, engineers and fitters keep us moving; from the bridge, mates navigate. A team of deckhands dutifully ensures everything is in working order, while chef Willy prepares lunch for midday. A queue forms at his hatch on the dot.</p> <p>Unless you\u2019re on watch duty, clocking off is at 5pm \u2013 just in time for an unofficial exercise class in the helicopter hangar or a smoke on the poop deck \u2013 before dinner is served up at 6pm. All the while, a small group of investigators, researchers and activists are plotting in a makeshift office. Because while the permanent crew keeps the boat running, it\u2019s these campaigners who truly set its course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef040916a4a3d1ec208400d669d6a44bd391a753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef040916a4a3d1ec208400d669d6a44bd391a753/0_156_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Segalov, pictured on Barrientos Island, in the South Shetland Islands, with a group of penguins behind him\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On dry land: Michael Segalov gets a bird\u2019s eye view of the local penguins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greenpeace</a> employs three ships to further its environmental efforts. Each is represented by a toy boat on a map pinned to a wall, reflecting their current positions. And as each traverses the oceans, an ever-changing team is drafted in from Greenpeace\u2019s international offices to take the helm. From climate change to plastic pollution, deep-sea mining and oil drilling, all manner of issues have been explored on this ambitious voyage. Right now it\u2019s an issue called \u201ctranshipping\u201d.</p> <p>After arriving in the Antarctic proper three days earlier, we\u2019ve anchored in a sheltered bay off the South Orkneys. Glaciers lead down to the water, which is peppered with icebergs. On a distant shoreline, a smattering of structures marks the <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/signy/\" title=\"\">British Antarctic Survey\u2019s Signy Island Base</a>. The waters might have calmed, but on board the atmosphere is anything but tranquil.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Three huge icebergs appear, deep blue against the orange light of dawn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Surrounded by maps, charts and laptops, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sophiecooke\" title=\"\">Sophie Cooke, </a>the mission\u2019s lead investigator, is in the campaign room holding a briefing on a direct action set to take place the following morning. </p> <p>Transhipping, Cooke explains, is how fishing boats transfer their catch on to cargo vessels while at sea, swapping fish for fuel, workers and supplies. It\u2019s a system that allows fishing operations to maximise profits, simultaneously making it possible to travel into distant waters with almost no need to return to port. Earlier that day, Greenpeace had published a report that was three years in the making; it set out the harm transhipping can do, both to the oceans and the fishermen on board.</p> <p>It\u2019s how, Greenpeace argues, illegal and unregulated fish are laundered into the market, which is estimated to be worth between $10bn and $23.5bn annually. (\u201cDodgy fish\u201d is mixed together in freezers with more sustainable, better regulated catch.) Human rights abuses at sea \u2013 including poor working conditions and modern slavery \u2013 are well documented, and by transhipping, beyond scrutiny and national jurisdiction, such malpractice is too often out of sight and out of mind. There are three transhipment boats (known as reefers) currently in the South Orkneys, I\u2019m told. Using complex satellite mapping and ship-tracking software, Cooke and her team have identified one of them \u2013 a cargo vessel they suspect has dodgy fish on board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3b28cfcc2194858a12f7b59fcad330f6a3187aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3b28cfcc2194858a12f7b59fcad330f6a3187aa/0_83_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two crew members below deck on soft seating repairing clothes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mending ways: crew relaxing on board.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They plan to attach a giant rubber fender \u2013 emblazoned with the words \u201cOcean Destroyer\u201d \u2013 to the ship in question, and have a group of climbers scale the side using rope ladders, to conduct a vigilante inspection in an attempt to see what\u2019s hiding in the ship\u2019s refrigerated hold.</p> <p>The next morning, from a speedboat, I watch as the team pulls together with military precision. The distinction between crew and campaigner melts away.</p> <p><em><strong>Everyone on board</strong></em> has a story explaining how they ended up here. It\u2019s not the sort of job you can stumble into. For deckhand Usnea Granger, time spent fighting to save ancient Oregon woodland from deforestation as a teenager inspired her to pursue environmental activism. Chief mate Adrian Arauz describes the fields and rivers of his childhood in rural Panama. \u201cIt was instilled in me from an early age that we should take care of our surroundings, because in the end it\u2019s nature that provides.\u201d</p> <p>It was an oil spill off the coast of Galicia in northwestern Spain that first got a young Fernando Romo interested in marine conservation. He recalls with vivid clarity a childhood memory: walking down to the beach in his hometown to be greeted by washed-up dead wildlife, the sand drowning in crude oil. While working on a commercial tanker ship in the 1990s, he and his team were tasked with pumping oil-infused water into the sea. Soon after he became a member of Greenpeace. He was working on their ships by 2008, and promoted to the role of captain in 2017.</p> <p>Compared to my digs, Romo\u2019s cabin is practically palatial. There\u2019s an office with room for a desk and sofa, and penguin postcards pinned to a noticeboard. A thin curtain separates his sleeping quarters from where we\u2019re sitting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2454336d30978cf3c77258e20e53c437c4321c92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2454336d30978cf3c77258e20e53c437c4321c92/0_83_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A complex machine (a Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle), being operated by gloved fingers, showing the bottom of Discovery Bay, off Greenwich Island in Antarctica, as the team looks for signs of plastic pollution and anchor damage which could be caused by fishing vessels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emergency response: images from the seabed of Discovery Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs captain, you\u2019re the representative of a ship\u2019s owner,\u201d the 49-year-old says, \u201cand you\u2019re ultimately responsible for the whole operation of the ship.\u201d In normal circumstances, say, on a cargo boat, that means getting your goods from port to port on time with no glitches. At Greenpeace, things are a little different: \u201cWe don\u2019t deliver shipping containers, we win campaigns.\u201d</p> <p>This adds another layer of responsibility and risk to Romo\u2019s workload. He\u2019s not just a sailor, he\u2019s an activist, too. It means breaking laws and putting the boat into situations that most other captains would do everything in their power to avoid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I become spoilt. The whales aren't as close as the last pod we spotted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That, Romo says, is how he stays positive. Eco-anxiety and burnout are common among environmental campaigners. I\u2019d have imagined that spending every waking hour fighting for the planet\u2019s future while witnessing firsthand parts of the world most vulnerable to the effects of climate catastrophe might be hard to handle.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why, but I arrived in the Antarctic expecting to come face to face with our shared, dystopian future. I thought that seals were going to be choking on plastic bags, that chunks of once pristine icebergs were going to be melting into piles of greyish mush. I thought it might trigger alarm bells. Instead, the air is fresher than any I\u2019ve ever breathed, there\u2019s wildlife in abundance, the seawater runs clear.</p> <p>But being here is an eerie reminder that we can\u2019t wait for the consequences of climate change to be visible in places like this \u2013 it will be far too late by then. It\u2019s no coincidence, I\u2019m realising, that the only continent with no permanent population and few visitors is also the one in which nature has best survived the most damaging effects of humankind. And far from despairing, I feel myself becoming more determined than ever to help preserve this unsoiled natural world. It\u2019s suddenly real, no longer an idea in the abstract, or a scene on TV. Spending time with people who\u2019ve given their lives to defending it is a stark reminder that most of us can, and must, play a bigger part in its survival, if we\u2019re to turn the tide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b45a5086ea02510f89f9322fc4276fa3ec8df95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b45a5086ea02510f89f9322fc4276fa3ec8df95/0_167_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usnea Granger, a deckhand, in waterproof clothing and helmet, by the pilot door onboard the Esperanza, in the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaign trail: Usnea Granger, one of Esperanza\u2019s deckhands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf anything, I think working for Greenpeace has made me <em>more</em> hopeful,\u201d Romo assures me. \u201cYou\u2019re doing something positive and proactive, and seeing the results of your effort. Last time we came to Antarctica we were campaigning to make ocean sanctuaries to protect wildlife from overfishing. We didn\u2019t achieve everything, but we forced the boats here into creating buffer zones for penguin feeding grounds, and that\u2019s a win.\u201d Romo isn\u2019t complacent. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve come back again. \u201cThe climate emergency is the biggest threat to civilisation as we know it, and that\u2019s a challenge. But if I\u2019m going to be anywhere to fight it, here\u2019s the right place to be.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Two or three</strong></em> <em><strong>weeks in,</strong></em> I\u2019ve lost track of time completely. The team has turned its eye to scientific research. A high-tech underwater robot camera scours the seabed for trash and mysterious species, and we visit the colossal A-68, the largest iceberg to have broken off from the shelf. (It is twice the size of Luxembourg.) Through the mist, it stretches out as far as the eye can see in every direction, a sinister omen of what further global warming might bring.</p> <p>From the South Orkneys we sail closer to the Antarctic Peninsula, a strip of the continent that protrudes northwards into more navigable waters. I become spoilt: a few whales spotted starboard aren\u2019t as close as the last pod; with notes on a whiteboard updating me, the idea of having to plan my own day feels like a drag.</p> <p>There\u2019s on-board wifi keeping me connected to civilisation, although how it works remains a mystery. (It involves, I\u2019m told, a complicated satellite system.) Just a few years ago, being at the end of the world meant losing touch completely. If, say, a panic-inducing medical epidemic happened to sweep the world, you wouldn\u2019t hear about it. I\u2019m grateful I can Skype my family, but while being online is convenient, a part of me was hoping for a little more isolation. I wanted to switch off and experience time spent truly off-grid. Instead, I\u2019m scrolling through Instagram, responding to work emails as if I\u2019m sitting at my London desk. But then, one particularly bumpy afternoon, I drop my iPhone when a big wave hits, and the screen smashes to pieces, so I surrender myself completely to my life at sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbcec3afe9f027f3686901042be9cbf93ba6fcd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbcec3afe9f027f3686901042be9cbf93ba6fcd9/0_126_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stormy sky and a rubber dingy at sea (with a few people on it) towing a large ship's fender with the words \u2018Ocean Destroyer\u2019 on it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Storm clouds: activists towing a large ship\u2019s fender.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McConnell/Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One day, a picture-perfect sunset appears over Discovery Bay, on the north side of the South Shetlands. I polish off my final bottle of stowed-away duty-free Malbec. Then Will McCallum, Greenpeace\u2019s head of oceans, appears with the news I\u2019ve been waiting for: my opportunity to set foot on the continent has finally come. \u201cWhat we have seen sailing from the Arctic to the Antarctic was much more dramatic than we expected,\u201d McCallum explains, \u201cand ocean-going industries are paying scant attention to the need to rein in their worst excesses.\u201d What is at stake, he says, is not only the survival of the creatures that inhabit the waters they\u2019ve visited, but also life on this planet as we know it. The ocean sustains life on Earth by providing us with oxygen; nearly half our planet depends on it for food. Here in the Antarctic, climate change means parts of the continent have reached unprecedented temperatures. Without urgent action the consequences of ice melts, and subsequent sea level rises, will be devastating.</p> <p>Conveniently for me, however, Greenpeace doesn\u2019t just want to highlight destruction. With a team of photographers, videographers and social media types they want to document the continent\u2019s beauty \u2013 to capture just what is at risk.</p> <p>A short trip in the speedboat and I\u2019m standing alone on a green, mossy carpet atop a hill on Barrientos Island. Thousands of chinstrap and gentoo penguins are standing, swimming and shitting on all sides. In front of me, the infinite, silky ocean. Behind, mountains drenched in sun and thick, white snow. It\u2019s bliss. Too soon, it\u2019s time to head back to the Esperanza. A few days later, we\u2019ll begin our long journey home.</p> <p>The sound of us upping anchor for a final time brings with it a sudden panic. My month at sea has left me institutionalised: once I disembark who\u2019ll cook my lunch, pick the film, tell me when and where to be? Most of all, though, I fear I\u2019ve taken my time soaking up the Antarctic\u2019s splendour for granted. Did I make the most of it? What will I do when I look through a window and all this magnificence just isn\u2019t there? I suppose those last ones are probably questions we all have to grapple with. Unless there\u2019s a radical shift in how we interact with our precious planet, there might well come a day when we look up and it\u2019ll have disappeared for good.</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus doesn\u2019t respect national borders, political ideologies or conventional thinking. As governments scramble to try to contain the pandemic and mitigate the fallout on economies and societies, the previously unthinkable is suddenly transformed into the essential. Policy ideas that were decried as madness yesterday are being redefined as the only sane response to this emergency. Positions once held to be immutable are being tossed into a great bonfire of discarded orthodoxies.</p> <p>This is an especially bracing challenge for politicians of the right, they who have been animated for decades by the belief that the only good government is a small one and that there is no problem to which the market cannot supply the answer. A philosophy rooted in the conviction that individualism and competition are the wellsprings of healthy and productive societies is found wanting when confronted by a crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity.</p> <p>You can see some of the tensions this creates in the strained and exhausted face of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/boris-johnson-to-hold-daily-coronavirus-press-briefings\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> whenever he appears at the now daily news conferences. This instinctive libertarian, who used to earn his living by penning newspaper columns ridiculing \u201cthe nanny state\u201d is being impelled to introduce social controls of a kind not seen since the Second World War. Some of the constraints go further than that time of national trial. They didn\u2019t shut the boozers during the Blitz. He finds himself, and clearly hates having to be, the prime minister responsible \u201cfor taking away the ancient and inalienable right of every freeborn Englishman to go to the pub\u201d.</p> <p>As the beer taps are closed, the spending spigots are being turned up in a way never seen before. The Tory leader who only recently won an election in part by attacking Jeremy Corbyn as the last of the big spenders will now preside over the most dramatic escalation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\" title=\"\">government expenditure </a>since the 1940s to try to save the economy from being ravaged by a depression.</p> <p>For government and voters alike, this crisis is a rushed tutorial in the case for the active and well-resourced state. Only government can take the exceptional measures required to curtail human activity in the hope that it will curb the spread of infection. Only government has the capacity to effectively perform as an insurer of last resort for the huge number of companies facing extinction unless they receive state aid. Only government can provide a safety net for workers deprived of the ability to earn their living because they are ill or trying to do the right thing by isolating themselves or because their employer is in trouble.</p> <p>Welfare is bad. Balance the books. It is not the role of government to bail out failing companies. All those beliefs long worshipped in the churches of conservatism are being sacrificed in the fierce urgency of the now.</p> <p>When events are moving at such an extraordinary pace, it can be easy to lose appreciation of the boggling scale of this transformation. Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\" title=\"\">first budget</a> was just 10 days ago, but already feels like an artefact from another era. There was a bit of a collective swoon among Tory MPs at the \u00a312bn he initially allocated to dealing with the virus. What he then called \u201cunprecedented\u201d intervention now looks like small change. Just six days later, he was back to announce a package of tax holidays, grants and business loans worth \u00a3350bn, almost 30 times as much as he had originally proposed. The chancellor declared this to be proof that the government would do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/so-far-whatever-it-takes-is-not-nearly-enough\" title=\"\">\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d </a>\u2013 only to be told that it would take a great deal more to see us through this crisis. The clamour came not just from opposition politicians, trades unions and charities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Forced to decide between Tory doctrine and food riots, Mr Sunak made the right choice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the arresting tableaux of the past few days has been Bernard Jenkin and other representatives of the Thatcherite right adding their voices to those of more centrist Tories such as Greg Clark, the former business secretary, to demand much broader help. Under that pressure, Mr Sunak came up with what was effectively his third emergency budget in less than a fortnight, when he announced higher welfare payments and a mammoth programme to subsidise the wages of workers who would otherwise be facing redundancy. \u201cThis is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy,\u201d remarked a man once known as a fiscal hawk as he dispatched another barrow-load of Tory sacred beliefs on to the bonfire of orthodoxies.</p> <p>He presented a confident face designed to mask the profound fear within government about the consequences of not taking the extraordinary step of making the state responsible for much of the economy\u2019s wage bills. The alternative was to see a massive and rapid surge in unemployment that would have overwhelmed the welfare system and threatened serious civil disorder. Forced to decide between Tory doctrine and food riots, Mr Sunak made the right choice.</p> <p>Similar things are happening around the world as governments battle to prevent an inevitable downturn from sliding into a deep depression. Donald Trump is even talking about sending a cheque from Washington direct to every American.</p> <p>This emergency differs in key respects to that of the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/20/2008-financial-crisis-coronavirus-138263\" title=\"\">Great Crash of 2008</a>, but some useful lessons can be drawn from the last global crisis. One is that governments and central banks have to act quickly, decisively and at scale to give confidence to markets, households and businesses that the state has their back and that it is possible for people to plan for a future when the crisis is over. Near-zero interest rates, quantitative easing and bank bailouts, the tools used during the financial crisis, did avert a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but it was only slowly that people came to appreciate the negative social consequences that stretched wealth inequalities and stoked a wide and deep public alienation. The spectacle of shameless financiers walking away unscathed from a wreck of their own reckless making and then going on to further enrich themselves fed a righteous rage among the less affluent folk who felt the squeeze of subsequent austerity. \u201cWe all remember what happened in 2008,\u201d Mr Johnson remarked last week, alluding to the debates within his cabinet about the dangers of a massive public backlash if the government is seen only to be looking after big business. Time and again, he tells companies that the government is standing by them so they can stand by their employees.</p> <p>There are critics who say that the gargantuan amounts of government spending being fired at this crisis are too scattergun. Money will end up in the hands of badly run or badly behaved companies. Money will go to some who don\u2019t really need it. Money will be wasted. To which we can only say: so be it. There is no time for government to develop sophisticated schemes with complex delivery mechanisms. The need is to make financial assistance available as simply and swiftly as possible. This crisis calls not for the sniper\u2019s rifle but the bazooka.</p> <p>The hope \u2013 it can be no more than a hope at this stage of uncertainty \u2013 is that a sharp dive in the global economy will be followed by a strong bounce-back when restrictions can be lifted and millions go back to work and return to spending. But that can only happen if there are still businesses left standing.</p> <p>Ministers and officials cannot say how much all the emergency measures will cost, because they can\u2019t know. We can safely say that the sums will be huge. Robert Chote, the director of the Office for Budget Responsibility, would normally have something very chiding to say about a government prepared to let the deficit rip in such a staggering fashion. Now he observes: \u201cWhen the fire is large enough you just spray the water and worry about it later.\u201d</p> <p>Fiscal disciplinarians on the right are largely swallowing it on the grounds that there is no alternative. Libertarians of the state-shrinking and welfare-loathing disposition are reconciling themselves to measures that they\u2019d normally hate with the thought that they are temporary impositions that will be lifted one day. Once the virus is brought under control, either by the production of a vaccine or other measures, then politics can go back to business as usual.</p> <p>I rather doubt that. While it is far too early to make any confident predictions about the longterm ways in which this crisis will reshape society, it has already upended many of the assumptions that have governed politics here and elsewhere for decades. It is hard to believe that a once-in-a-century event will not have some once-in-a-century consequences.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<h2>Cocktail hour</h2> <p><em><strong>Henry Porter, novelist and Vanity Fair editor<br></strong></em>One of the nastier aspects of the pandemic is that it turns your friends and all that you do to show them affection \u2013 hug and kiss; share meals and drinks \u2013 into a deadly threat. And yet, in this appalling moment, we need our friends more than ever, and it is probably true that our immune systems do, too. Isolation is bad for a species addicted to social intercourse.</p> <p>My solution has been to start a cocktail hour on a video conferencing site, sending one or two friends every day an invitation to drinks in front of their laptop (or phone) at a time when we might normally meet in a pub or at each other\u2019s homes. It\u2019s surprising what a difference it can make to a day of isolation, and to your spirits in general, to see your friends\u2019 faces in the evening and hear them talk and laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a0b6941bba9804e9ebbd2a1d74b5c72ac24553c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0b6941bba9804e9ebbd2a1d74b5c72ac24553c4/0_0_595_357/500.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Porter enjoying cocktail hour with glass of wine, a laptop and a few friends.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Porter enjoying cocktail hour with a few friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liz Elliot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scale of Covid-19 and what it\u2019s doing to us is very worrying, but an hour with different friends every evening really helps reduce anxiety, and of course you can make much more effort than I do \u2013 dress up, light candles, provide nibbles (crisps make too much noise). Whatever joy is released when you see your pals in the flesh is also present in these video cocktails, and the beautiful thing is that for a small charge the host gets unlimited conference calls (I pay \u00a3110 annually for BlueJeans) and guests pay nothing.</p> <p>Clearly, this can be expanded to talking to neighbours you may not know very well, or people you believe are really suffering from enforced isolation and loneliness. It may even be a good way of meeting people. Each participant might invite a person no one else knows. It\u2019s certainly great for new mothers, book clubs, football supporters \u2013 anyone who is missing out on regular contact.</p> <p>Despite the remoteness of the interaction and the occasional annoyances of the technology, I find that people really talk in the video cocktail hour. Maybe that has something to do with the ambiguity of the interaction \u2013 you are neither alone nor really in company. You are half-way between the two and perhaps that makes you more candid.</p> <p>Sites I have used include Zoom, BlueJeans and Whypay?

It connects us with the outdoors and the gentle satisfaction of watching things grow brings a unique positivity. If you\u2019ve no garden, there are plenty of ways to grow indoors.</p> <p>You\u2019ll need a sunny windowsill, inside or out. I always advise beginners to grow herbs. They\u2019re easy and delicious \u2013 and when supermarket supplies are low they become increasingly worthwhile. The plastic trays that tomatoes and mushrooms come in will do \u2013 just make some holes in the bottom for drainage.</p> <p>Fill with, ideally, peat-free multipurpose compost (most nurseries deliver and will be grateful for the custom). Parsley and basil rub along happily next to one another, but mint\u2019s a bit of a thug and better in its own pot. You can also chuck in some salad leaf seeds: pea shoots, rocket and nasturtiums germinate quickly and are tasty at any point in their growing cycle. Sow according to packet instructions: you\u2019ll need a fraction of what\u2019s in the packet.</p> <p>Keep the soil moist \u2013 an old spray bottle is perfect for this \u2013 before and after shoots appear. If youharvest no more than a third of the plant at a time, all should bounce back.</p> <h2>Exercise</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8171edf6fb053128f7580e7498a3248fbe350b86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8171edf6fb053128f7580e7498a3248fbe350b86/0_347_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman stretching on piano bench\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Justin Jacobs, manager, Equinox fitness clubs</strong></em><em><strong><br></strong></em>We are creatures of habit in what we eat, when we work, what TV shows we watch.

Consider the space and think about what mood you want works best. If you want your kitchen to give you a little lift each morning, go for light, bright tones. Avoid mistakes: that shade that looks gorgeous on the tin (or on Instagram), can look less appealing on walls with less natural light or in a different-sized room, so swatching is key.</p> <p>Test multiple swatches on every wall. Paint dries to a different shade, so don\u2019t be freaked out. Walk away and come back when it\u2019s fully dry before considering how it looks. If you\u2019ll need two coats, do two coats when you swatch. Pay attention to how the colour is affected by light at the times you use the room most.</p> <p>When it comes to painting a wall, use a brush to \u201ccut in\u201d first. This means painting the corners and edges before anything else \u2013 it gives a better finish. Rollers are ideal for large areas and easier on the hands. Make sure you have the correct roller for the surface \u2013 check with your paint supplier.</p> <p>I favour water-based paint \u2013 it doesn\u2019t trap moisture, it\u2019s kinder to the environment and the clean-up is easier. Also, while modern satin and sheen paint finishes are great, consider a matt paint in an older home: it won\u2019t bounce light from any dents and imperfections.

I knee-patched jeans, darned jumpers and, before you could say \u201ctreadle-powered Singer sewing machine\u201d, I had bought one and started making things from scratch. I shirted and trousered myself, and with knitting needles I socked and jumpered. I learned crochet so I could make Y-fronts using nettle fibre.

Like any activity that involves applying your mind to the physical universe, sewing is meditative. It puts you in the here and now.</p> <p>Gradually I set aside the angst that had got me started and started sewing for pleasure. Hoping others might follow, I let my repairs show themselves off, using thread of contrasting colours to edge holes in a jumper, and to stitch the slogan \u201cFresh Air Machine\u201d on the back.</p> <p>I published a book about all this, initially as a limited series of hand-bound books I stitched together, with bits of cereal box and old shirts for the cover. (Better than it sounds.) This, too, was meditative work.</p> <p>If you want to have a go, try darning something. (Look at YouTube.) Cut something up and use it to patch something else.

  "<p>When the novelist Maggie O\u2019Farrell was 16, she was invited to a fancy-dress party and knew at once who to be. She put on a black shirt, with a ruffled paper collar, an inky cloak made out of a skirt, her Doc Martens and cheeky shorts over black leggings. To complete her ensemble, she borrowed a skull from her school\u2019s biology lab. She had become obsessed with Hamlet: \u201cHe had got under my skin. I felt he was part of my DNA.\u201d And while there is no mystery about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/25/hamlet-andrew-scott-harold-pinter-theatre-west-end-transfer-review-robert-icke\" title=\"\">Hamlet</a>\u2019s glamorous turbulence appealing to an adolescent, O\u2019Farrell\u2019s feeling was to be rekindled, as an adult, by her discovery of the play\u2019s connection with Shakespeare\u2019s son, Hamnet. There was, she was sure, a novel in it. Over the years, she repeatedly tried to write that novel and almost gave up. Yet it was a story that refused to abandon her.</p> <p>And now, here it is: <em><a href=\"https://www.maggieofarrell.com/titles/maggie-ofarrell/hamnet/9781472223791/\" title=\"\">Hamnet</a> </em>\u2013 the novel of her career. And that is saying something because O\u2019Farrell is the author of eight accomplished and hugely popular books. She won the Costa novel award, in 2010, for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/25/hand-that-first-held-mine\" title=\"\">The Hand That First Held Mine</a></em>, and shortlisted for both <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/03/instructions-heatwave-maggie-ofarrell-review\" title=\"\">Instructions for a Heatwave</a></em> (2013) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/27/this-must-be-the-place-by-maggie-ofarrell-review\" title=\"\">This Must Be the Place</a></em> (2016).

But <em>Hamnet</em> is a novel apart. And what distinguishes it from O\u2019Farrell\u2019s earlier work is that while it shares the page-turning verve of its predecessors, it pulls off what younger writers (she is now 47) seldom achieve: the power of letting a story appear to tell itself. It reads like a fairytale rooted in heartbreaking reality \u2013 there is no magic with which to save a child.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re told he did not want to be with Anne, that she trapped him.

His brief and precious life was, O\u2019Farrell thinks, more significant than literary historians suppose. In Shakespeare\u2019s time, Hamlet and Hamnet were, according to the critic Steven Greenblatt in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, the same name. It is not that Hamnet has never featured on stage or screen: there was Kenneth Branagh\u2019s 2018 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/21/all-is-true-review-ben-elton-kenneth-branagh-shakespeare\" title=\"\">All </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/21/all-is-true-review-ben-elton-kenneth-branagh-shakespeare\" title=\"\">Is True</a></em>, written by Ben Elton; a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/11/hamnet-a-play-for-shakespeares-forgotten-son-and-one-11-year-old-actor\" title=\"\">short, one-boy</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/11/hamnet-a-play-for-shakespeares-forgotten-son-and-one-11-year-old-actor\" title=\"\"> show by Bush Moukarzel</a>; and David Mitchell in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/17/the-upstart-crow-review-gielgud-theatre-london\" title=\"\">The Upstart Crow</a></em> (also by Elton), mentions Shakespeare\u2019s bereavement. But no one has, until now, imaginatively investigated the connection between Hamnet and Hamlet \u2013 what is likely to be a clear link between Shakespeare\u2019s life and his work. Claire Tomalin, Dominic Dromgoole and Kamila Shamsie are among those competing for superlatives to hail the novel, and everyone I know who has managed to get hold of an advance copy is in love with it. Of one thing I\u2019m certain: anyone who reads it will find it impossible to see <em>Hamlet </em>again without thinking about the boy after whom the play was named.</p> <p>It is 11 o\u2019clock on a grey winter morning in Edinburgh and the plan is to meet O\u2019Farrell in a local cafe and walk together to her house. I am waiting as she pushes open the cafe door in a fast-forward flurry. What is immediately likable is that she seems unaware of making a dramatic entrance and of her striking appearance. She is wearing a silver Puffa jacket \u2013 as though outer space might be her next stop \u2013 and has piercingly blue eyes and, a mass of auburn curls and is yanked into the cafe by a small lurcher. \u201cLuna,\u201d she explains, \u201cmy sister\u2019s dog.\u201d</p> <p>We arrive at a double-fronted stone house and she leads the way into the sunny kitchen. The room\u2019s occupants are mainly cats (it is a school day) and there is a sketch of Voldemort in fancy lace-up boots left behind by her daughter on the kitchen table. A wall of glass gives on to the garden and the vibe is bohemian in a good way, with plenty of evidence of a family life: she has three children with her novelist husband, William Sutcliffe \u2013 a son of 16 and daughters aged 10 and seven.</p> <p>We sit down at the kitchen table, and O\u2019Farrell explains the book\u2019s beginnings when she was at Cambridge University studying English (having got in from a comprehensive school in North Berwick): \u201cAt that time, studying English was frustrating because it was all about post-Marxist readings \u2013 you were several removes from the text.\u201d But it was through reading biographies of Shakespeare that she learned of Hamnet\u2019s existence. \u201cWhenever they talked about his death, it would be followed by several paragraphs about infant mortality in the late 16th century.\u201d The authors would explain that infant mortality was commonplace and imply that parents barely reacted when their children died. \u201cI found this an extraordinary assumption,\u201d she says. \u201cHamnet was 11...\u201d</p> <p>After leaving university, she would ask friends if they knew the names of Shakespeare\u2019s children \u2013 had they heard of Hamnet, the twin brother to Shakespeare\u2019s second daughter, Judith? When she told them about Hamnet, they thought she was making him up. \u201cThey said: \u2018No! Are you sure?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Yes, I\u2019m absolutely positive.\u2019 And I thought: if they don\u2019t know, then maybe quite a lot of people don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88702ad26a39644066ad3b04ff97468730ef31aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88702ad26a39644066ad3b04ff97468730ef31aa/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie O\u2019Farrell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For all of Shakespeare\u2019s incredible output, he left a very scant paper trail\u2019... Maggie O\u2019Farrell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the stumbling blocks to writing the novel was the feeling of presumption about characterising a genius (she describes herself as an Anthony Burgess fan but thinks his novel about Shakespeare, <em>Nothing Like the Sun</em>, does not come off). I notice she never uses Shakespeare\u2019s name in the book. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. When you\u2019re sitting at your computer, immersed in the world you\u2019ve created, and have to write: \u2018William Shakespeare had his breakfast\u2026\u2019 it\u2019s impossible not to think: I\u2019m an eejit. Even calling him William seems colossally presumptuous,\u201d and she gives in to a gale of laughter.</p> <p>But an indignation was growing in O\u2019Farrell that would prove stronger than doubt or mirth \u2013 not about Shakespeare but about his wife, Anne Hathaway (also known as Agnes). Agnes is also dismissed by biographers: \u201cFrom scholarly texts to popular culture, we\u2019re told Shakespeare\u2019s wife was an older woman, a peasant. We\u2019re told he did not want to be with her, that she trapped him into marriage. We\u2019re drip-fed this image. I started to feel anger about how domestic life is diminished: people want to believe Shakespeare appeared in London fully formed, that he did not have a domestic life.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The assumption he did not grieve is outrageous. It\u2019s not nothing to call a play and a tragic hero after your son</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Germaine Greer\u2019s book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/01/biography.germainegreer\" title=\"\">Shakespeare\u2019s Wife</a></em>, which O\u2019Farrell found \u201cinspirational\u201d, recommends that people stop asking: why did Shakespeare marry her? and ask instead: why did she marry him? \u201cPeople think of Agnes as a cradle-snatching yokel who married a younger man but her family was wealthy, they had a successful sheep farm. I kept thinking: why would a 26-year-old woman, with a good dowry and a secure home want to marry this fellow? He had no trade and was only 18.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no evidence he hated his wife or his domestic life. And the assumption he did not grieve for Hamnet is outrageous. It\u2019s not nothing to call a play and a tragic hero after your son \u2013 it speaks volumes. We may not quite know what the volumes are \u2013 but it\u2019s a huge act.\u201d She adds that Shakespeare cannot have been indifferent to his family as he sent money made in London back to Stratford and, when he retired, returned to live there with his wife. O\u2019Farrell went to Stratford-upon-Avon to research the book: \u201cWhat\u2019s astonishing at Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace in Henley Street is that, for all his incredible output, he has left a very scant paper trail, so to be able to walk into that house is astonishing. It\u2019s incredibly moving. It seems so unlikely it has survived, that we can walk through it and into the room in which he was born, the room in which he ate. I went round it several times and talked to several guides and asked millions of questions. They were very patient \u2013 they exude such knowledge and love and enthusiasm.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10b63a1da8f6897f2cedd3af101103f2fdd76657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b63a1da8f6897f2cedd3af101103f2fdd76657/0_0_4080_2369/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace in Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace in Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PC Turner/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet because so little is known about Shakespeare, O\u2019Farrell had a free rein. This is a novel that, above all, like her memoir, addresses mortality. And, as readers of her memoir know, O\u2019Farrell\u2019s own survival has been against the odds. To mention just three incidents described in <em>I am, I am, I am: </em>she jumped off a harbour wall \u2013 a 15-metre drop into black water \u2013 and lived to tell the tale. She was held up by a machete-wielding man in Chile. She gave the slip to a man who later murdered a young woman. In <em>Hamnet</em>, she writes: \u201cWhat is given may be taken away, at any time.\u201d As a writer, she is most herself when on the brink, when thinking about what it is for a life to hang in the balance. And for her, balance has particular significance. She has written about encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, which exiled her from school aged eight, turned her into a reader and tilted her world (she still sometimes sees things upside down). It is an \u201cimpairment to a number of neurological functions, one of which is the ability to sense where things are or should be and my place among them\u201d. It is a condition from which she might have died.</p> <p>Strangely, given how devastatingly she writes about bereavement, she has never lost anyone close to her: \u201cWhat informed the novel is the peril we live in with my daughter.\u201d Her middle daughter suffers from anaphylaxis, a potentially lethal allergic reaction, and can go into shock just sitting next to someone eating peanuts. \u201cIt\u2019s every parent\u2019s worst and most visceral fear that you will lose your child. That \u2013 and the idea you couldn\u2019t save them or weren\u2019t able to safeguard them. I cannot imagine the agony of having to bury a child. It must be unlike anything else.\u201d</p> <p>But is the situation with her daughter under control? \u201cNo. She is 10 and in great danger all the time from naturally occurring things in her environment. We can\u2019t control it at all. I realised when I wrote my memoir, <em>a</em> memoir \u2013 the indefinite article is better \u2013 it\u2019s only when you finish a book that you understand why you\u2019ve written it. Doing the final copy edit, I realised that trying to pin down in words what she goes through was my way of trying to feel in control but that control was illusory.\u201d</p> <p>Living vigilantly \u2013 being constantly on red alert \u2013 is key to understanding O\u2019Farrell and her writing. And although she is not superstitious, a further stumbling block to finishing <em>Hamnet</em> was the fear that it was playing with fire to imagine the death of an 11-year-old boy when she had a son who, at the time, was under 11 himself. \u201cIf I was doing this, I\u2019d have to put myself inside the skin of a woman sitting beside her son, laying him out for burial. I thought, I cannot do it \u2013 imagine! My son used to say [teasingly picking up on his mother\u2019s anxiety]: \u2018On my 12th birthday you probably won\u2019t give me a birthday party.\u2019 That was not true and he\u2019s almost 17 now...\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e48a147cdd06edfa39716553df088c92c09ac931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48a147cdd06edfa39716553df088c92c09ac931/0_129_1536_1919/800.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie O\u2019Farrell with her cats Malachy, right, and Moses, in 2007.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maggie O\u2019Farrell with her cats Malachy, right, and Moses, in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Maggie O'Farrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I ask whether taking risks is still part of who she is, she says she has played safer since having children. But mightn\u2019t writing be seen as a form of risk-taking? As brave? Exposing? She laughs in disbelief: \u201cWriting is not brave, it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. Surgeons are brave. If there\u2019s a hierarchy of bravery, writers are somewhere near the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Farrell is an interesting mixture \u2013 flighty and earthed. Open and judiciously closed. She never swanks. She talks freely about difficult subjects but swerves from even tame questions that close in on her character. She will not say whether she craves solitude or discuss her intuitions and ducks giving an account of her working day although, to be fair, this might be because she does not have one. \u201cRoutine\u201d and \u201corganisation\u201d are alien to her. She gestures at her kitchen and insists tidiness is beyond her, absently fielding a dropped toy from the floor to confirm the point.</p> <p>Ironically, she has much more to say on the subject of her stammer. Speech therapy \u2013 five years ago \u2013 has helped although radio interviews, she says, remain a challenge. \u201cEvery stammerer has a collection of sounds they can\u2019t start off on and one of mine was \u2018M\u2019.\u201d And that is not easy when your name is Maggie. But writing has always been a reprieve. \u201cThere\u2019s indescribable joy in being able to write when nothing stops you.\u201d</p> <p>Might hearing the criticisms of a novelist husband sometimes stop her? \u201cWill and I have known each other a long time. We met in the first year of university but weren\u2019t together for another 10 years. I trust his judgment and know he will tell me what he thinks.

The daughter of an economist, she grew up with her mother and two sisters in Wales and Scotland. As an adult, she has lived in Hong Kong (a year working for a computer magazine) and London (as an arts journalist). But Ireland never loosens its hold: \u201cMy passport is Irish and, since Brexit, I\u2019m clinging proudly to it. I\u2019m wary of claiming Irish heritage but I often mistily think: I shall move back to Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>She once wrote: \u201cIn any fairytale, getting what you want comes at a cost.\u201d What does she want herself? \u201cI want Brexit not to have happened.

They\u2019ll have huge strains on them and no immunity to digital onslaught and destruction. How can we equip them to cope?\u201d About her own future, she volunteers nothing. Instead, she tells a story. One day, while she was writing <em>Hamnet</em>, her daughter looked over her shoulder and started to read. After a while, she remarked to her mother: \u201cI don\u2019t like this story \u2013 it\u2019s too sad. Please write a happy story next.\u201d And now, as <em>Hamnet</em> finds its audience, O\u2019Farrell is settling down to a children\u2019s book, to be published at the end of the year. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be happy \u2013 I\u2019m doing it for her.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Hamnet</em> is published by Tinder Press on 31 March (\u00a320).

  "<p>Since the essential raw material of their business is chance, bookmakers tend to assume that they will, for the most part, enjoy an unlimited supply. For more than 200 years, through periods of immense social, economic, political and technological upheaval, bookies have carried on adjusting the odds on an ever-expanding number of sports and events, paying out winners and taking a percentage for their trouble.</p> \n<p>Now, at a stroke, the sporting diary has effectively, and indefinitely, been cleared as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Horse racing meetings, the weekend-to-weekend routine of the football season and the big annual or one-off events like the Grand National, the Masters golf and Euro 2020 have all been scratched in less than a fortnight.

  "<p>Last week, the British economic and financial system came very close to breakdown. An extraordinary number of companies were, and are, in acute financial distress, threatening mass lay-offs and the cessation of swathes of economic activity. There was an almost complete collapse in investor confidence, with attempts to sell every financial asset \u2013 even high-quality government bonds \u2013 in a desperate quest to hold cash. Such was the loss of generalised faith in the integrity of the system that the governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/andrew-bailey\" title=\"\">Andrew Bailey</a>, came close to shutting the financial markets.</p> <p>The scale of the incredible drama \u2013 much more acute than the financial crisis of September 2008 and still unfolding \u2013 only commanded half our attention. Most eyes understandably were focused on the march of the coronavirus and the missteps and miscommunications of a prime minister unsuited for the leadership demands of high office.</p> <p>The confusion and growing public panic at the uncertain response was amplified manyfold in the financial markets, matched by fear and uncertainty in the real economy that produces the goods and services we want and need. The Treasury and the Bank of England stared into an abyss. Thankfully their officials, derided by the cabal of second-rate ideologue advisers at Number 10, were up to the task.</p> <p>Here Boris Johnson \u2013 and the country \u2013 got lucky. The Conservative party, broken by the triumph of anti-EU ideology and the wilful disregard for fact that is the hallmark of the Brexiter mindset, now offers the weakest talent pool in its long history. But the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, is an unexpected outlier. Officials report that he is proving highly intelligent, economically literate, agile and with acutely sensitive political antennae. Thus the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\" title=\"\">unprecedented interventions</a> last week \u2013 with much more to come in the weeks ahead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Business cannot prosper without buyers for its products: the good health and predictable income of workers are vital</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even as I write, the Treasury and the Bank are in urgent talks to organise bailout packages for a number of top companies (including, but not only, airlines), sometimes taking government share stakes along the lines of the bailout of RBS in 2008.</p> <p>But it was only last Monday that the government genuinely thought that if it stood behind business with a massive programme of soft loans, with grants for hard-hit sectors, it might escape without having to go much further. It did not need to sully its hands with un-Tory propositions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">underwriting worker incomes</a> together with improved benefits for those thrown out of work.</p> <p>However, the crisis of confidence in the financial markets and intense lobbying by the CBI and the TUC soon changed minds, none faster than the initially sceptical Sunak. After all, business cannot prosper without buyers for its products: the good health and predictable incomes of the working population are vital. The last vestiges of Thatcherite individualism are being torched. Social partnership is back with a vengeance</p> <p>Meanwhile, the top echelons of the Bank of England witnessed the consequences of the outbreak as mounting panic in global trading hit British markets badly, all magnified by Johnson\u2019s bumbles. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/britain-faces-economic-emergency-warns-new-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-covid-19\" title=\"\">sterling crisis</a> expected with a no-deal Brexit was brought forward: a currency dependent on the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d, given the scale of Britain\u2019s monumental international balance of payments deficit, was in near freefall. There had to be a twin response: a fiscal one that \u201cwould blow the bloody wall down\u201d and a shock-and-awe monetary intervention to try to steady shattered bond markets.</p> <p>The Bank moved first, committing to a \u00a3200bn programme of printing money to buy bonds (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/bank-of-englands-qe-programme-is-bigger-than-the-city-expected\" title=\"\">quantitative easing</a>) and cutting interest rates to a symbolic 0.1%. For the moment, the markets have steadied. Then came Sunak\u2019s measures, the centrepiece of which was the commitment to pay 80% of the wages (up to \u00a32,500 a month) of workers threatened by lay-off. He also ratcheted up support for renters and those on universal credit.</p> <p>Two million people working in the now shut hospitality sector will be immediately eligible, along with up to five million more as the economy contracts by at least one fifth in the months ahead, with the expected package for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/self-employed-coronavirus-crisis-sick-pay-redundancy-benefits\" title=\"\">self-employed</a> adding yet more. At its peak, the cost per month will exceed \u00a325bn and the scheme will plainly need extending. The budget deficit in 2020-21 will comfortably exceed \u00a3200bn, to be financed, if necessary, by the Bank of England printing money. There are no other options. One privy to the policy told me that even at the last they were unsure whether Sunak \u201chad the balls\u201d. He did. It is what had to be done \u2013 and is being reproduced across Europe and North America.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnson is too divisive a figure, too thin-skinned and too unserious to lead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is wartime finance for wartime economic conditions. Over and above the multiple bailout packages currently being negotiated will come state direction and manufacture of vaccines, key medical products, respirators, and the takeover of private hospitals. Key workers \u2013 in the NHS, police, transport and food supply chain \u2013 will have to be marshalled in their millions and their wellbeing and health protected. Rationing of key foodstuffs will need to be imposed. The only way to head off a full-scale collapse of sterling and protracted economic depression will be to defer Brexit for at least a year or, as one source told me, five years. Government communications will have to be infinitely more sure-footed. The government itself has to be 100% trusted.</p> <p>The open question is whether Johnson\u2019s government, with its \u201cfrighteningly weak\u201d core at Number 10, as one insider reported to me, can do what is necessary. If not there will, as in wartime, have to be a national government (headed by Sunak with Keir Starmer as his deputy). Johnson is too divisive a figure, too thin-skinned, too unserious in his messaging and with too divisive a history, to lead.</p> <p>Sunak and Starmer offer competence and humanity above ideology. Whether through the deferral of Brexit or smart and well-thought-through state direction of the economy, they will do what is needed to get us through. In the meantime, take social distancing seriously. Be one of those who put society and social obligations first. And stay safe.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>",

It\u2019s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feeding-britain-9780241442227.html\" title=\"\">Feeding Britain</a></em>, that, \u201calthough not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge\u201d, it\u2019s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble.</p> <p>Lang, who established the pioneering <a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/health-sciences/research/centre-for-food-policy\" title=\"\">Centre for Food Policy</a> at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. \u201cI did not write that lightly,\u201d he says, when we meet in central London. \u201cI sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.\u201d Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. \u201cI like my food,\u201d he says. \u201cMore joy around food has come into our lives.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Lang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. \u201cWhen I looked at the numbers on inequality,\u201d he says, \u201cI was shocked. There\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.\u201d As he says: \u201cFood is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\u201d Food may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere.</p> <p>His doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. \u201cThere is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018leave it to Tesco\u2019 approach,\u201d he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. \u201cThey get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a685116511d8a98812d14017a1e7037fb161c33a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a685116511d8a98812d14017a1e7037fb161c33a/0_16_4339_2603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elderly woman looks at empty shelves at a Tesco supermarket in London, March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have a default position that someone else will feed us\u2019: empty supermarket shelves, one consequence of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.\u201d I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. \u201cThere is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.\u201d Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full.</p> <p>He\u2019s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Problem-Relation-National-Defences/dp/B0055DAUGQ\" title=\"\">Our Food Problem and Its Relation </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Food-Problem-Relation-National-Defences/dp/B0055DAUGQ\" title=\"\">to Our National Defences</a></em>, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children\u2019s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/29/saving-britains-food-supply-manifesto-jay-rayner\" title=\"\"> food supply chain was exceedingly delicate</a> and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. \u201cBeveridge was totally ignored,\u201d Lang says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Lang</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">food </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/leon-restaurants-co-founder-henry-dimbleby-uk-food-system-review\" title=\"\">strategy</a>, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he\u2019s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby\u2019s review will be ignored when it\u2019s eventually published. \u201cWhen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/16/food-security-brexit-biggest-shake-uk-farming-40-years-agriculture-bill\" title=\"\">new agriculture bill was introduced in January</a>, it had almost nothing about food,\u201d he says.</p> <p>What\u2019s Lang\u2019s solution? It\u2019s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from \u00a32.5bn of the \u00a3130bn health budget to \u00a35bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of \u201cmulti-criteria principles for the UK food system\u201d, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f93351e43306362c66e65959efe40af78d9743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f93351e43306362c66e65959efe40af78d9743/0_219_5300_3181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apples being collected in an orchard in Somerset, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Among Tim Lang\u2019s solutions for sustainability is an audit of food production in the UK: apple harvesting in Somerset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he\u2019s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been pretty modest,\u201d Lang says. \u201cThe British state is failing us by not decentralising.\u201d He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on. He insists, however, that this is not some kneejerk leftist manifesto. \u201cWe just need to re-engineer how capitalism works for us.\u201d</p> <p>We agree we can no longer ignore the viral elephant both inside the room and outside it. Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. \u201cIt could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,\u201d he says. And the emptying of shelves as a result of panic buying may help people to \u201cthink about where their food comes from\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe need to move from a \u2018me\u2019 food culture to a \u2018we\u2019 food culture.\u201d It\u2019s a very simple message, but in the white heat of a crisis, defined by queues outside supermarkets, a useful one.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 23 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the content and context of the interview with Lang.</p> <p><em>Feeding Britain: Our Food Problems and How to Fix Them by </em><em>Tim Lang is published</em><em> on 26 March</em><em> (Pelican, \u00a325).

  "<p>My mother and I, both widowed just weeks ago and only 41 days apart, have quickly come to dread the well-meaning words: \u201cHow are you?\u201d. Semaphored by a telltale tilt of the concerned head before they are even spoken, they force us to contemplate the thing that anyway lodges like a stone in our stomachs and drags on our every step.</p> <p>And what answer should we give? That we are doing our best to adjust to our bleak new realities? In the age of coronavirus, realities change by the hour. The friends and family who rushed to embrace us after we lost our beautiful boys now keep a responsible distance, especially from my mother, who is 86. The government advises over-70s to stay home and shun visitors. My mother, alone for the first time in her life, oppressed by the weight of \u201csadmin\u201d and new to the technologies that offer virtual connections, could scarcely be more isolated in her self-isolation. This is why today, exceptionally, is one that we will spend together, at a two metre distance and without hugs. Happy Mother\u2019s Day.</p> <p>In so doing, we play to the stereotype that currently infests social media, of entitled elders endangering wider society by resisting public health advice. Mainstream media is just as dismissive. Italy\u2019s high death toll from Covid-19 is explained away by journalists as a consequence of its ageing population in terms that ignore the value and vibrancy of older citizens.</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Telegraph</em>, its assistant editor, Jeremy Warner, suggested that \u201cfrom an entirely disinterested economic perspective, the Covid-19 might even prove mildly beneficial in the long term by disproportionately culling elderly dependents\u201d.</p> <p>Such a cull will not be purely a function of biology. In January, I watched as the brilliant ICU nurses and doctors at St Thomas\u2019s hospital battled in vain to save my 64-year-old husband while extending the same extraordinary level of care to patients who were significantly older, as well as to the chronically sick and the disabled. In failing adequately to invest in the NHS, successive governments have condemned its workforce to contemplate a system of triage that may force them to give more attention to some patients than others, as ICUs are overwhelmed by the sheer numbers suffering complications from the new virus. Those viewed as less viable, less valuable, by society are right to fear for their chances under such a system.</p> <p>Covid-19 is laying bare inequalities like nothing in my lifetime, yet too few see this picture as they attend meetings of Boris Johnson\u2019s all-male war cabinet (average age 46.6 years). Where is the understanding of the different gendered impacts of the crisis in an economy sustained by the unpaid labour of women? Which of those affluent men can speak to the experience of being told to self-isolate when home is a place of abuse or hardship?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b988d874037189ceb097337d5237de086260d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b988d874037189ceb097337d5237de086260d21/0_76_3918_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Mayer, far left, with her parents Anne and David, and her sisters Lise and Cassie, in London in 1969.

Well, I\u2019m scared not for myself but of further loss, and I\u2019m angry and I\u2019m determined to see some good come out of this misery. So please, let\u2019s ask questions \u2013 and make them the right ones. Some are urgent, such as \u201cHow can I help?\u201d, a hashtag I\u2019ve been using on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/catherine_mayer\" title=\"\">Twitter </a>and Facebook to link those self-isolating with people able to run errands for them. This comes garlanded with additional questions about safeguarding and bolstering \u2013 rather than impeding \u2013 existing organisations and authorities engaged in these efforts. Many of us are also looking at ways to create free content and community for those in isolation; two organisations I co-founded, the Women\u2019s Equality Party and Primadonna festival, are separately concentrating efforts on this. As the crisis develops, and while the prime minister continues to forswear clarity of policy in favour of Churchill impressions \u2013that\u2019s Churchill the Dog (\u201cOh yes. We can lick this virus in 12 weeks\u201d) \u2013 those of us who are not key workers may find that the most helpful thing we can do is to stay home and avoid panic buying.</p> <p>Yet staying home does not and cannot mean withdrawing from the debate. If we care about shaping a better post-pandemic world, we must scrutinise measures taken to combat the emergency and prepare to rise, an army of keyboard warriors, if they threaten democracy or a deepening of the social and economic divisions that have left us so ill-prepared and badly led.</p> <p>We must ask questions, too, about the wisdom of pursuing economic growth driven by global consumerism, no matter the environmental cost \u2013 and as air pollution declines because of efforts to stem the spread of coronavirus, it should be clear that every environmental cost is a human cost.</p> <p>Let us ask the right questions, too, about the value we ascribe to each other. A good starting point would be to look afresh at older women, so often underestimated, belittled in popular culture and short-changed by a pensions system that not only refuses to acknowledge the cumulative effect of the gender pay gap but actively penalises women for taking time out to provide the unpaid caring on which our society relies. This much older women have in common; but theirs is a diverse population, with valuable skills, wisdom and perspectives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>My mother may never get to grips with tech (though I\u2019m confident she will), but there are women of her age writing code and others, scientists and medical staff, rejoining the workforce to combat Covid-19.</p> <p>My mother has never stopped working, most recently as a self-employed theatre publicist. She could tell this government about the hit to freelancers and to the arts from the crisis. She could tell them about unpaid labour too.</p> <p>For the last three years of my stepfather\u2019s life, she was his carer, a tiny woman somehow managing to manoeuvre him around London in his wheelchair so that he could enjoy the time he had left. She is amazing, as so many older women are. I say again: Happy Mother\u2019s Day.</p>",
  "<p>Last century the Forestry Commission sparked anger with a mass planting of conifer trees designed to provide a national reserve of timber because the shortages of the first world war had highlighted a national need.</p> <p>Now a leading expert is calling for similar action again, arguing that if the UK is serious about offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions it must plant tens of millions of trees from imported species on open land.</p> <p>John Healey, professor of forest sciences at Bangor University, says that relying on indigenous species such as oak and beech will make it impossible for the government to hit its climate goals. Britain will have no choice, he says, but to engage with the commercial sector in large-scale planting of imported conifers, despite fears of the impact on habitats and wildlife.</p> <p>Such a move risks incurring public anger, if its 20th-century precursor is anything to go by. \u201cPeople felt it was bad for landscape, biodiversity and amenity,\u201d said Healey. \u201cBoth the public and conservation professionals saw many negative effects on heathland; there was the notorious draining of the peat bogs of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/scotlands-peat-bogs-reveal-their-secret-strength-carbon-aoe\" title=\"\">Flow Country</a> in the far north of Scotland; some really important habitats were left decimated by tree planting.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/13/carbon-benefits-of-fast-growing-trees-have-been-clearly-proven\">Carbon benefits of fast-growing trees have been clearly proven | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2017 the UK was the second largest net importer of forest products, behind China. Yet only 1,420 hectares of woodland were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government\u2019s target of 5,000 hectares. Wales and Northern Ireland planted 520 hectares and 240 hectares respectively.</p> <p>The Committee on Climate Change has called for the planting of more trees and woodlands if the UK is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It recommends increasing UK woodland cover from its current low level of 13% of total land cover to at least 17%, and possibly to 19% by 2050. In contrast, 38% of the average EU member state is wooded, a roughly similar percentage to the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"150cee4997b7af7324704e4ac75e80b1fcc95371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/150cee4997b7af7324704e4ac75e80b1fcc95371/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RSPB Farnham Heath nature reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farnham Heath nature reserve, where conifer plantations were removed to restore open heathland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Conservatives have pledged to plant 30 million trees a year between 2020 and 2025. But Healey said such targets faced stiff challenges. Indigenous species grow too slowly to be an efficient option for rapid carbon fixation, he said. Unharvested woodland eventually stops sequestering carbon when it reaches maturity.</p> <p>But conifer forests are harvested for timber, allowing new trees to be planted. He said: \u201cThe trees that produce this commercial timber and can grow in this country are virtually all non-native and are predominantly conifers from North America.\u201d</p> <p>The need to plant more trees<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/17/guardian-and-observer-appeal-raises-1m-for-tree-charities\" title=\"\"> is now an urgent priority</a> to tackle the climate emergency. Mature tropical forests in Africa and the Amazon are slowing their rate of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/tropical-forests-losing-their-ability-to-absorb-carbon-study-finds\" title=\"\"> and may soon become a source of emissions</a>, as trees die.</p> <p>Healey said it was time to be pragmatic. \u201cMany people think we can have this huge expansion of tree planting in the UK and it will all happen without costing us as the taxpayer that much money. We also think it will all be nice, native species woodland of broadleaved trees and lots of biodiversity but it\u2019s just economically impossible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople and politicians have got to face up to the fact that the vast majority of this tree planting, if it\u2019s to occur at the scale they have talked about, is going to have to come from commercial investments, and forest and environmental policy has got to avoid getting in the way of that unnecessarily,\u201d Healey said. \u201cPlanting is catastrophically slow in England and Wales, and many commercial investors feel that they are held back from acquiring land and converting it to woodland because of the way that the whole raft of environmental and other policy regulations are implemented.\u201d</p> <p>Many endangered species \u2013 such as curlews and lapwings \u2013 depend on open habitats like moors and heaths.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone agrees that the best of these habitats should be protected,\u201d Healey said. \u201cBut a lot of them are in really poor condition. Is restoration the best use of all this land, or should some, instead, be converted to conifer plantations or native woodlands? We need to ask how much of our heathland we need to protect or restore and how much we can convert to rapid carbon sequestration.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>For the sake of our loved ones and for all those going out to keep essential services running, Britain must fast become a nation of social distancers. Like many, I suspect, while trying to work from home I\u2019ve been bingeing upon on-demand television. Craving mindless escapism, I decided to give Netflix\u2019s new reality dating show, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/13/love-is-blind-review-toxic-revolting-and-totally-addictive\" title=\"\">Love </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/13/love-is-blind-review-toxic-revolting-and-totally-addictive\" title=\"\">Is Blind</a></em>, a go.</p> <p>I started off quite intrigued by what appeared to be an alluring cross between <em>Blind Date</em> and <em>Big Brother</em>. The premise of the show drops 30 attractive singletons from Atlanta into a blind-dating facility, with the men living in communal space on one side of the building, the women on the other. The only contact they have with each other is in \u201cpods\u201d; two rooms filled with plush sofas, separated by an opaque glass wall.</p> <p>The contestants spend 10 days \u201cdating\u201d each other in these pods, without ever being able to see the physical appearance of their date. The barely there presenters pop up occasionally to lecture them about the groundbreaking \u201cexperiment\u201d they are taking part in that is going to answer the question (cue serious look) \u201cIs love blind?\u201d But there is a twist: \u201cHere, you will choose someone to marry, without ever seeing them.\u201d</p> <p>We spend two episodes watching earnest dates in which people who are tired of a shallow swipe-left dating culture strike up deep conversations, scribbling in notebooks as they go along. Ignore the fleeting mention of the M-word, and you are initially lulled into thinking this worthy series is all about getting past the superficial. Then, halfway through the first episode, a caption flashes up. \u201cDay 2 of experiment. 36 days until weddings\u201d. Wait, what?</p> <p>There\u2019s no more information at that stage; rather, the contestants\u2019 journey to the altar is only gradually revealed. Couples who get engaged to each other in the pods after just a few hours\u2019 contact get to meet face to face on camera, before getting whisked away to a luxury honeymoon-style retreat in Mexico.</p> <p>After that, they return to Atlanta to move into blandly decorated flats together, introduce their fiances to their families, plan their weddings, and go on group hen and stag parties. It all culminates in a series of cliffhanger weddings where we \u2013 and they \u2013 have no idea whether their other half will say \u201cI do\u201d in front of friends and family. Cue high-drama scenes of brides running out of the wedding venue sobbing when (shocker) only a couple of couples make it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>About halfway in, the series starts to feel like it is exploiting some deeply unhappy, vulnerable people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Netflix probably thinks it has struck gold with this Frankenstein format that borrows bits and pieces from other reality shows. But I grew increasingly uncomfortable as the series progressed. About halfway in, it starts to feel like it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/netflix-love-is-blind-experiment-straight-heterosexual-marriage\" title=\"\">exploiting some deeply unhappy and vulnerable people</a>. Alcohol plays a starring role: the glasses of wine gulped by contestants seem to get bigger with each episode. By the time we get past Mexico, we are regularly watching insecure people get drunk on screen as they contend with marrying someone they\u2019re not really in love with. Worst of all is the excruciating reunion episode in which some participants, looking traumatised by what they went through, cry on screen as they share their experiences of receiving social-media hate, in real time, when the episodes dropped a year after filming. Meanwhile, the hapless presenters pretend to play the role of therapist.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not just <em>Love </em><em>Is Blind</em>: reality television has had some infamously sick moments, such as when an Indian version of <em>Big Brother</em> screened Jade Goody being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/19/bigbrother.realitytv\" title=\"\">told the news</a> that she had cervical cancer while in the \u201cdiary room\u201d six months before she died. When such programmes run on national channels, there is far more accountability to viewers, whether through debate in the media, chats in the office or the public writing into platforms such as <em>Points of View</em>.</p> <p>Netflix, with its segmented audiences, faces very little of that, and it shows. One participant has described the show as \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d, and claimed she had a conversation with producers about leaving but \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a31233088/love-is-blind-producer-jessica-wanted-to-quit/\" title=\"\">wasn\u2019t able to do that</a>\u201d.

It doesn\u2019t feel like public pressure will lead to Netflix or the producers changing things, as <em>Love Island </em>did after early series were marred by boozing, bullying and the subsequent suicides of two former contestants. <em>Love </em><em>Is Blind</em> feels even less responsible than the earliest incarnations of <em>Love Island</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/17/an-ethical-nightmare-how-coronavirus-turned-big-brother-into-a-house-of-horrors\">'An ethical nightmare': how coronavirus turned Big Brother into a house of horrors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Netflix also stands accused of flouting basic standards of safety and decency in other genres.

  "<p>Oil has a nasty habit of featuring in global recessions. At the start of 1973 the global economy was celebrating a quarter of a century of strong growth. By the end of the year the golden age had come to a shuddering halt after a cartel of oil producing nations \u2013 Opec \u2013 drove up the cost of crude in response to western support for Israel in the Yom Kippur war.</p> <p>A spike in oil prices has been a feature of every subsequent global downturn \u2013 until this one. This time what\u2019s been notable about the cost of crude is that it has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/08/oil-price-to-plunge-as-much-as-20-as-saudis-vow-to-step-up-production\" title=\"\">coming down fast</a>, hitting levels last week not seen since the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p> <p>On this occasion, the oil price is a symptom rather than the cause of the problem. The first rule of economics is that the price of something is determined by the interplay of supply and demand, and what\u2019s currently happening is that two of the world\u2019s biggest producers \u2013 Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\" title=\"\">pumping as much crude as they can</a> at a time when demand for the commodity is going through the floor.</p> <p>This is costly for both countries, especially Saudi Arabia, which will have to make sizeable budget cuts to compensate for the loss of oil revenue. But both Moscow and Riyadh think the short-term pain is worth it to capture a bigger share of the market. Their target is the US shale sector, which has grown rapidly but is heavily indebted and requires global oil prices to be much higher than their current levels to be financially viable.</p> <p>Geopolitics as much as economics has been behind the price war. Russia is not only worried about competition from US oil exports, it is upset about the sanctions imposed by Washington on its national oil company, Rosneft, over its trade with Venezuela.</p> <p>In theory, falling oil prices should be good for growth. Business costs fall when fuel becomes cheaper and consumers see their wages go further. But these are not normal times. A falling oil price at the start of the US driving season would normally encourage even more Americans to take to their cars and SUVs. But the Covid-19 pandemic means there is unlikely to be much of a driving season this year.</p> <p>Similarly, it might now be \u00a310 cheaper for UK consumers to fill up their tanks than it was a month ago but they are not going to spend the windfall on a visit to the pub or cafe, because they are all closed.</p> <p>At the end of last week, the oil price registered a gain after Donald Trump announced that he would support US producers by adding to America\u2019s strategic reserve. But with the global economy facing falls in output not seen even in the Great Depression, the risks to the oil price remain strongly to the downside.</p> <p>Opec is no longer the force it once was, and the attempt to include Russia as a sort of associate member has ended in failure. The fact that Saudi Arabia is the current chair of the G20 group of developed and developing nations only serves to highlight the weakness of international co-operation at a time when it has never been more sorely needed.</p> <p>From Riyadh\u2019s perspective, opening the taps makes sense because it believes it can win a race to the bottom. Without Russia\u2019s cooperation, production curbs were not going to work anyway, and Saudi oil is plentiful and cheap to get out of the ground.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach has echoes of the cold war, both in its economic show of strength to the US and its implicit warning to the Saudis that they need to increase their purchases of Russian military hardware.</p> <p>But it is also worryingly redolent of the 1930s when the US imposition of the Smoot-Hawley tariff triggered tit-for-tat protectionist measures. Beggar-my-neighbour policies are back.</p> <h2>Supermarkets are living up to their mission statements</h2> <p>In the pre-coronavirus era \u2013 in other words, just a few weeks ago \u2013 the corporate fashion was for companies to declare their \u201cpurpose\u201d. About 90% of these ponderous statements looked like the work of the PR department, so a minor consolation of the current crisis is that we\u2019re discovering which companies can actually summon a spirit of genuine resolve and endeavour. Near the top of the list would be the supermarkets.</p> <p>Their on-the-hoof exercise in adapting logistics networks has been impressive. A small army of temporary workers is being hired to fill shelves and drive vans. One Tesco store manager said new recruits could complete the administration process, be trained and be \u201cfired up and ready to go\u201d within four hours. Meanwhile, Asda has been linking up with stricken hospitality and travel companies to take on staff. Others are hiring through \u201cfriend and family\u201d initiatives.</p> <p>The tone from the top of these organisations has also been spot-on. In normal times, Morrisons chief executive David Potts would invite guffaws if he said the company was \u201cat the service of the nation\u201d. Now it sounds credible, especially when combined with a policy of paying small suppliers immediately to ease the strain on their cashflows.</p> <p>Not everything has run perfectly, of course. Websites have creaked with the extra online demand; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/sainsburys-dedicated-shopping-hour-for-vulnerable-people-chaotic-and-crowded\" title=\"\">not all vulnerable shoppers have got what they wanted</a> in dedicated shopping hours; and restrictions on would-be hoarders should probably have been introduced sooner.</p> <p>In the round, though, one must applaud. By way of mental experiment, ask yourself whether you\u2019d rather have government ministers in charge of food distribution at a moment of maximum stress on the system. When the crisis passes, let us hope bosses remember to award their staff some fat bonuses.</p> <h2>Closing time for Wetherspoons\u2019 resident medical expert</h2> <p>\u2018Am I out of my depth?,\u201d asks Tim Martin, chairman of the pub group JD Wetherspoon, to which the only possible answer is: yes, you are, old fruit.</p> <p>Martin, uniquely among the bosses of FTSE 350 companies, is under the impression that he is obliged to broadcast his views on the best way for the government to tackle what he calls \u201cthe current health scare\u201d, and \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 he would prefer an approach in which the population remains free to frequent hostelries such as his.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m obviously not an expert but I\u2019ve got a view and that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d he said, just before he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-wetherspoons-boss-says-uk-pubs-will-stay-open-as-long-as-possible\" title=\"\">served up another round of non-expert analysis on Friday</a>: \u201cMore people have caught the virus in one building, parliament, than in all our pubs combined.\u201d</p> <p>Martin, unfortunately, did not provide a source for this statistic, but he had wanted to keep open Wetherspoons\u2019 867 pubs in the United Kingdom. Matters were taken out of his hands on the same day he spoke, of course.</p> <p>Naturally, one hopes that Wetherspoons survives and then prospers once actual epidemiologists have assessed the \u201cscare\u201d as less scary. The business is successful, has many loyal customers and serves a decent pint at a fair price. \u2019Spoons is a great institution.</p> <p>Martin himself also enlivens the corporate scene on matters where his opinions carry more weight. A recent rant about the perils of box-ticking wonks and their one-size-fits-all approach to boardroom governance was widely applauded, even by one important fund management body.</p> <p>On that occasion, Martin could speak from long professional experience and provide oodles of evidence to support his argument.</p> <p>There are, though, subjects where he would be well-advised to put a sock in it. A national health emergency is one.</p>",
  "<h2>Recovery on hold<br></h2> <p>Mallacoota, in the Australian state of Victoria, has the jump on most of us when it comes to confronting the apocalypse. This is a town whose people, last New Year\u2019s Eve, had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2019/dec/31/mallacoota-bushfire-thousands-evacuate-to-sea-as-victorian-town-burns-video-report\" title=\"\">retreat to the beach to escape the fires</a> that threatened it. Some of its houses are wrecked, their timber frames burned away, their metal cladding scrunched like tissue paper. Which makes it all the more striking that one of the first acts of restoration has been to install a brand-new public barbecue facility, with pristine picnic tables and emerald grass, a few feet from a backdrop of charcoal trees next to a river mouth polluted by ash. I am not sure if this work is mad or touching \u2013 possibly both.</p> <p>To drive from Sydney to Melbourne, via the scenic coastal routes, is to alternate between shock and hope. You can travel all day through damaged forests, but the underlying beauty of the landscape endures. Native trees have a remarkable ability to sprout green shoots from their charred trunks, so that seemingly dead wood is swathed in new life. Locals tell you they\u2019re grateful you\u2019ve come, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that this latest catastrophe will stop tourism once again.</p> <h2>Faulty towers<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9da59240c474de4fe5e2ab14aaa0051fc9a7f447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9da59240c474de4fe5e2ab14aaa0051fc9a7f447/0_183_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Central Melbourne\u2019s high-rise skyline of gimmicky glass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Central Melbourne\u2019s high-rise skyline of gimmicky glass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danita Delimont/Getty Images/Gallo Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for almost everyone, the past few weeks have been about adjusting to realities that change every day. I went to Australia to join my daughter, who has been living there for six months, and we were to travel the country before she and her boyfriend set off on an ambitious Asian tour. I have never planned a trip in more detail, half of which is now unpicked.</p> <p>A fortnight ago we decided \u2013 wrongly as it turned out \u2013 that it was still reasonable to see a show at Sydney\u2019s opera house (it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, we told ourselves). A week ago I was having a drink in a Melbourne bar with a friend of a friend, while my daughter explored the idea of sitting out the pandemic in Bali. At the time of writing we were due to be camping in Australia\u2019s red centre. Then the realisation dawned that we might not get home at all if we didn\u2019t leave soon. So, here I am, contemplating a pale sun fighting to penetrate a London sky, the desert horizons having contracted to the saw-tooth backs of London terraces.</p> <p>It\u2019s not supposed to be possible to like both Sydney and Melbourne, one allegedly more superficial, the other more sophisticated. I claim a tourist\u2019s prerogative to enjoy both, but Melbourne \u2013 which lacks the icons and setting to impress itself on the world\u2019s consciousness \u2013 is the more intriguing. It has aspects of both American and British towns, a Houston-Eastbourne fusion which, I hasten to say, is also definitively Australian. Like London, it reveals itself through a series of contrasting districts. Like London, its recent skyline is atrocious, made of gimmicky glass towers delivered in both cities by much the same cohort of investors, developers and consultants. Which only goes to show that this junk is global.</p> <h2>Aboriginal sin<br></h2> <p>Wherever you go, you encounter awkward proclamations of respect for the indigenous people who formerly lived in a given location. You hear them before the show starts at the Sydney Opera House, along with announcements about turning off mobile phones, and at the entry to some caves in the hill town of Buchan. You read them in signs in Melbourne\u2019s neo-Gothic cathedral or in the preserved bit of wilderness that is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2020/mar/08/australias-extraordinary-and-vulnerable-animals-in-pictures?CMP=share_btn_fb&amp;page=with%3Aimg-4\" title=\"\">Yarra Bend park</a>. Such statements don\u2019t include the possibility that the land might ever be handed back, of course, which is what makes them awkward, but I guess it\u2019s better to have this acknowledgment than not.</p> <p>A day out on the coast, south of Melbourne near the towns of Hastings and Rye. Also Safety Beach, renamed in the 1960s from Shark Bay, on account of the (admittedly harmless) creatures who swam around nearby. Apparently the old name deterred visitors.

The initial focus on the dubious policy of promoting so-called herd immunity, now apparently abandoned, risked a higher death toll among the old and infirm, apparently regarded as expendable and a price worth paying.</p> <p>The public has been proactive in taking measures forcing the government to, as the BBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg said, \u201cscramble to keep up\u201d.

Individuals with mild symptoms are asked to self-isolate at home without calling NHS 111, and without being offered a test, because we have not built up our testing capacity. However, without a call to NHS 111 or a test, it seems unlikely that these patients will have the information or motivation to comply with the stringent home isolation measures that reduce further transmission.</p> <p>Should we not have built up the capacity for large-scale testing? In South Korea, this has been notably more successful than the use of lockdown in Italy. Furthermore, the recommended duration of self-isolation (seven days from the onset of symptoms) seems inadequate. Covid-19 symptoms and infectivity often continue for longer than seven days. <br><strong>Dr Giuseppe </strong><strong>Bignardi</strong>, retired consultant microbiologist<br>Springfield Park, Durham<br></p> <p>Michael Savage demonstrated the difficulties for the government with coronavirus and Brexit transition talks coinciding (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/14/calls-to-extend-eu-transition-period-as-europe-fights-coronavirus?CMP=share_btn_link\" title=\"\">Pandemic sparks calls to extend EU trade talks</a>\u201d, News). </p> <p>We can only hope that Boris Johnson will heed the calls to delay transition, so that the most important problem for the whole world, the Covid-19 pandemic, can be concentrated on, even before climate change.

There are exceptions, such as the rather clumsy use of \u201ccomputer\u201d to describe the brain, the more appropriate \u201cvirus\u201d for a malicious programme that spreads from one computer to another, and the more recent emergence of \u201cPetri dish\u201d to describe a crowd of people at risk in a pandemic. But irrelevant or unsolicited email is, of all things, spam.</p> <p>Perhaps scientists and engineers themselves could do more to help refresh the metaphor gene pool by introducing scientific and technological concepts into the metaphors they use in their everyday communication.

And their party gets punished \u2013 just ask Herbert Hoover. A <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">Democratic</a> Senate is actually possible.</p> <p>Enter David Plouffe and his campaign primer, A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Beating Donald Trump. Plouffe managed Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential run, then served in his White House. He also did a stint at Uber and partnered with Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. He is sharp and prescient, but not clairvoyant.</p> <p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/03/plouffe-obama-trump-book-118947\">Plouffe predicted a Clinton win</a> and derided liberal doubters as \u201cbedwetters\u201d. His worst-case scenario awarded the Democrats 324 electoral votes. Things didn\u2019t work out as planned.</p> <p>Looking to avoid another debacle, Plouffe delivers a dense, nuts-and-bolts book, chock-full of advice. Written before the first nominating contest and the global pandemic, it is a mixture of enthusiasm and partially outdated realism.</p> <p>Plouffe is no longer dismissive of Trump and his political skill set. As for Clinton\u2019s loss, Plouffe observes, the \u201ckillers\u201d were the \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d on the margins, in the swing states, and Clinton\u2019s own errors.</p> <p>\u201cThree strikes, and you know what happened next,\u201d writes Obama\u2019s counselor. Plouffe contends that a significant pool of \u201cundecided and persuadable and might-vote citizens\u201d will probably control the next election\u2019s outcome.</p> <p>Citizen\u2019s Guide offers a useful description of the \u201cgettable\u201d electorate: first-time voters, Obama/Trump voters, past-Trump voters who are \u201copen to an alternative\u201d and voters who did not previously vote for him but who are now open to that possibility. Likewise, Plouffe is mindful of political identification serving as social glue and identity.</p> <p>As he frames things: \u201cIf November comes and persuadable voters testify\u201d that Trump drives them \u201ccrazy with tweets\u201d, view him as a \u201cterrible person\u201d, but conclude that the president has been \u201cOK on the economy and the Democrats want to turn us into a socialist country\u201d, Trump will probably return to power.</p> <p>To be sure, the economy is no longer fine: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorabitoCM/status/1240097382886453249\">Black Plague 2.0</a> is never a good look.

Reality is stripping Trump\u2019s theatrics bare.</p> <p>Yet Trump was never simply a candidate. He led a movement. How all this affects his support is an open question. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWFgqnisSsk\">Breaking up is hard to do</a>.</p> <p>Understandably, Plouffe takes heart from the midterms which saw the Democrats recapture the House of Representatives. That was about Democrats building on their traditional base of liberal voters, minorities and graduate degree holders, making inroads with suburbanites and white women and ginning up those who go to the polls less frequently.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_biden-6861.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, which went for Trump, are again leaning Democratic. <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_biden-6807.html\">Arizona</a>, which last voted blue in 1996, may be fertile territory for Biden.

On the other hand, participation in Illinois dropped markedly.</p> <p>Looking ahead, voting by mail may emerge as the rule, not the exception. Disease and social distancing are altering how we live and vote. Our country and democracy are in transition.</p> <p>Plouffe has publicly acknowledged Biden\u2019s vulnerability with younger voters. On that score, his concerns are to a point well-placed.</p> <p>Biden won less than 40% of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/primary-results/voter-analysis?state=IL\">Illinois Democrats</a> under the age of 45 even as he took nearly three-in-five older voters. Michigan told a similar story. But Sanders was no pied piper. Although he won younger voters, the Vermont senator did not electrify them. In all fairness, elections are an older person\u2019s game.</p> <p>Plouffe offers no foolproof method for energizing young Americans.

And while regular fans were banned from the stadium, you could still watch them congregate elsewhere; organising online watch-parties and group chats from their various rooms in their various cities, isolated but not alone.</p> <p>This is one possible silver lining to football\u2019s global shutdown: the 2019-20 W-League final could be one of the most-watched Australian women\u2019s club games ever. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/17/the-show-goes-on-for-now-but-at-what-cost-to-football-in-australia\">The show goes on for football in Australia but at what cost? | Samantha Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardian Australia\u2019s liveblog tracked viewers not just around the country but around the planet, from the US and the UK to South Africa, Nigeria and India. What they saw, though, wasn\u2019t the \u201cproduct\u201d that professional football has become; the waves of branded fans, the glamorous stadium, the slick studio productions, the celebrity pundits. Instead, they saw football distilled: 22 people, two teams, one ball. It was football as we love and remember it; football on a Sunday morning in a quiet suburb, the pitch still shimmering with dew. </p> <p>It was two groups running around, buoyed by the cheers of those who love them from the sidelines. It was team-mates rushing to celebrate the goal-scorer and rushing to comfort the error-prone keeper. It was the players collapsing in devastation and in delight, the collecting of medals from the table, and figuring out where to crouch for the group photo so that everybody can be seen. It was the line from the losing team\u2019s captain that \u201cI would lose with [this team] a thousand times if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p> <p>During these 90 minutes, regardless of who won or lost, 22 women on a pitch in Australia provided an answer to football\u2019s existential question. Football\u2019s meaning is amplified, not diminished, in times like these; not because it distracts us from what matters but because it reminds us that what matters is each other. </p> <p>When you strip it back to its bones, this game has always been about people working together to achieve some common purpose. That is, perhaps, how sport best fits into a world currently reckoning with its own failure to do just that. So even though the business of football might not survive, the meaning of it will live on, so long as there\u2019s a group of people with a ball at their feet or a boy who falls asleep with his boots on.</p>",

Sydney\u2019s famous Bondi Beach, from Australian Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>The New South Wales government has temporarily closed Bondi Beach as authorities handed lifesavers unprecedented move-on powers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>NSW Police David Elliott announced the drastic measure on Saturday afternoon after photos of throngs of beachgoers flocking to the iconic Sydney strip drew swift condemnation.</p> \n  <p>Thousands flocked to Bondi Beach on Friday amid temperatures in the high 30s, ignoring social distancing measures.</p> \n  <p>Pictures of big crowds were criticised by foreign media and on social media.</p> \n  <p>The decision comes as the number of coronavirus cases in NSW ballooned to 436 after 83 new cases were identified in the state.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a significant level of disappointment that we have to move today to not only remove people from Bondi Beach and it\u2019s a significant opportunity to remind people that the Health Act must be complied with,\u201d Mr Elliott said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat we saw this morning at Bondi Beach was the most irresponsible behaviour of individuals that we\u2019ve seen so far.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe cannot have an area where more than 500 people are gathered.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under regulations introduced to control the spread of the deadly virus, outdoor gatherings of 500 people or more have been banned.</p> \n  <p>As part of that, lifesavers will have the power to close beaches and ask people to move on if a crowd of 500 or more is gathered at the same spot.</p> \n  <p>The minister said that if the crowd does not comply, NSW Police will have the powers to make people leave.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is not something we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re the fun police, this is not something that the government is doing because we want to make life easy, this is about saving lives,\u201d Mr Elliott said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTomorrow in NSW we will probably crack 500 cases of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings, this is going to become the new norm.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are going to close down the type of activities we\u2019ve grown to love.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It came as Waverley mayor Paula Masselos on Saturday issued a public plea for people to stay away from Bondi amid the coronavirus pandemic and away from beaches.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don\u2019t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home,\u201d Mr Masselos said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and I am frustrated that people continue to ignore health advice about social distancing as observed yesterday at Bondi Beach.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also hit out at people who flouted social distancing advice and risked spreading the virus.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,\u201d Mr Hunt said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEach of us as individuals, as families, as groups, as councils, as state governments, as a national government has responsibility.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhere something like this is occurring the local council must step in and that message is

second-highest number of daily positive diagnoses this week</strong>, following 152 identified on Wednesday, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).<br><br>The pace of daily new infections had shown signs of slowing since the second week of this month after health authorities finished testing 210,000 followers of a secretive church that was at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak.<br><br>Just over 100 of the new daily cases were from Daegu, the southeastern city where the church is located, and nearby North Gyeongsang province. The two locations account for about 60% of all of South Korea\u2019s Covid-19 infections. <br><br>There is concern, however, over a rise in infections in Seoul and among people arriving from overseas, Yonhap news agency said.<br><br>Seoul reported 15 additional cases and nearby Gyeonggi Province 12, while the number among people arriving in the country rose by six to 23.<br><br>In response, South Korea will require all arrivals from European countries to get tested for the virus and self-isolate for two weeks starting Sunday, Yonhap said, adding that temporary shelters had been set up to accommodate up to 1,000 European travelers while they wait for their test results.<br><br>South Korean health authorities have won praise for their mass testing regime, which has enabled them to quickly identify infection clusters. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 15,704 as of Friday, the KCDC said. The country has tested a total of 327,509 suspected cases, with 303,006 coming back negative.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T04:09:15.056Z\">at 4.09am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e758eb78f08dcc95cc2076e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T03:58:45.534Z\">3.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>People living in poorer areas of the Philippine capital, Manila, have begun building makeshift barricades to halt movement along the tight alleyways of their neighbourhoods, as this image, taken by Ezra Acayan for Getty Images shows.</p> \n  <p>The Philippine island of Luzon, which includes Manila, has been on lockdown since Monday.
