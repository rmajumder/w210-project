  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>More US states to end lockdown as US economy worsens</h2> <p>US states Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join four other states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April.</p> <h2>Italian PM announces easing of lockdown</h2> <p>Prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation in a televised address \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May.</p> <h2>British PM ready to return to work</h2> <p>Prime minister Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday evening, where the government is headquartered, for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 5 April.</p> <h2>Egypt asks IMF for coronavirus bailout loan</h2> <p>Egypt has asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus. With aviation and tourism at a standstill, the partial lockdown threatens the livelihoods of many of Egypt\u2019s 100 million people.</p> <h2><strong>Russia \u2018could experience new spike in cases\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Covid-19 cases in the country could rise sharply if people flout lockdown measures during public holidays scheduled for early May, a top health official said on Sunday, after total reported infections in Russia topped 80,000.</p> <h2><strong>Chile to push ahead with immunity passports</strong></h2> <p>The country is is planning to issue previously announced \u201crelease certificates\u201d for recovered Covid-19 patients \u2018\u201csoon\u201d, despite a World Health Organization warning that it is not clear whether people have immunity after becoming infected.</p> <h2><strong>New York governor outlines lifting of restrictions for parts of state</strong></h2> <p>Andrew Cuomo said some regions such as upstate New York might qualify to open sooner, \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.</p> <h2><strong>France daily death toll slows</strong></h2> <p>Officially recorded Covid-19 fatalities in France rose by 242 to 22,856 on Sunday, down from 369 new deaths the previous day.

  "<p>The number of web pages featuring child sexual abuse that are being taken down globally has plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic, an internet watchdog has said.</p> <p>The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK charity that identifies child sexual abuse content online, said 1,498 URLs were taken down between 16 March and 15 April after being identified as showing child sexual abuse.</p> <p>This was an 89% reduction from the previous month, when 14,947 URLs on the IWF list were taken down.</p> <p>The IWF said this could be because tech companies and law enforcement agencies were operating with reduced numbers of staff and did not have the capacity to take down the material.</p> <p>Last month Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said third-party US content moderators would be working from home and the company would increase its use of artificial intelligence to moderate content during the health crisis.</p> <p>Susie Hargreaves, the chief executive of the IWF, said: \u201cWhat we are seeing here is the first hard evidence of how the global crisis is affecting the fight against child sexual abuse material. Even though our analysts are working as normal to find this evil content, it is staying available for longer, even after they have reported it. This means there is more opportunity for sexual predators to view and share it.\u201d</p> <p>She added:\u201cHotlines and abuse teams across the globe need to be aware that there is a slowdown of this content being removed and to be mindful of doing what they can, within their ability, to get this content taken down.\u201d</p> <p>The IWF provides a list of child sexual abuse URLs, which companies use to block and filter so criminal content is not available through their services. When the imagery has been taken down, the URL comes off the list.</p> <p>The IWF\u2019s annual report says nine out of 10 webpages identified as featuring child sexual abuse, rape or torture are hosted on servers in Europe, with the vast majority held in the Netherlands.</p> <p>In 2019, 89% of URLs known to contain child sexual abuse material were hosted in Europe, compared with 79% in 2018.</p> <p>Of all the content found by the IWF, 71% \u2013 the equivalent of 93,962 URLs \u2013 was hosted in the Netherlands. This was an increase from 2018, when the Netherlands was found to be hosting 47% of all known child sexual abuse material.</p> <p>The Netherlands has become a target for hosting child sexual abuse material due to its strong internet infrastructure, which makes it an easy place for any internet company to operate, offering low-cost hosting services, the IWF said.</p> <p>North America hosted 9% of all known child sexual abuse URLs in 2019, a fall from 18% in 2018, the report says.</p> <p>Hargreaves said the situation could worsen given increased concerns over activities of sexual predators online during the pandemic. Europol, the EU\u2019s law enforcement agency, said early on in the crisis that it had seen \u201cincreased online activity by those seeking child abuse material\u201d.</p> <p>Hargreaves said: \u201cWe have seen a real and frightening jump in the amount of child sexual abuse material that is being hosted right on our doorstep here in Europe. No country is immune to this terrible criminality. While the UK doesn\u2019t have the hosting issue, our problem is that many consumers of child sexual abuse live here. We\u2019ve got to fight this on both fronts \u2013 both the supply and the demand.\u201d</p> <p>The IWF develops tools and provides services for technology companies to prevent the abuse of their platforms for child sexual abuse content.</p> <p>Arda Gerkens, the chief executive of EKOM, which comprises the Dutch hotline for dealing with child sexual abuse as well as the helpline for victims of online sexual abuse, said: \u201cThe Netherlands is unfortunately the biggest webhosting country when it comes to this material. A strong and swift infrastructure combined with low costs, appeals to services that host images. Those services are often abused by people sharing this material.</p> <p>\u201cActing on a notice to take down should be a last resort. It\u2019s best if this material doesn\u2019t come online at all.\u201d</p>",

We will end up moving to a new normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson, who has been easing his way back into work with video conference calls, and a three-hour meeting with key ministers at Chequers on Friday, will be back at his desk in No 10, amid growing pressure from some in his own party to lift restrictions.</p> \n<p>Raab said Johnson would be \u201cback at work full-time, properly, at the helm\u201d and is \u201craring to go\u201d.

Secondly, that overall this package doesn\u2019t allow the coronavirus to get back hold, to spread more widely and to undo all the progress we\u2019ve made, or the sacrifices so many people have made,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He also echoed the warning of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, that a vaccine is unlikely to be widely available this year.</p> \n<p>The TUC is calling for businesses to be obliged to make a comprehensive risk assessment before they can reopen.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority\u201d said its general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cToo many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won\u2019t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>Polling carried out for the TUC showed 40% of workers are concerned about the health risks of returning to their workplace. O\u2019Grady called for bosses who put the health of their staff at risk to be prosecuted.</p> \n<p>Raab declined to say what physical distancing in schools might mean in practice \u2013 though Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, suggested that in Scotland it could involve staggered attendance by different year groups.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would not be right or safe to open schools right now and that may continue to be the case for some time to come, but the point I think everybody is trying to get their heads round right now is that as we come out of these very restrictive measures we\u2019re not going to be going back to normality as we knew it,\u201d Sturgeon told Marr.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I described \u2013 and many others have used this phrase \u2013 a new normal that we\u2019re looking for where social distancing will be a fact of life for quite some time to come and different ways of operating will have to be contemplated.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-testing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-testing&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-testing</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, called the government to consult with the teaching unions about how best to manage children\u2019s return to school when it is safe to do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cSchool leaders, teachers and support staff have been working tirelessly to keep children\u2019s education going during this crisis and to minimise disruption and the inevitable impact on social inequality. Any decision to lift restrictions cannot be sprung upon schools at short notice,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>In another sign of the scale of disruption to normal life, the environment secretary, George Eustice, repeated his call for furloughed workers to go to the aid of Britain\u2019s farmers, by picking fruit and vegetables during the harvest season this summer.</p>",

  "<p>Packed pools, beaches and tour buses, as well as middle seats on planes, hotel minibars and scrums at airport check-ins, may all be a thing of the past as Europe\u2019s tourism industry attempts to reimagine the holiday in the wake of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Travel will take place only under \u201cspecific new rules\u201d, Greece\u2019s tourism minister has said as he prepares to propose ways of salvaging the sector with his EU counterparts in the era of Covid-19 on Monday.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we are to think of the possibility of travelling this year it has to be under specific new rules,\u201d says Harry Theoharis, the country\u2019s tourism minister , whose economy is especially dependent on the sector. \u201cWe have to have new rules for hotels, new rules for beaches, new rules for pools, new rules for breakfast buffets, new rules for tour buses.\u201d</p> \n<p>How the regulations will work, and what they will look like, in Europe at least, will be the focus of talks between EU tourism ministers on Monday. Health and safety measures, including Covid-19 immunity certificates, will be high on the agenda. The possibility of passengers being subject to temperature checks and pre-flight blood tests is also likely to be raised.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will be pushing for agreement on a common set of [EU] rules,\u201d Theoharis told the Guardian. \u201cWe need them if we are to start moving people from one country to another by road, air or sea. Temporary rules that will have to make economic sense. If, for example, you can only fly with 10 people on a plane to be deemed safe then obviously there will be no flight,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Global tourism has been among the hardest hit industries by the public health emergency, impacting the lives of some 75 million people employed in an industry brought to a near standstill by travel bans and closed borders. In Greece, where tourism accounts for 20% of GDP and provides one in five jobs, the economy is expected to suffer an immense blow \u2013 contracting by as much as 10% - just as it was emerging from its worst crisis in recent times.</p> \n<p>Theoharis, who assumed the post last July when the centre-right government was catapulted into office, predicts the country could have \u201cless than a third\u201d of the tourists it hosted last year.</p> \n<p>In 2019, Greece attracted a record 33 million arrivals, more than three times its total population, and double the number it lured a decade ago. The boom brought in an unprecedented \u20ac18.2bn \u2013 revenue that played a crucial role in reviving an economy thrown into depression by a near-decade long public debt crisis that cut output by a quarter.</p> \n<p>On the back of mass cancellations, the Hellenic chamber of hotels forecasts that 65% of its members could be forced to declare bankruptcy. Christina Tetradis, who runs a resort on the Ionian isle of Zakynthos and is the chamber\u2019s vice-president, says any desire to resurrect tourism is also tempered by concerns over keeping Greece virus-free. Industry figures, she says, are acutely aware of the dangers inherent in removing travel restrictions too fast. \u201cNo one wants to blamed for putting staff at risk or endangering lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>But, like Theoharis, she is also persuaded that Athens\u2019 handling of the pandemic will reap rewards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In contrast to other European countries, Greece, which is poised to ease lockdown measures with the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, addressing the nation on Tuesday, applied tough restrictions to contain coronavirus early on.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen health and security are so important for travellers worldwide, the way the government has managed to keep the numbers down does, I think, give us a competitive edge,\u201d said Tetradis. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be complicated especially for bigger hotels. There are so many questions, like how many people can you have in a pool, are buffets out and what if someone falls sick? But there is also a sense of safety regarding coronavirus that we can project too.\u201d</p> \n<p>With 2,517 confirmed cases of the disease and a death toll of 134, Greece has to date fared far better on the Covid-19 battlefront than expected.</p> \n<p>Turkey to its east and Italy to its west have suffered hugely, by Sunday registering mortality rates of 2,706 and 26,386 respectively.</p> \n<p>Reimagining travel will be as paramount to tourism\u2019s survival as the precautions needed to prevent possible infections, say officials. After the 9/11 <sup> </sup>terror attacks in 2001 the sector took three years to recover but rose dramatically when it rebounded.</p> \n<p>Theoharis acknowledges that the future is fraught with uncertainty. Already, fears abound of a second wave of the epidemic later this year and, ultimately, much will depend on the discovery of a vaccine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-nearly-60-new-cases-found-on-cruise-ship-in-japan\">Coronavirus: global death toll passes 200,000 as more countries prepare to reopen</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But if the warm weather brings a reprieve, as epidemiologists hope, Greece, he says, could open to holidaymakers in July \u2013 later than usual but in time for the peak summer months when most revenue is made.</p> \n<p>Selective tourism is not ruled out: traditional markets in the UK, Germany and France, may be replaced by tourists from eastern and central Europe used to accessing the country by car if air links continue to be suspended.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnce measures are relaxed a good month will be required to prepare the ground for the [tourism] engine to get started,\u201d he said. \u201cTour operators are waiting and hoping we can come up with the right rules so that we can start bringing visitors in.

  "<p>Famine is riding alongside pestilence, on the tail of war. Though coronavirus leaves no part of the world untouched, its impact will be harshest in places that were already suffering. Yet the problems it brings with it may prove more deadly than Covid-19 itself. Even in the richest countries, coronavirus has left families in hunger; for the poorest, it could mean starvation.</p> <p>The head of the World Food Programme warns that we are now on the brink of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-pandemic-will-cause-famine-of-biblical-proportions\" title=\"\">a hunger pandemic</a>, with the prospect of multiple famines \u201cof biblical proportions\u201d within a few months, across three dozen countries. Households already struggling to survive have lost the work that fed them. Remittances sent home by family members abroad are predicted to <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/22/world-bank-predicts-sharpest-decline-of-remittances-in-recent-history\" title=\"\">fall by around a fifth</a> due to Covid-19. Tourism has vanished. Children are missing the nutritious school meals they depend upon. Quarantine regulations and transport issues are disrupting food supply chains.</p> <p>Covid-19 alone has not created this crisis. Rather, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/21/millions-hang-by-a-thread-extreme-global-hunger-compounded-by-covid-19-coronavirus\" title=\"\">one more devastating blow</a>, complicating and deepening the troubles of countries already struggling with the impact of war, global heating, other health crises, and specific threats such as the locust infestations plaguing east Africa. It could almost double the number of those facing acute hunger, pushing an additional 130 million people to the brink of starvation by the end of the year. In all, shortages are likely to affect a fifth of the world\u2019s population. Many of them live in overcrowded conditions, with poor sanitation, and a considerable number have pre-existing health problems such as HIV or TB; malnutrition will make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 and other threats.</p> <p>Yet the worst is not inevitable. The food crisis is currently one of distribution and affordability, though in the longer term agriculture is likely to suffer, particularly in places where it is labour intensive.</p> <p>Developing countries cannot afford the support packages adopted elsewhere, and no single nation can solve supply issues. International solutions are required; UN organisations are uniquely placed to handle border closures, restrictions and transport disruption given their regional presences, contacts and diplomacy. In the long run, warn economists and global health experts, developing countries will need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/27/back-poor-countries-fighting-covid-19-with-trillions-or-face-disaster-g20-told\" title=\"\">trillions of dollars</a> to recover. The UN is seeking just $2bn for its emergency appeal; yet as of last week, wealthier countries had pledged only a quarter of that. They must deliver on those promises now, and give more.</p> <p>Particularly essential within that is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/20/un-heads-warn-of-coronavirus-risk-in-weakest-countries\" title=\"\">$350m logistics plan</a>, which would allow goods and relief workers to reach crisis-hit areas. Persuading governments to allow essential agricultural and food workers to move within and between countries will be crucial. The UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\" title=\"\">has warned</a> that trying to protect domestic supplies through tariffs and export bans will create extreme volatility. Finally, the G20 and International Monetary Fund agreements to suspend debt are a step forward, but insufficient; private creditors too must act.</p> <p>All this is a matter of common decency, but also of self-interest. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/16/race-against-time-to-prevent-famines-during-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">2007-08</a> we saw how rising food prices can destabilise societies, producing repercussions felt much more widely. In several countries, the spectre of unrest is already emerging. Coronavirus is the latest and perhaps most immediate demonstration of what the climate crisis and wars in Syria and elsewhere should already have told us: that other people\u2019s suffering will not be contained. It is our business, too.</p>",
  "<p>So concludes the election campaign to be World Rugby\u2019s top dog. Voting has begun, though we will not know for sure whether Bill Beaumont or Agust\u00edn Pichot has prevailed for more than two weeks. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances but, as convoluted processes go, you might have thought lessons would be learned from the contest to host the 2023 World Cup (more on that later).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/european-clubs-collision-course-world-rugby-unacceptable-fixture-plans\">European clubs on collision course with World Rugby over 'unacceptable' plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may yet prove to be the smoothest of ballots, but a fortnight is a long time in sports politics. That the vote is secret and heavily weighted so that the Six Nations countries each get three votes, Fiji or the USA one, serves only to muddy the waters further.</p> <p>On to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/world-rugby-administration-needs-to-work-many-not-few\">candidates</a> and Beaumont has had a trying couple of weeks, what with his campaign being backed by a convicted killer who has been condemned by Amnesty International. The Fiji rugby union chairman, Francis Kean, has been denied a visa for the US but astonishingly he emerged as a key supporter of Beaumont\u2019s bid. It is just one of this campaign\u2019s great ironies that a key part of Sir Bill\u2019s manifesto is a fit and proper persons test for elected officials.</p> <p>To briefly recap, Beaumont has been nominated by France and seconded by Fiji. In turn, Bernard Laporte, who is running unopposed as his vice-chairman, has been nominated by the Rugby Football Union while Kean was seconded by France for a role on World Rugby\u2019s executive committee. This was all announced nearly two weeks ago but then fresh allegations of homophobia by Kean came to light and Beaumont had to act, with Fiji pressured to stand down Kean from the World Rugby council and the election. Meanwhile, Fiji\u2019s vote falls to Frank Bainimarama, the president of the union and who happens to be Kean\u2019s brother-in-law and his country\u2019s prime minister. Bainimarama, lest we forget, took charge of the country in 2006 via military coup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e2524fe8d7e6b76a1fd9a7f01734fd102646d0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2524fe8d7e6b76a1fd9a7f01734fd102646d0d/0_68_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agust\u00edn Pichot in action for Argentina at Twickenham in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agust\u00edn Pichot in action for Argentina at Twickenham in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hevezi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is against this backdrop that Beaumont has also had to deal with the white knight in white trainers coming up the rails. Pichot has portrayed himself as the underdog but he has gathered late momentum. For this is an election fought on the north-south divide, the traditionalist Beaumont against the revolutionary Pichot, the dinosaur versus the dynamo. Accordingly, Beaumont has undergone a bit of a rebrand, trying to come across as a bit more avuncular. Pichot has called for a new rugby computer game to spin the world game on its axis, Beaumont insists: \u201cI\u2019m not bad with modern technology.\u201d You get the gist.</p> <p>While Beaumont has the backing of the European stronghold, Pichot has the Sanzaar votes and has been canvassing for the support of the tier two nations. This new radical wants to shake up the existing order. Indeed, Pichot wants to spread the British &amp; Irish Lions gospel in the Americas. That\u2019s Argentina\u2019s Pichot, who was appointed to the USA Rugby board in late 2018.</p> <p>There is also the matter of the 2027 World Cup. Argentina had been expected to bid but Pichot recently revealed that was no longer the case and instead the union would be getting behind Australia. Pichot\u2019s nomination in the election was seconded by Rugby Australia. It is only a couple of years ago that RA was furious to learn of his<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/twiggy-recruits-world-rugby-deputy-to-head-mining-push-in-argentina-20180816-p4zxwd.html\"> relationship with the Australian iron ore billionaire Andrew \u2018Twiggy\u2019 Forrest</a> \u2013 the brains behind the rebel World Series Rugby competition.</p> <p>Indeed, eyebrows were raised when he appointed Pichot, not previously famous for being an expert in the field, as head of his South American mining operation. So much so that one of RA\u2019s leading officials, Brett Robinson,<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/twiggy-recruits-world-rugby-deputy-to-head-mining-push-in-argentina-20180816-p4zxwd.html\"> reportedly demanded that Pichot declare his conflict of interest</a> to World Rugby. It seems the pair have made up, however, because Robinson\u2019s nomination to World Rugby\u2019s executive committee was seconded by the Argentinian union.</p> <p>Beaumont and Pichot have spent the past four years as chairman and vice-chairman respectively, but this election battle has long since been coming. According to one well-placed source, they were \u201cwatching each other\u2019s every move\u201d throughout the Japan World Cup and their manifestos do not differ greatly from each other. But while Pichot has decided to go it alone, Beaumont has enlisted Laporte\u2019s services. And Laporte is a political animal.</p> <p>It was he who, despite an official recommendation that South Africa should be awarded the 2023 World Cup, convinced the voters to plump for France. It seems likely Laporte fancies a crack at the top job, a year after delivering that tournament, and while that 2023 fiasco came at great embarrassment to Beaumont, clearly he recognised the Frenchman\u2019s influence. Indeed, it was Laporte who almost convinced the uber-conservative Six Nations to back the Nations Championship proposal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/world-rugby-administration-needs-to-work-many-not-few\">Trad turkeys of World Rugby unlikely to vote for Christmas on election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having Laporte as his No 2 has not been without its difficulties, however. There is his role in the Kean affair and Beaumont was also forced to row back on Laporte\u2019s recent claims that World Rugby would run a proposed Club World Cup and the Champions Cup would be ditched as a result. It is unlikely that was a slip of the tongue by Laporte who, crucially, understands the balance of power within the global game and just how much of it lies with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/premiership-rugby-union-clubs-in-danger-funding-shortfall-from-paused-season\">clubs in England</a> and France.</p> <p>We have heard plenty about a new-found cooperation between unions and clubs in recent weeks, but already the cracks are beginning to show. World Rugby wants to play Tests in October, the European clubs have balked at the idea. The best way to interpret Laporte\u2019s comments is as planting a flag, the Frenchman aware that the coronavirus crisis has rendered the clubs weaker than usual. Because, for all that Beaumont and Pichot have both promised change, it will only happen with the say-so of the clubs, regardless of whoever accrues most votes on 12 May.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s largest banks could have to put aside nearly \u00a35bn to help cover potential loan losses in the first quarter, amid fears that the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak will make it harder for borrowers to repay their debts.</p> <p>This week HSBC, Lloyds, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered will reveal how the pandemic and resulting lockdowns hurt their balance sheets during the first three months of the year.</p> <p>HSBC is expected to report the largest provision among its peers when it releases first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with consensus estimates pointing to a $1.8bn (\u00a31.4bn) charge.</p> <p>That is nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/18/hsbc-to-cut-35000-jobs-worldwide-as-profits-plunge-coronavirus\">three times the $600m</a> that HSBC said it may have to put aside in February, when the disease was still largely contained in Asia and hitting the bank\u2019s largest market in Hong Kong. Analysts are now expecting HSBC\u2019s first-quarter profits to more than halve, from $6.2bn to $2.9bn.</p> <p>The London-headquartered lender Standard Chartered is expected to take a smaller hit as its customer base is primarily based in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Consensus estimates suggest it will put aside $622m (\u00a3502m) in the first quarter, having already warned that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/27/standard-chartered-misses-growth-targets-amid-coronavirus-fears\">miss financial targets for 2020.</a> Pre-tax profits are forecast to fall by a third, to $796m.</p> <p>Domestic banks in the UK have been scrambling to grant mortgage and credit card repayment holidays to retail customers and dole out government-backed loans for small businesses hit by the outbreak. While the measures will provide temporary relief, there are questions over whether borrowers will be able to afford repayments once the holidays expire.</p> <p>That uncertainty could result in Lloyds setting aside around \u00a31.1bn worth of impairments, according to analysts at UBS, who expect Lloyds\u2019 profits to fall by 77% to \u00a3363m. </p> <p>RBS, which will soon be renamed NatWest, is expected to take a \u00a3515m charge, according to consensus forecasts, though some estimates are as high as \u00a3888m. It is expected to push attributable profits down by more than 70% to \u00a3200m.</p> <p>Forecasts also show Barclays may have to put aside around \u00a3923m to cover loan losses and any other charges, pushing pre-tax profits down by 20% to \u00a31.2bn.</p> <p>While some analysts expect the bulk of UK bank provisions will be put aside for business loans, Barclays may end up having to put more aside for its credit card division, which is exposed to both the UK and US markets. Barclays is one of the top-10 credit card issuers in the US, where more than 26 million workers have lost their job in the last month.</p> <p>Jason Napier, a banks analyst at UBS, said investors were still shooting in the dark as they try to predict the full fallout of the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThough Covid-19 infection curves seem to have peaked in a number of countries, investors have no hard data to gauge the damage this shock will do to the banks,\u201d he said.</p> <p>New accounting models being phased in across UK banks mean they are likely to take more of their charges upfront, but not to the same extent as US banks, which operate on a different standard. \u201cThere\u2019s potential for very significant charges to be taken in a short space of time,\u201d Napier warned.</p> <p>This month JP Morgan set aside $8.3bn (\u00a36.6bn) to cover potential loan losses, saying it expected a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\">\u201cfairly severe recession\u201d</a> due to the outbreak. That was followed by a \u00a31bn charge by Goldman Sachs, which nearly halved its first-quarter profits.</p> <p>However, Napier said UK banks were much better placed to weather a downturn than they were at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>",

Yet it\u2019s not just that people are bored and horny \u2013 there\u2019s more to it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are feeling very vulnerable and they are feeling scared. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. When we\u2019re facing death, we tend to become much more vibrant in wanting to be alive,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Koens believes people are turning to sexting and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/nude-selfies-what-if-they-are-just-an-ordinary-part-of-teenage-life\"> nudes</a> because it\u2019s \u201chooking into our desires. It\u2019s hooking into our desirability. It\u2019s hooking into our body. It\u2019s special because this isn\u2019t something that we do with everybody [and] it\u2019s a way of being intimate in a time where we actually can\u2019t touch each other\u201d.</p> <p>Sexting \u2013 in case you aren\u2019t familiar \u2013 is using text, images, photos, video and audio to get saucy with someone online. Right now the practice is having a heyday. What\u2019s more, people are using their creativity to sext in varied and unexpected ways. Koens notes that some groups of friends \u2013 such as the Cheeky Chicks \u2013 are sending nude images to each other too \u201cfor shits and giggles\u201d.</p> <p>However, others, such as 41-year-old public servant Mia*, are sexting their crushes one to one. And not just a bit. But a lot. Mia says: \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying sharing a long fantasy of: \u2018What I\u2019d do if we were locked in the steamy spa room at my gym together\u2019 texts with my bloke.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like the end of the world, so all the basic urges like cooking, sleeping and fucking are really important again,\u201d Mia says. \u201cThe isolation is ramping up the desire to connect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/16/self-love-in-isolation-i-hope-people-are-using-this-time-to-explore-their-sexuality\">Vibrators and self-love</a> don\u2019t cut it right now. It needs to be more.\u201d</p> <p>Our feelings of isolation and fear are causing us to reach out and connect in a far more vulnerable way. Take 51-year-old legal professional, Jennifer*, as another example. She thinks back a few weeks: \u201cAt the start of the crisis, anxiety was peaking, and I was standing in the supermarket crying.\u201d</p> <p>This prompted Jennifer to send her best friend of 25 years, who lives interstate, a message along the lines of: \u201cI would give anything to see him just so he could hug me.\u201d</p> <p>A phone call followed, and the relationship quickly evolved into regular sexting between the pair. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sexy story just for me where I am beautiful and desirable. That\u2019s an intoxicating feeling,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While exploring new forms of intimacy can be a thrill, Rosy wants to underscore something crucial: \u201cNo one is forced to put something up and you engage at the level you feel comfortable at.\u201d</p> <p>Koens says people sext for all kinds of reasons. \u201cWhen we flirt with somebody we get a little bit of an extra spring in our step \u2026 It can be very validating to have somebody responding positively to messages that you\u2019re writing or imagery or voicemails that you are sending.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/21/single-people-living-with-couples-coronavirus-lockdown\">'I\u2019m so starved for human touch': a hell of its own for single people living with couples</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just like with face-to-face sexual interactions, consent is king when it comes to sexting. \u201cIf you\u2019re having sexy banter and you want to up the ante and send a recording or an image, you need to check first,\u201d says Koens. \u201c\u2018Would you be open to receiving some images of me? Would you be open to receiving naked images of me? Would you be open to seeing pictures of my genitals?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cPeople say that\u2019s not sexy [to ask] and I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s incorrect \u2026 Once you\u2019ve got permission, you have zero risk of offending somebody.\u201d</p> <p>When wanting to turn the chat to sexy talk, Koens has noticed that men can often \u201cpressure\u201d women into sending images.

  "<p>As the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine intensifies, there\u2019s a question Jane Halton and her team come back to time and again: if and when successful vaccines emerge, what can be done to ensure they don\u2019t simply go to those with the deepest pockets?</p> <p>If market power is allowed to dictate access, how can those most vulnerable to Covid-19 be assured of protection?</p> <p>\u201cWe are acutely aware of this and it is literally a topic that is being discussed on a daily basis,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cBecause to us it is just unacceptable that there is not fair access to a successful vaccine across the world\u2019s population.</p> <p>\u201cThe notion that this would be a question of going to the highest bidder, to us is just totally unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Halton, a former secretary of Australia\u2019s health and finance departments, is chair of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations, a global body playing a critical role in financing and coordinating Covid-19 vaccine development.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">Coronavirus vaccine: when will we have one?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of its founding aims is to ensure that vaccines, once developed, are distributed fairly.</p> <p>The world has witnessed what happens when the market is left to dictate vaccine distribution. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30763-7/fulltext\">wealthy nations negotiated</a> large advance orders of the vaccine, effectively crowding out poorer countries.</p> <p>The West African ebola crisis \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/history/2014-2016-outbreak/index.html\">outbreak that killed</a> 11,325 people \u2013 exposed its own galling market failure.</p> <p>Even as the death toll in West Africa grew and grew, big pharmaceuticals could not see a way to recoup the considerable losses they would face attempting to find a vaccine.</p> <p>The leader of Britain\u2019s ebola response, Adrian Hill, said there was simply no \u201cbig market\u201d to make it worthwhile for massive corporations.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no business case to make an ebola vaccine for the people who needed it most,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/ebola-outbreak-big-pharma-failed-victims-why-9716615.html\">he said</a>.</p> <p>It was out of that failure that the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations emerged.</p> <p>\u201cThe world\u2019s response to this crisis fell tragically short,\u201d it says in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2019/april/1_CEPI_Summary_WHO_SAGE_Meeting_April.pdf?ua=1\">explaining its background</a>. \u201cA vaccine that had been under development for more than a decade was not deployed until over a year into the epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cThat vaccine was shown to be 100% effective, suggesting that much of the epidemic could have been prevented. It was evident that we needed a better system to speed the development of vaccines against known epidemic threats.\u201d</p> <p>But Covid-19 presents it with a test like no other. A <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930763-7\">paper published in the Lancet last month</a> warned of the significant prospect that wealthy countries would monopolise global supply of Covid-19 vaccines.</p> <p>\u201cThis risk is real,\u201d the paper warned. \u201cSuch an outcome would result in a suboptimal allocation of an initially scarce resource.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There should not be a divide between the haves and the have-nots</p> <footer> <cite>WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Halton predicts the pressure to secure access to successful vaccines will be \u201castronomical\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m worried about is vaccine nationalism and I\u2019ve started to use that terminology when I talk to people,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been worrying about this issue now for months and months ... What is a mechanism to ensure equitable access?\u201d</p> <p>An estimated minimum of 1 billion people across the globe are vulnerable to Covid-19. They fall into a number of categories: the immunocompromised, those with co-morbidities, the ageing, and frontline medical staff.</p> <p>\u201cSo that says to you you need a lot of vaccine to protect even the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Halton says.</p> <p>It\u2019s a problem the World Health Organisation is also working urgently to solve. This week it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/23/world/europe/23reuters-health-coronavirus-who-covid.html\">announced it planned </a>to design mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re looking for vaccines, unless we break the barriers to equitable distribution of the products, whether it\u2019s vaccines or therapeutics, we will have a problem, so we need to address the problem ahead of time,\u201d WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.</p> <p>\u201cThere should not be a divide between the haves and the have-nots.\u201d</p> <p>For private companies, vaccine development is considered risky, protracted and hugely expensive.</p> <p>Companies are faced with the prospect of spending extraordinary amounts to develop vaccines, with a low likelihood of success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-vaccine-trials-could-be-completed-by-mid-august\">Coronavirus vaccine trials could be done 'by mid-August'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs a company, you are not going to spend the hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars that are needed to develop a vaccine,\u201d Halton says. \u201cOne, because you think your chances of being successful are about 5%. [Second], because you don\u2019t even think there\u2019s going to be a market for it.</p> <p>\u201cSo this part of market failure is completely understandable. And that\u2019s why [the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations] was set up.\u201d</p> <p>It believes it needs $US2bn to develop three vaccine candidates in the next 12 to 18 months. It has raised almost half of that.</p> <p>The $2bn does not include the costs of manufacture or delivery.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s work emphasises speed. Each stage of the vaccine development process is compressed. Halton says the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines are being developed is \u201cunprecedented\u201d.</p> <p>One of the projects the coalition is <a href=\"https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2020/04/international-partnership-progresses-uq-covid-19-vaccine-project\">funding is at the University of Queensland</a>, where researchers are testing a molecular clamp technology they hope can help neutralise the virus.</p> <p>The coalition asked UQ researchers to begin working on a Covid-19 vaccine in January. Within three weeks it had produced the candidate now being tested.</p> <p>\u201cLike every researcher who\u2019s looking at their baby, they are optimistic,\u201d she says. \u201cAll I can say is I hope they\u2019re right. I genuinely hope they\u2019re right. It\u2019s very hard for me to form a judgment about the likelihood of success.\u201d</p> <p>More broadly, she remains optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cI think when we look across all the work that\u2019s going on globally on vaccines, I do have some hope that we will end up with not just one successful candidate \u2013 ideally we would have three,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve said this now publicly several times: hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And if you hope for the best what you would do is hope to get three successful candidates.\u201d</p>",

The warning came as the academic developing the app admitted that 60% of population would need to sign up to the app to make it effective. </p> \n  <p>Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no-one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life. The government needs to focus on providing a public health response that ensures we come through this crisis with our rights intact.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Prof Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said that it would a require a very high take-up to be effective. </p> \n  <p>\u201cFor this intervention alone to stop a resurgence of the epidemic, about 60% of the population would have to use the app,\u201d he told the BBC. </p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cThe app is going to be one of the building blocks of how to get out of the epidemic. For every one to two users who download the app, and who adhere to the instructions, you will prevent one infection.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He explained if you become infected the app will send warning messages to anyone you have who has come within Bluetooth range of your phone. He said: \u201cYou\u2019ll either get a message which says you\u2019ve been in contact with a suspect case of Covid-19. Or you may later get a message and you\u2019ve been a contact of a confirmed case. At that point, we would recommend quarantine of 14 days after the contact has taken place.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cWhen you install the app, this is an opt in system so it will work in the background. Your phone builds up a memory of the sort of anonymous IDs of the other phones you come into contact with. It needs to be a contact long enough that there\u2019s a risk of transmission.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked about privacy concerns he said: \u201cThe NHS records patient data already and we trust the NHS to look after private data. This is being developed with a minimal amount of data \u2013 enough to make it work. It\u2019s a public health intervention with data collected within a health system.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-26T14:07:56.542Z\">at 3.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea55c558f08fa2bdcb1b940\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-26T10:07:26.228Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Testing kits for key workers booked up within hours for third day running</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For the third day running since becoming available online, coronavirus home testing kits for key workers have been booked up within hours.</p> \n  <p>More than 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for Covid-19 tests as officials race to hit their 100,000-a-day testing target by next Thursday.</p> \n  <p>By 10am home testing kits for England were listed as \u201cunavailable\u201d on the government\u2019s website - two hours after booking slots reopened.

  "<p>Stone upon stone, the towering embodiment of their builders\u2019 wealth, status or hunger for defence, Scotland\u2019s iron-age brochs have fascinated and confounded archaeologists for centuries.</p> <p>The precise constitution of these architecturally complex roundhouses, and why they remain unique to Scotland, is the subject of ongoing research, but there is broad agreement that a broch is a drystone tower built between around 2,500 and 1,800 years ago, in the mid-iron age, often with cells and stairs built within the walls.</p> <p>According to Historic Environment Scotland (HES), between 500 and 600 have been identified using this definition, scattered across the country but with the densest distribution in Orkney, Shetland, and Caithness.</p> <p>On the Caithness coastline, north-east of Helmsdale, conservation work on the broch at Ousdale \u2013 now among the best preserved in the country and one of the few with evidence of a second floor \u2013 was weeks away from completion when it was abruptly halted by the lockdown.</p> <p>With fresh gravel flooring ready to lay when restrictions allow, the Caithness Broch Project, which coordinated the \u00a3180,000 Ousdale preservation, will then be ready to proceed with its flagship experiment: building a new broch from the ground up for the first time in the modern age, with the aim of understanding through construction how these structures developed and what they signified to the people who built them.</p> <p>\u201cExperimental archaeology is a more practical and innovative way of dealing with the difficult questions posed by these enigmatic constructions,\u201d explains Kenneth McElroy, the director of the Caithness Broch Project. \u201cIn turn, this helps us to better understand peoples of Scotland, and what drove them to build such impressive constructions.\u201d</p> <p>A handful of the most impressive brochs \u2013 Gurness, dominating the shoreline of Eynhallow Sound in Orkney, or the 13-metre Mousa broch in Shetland, which features in two Norse sagas \u2013 are open to the public. Many are cared for by HES or local authorities, but still more are lost beneath grassy tors, evidenced only by a few protruding stones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bec07ad3ed5c34105a2a8c46a4fdb37625aaa6ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec07ad3ed5c34105a2a8c46a4fdb37625aaa6ec/0_46_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Midhowe broch on the island of Rousay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Midhowe broch on the island of Rousay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Sargent/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr John Raven, the deputy head of casework at HES, suggests that a series of factors combined to create the context for the development of brochs. \u201cIn the background is a social crisis throughout north-western Europe in the mid-iron age which resulted the creation of hierarchies who sought to express their status and ownership by building complex structures. This was also a period of climate change which resulted in a significant expansion of peat growth in north and west Scotland, which limited the extent of good agricultural land and placed pressure on communities.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also possible that communities were reacting to slave trading with communities to the south and later the knock-on effects of the expansion of Rome. The structural complexity of brochs also suggests the development of specialised building techniques which largely limited the spread to inter-connected communities.\u201d</p> <p>As well as a thrilling exercise in experimental archaeology, the construction of a new broch will preserve and promote the skills of drystone dyking, says McElroy. He is working with a firm of architects to identify a suitable site for the project before fundraising stars in earnest. Crucially, he adds, the newbuild broch could serve as a world-class tourist attraction to draw visitors to Caithness, an area often bypassed on the way to more familiar island destinations.</p> <p>McElroy says: \u201cThere are so many unanswerable questions in archaeology, and in the past, but this should go some way to revealing more about our iron-age ancestors.\u201d</p>",

After criticism from scientists, the agency rowed back, clarifying that it expected people to develop some level of protection but that it was not clear how much and how long it would last.</p> \n<p>Unlike Sweden, France has imposed a mandatory tight lockdown for weeks.

  "<p>A week or so ago, Iain Chirnside was lying on a trampoline in his back garden with his 12-year-old son, Oscar, when they heard a noise. \u201cWe both looked at each other and said, \u2018What the heck is that?\u2019 And we looked up and saw that it was an easyJet plane.\u201d It caused a momentary jolt: \u201cFlip! I had almost forgotten about that!\u201d</p> <p>The family live in the flight path of Aberdeen airport and in more normal times, as well as frequent planes, they also endure regular helicopter flights to the region\u2019s oil rigs \u2013 which have also dramatically reduced since the twin crises of coronavirus and oil prices struck. Shortly before spotting the plane, Chirnside says, he had been delighted to hear the call of a buzzard high above his garden for the first time.</p> <p>Before the crisis slashed air traffic by 90%, Chirnside says he does not think he would have been lying on the trampoline with his son on a Saturday afternoon, just watching things. \u201cI hope we hold on to that spirit when we go back to our, inverted commas, \u2018normal life\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It is a sentiment that has been felt keenly across the country by those who live under flight paths, who find themselves unexpectedly able to breathe clean air, hear birdsong and \u2013 for many of the worst affected \u2013 sit in their own gardens. In the week before Britain went into lockdown, 7,865 flights departed the UK\u2019s 10 biggest airports, according to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52323416\">a BBC analysis of flight data</a>. During the week to 21 April, the number recorded by<a href=\"https://www.flightradar24.com/\"> Flightradar24 </a>was 711.</p> <p>For some, the change in their quality of life has been dramatic. \u201cIt\u2019s blissful at the moment,\u201d says Maggie Thorburn, who lives in Isleworth, west London, so close to Heathrow that at the worst times of the day planes usually scream over her home every 90 seconds, with constant air traffic from 4.30am until 11pm.</p> <p>So dominant is the noise from the airport, says Thorburn, that in normal times her decisions when to open her windows or sit in her garden are driven entirely by Heathrow\u2019s flight schedule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e11fb174a1308e96d4e47215fb24b92212622a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e11fb174a1308e96d4e47215fb24b92212622a6d/355_0_3102_1863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grounded easyJet aircraft parked at Southend airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grounded easyJet aircraft parked at Southend airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With flight numbers down by two thirds, however, she is certainly sleeping better, \u201cand I can hear things from further away \u2013 the church clock striking, and of course the birds. It\u2019s not the same as being in the countryside, but it\u2019s the next best thing. It really is a huge relief to be able to be home and have some peacefulness.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, no one is pretending the clean air and relative quiet comes without a cost. While the national economy has been clobbered by the lockdown, the collapse in air travel means towns near airports are among the worst affected. Research by the <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/blog/what-does-the-covid-19-crisis-mean-for-the-economies-of-british-cities-and-large-towns/\">Centre for Cities</a> suggests that in Crawley, close to Gatwick, more than half of all jobs are vulnerable either to being furloughed or lost altogether \u2013 a dizzying speed of collapse that is entirely without precedent, according to Paul Swinney, the thinktank\u2019s director of policy and research.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, the hope would be that while the downturn is unprecedented the bounce back in theory will be very quick as well,\u201d he says.</p> <p>However, for Thorburn, who is vice-chair of the group <a href=\"https://hacan.org.uk/?page_id=4496\">Hacan</a><br> which campaigns against Heathrow expansion, a return to what once was considered normal is a prospect that provokes dread. \u201cI have got used to not hearing the planes all the time. And when they come back \u2013 if they come back \u2013 I am not looking forward to business as usual.\u201d</p> <p>With many airlines struggling even to survive,<br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/small-planes-and-no-business-class-will-flying-ever-be-the-same-again-covid-19\"><br></a> it is not clear when, if at all, air travel will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/small-planes-and-no-business-class-will-flying-ever-be-the-same-again-covid-19\">return to its pre-coronavirus levels</a> \u2013 though Swinney says he thinks flying is likely eventually to recover, because \u201cthere aren\u2019t enough viable alternatives to flying to different places\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For Shaun Davidson, however, whose east London home lies in the flightpath of the closed London City airport, his newly quiet back garden has made him wonder whether it\u2019s time to reexamine the compromises city dwellers make with aircraft noise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s made me think more about how many flights people take and how many are necessary. We probably do travel more than we need to.\u201d Is it really worth it, he says, when the alternative might be \u201cto have clearer skies, a nicer environment around. Yes I guess I have started questioning that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The 2020 NFL draft wasn\u2019t quite a live sporting event, but it was enough to distract fans from the global pandemic that has kept major leagues indefinitely suspended. Here are the teams that we think did the best and worst jobs of improving their future.</p> <h2><br><strong>Winners</strong></h2> <p><br><strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong>: Baltimore didn\u2019t have many needs after winning 14 games in 2019, but general manager Eric DeCosta and head coach John Harbaugh maximized their positioning during the draft\u2019s first two days.</p> <p>After losing linebackers Patrick Onwuasor and Josh Bynes in free agency, the Ravens tapped rangy LSU linebacker Patrick Queen with their first pick (28th overall). Queen is undersized for the position, but possesses blistering sideline-to-sideline speed and strong pass coverage abilities. After Queen, Baltimore added Ohio State running back JK Dobbins, an exciting addition to Baltimore\u2019s record-breaking rushing attack who should effectively spell 30-year-old starter Mark Ingram and backup Gus Edwards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/justin-rohrwasser-new-england-patriots-kicker-tattoo-three-percenters-nfl-draft\">Patriots' new kicker Rohrwasser denies tattoo represents rightwing militia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead of Queen or Dobbins, it was third-round pick Justin Madubuike that excited draft analysts the most. Some experts thought the brawny Texas A&amp;M defensive tackle would go early in the second round, but he instead fell to Baltimore at pick No 71. When asked what his favorite part of playing football is, Madubuike <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinM_NFL/status/1248334719378391049\">told USA Today</a> \u201cI love putting my hand in somebody\u2019s throat and pushing them all the way backward.\u201d Add in fellow third-round pick Devin Duvernay, who logged 106 catches and nine touchdown receptions last year at Texas, and the Ravens left the 2020 draft looking like the biggest winners.</p> <p><strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong>: The question that vexes every team when drafting is whether you select the best player available or the player that fits your biggest need. The Cowboys entered the draft with one of the league\u2019s most loaded offenses but still spent their first-round pick on Oklahoma wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, one of three standout receivers in the 2020 class. Dallas had more glaring needs at defensive back and defensive line, but wily owner and team president Jerry Jones decided on Lamb, who has the explosiveness, strength and route precision of a future superstar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2809a094ff37b5e5a623dbc42ea009f8eeb9c91c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2809a094ff37b5e5a623dbc42ea009f8eeb9c91c/0_126_4006_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cowboys were thrilled to grab CeeDee Lamb\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cowboys were thrilled to grab CeeDee Lamb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alonzo Adams/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gamble on Lamb may be worth it after Dallas unexpectedly landed Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs in the second round. Diggs is a former receiver who converted to defensive back and excelled in 2019 with three interceptions, 11 pass breakups and is a player many scouts considered a first-round talent. Third-round pick Neville Gallimore is a mammoth interior defensive lineman that Dallas may have lucked into at pick No82 and fourth-round cornerback Reggie Robinson gives them depth at one of their weakest positions.</p> <p><strong>Indianapolis Colts: </strong>The Colts drafted some of the best players available and filled some of their biggest needs even without a first-round pick. Second-round pick Michael Pittman is one of the many stud receivers of this draft class; the USC product is a sturdy 6ft 4in with excellent hands and enough speed to become the Colts\u2019 top receiver within the next few seasons. Running back Jonathan Taylor is one of the most successful college players of all-time \u2013 he became the first player in NCAA history to rush for over 6,000 yards in a three-year span \u2013 and possesses the strength and field vision consistent with the NFL\u2019s most successful running backs. There is some concern about the amount of carries he took in college and whether that will hurt his durability, but his explosiveness and physicality give him one of the highest ceilings of any skill player in the draft.</p> <p>Fifth-round selection Jacob Eason certainly looks the part of a future NFL starting quarterback \u2013 the Washington product stands 6ft 6in and has excellent arm strength \u2013 but must overcome the streaky tendencies that affected his 2019 season. He won\u2019t play next year, but head coach Frank Reich may work to groom him as Indianapolis\u2019s future starting QB.</p> <h2><strong>Losers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Green Bay Packers</strong>: It\u2019s impossible to anoint any true \u201closers\u201d before the drafted players begin their NFL careers, but Green Bay\u2019s selections were extremely confusing for a team looking to win a title while the 36-year-old Aaron Rodgers is still one of the game\u2019s best players. Widely expected to pick one of the many elite receivers in the draft, general manager Brian Gutekunst instead traded up from pick No 30 to select Utah State QB Jordan Love, who the team presumably expect to replace Rodgers in two or three years. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/26/patriots-passing-on-quarterbacks-in-nfl-draft-not-by-design-says-bill-belichick\">Patriots passing on quarterbacks in NFL draft 'not by design' says Bill Belichick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the second round, Gutekunst and coach Matt LaFleur drafted bruising running back AJ Dillon even though the Packers already have two proven rushers in Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams. Perhaps the front office expects Jones and Williams to leave town once they become free agents after next season, but it was still odd to see Green Bay spend their top two picks on positions they didn\u2019t need to address.</p> <p>Any angry Packers fan should read this 2012 assessment of the Seattle Seahawks draft\u2013 one that calls Russell Wilson <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1165320-2012-nfl-draft-grades-power-ranking-teams-that-failed-on-draft-day\">\u201cthe worst pick in the entire draft\u201d</a> \u2013 before declaring this draft a failure. Even so, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a player besides third-round tight end Josiah Deguara who looks primed to make an impact in 2020.</p> <p><strong>Las Vegas Raiders</strong>: The Raiders maintained their eccentric draft-day tendencies with a host of confusing selections despite holding two first-round picks. Speedy Alabama receiver Henry Ruggs was one of the three elite players at the position (along with Lamb and Jerry Jeudy) but considered the least polished of the three. It was a forgivable selection, but few thought that Ruggs would be the first of a historically deep receiver class off the board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19882f5110b166f9a7ad302e181a12a28284910c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19882f5110b166f9a7ad302e181a12a28284910c/0_0_3817_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Ruggs has pace to burn but was he the best receiver in the draft?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Ruggs has pace to burn but was he the best receiver in the draft?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vasha Hunt/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was eight picks after Ruggs when the Raiders stumped anybody who follows the draft: defensive back Damon Arnette was a strong defender on a loaded Ohio State defense, but most draftniks didn\u2019t have him as a first-round player. Time will tell if Arnette becomes one of the better players on the Raiders secondary, but Mayock probably could have traded the 19th overall pick and stockpiled assets instead of spending it on a player nobody valued highly.</p> <p>While the Raiders are always one of the most entertaining teams to follow on draft day, their inconsistency remains the only consistent thing about them.</p> <p><strong>Denver Broncos</strong>: Team president John Elway clearly wanted to supply new starting quarterback Drew Lock with weapons, which explains his selection of receivers Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler with Denver\u2019s first two picks. The problem is that he didn\u2019t do much to assure that Lock will be properly protected and given adequate time to get the ball to his new studs. While Elway drafted his center of the future in LSU\u2019s Lloyd Cushenberry, Denver didn\u2019t select an offensive tackle. That means the inconsistent, penalty-prone Garett Bolles will likely be the starting left tackle in Week 1.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Jury trials for serious crimes have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/mar/23/jury-trials-put-on-hold-in-england-and-wales-coronavirus\">come to a halt</a>. Twelve good men and women and true cannot be permitted to sit cheek by jowl in jury boxes, or expectorate in each other\u2019s presence in cramped jury rooms, while Covid-19 remains a threat \u2013 as it will for months or even years until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/21/hancock-uk-human-trials-for-coronavirus-vaccine-to-begin-on-thursday-video\">longed-for vaccine</a>.</p> <p>We believe sentimentally that trial by jury is a defendant\u2019s fundamental right \u2013 but why not give them the additional right to choose instead a reasoned verdict from a judge, as they have, for example, in most Australian states? That would get courts back up and running, even if barristers and judges have to argue through their face masks, and it would be a boon to defendants with good cases who do not want justice delayed.</p> <p>It is, of course, an Englishperson\u2019s enduring right not to be sent to prison for more than a year without the option of having his or her guilt determined by a jury of peers. But the right to jury trial was left out of the Human Rights Act, which merely adopted the European convention. Juries, as we know them, are not available in most continental countries, where first instance judges do an acceptable job of detailing rational reasons for findings of guilt that can then be scrutinised on appeal. There are cases in the UK where justice would be better served, and defendants would be better off, if they could choose trial by judge alone.</p> <p>Trial by judge alone operates in all international criminal courts and was introduced in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles by the judge-only Diplock courts. There were civil liberty concerns at first but the Northern Ireland judges were generally astute and rejected some high profile RUC prosecutions. There is a rarely used power for prosecutors to apply for trial by judge alone, but only if they can show that the defendant is bent on jury tampering.</p> <p>Cases where defendants may prefer trial by judge alone are those where the prosecution does not have the evidence to exclude a reasonable doubt, and trial by judge would predictably produce a speedy acquittal. This could also be preferable in cases involving defendants demonised either in person or because of their racial or religious group. When I defended Irish terrorist suspects and black activists in earlier days, juror prejudice was inevitable due to oppressive police security arrangements in court precincts and sensational media coverage, and it resulted in some notoriously wrongful convictions. In such cases, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial would have been more secure had they been entitled to opt for trial by judge alone.</p> <p>The most powerful argument against this was encapsulated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/nov/13/lord-hutchinson-of-lullington-obituary\">Lord Hutchinson</a>\u2019s response to my proposal: \u201cIt sounds fine in principle, but it will be the thin end of the wedge.\u201d He was afraid, like many great criminal lawyers, that it would be the first step to abolishing a trial system that they knew instinctively was worth keeping. They thought it vulnerable to politicians\u2019 attraction to cheaper, speedier and more rational justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/uk-courts-told-not-to-overreact-during-coronavirus-crisis\">UK courts told not to 'overreact' during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But provision of a jury waiver option will not lead to the demise of a form of trial that has so much public acceptance, in particular because it involves the public in the delivery of justice. None of the Australian states that allow defendants (but not prosecutors) to waive jury trials have moved on to abolish jurors. One state that does not allow waiver \u2013 Victoria \u2013 was recently faced with the trial of a cardinal (George Pell) accused of child sexual abuse. It had to be held in secret \u2013 the worst of all alternatives \u2013 because of fear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/15/andrew-bolt-and-the-abc-did-the-reporting-on-george-pell-step-over-a-line\">publicity</a> could prejudice a follow-on trial (although in the event prosecutors withdrew those charges).

Had he been entitled to a trial by judge alone, this objectionable secrecy would never have been necessary.</p> <p>Jury waiver would help the justice system to handle some problems caused by Covid-19. But it should not be regarded either as a short-term expedient or as harbinger of the demise of jury trial. It should rather be accepted as the right of any person facing a substantial prison sentence to opt for trial by judge alone \u2013 or by three judges \u2013 in order to know the reasons why he or she is losing their liberty.</p> <p>\u2022 Geoffrey Robertson is a human rights barrister and founder of Doughty Street Chambers.

  "<p>For most of the past 20 years, gymnastics is the only thing that Kyla Ross has known. She was doing handstands by four years old, she was an Olympic gold medallist by 15 and this year at 23 she was finishing an exceptional college gymnastics career at UCLA. This was supposed to be the season that tied all the loose ends as she achieved her final goals and then departed into the night. Instead, Ross watched helplessly as the coronavirus outbreak had the final say, briskly sending her into retirement.</p> <p>For a full week in mid-March, each new day brought one more blow in a series of gut punches for college athletes. First they learned that their meets would be audience-free, then the Pac-12 national competition was scuppered, then the entire season was cancelled. By 12 March, universities were closing down. After teams held emergency meetings filled with tears and farewells, senior athletes across the United States spent the trip home trying to come to terms with the mortality of their careers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/verona-van-de-leur-gymnast-no-food-anything-survive-interview\">Verona van de Leur: 'When you have no food you do anything to survive'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a gymnast, the sting was even more severe for Ross. Even in a world of questionable judging and suffocating coaches, a gymnast steps up on to the podium alone. Only their actions determine the quality of their performance. As the world shut down, so too did her autonomy.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, that was probably one of the longest weeks of my life,\u201d says Ross in a phone interview. \u201cIt was all out of our control. Usually, you have this expectation in your mind of how you want your season to end and you usually have control of being out there on the competition floor. But just having the news given to you and told that you\u2019re done is the hardest.\u201d</p> <p>Ross is a rarity among the college athletes. She also happens to be one of the best gymnasts of the past decade. The youthful nature of women\u2019s gymnastics means that those who attend university complete the cycle back to front; they chase their Olympic dreams, retire from elite level, and only then head off to class.</p> <p>In Ross\u2019s first year as a senior gymnast, she marched into the monstrous 2012 US Olympic team at 15 and projected <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HiaPliVoXk\">all the composure</a> in the world to help USA win team gold.

She remains the last person to beat Biles.</p> <p>The conditions in which she and her teammates competed have come to define recent gymnastics headlines. As the entire 2012 Olympic team stepped forward against Larry Nassar, the toxic culture of Marta Karolyi\u2019s camps was revealed. However, college is often different. The gymnasts are hellbent on pairing fierce competition with enjoyment, friendship and an enriching culture. Ross\u2019s UCLA head coach, Chris Waller, describes college gymnastics as \u201ca pep rally for learning life lessons\u201d.</p> <p>When Ross first entered the UCLA training gym, the environment unsettled her.

  "<p>For almost six years now, a network of volunteers in Europe and Africa have been providing a service that some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries have chosen not to. When migrants get into distress in the Mediterranean, they can call <a href=\"https://alarmphone.org/en/\">Alarm Phone</a>\u2019s emergency number; the call is relayed by a team of people spread across France, Tunisia, Italy, Germany, the UK, Morocco and elsewhere to the coastguard service nearest the boat.</p> <p>On the night of 10 April, Alarm Phone received a call from one of 63 people on board a rubber boat drifting between Libya, Italy and Malta that was slowly filling up with water.<a href=\"https://alarmphone.org/en/2020/04/16/twelve-deaths-and-a-secret-push-back-to-libya/\"> According to Alarm Phone</a>, the EU was aware of the boat but Malta, the country that should have been responsible for rescuing it, held off until the migrants could be returned to Libya, where torture and other forms of mistreatment are well documented. The boat drifted for five days, during which time five people died of thirst, according to survivors, and another seven people went missing, presumed drowned.</p> <p>Malta\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, is now<a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/malta-prime-minister-migrant-deaths-5078016-Apr2020/\"> under police investigation</a> for the incident but remains defiant: \u201cMy conscience is clear because we have done everything in our power to protect our people and all those who live in this country,\u201d he said, explaining that Malta\u2019s ports were closed during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIn a health emergency, this country is not a safe port for migrants.\u201d</p> <p>To many people, this logic \u2013 we must look after our own \u2013 will seem unassailable, despite the costs. Malta is not the only country to shut off help to vulnerable migrants during the pandemic: Italy has also<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/italy-declares-own-ports-unsafe-to-stop-migrants-disembarking\"> closed its ports</a>, while the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/patel-refuses-to-take-children-from-greek-camps-threatened-by-covid-19\">declines to evacuate</a> refugee children with relatives in Britain from unsanitary Greek camps, and the US has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/7e9426532434bdda47f270a57d091c91\">quietly suspended</a> its entire asylum system. Earlier this month, nearly 400 Rohingya refugees were found starving on a boat near Malaysia, which had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52305931\">cited the pandemic</a> as a reason not to take them in.</p> <p>Temporary limits on movement \u2013 within countries and cities, as well as internationally \u2013 are regarded by most public health experts as an essential part of the fight against the coronavirus. But the overriding message from leading scientists has been that this needs to be based on a system of testing and contact tracing that tracks the spread of the virus, rather than blanket assumptions about foreigners and other outsiders. If clampdowns on national borders are offered as a substitute for more meaningful forms of protection then everybody loses.</p> <p>In recent years, as rightwing populism has become a defining political force in many parts of the world, the demand for tougher border control has come to stand in for a range of wider anxieties about identity, culture and economic security. The political theorist Wendy Brown links this to decades of neoliberal policies that have allowed finance-driven global capitalism to undermine wages, infrastructure and social security in wealthy countries; her book<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/walled-states-waning-sovereignty\"> Walled States, Waning Sovereignty</a> suggests that the politically potent image of the border wall has come to stand in for security that the state no longer provides.</p> <p>Nowhere does this seem more apt today than the US. Universal healthcare and comprehensive unemployment support is anathema to much of the political elite; what they have instead is a president who grandstands about flight bans and protecting Americans<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\"> from being \u201creplaced\u201d</a> in their jobs by immigrants even as he actively undermines domestic social distancing policies and efforts to source vital medical equipment. But the impulse is present in Europe too: as the coronavirus arrived on the continent the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-outbreak-migrants-blamed-italy-matteo-salvini-marine-le-pen\"> first response of many rightwing populists</a> was to attack refugee policy and the EU\u2019s internal free movement rules. Some of these voices<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/populist-right-coronavirus\"> have, for the moment, been dimmed</a> as many citizens prioritise the advice of scientific experts in a time of medical emergency.</p> <p>If the border is a dominant symbol of national welfare, it is not the only one. In the UK, while a vocal minority on the right<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/30/course-must-stop-coronavirus-not-cost-becoming-police-state/\"> continues to play on this theme</a> in order to attack domestic lockdown measures, it has been eclipsed by the call to rally around the NHS. There is no more powerful symbol of collective good in the British political lexicon; not even politicians who oppose the principle of socialised medicine dare say so openly. It sits at the heart of the government\u2019s call to action: <em>stay home, protect the NHS, save lives</em>.</p> <p>The solidarity expressed by millions of people at a moment of crisis is an amazing thing. As in other afflicted countries, the vast majority of the UK\u2019s population have made huge, largely voluntary changes to their lives for collective benefit. But our desire for security can nonetheless be pushed in an exclusionary direction. \u201cIt\u2019s the national health service, not the international health service,\u201d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1195997609942560768\"> wrote</a> the health secretary Matt Hancock during last year\u2019s general election campaign, promising to extend the health surcharge to non-resident EU citizens after Brexit.</p> <p>Over the past decade, as the strength of the NHS has been depleted by austerity economics, along with other public services, the right has pushed the claim that foreigners are an unacceptable drain on the state, accompanied by a host of bureaucratic measures \u2013 charges, restrictions, surveillance, punishment \u2013 to police their activities even as the rest of society benefits from their labour. It is no small irony that as Britain expresses a newfound gratitude to the immigrants that help keep the NHS and other key services running, the Home Office is<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayaGoodfellow/status/1252550524790018048\"> fighting to maintain</a> many of its notorious hostile environment policies.</p> <p>Once the pandemic subsides, and we are left to deal with the social and economic upheaval in its wake, nationalist demands for wealthy countries to turn inwards are likely to intensify. These may well start with demands to exclude outsiders but they are likely to turn on \u201cundeserving\u201d citizens too. Events in the Mediterranean may seem distant from many everyday concerns right now, but the way our governments treat people in need is the defining question of our time. If you want to see what happens when death and suffering are swept under the carpet and rendered acceptable by political euphemism and omission, then the frontiers of the rich world are a useful place to start. This is a planetary crisis, not a national one, and it is vital that we do not allow our respect for human life to end at the border.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe</p>",
  "<p>Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 wisecrack \u2013 \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d \u2013 would not get a lot of laughs today. In much of the world, people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Reagan\u2019s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades, spreading abroad \u2013 particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries.</p> <p>The antipathy to the state was selective: Reagan, like Donald Trump today, racked up huge deficits, spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks. But on both sides of the Atlantic, the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate.</p> <p>There are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes. Disease and mass unemployment have always been far better recruiting sergeants for the cause of big government than any party manifesto \u2013 and this crisis is unlikely to be an exception.</p> <p>Some social scientists and historians argue that this pandemic could become a turning point in social history \u2013 on a par with the New Deal in the US or the post-war Labour government in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been on this kind of trajectory for last 30-odd years where the individual was taking priority over the collective.

As a far broader cross-section of Americans face medical bankruptcy because they have partial or no health insurance, it will be harder for Trump to pursue his effort to obliterate the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which extended the scope of health insurance coverage, and could provide support for a more ambitious expansion of government-funded healthcare.</p> <p>For parallel reasons, it will be even harder politically for Boris Johnson to bargain away the fundamentals of the NHS at trade talks with Washington, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">after it saved his life</a>.</p> <p>It is too early to predict how the coronavirus shock will affect the outcome of this year\u2019s US elections.

The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Downing Street is insisting there is nothing untoward about the pair\u2019s attendance at Sage meetings, saying they are largely taking part as silent observers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate to imply [Sage] advice is affected by government advisers listening to discussions,\u201d a Downing Street spokesperson said. \u201cIt is entirely right that No 10 advisers attend to better understand the scientific debate and the decisions that need to be taken.\u201d<br><br>However, the two other Sage attendees the Guardian spoke to painted a different picture to that presented by No 10, which has been striving to play down the influence of the two advisers. Both Sage attendees declined to be named.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have been concerned sometimes that Sage has become too operational, so we\u2019ve ended up looking as though we are making decisions,\u201d one of them said, making clear that Cummings had been involved on those occasions. \u201cIt contravenes previous guidelines about how you make sure you get impartial scientific advice going through to politicians, who make the decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring to both Cummings and Warner, the Sage attendee added: \u201cWhen a very senior civil servant or a very well-connected person interrupts, then I don\u2019t think anyone in the room feels the power to stop it. When you get to discussing where advice might be going, there have been occasions where they have been involved, and a couple of times I\u2019ve thought: that\u2019s not what we are supposed to be doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>A second Sage attendee said Cummings had played an active role meetings from February onwards. They said they were initially shocked to discover Cummings was taking part in a meeting of supposedly independent scientific experts.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was not just an observer, he\u2019s listed as an active participant,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe was engaging in conversation and not sitting silently.\u201d The second attendee said Cumming\u2019s involvement was worrying because of his reputation in Whitehall and the questions his participation raises about Sage\u2019s role as a neutral body of expert advisers.</p> \n<p>The reaction from the two Sage attendees contrasts with that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/scientists-criticise-uk-government-over-following-the-science\">Prof Neil Ferguson</a>, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have played a guiding role in the government\u2019s response to Covid-19. He appeared unconcerned when asked, in a video interview, about Cummings attending Sage meetings. \u201cThere have been a number of observers at those meetings, who have not interfered with business at all,\u201d he replied.</p> \n<p>Sage membership is not fixed, but changes according to the nature of the crisis being faced. Independent scientific experts on the group are supposed to assess evidence impartially and pass their advice to Cobra, the civil contingencies committee convened in the Cabinet Office.</p> \n<p>The advisory group is chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who also decides which experts take part. Asked whether Vallance had also given his approval to Cummings and Warner coming to his meetings, a government spokesperson said Vallance \u201cwould not have to sign off\u201d observers or representatives from government departments.<br><br>The chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are classified as observers on Sage. However, unlike Cummings and Warner, they are unable to ask questions unless they are submitted in writing in advance.</p> \n<p>George Eustice, the environment secretary, was asked about the makeup of Sage during Sunday\u2019s Downing Street press conference.</p> \n<p>He said it was \u201cconvened in response to specific emergencies, and the scientists that go on to that group will change, depending on the type of emergency.\u201d He said minutes of its deliberations would eventually be published.</p> \n<p>Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, appearing alongside Eustice, said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d with the names of those who attend being made public, provided their personal permission had been sought. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty has previously said the same thing.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Labour urged the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/bar-dominic-cummings-from-sage-coronavirus-meetings-labour-urges\">to ban political advis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/bar-dominic-cummings-from-sage-coronavirus-meetings-labour-urges\">ers from attending Sage</a>.

We don\u2019t release, as a matter of practice, the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Guardian messsage to whistleblowers\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\">Guardian messsage to whistleblowers</a> \n</figure>",

  "<p>When John Major pulled off a shock election victory in April 1992 there was despair in the Labour party. After four defeats in a row, it seemed as if the Conservatives would be in power for ever.</p> <p>Five months after being reinstalled in Downing Street, Major faced a run on the pound that culminated in Britain\u2019s departure from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. The economy recovered but Major\u2019s political reputation never did.</p> <p>The mood was similarly downbeat in Labour ranks last December, when the party again notched up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win\">fourth straight defeat</a>, and this time by an even bigger margin than in 1992. And for a couple of months following his election triumph Boris Johnson lorded it just as Major had done after seeing off Neil Kinnock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Yet, as then, things have gone downhill fast. The economy went into enforced hibernation in mid-March and is at its nadir this month. Evidence of that will come through in May \u2013 five months after the election.</p> <p>Governments unfortunate enough to be in power when a crisis strikes tend to get the blame. Ted Heath was held responsible for the three-day week in early 1974 and Jim Callaghan was booted out following the 1978-9 Winter of Discontent. Black Wednesday did for Major and Gordon Brown lost power as a result of the banking crisis of 2008.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t really matter that Black Wednesday proved to be a boon to the economy, since leaving the ERM meant the pound and interest could fall; nor that Brown is seen \u2013 by fair-minded observers, at least \u2013 to have handled the global financial crisis well.</p> <p>Johnson will need to go some \u2013 or Labour will need to be truly incompetent \u2013 for this pattern to be broken. This is no ordinary crisis: early indicators suggest that one-in-three private sector employees are either furloughed or have lost their jobs. Three quarters of households have <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/the-economic-effects-of-coronavirus-in-the-uk\">suffered a fall in their incomes</a>. The government will need to sell \u00a3180bn of gilts in the next three months to cover the cost of the economy being in hibernation.</p> <p>This is worse \u2013 far worse \u2013 than anything in recent or, indeed, distant history. <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2020/gertjan-vlieghe-speech-monetary-policy-and-the-boes-balance-sheet\">Jan Vlieghe</a>, one of the members of the Bank of England committee that sets interest rates, said the UK was facing its biggest slump in three centuries.</p> <p>Nor is this going to be over quickly. The need to prevent reinfection means the economy will only come out of lockdown slowly and \u2013 unlike in other countries \u2013 there is no suggestion of when that might start. Failing to take Covid-19 seriously in January and early February, a period when Johnson and his team were effectively winging it \u2013 has proved not just costly but fatal.</p> <p>On the basis of the relative scanty data out there, the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s projection of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">35% fall in output </a>in the second quarter of 2020 looks reasonable. A slightly smaller fall in gross domestic product might occur if parts of the economy reopen in late May and June, but even then in the best case a drop of 25% looks probable.</p> <p>The OBR is also assuming that half the restrictions will be lifted in the third quarter, the rest will go in the fourth quarter, and that there will be no lasting damage done. On that basis, output will be back to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year. This looks far less realistic. For a start, there are already signs that some firms are going bust and that workers are being made redundant, despite government assistance. </p> <p>Moreover, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer has warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-will-need-social-distancing-until-at-least-end-of-year-says-whitty\">social distancing </a>will remain in place until at least the end of the year, and that means large chunks of the economy \u2013 bars and restaurants, for example \u2013 have no chance of being back to business as usual. This recession is far more severe than that of 2008-09 and it will take time for the economy to return to its pre-crisis level. The chances of the UK emerging from this without deep scarring are zero.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s cabinet \u2013 as has been highlighted during his enforced absence due to illness \u2013 is weak: far less impressive than the team of ministers that Major had round him at the time of Black Wednesday. Rishi Sunak has looked competent; the rest have seemed out of their depth.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the things Johnson has got going for him are all diminishing assets. The government may be taking comfort from the fact that the Covid-19 crisis happened within months of the election, leaving plenty of time to put the economy straight. But the effects of this slump are going to be felt for years not months.</p> <p>Nor should ministers assume that public support for the government\u2019s handling of the crisis is going to last. The longer this goes, the longer the list of screw-ups becomes. It is not a good look to be seen as clueless when that cluelessness has cost lives and livelihoods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>All things considered, the government has had an easy ride from the opposition parties, which have been reluctant to be too critical at a time of national emergency. There have been signs in the past couple of weeks that Labour has started to toughen up its stance, with Keir Starmer asking pointed and appropriate questions, such as why was the government slow to respond to the crisis, slow to provide enough tests, slow to provide enough protective gear and slow to come up with an exit strategy.</p> <p>Starmer will never match Johnson for charisma but he is a lawyer who knows how to make a case. So was John Smith, Labour leader at the time of Black Wednesday, and he had a fine old time at Major\u2019s expense.</p>",

What actually happened there?</p> <p>The closed book history of that World Cup quarter-final, an event most people will have watched once, 34 years ago, states that the game was pretty much even. Diego Maradona punched the ball into the net. He scored a wonder-goal from nowhere. Towards the end something freakish happened to stop Gary Lineker heading an equaliser.</p> <p>Jimmy Hill, co-commentating for the BBC in Mexico, announced that Bobby Robson\u2019s team had been \u201cknocked out of the World Cup by an act of blatant cheating\u201d. England were unlucky, derailed by a muscular man in shiny shorts with a Malvinas grudge and a streak of ragged genius.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8049889525d66242fb1bcd704641511079c6b8a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8049889525d66242fb1bcd704641511079c6b8a2/0_0_2040_3072/664.jpg\" alt=\"The teams take to the field of the Azteca Stadium.\" width=\"664\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The teams take to the field of the Azteca Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This version also elides with a broader picture of Argentina\u2019s World Cup win as basically a one-man affair. The players lived in wooden huts in Mexico. They shaved outside, cooked barbecues, horsed around on the bus to the games. How did we lose to this lot? How did we lose a clear chance to <em>actually</em> <em>win the World Cup</em>?</p> <p>At which point: rewind. The Fifa archive film comes in vivid, slightly grainy square-screen. The pictures capture a world that was still pre-modern: cotton shirts, adverts for Camel cigarettes, skinny men in Union Jack shorts frazzling in the midday sun. The players\u2019 heads flash up on screen and you remember how young and handsome Maradona was in those pre-meltdown days. England are in white shirts and light blue shorts.</p> <p>The names of the starting XI are: Pete, Gary, Kenny, Terry, Terry, Trevor, Glenn, Pete, Steve, Pete, Gary. Little wonder that in this company being called \u201cGlenn\u201d could mark you out as a bit of a maverick.</p> <p>England\u2019s pre-tournament first-choice midfield, Bryan and Ray, is absent for this game, one as a result of injury and the other not being recalled after suspension. At which point it is worth dwelling on the mood, the vibe, the outlook. The Madness Of England Football Part 1.</p> <p>In the buildup to Mexico 86 Bryan Robson had written an article in which he revealed that he felt tortured by the famous picture of Bobby Moore lifting the World Cup. When he saw it he wanted to rip it up. This was because England had gone a full 20 years \u2013 imagine! \u2013 without winning the World Cup again. Never mind the fact England had managed to qualify only twice since then. Robson was tortured by the failure to actually win it, something that could still be cast as a transgression against the natural order.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Players barely move off the ball. This is the biggest textural difference. Nobody stands still these days</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But then, four years previously the England World Cup squad had sung \u201cthis time, more than any other time\u201d, a tournament song ode to yearning and missed chances that ignores the fact England had actually won the World Cup just 16 years previously. There had only been 11 World Cups at that stage. England had no right being this upset, this thwarted. This Time is proof of only one thing: that England as a nation is hardwired to see nostalgia and lost sovereignty on every available stage.</p> <p>England football has always been to some degree about scale and loss of scale. Being cheated, not just out of a goal, but out of everything; well this was always going to be an irresistible twist.</p> <p>Back in Mexico, the referee, Ali Bin Nasser, appears on screen, an ambling figure with a range of oddly formal gestures. He\u2019s described by the Fifa commentator as the \u201crelatively inexperienced Tunisian\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cb4a7a10041eae7998f195fa2538e6c0ed3b1a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cb4a7a10041eae7998f195fa2538e6c0ed3b1a2/0_0_1888_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Shilton shakes Diego Maradona\u2019s right hand as the captains swap pennants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Shilton shakes Diego Maradona\u2019s right hand. It was the left he needed to be worried about.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The game kicks off and England pass the ball around slowly at the back. Steve Hodge is kicked to the ground. Kenny Sansom launches a startlingly long, flat throw. And almost immediately everyone looks fried in the midday heat, the players barely moving off the ball. This is the biggest textural difference. Nobody stands still these days.</p> <p>Only Peter Reid is really running around. He dispossesses Maradona, loses his boot and keeps on running. For 15 minutes he\u2019s the best player on the pitch. His opposite number is Sergio Batista, who despite being only 23 has perfected the classic bearded serial killer midfielder look. The crowd noise is an ambient hum through this, with sudden vague hisses of excitement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Does anyone else think Shilton gets away with it a bit?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>England\u2019s full-backs stay very wide. The whole team is arranged in a series of rigid squares. Argentina are more fluid, easier in possession, and more prone to breaking up those tight lines. It takes Maradona 10 minutes to drop deep and play his first high-speed one-two. He beats Sansom twice and is violently hacked down by Terry Fenwick, just back from suspension, and rewarded with his fourth yellow card of the tournament. The free-kick deflects off Glenn Hoddle\u2019s head and Peter Shilton palms it awkwardly over the bar, barely getting off the ground. He looks very small in that moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"189e5af2bb11528adb860be5b3985b95b9ca3f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/189e5af2bb11528adb860be5b3985b95b9ca3f65/0_0_4091_2728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Shilton tips the ball over the bar after a free-kick deflects off Glenn Hoddle\u2019s head.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Shilton tips the ball over the bar after a free-kick deflects off Glenn Hoddle\u2019s head.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Robinson/Empics Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does anyone else think Shilton gets away with it a bit? There was a real sense of English goalkeeping exceptionalism in the 1980s. Our keepers were scowling, nerveless, un-clown-like. They were the Best In The World. But Shilton should probably have caught that ball back from Hodge, the one that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Aged 40, he didn\u2019t get off the ground against West Germany in 1990, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live\" title=\"\">get anywhere near any of those penalties</a>.</p> <p>Maradona pops up on the left and whips in a lovely cross. Thirty minutes gone and we haven\u2019t had a shot. Gary Lineker gets his first touch and is hacked down by Oscar Ruggeri. Jorge Valdano holds the ball well, striding from wing to wing, much more than just a target man. And by now England are under pressure. They can\u2019t really keep the ball. The players are relentlessly committed and forceful in the challenge. But they also kick the ball like they hate it. In possession they run through the same drilled patterns.</p> <p>Does it have to be like this? The Madness of England Football Part 2: for decades the national team played this way as a matter of choice. There is a notion that England looked like a regressive footballing force because they had no plan. But this isn\u2019t true. They did have a plan. They had a bad plan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/15/peter-shilton-respect-diego-maradona-england-hand-of-god\">Peter Shilton: \u2018Maradona\u2019s the greatest player in history but I don\u2019t respect him\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Charles Hughes was the FA\u2019s de facto technical director in 1986. The plan was clear, developed out of the garden-shed direct football data of Wing Commander Charles Reep. This Reep-Hughes ideology stated that direct forward passes were the way to win at football, that set pieces and crosses into the Position of Maximum Opportunity were the dictum, and that players who were willing to deliver this would be selected. It seems odd now that so many influences \u2013 the progressiveness of Bobby Robson, the grace of Hoddle \u2013 could be subsumed by this. But Hoddle was always chafing against the orthodoxy, and England doomed to battle against the limits of their own vision.</p> <p>As half-time approaches Maradona goes to take a corner, removes the flag, and has to literally tie the material back on to the pole himself before the game can continue. The interval arrives as a bit of a relief to everyone. We\u2019ve yet to see a shot on target. But there is a feeling of ascent, of one team playing with the flow.</p> <p>The commentator reminds us England have conceded once in six and a half games. In fact they\u2019ve kept 17 clean sheets in their last 26 games. All of which helps to explain the startling nature of what happens six minutes into the second half.</p> <p>Maradona takes the ball deep on the left side and beats three men with five touches. He veers past Hoddle with ease. Reid and Fenwick just can\u2019t get there. The ball is chipped towards Valdano. At which point Hodge does something odd, skying the ball back on the volley towards his keeper. Shilton is surprised. Maradona is standing in what would have been an offside position. He runs forward and punches the ball into the goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d67fc010c3cc2ef91e493f6fc54b1eb8c29d84f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d67fc010c3cc2ef91e493f6fc54b1eb8c29d84f4/0_0_3045_2039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maradona punches the ball over Shilton to score Argentina\u2019s first\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maradona punches the ball over Shilton to score Argentina\u2019s first.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So many questions. Why didn\u2019t Shilton just clean him out? Why didn\u2019t he take the ball with both hands? Why didn\u2019t the referee or assistant referee see it? In his autobiography Maradona says he was running to the far side screaming for everyone to follow before the referee disallowed it.</p> <p>England are winded by this. Argentina have been the better team, but there\u2019s no doubt the gut-wrench of the first goal has something to do with the brilliance of the second. Suddenly there is space, a relax of air. It takes a genius to do this with it.</p> <p>Let us ponder Maradona for a moment. He is already playing a different kind of game to anyone else in this tournament. Football was a brutal environment. People didn\u2019t dribble and hurdle challenges or try to break the whole game open on their own.</p> <p>Maradona has talked about how he found the right tempo in Italy. He knew if he played at full speed nobody could live with him. But he knew he couldn\u2019t do it all the time, partly because of exhaustion, partly because he\u2019d be kicked to death. How much of this can I cope with, how far can I extend myself? In Mexico he found the perfect timing, the perfect set of rhythms.</p> <p>With 55 minutes gone Maradona takes the ball facing his own goal in his own half to the right of the centre circle. Eleven seconds later it\u2019s in the England net. First he pirouettes away from Peter Beardsley, then he dodges Reid. Reid runs back with him, losing ground. Terry Butcher has charged out to fill the space. Maradona hurdles him. He\u2019s at the edge of the area now. Something is clarifying. He veers past Fenwick, who puts an arm across his throat.</p> <p>He takes a soft, rolled touch with his left foot that puts Shilton off balance. Butcher has got back, but Maradona shifts his feet to block the lunge from behind, then prods the ball into the empty net as the world starts to erupt around him. Argentina\u2019s No 10 has beaten seven challenges and run straight through the middle of all that English muscle, a man playing with a kind of light around him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c9d959071323e6bde8e61586f62700184f04d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c9d959071323e6bde8e61586f62700184f04d29/0_0_2814_1881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maradona evades the tackle from Terry Butcher, rounds Peter Shilton and scores his second.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maradona evades the tackle from Terry Butcher, rounds Peter Shilton and scores his second.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L'Equipe/Offside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To their credit England rally. Beardsley begins to affect the game. Batista is finally booked. Reid is replaced by a pre-mullet Chris Waddle, hair forming a wondrous pomp-rock tangle down his shoulders. Hoddle has a shot. Waddle produces a fine dipping cross with the outside of his boot.</p> <p>Argentina\u2019s players are shouting at each other. And England are finally bringing their version of the game to bear, putting the ball into the box, creating some aerial confusion. At which point, enter John Barnes, who comes on for Trevor Steven.</p> <p>This is not the full Barnes, not yet the player who would illuminate the First Division with Liverpool. But it is also his first appearance of the tournament. Lads, he\u2019s your most talented player. There you go, Barnesey, have 15 minutes. And by the way we\u2019re 2-0 down.</p> <p>Some shithousery has broken out by now. England players are grabbing their opponents and hoisting them to their feet. There are sneaky kicks and trips. Hoddle is furious as Maradona punts the ball away as he stands over a free-kick.</p> <p>Barnes gets his first touch on 79 minutes. A minute later he gets his first pass of the World Cup. He ducks outside, beats his man, gets to the line and crosses. Throughout all this Lineker has kept on making his finely judged runs, playing with wonderful patience. He\u2019s in the perfect spot to head it in, a goal that captures a different kind of brilliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89debaaed26216dc24ccb186154de2affef260fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89debaaed26216dc24ccb186154de2affef260fa/0_0_4086_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Lineker heads home for England from a cross by John Barnes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Lineker heads home a cross by John Barnes, on as a substitute for his first appearance of the tournament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Kidd//Sporting Pictures/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Argentina go back down the other end of the pitch and hit the inside of the post. Maradona takes the ball and waggles his foot over it by the corner flag, waiting for someone to kick him. There are seven minutes to go.</p> <p>Soon after we get the final significant act. Barnes gets his second pass of the tournament. This is how England might have played. Hodge wins the ball from Maradona. Hoddle plays an instant pass. Barnes goes for the line, beats two men and puts a cross to the back post.</p> <p>A while back I asked about what happens next on Twitter. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Lineker just punch the ball into the net, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to reach it?\u201d At which point something very modern happened. \u201cHe did reach it,\u201d a voice interjected, like some unanswerable deus ex machina.</p> <p>The Voice of Football? Jehovah himself? In fact it was Lineker himself, lurking once again in just the right spot. He is of course right. The cross produces an astonishing piece of defending from Julio Olarticoechea, who somehow gets around Lineker just as he makes contact and deflects the ball away. This is what denied England in that moment: not bad luck, but brilliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9504ffbb755620cab8629fd6da53215338f80fce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9504ffbb755620cab8629fd6da53215338f80fce/0_0_2200_1482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julio Olarticoechea denies Lineker an equaliser from another Barnes cross\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julio Olarticoechea denies Lineker an equaliser from another Barnes cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lineker is hurt, dumped into the back of the net. In the stands lads are singing and waving their union flags. Argentina have started to triple-mark Barnes, blue shirts in full panic-defence mode. Imagine if he\u2019d been on for an hour. The final whistle is blown and Argentina\u2019s players bounce around, rejoicing in a moment that isn\u2019t just to do with football.</p> <p>Watching the game back has clarified some things. It\u2019s obvious why England didn\u2019t win the World Cup. They weren\u2019t good enough. Or rather, they were good for 10 minutes and so-so for 80. Argentina may have had a (cheating) genius at the height of his powers. But they also looked a lot more like a modern football team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"451dff82387ec0cee59c7ab5123ccb7f5b380aa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/451dff82387ec0cee59c7ab5123ccb7f5b380aa4/0_0_2424_1591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s fans react after the game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s fans react after the game.

The Madness of English Football Part 3. Bobby Robson took a better team to Italy in 1990. He shifted the formation to suit his players. He trusted his instincts, playing Waddle, Barnes, Lineker, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne in the same XI. England really were a bit unlucky in Turin. They might have had their revenge for the Azteca at the final in Rome. And yet within two years they would be back at Euro 92, managed by an arch-zealot of direct football in Graham Taylor, and producing something that looked almost like a pastiche of that cod-science long-ball island game.</p> <p>England were cheated in Mexico. But nobody was robbed. Destiny wasn\u2019t altered. Something was still being worked through here. And while the dynamic may have changed now, with the arrival of a global top-tier league and the systems-football of the Southgate era, it is also possible to miss that note of variation; the days when England, who thought they were the state of the art, the once and future kings, were still playing a different game altogether.</p>",

Techno-illusionist <a href=\"https://marcotempest.com/en/\" title=\"\">Marco Tempest</a>, a director\u2019s fellow at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, gives magic demonstrations to rapturous audiences of billionaires at places like Davos, using augmented reality and interactive projections in a bid to outpace technology. But the problem is that Tempest\u2019s demonstrations from even five years ago, when he made drones react to his movements or a robot perform simple sleight of hand, now look entirely unremarkable \u2013 already superseded by the automotive dystopias on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics\" title=\"\">Boston Dynamics </a>YouTube channel.</p> <p>\u201cThe technology that comes out is so fascinating and moving at such a rapid pace that it\u2019s so hard to comprehend what is going to be out in the future,\u201d says Dynamo when I ask whether people are more amazed by human magicians or virtual achievements. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any piece of technology out there that is more advanced and can grow more than the human mind. The technology that\u2019s getting developed, it starts off as an idea in someone\u2019s head. And that\u2019s what magic is. It\u2019s taking something that just starts in your mind and bringing it to life.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the magicians that seem to be doing best are those who have moved beyond the idea of illusion in these untrustworthy times. On <em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80190510\" title=\"\">Magic for Humans</a></em> with Justin Willman, a big Netflix show, one of the most interesting tricks is explained in its entirety before it begins. Willman explains that he has hired an audience of stooges for a magic show in a park and then waits for one unsuspecting man to join them, who he picks \u201crandomly\u201d as a volunteer and says he\u2019s going to make him disappear. He doesn\u2019t do anything, just chucks a blanket over his head and pulls it off again, but the fake audience reacts as if he\u2019s gone, so he believes he has. The magic comes in watching a person \u2013 waving in people\u2019s faces and getting no reaction \u2013 believe they have truly become invisible.</p> <p>Even those that once made a living out of can-you-believe-it stunts are moving away from illusion. Brown\u2019s most recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/13/derren-brown-sacrifice\" title=\"\">Netflix special</a> was all about teaching a man who harboured racist views enough empathy to take a bullet for someone of Mexican descent, with Brown relying more on a combination of psychological techniques than showpiece stunts. The final five minutes involved no magic at all, instead letting a moral argument play out between two of his advisers about whether they had a responsibility to resign from the programme if Brown refused to take his own safety seriously. The question of these shows becomes not \u201cHow did he do it?\u201d but \u201cShould he do it?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9090d2974c72df835cd6140d5c52ba40f46ea86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9090d2974c72df835cd6140d5c52ba40f46ea86/0_188_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Streets ahead: Dynamo in a still from his new Beyond Belief series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Streets ahead: Dynamo in a still from his new Beyond Belief series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inner Circle Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/kuhn/\" title=\"\">Gustav Kuhn</a>, a former magician turned psychology professor, has spearheaded examination of magic as a field of science. He\u2019s interested in the places magic, clinical psychology and the modern world overlap. In one recent study, for example, he got a \u201cmedium\u201d to claim they were talking to the dead relatives of an audience of undergraduate students. Using magical trickery, he was able to guess correctly some of the things the students were thinking.</p> <p>\u201cThe sheer number of people, and these are Goldsmiths undergraduates, who believe what they\u2019re seeing is true really shocked me. What\u2019s even more frightening is that even if you tell someone what they\u2019re seeing is a magician who is using deception, they still believe what they are seeing is true. It\u2019s alarming how easily people are led to believe things that are impossible.\u201d</p> <p>This, he says, has a big impact on the way we think about fake news. It\u2019s not merely enough to tell people it isn\u2019t real, to factcheck \u2013 people ignore that information. Only when we are told how a trick is done do we stop believing in it, as the Goldsmiths students eventually were.</p> <p>For Dynamo, the distorted dangers of magic and the jeopardy of real life have become inexorably linked. Just a few years ago it seemed he might never make it to Japan. Having suffered with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/19/bad-gut-feelings-doctors-arent-spotting-crohns-disease\" title=\"\">Crohn\u2019s</a> disease his whole life, in 2014 a complication caused by a bout of food poisoning meant he was hospitalised for months with chronic pain and a series of worsening symptoms, including arthritis that affected every joint in his body and meant even some basic tasks, never mind sleight of hand, were impossible.</p> <p>While we\u2019re waiting for shooting to reset, he tells me that although he experienced \u201cthe worst pain ever\u201d during those months, he never lost focus on magic \u2013 coming up with more than 250 tricks and even learning Japanese from his hospital bed. When he was eventually discharged, he was followed home by paparazzi. He didn\u2019t want photos of him appearing unexplained, so he posted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dynamomagician?lang=en\" title=\"\">video</a> outlining his condition. In it he looked unrecognisable, his face and body bloated and swollen, a result of the medication. But with the help of rehabilitation he was able to relearn the fundamentals of his craft. Now, at 37, he\u2019s finally made it to Japan. When he arrived a few days earlier, he was met by hundreds of screaming fans at the airport, a sign of his global appeal (he\u2019d just come off a 145-date <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/27/dynamo-magician-next-trick-live-tour-interview\" title=\"\">live tour</a>, selling out arenas from Cardiff to Cape Town). Now he says he worries less about the damage trickery can do and thinks more about the hope it can inspire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78f9fd527e9e70fbaa032318786bfd637e3a9c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78f9fd527e9e70fbaa032318786bfd637e3a9c2a/16_215_2487_1491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Blaine crouching in a street and holding up playing cards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kingmaker: David Blaine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donna Svennevik/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was raised in what he describes as \u201cquite a broken home\u201d. His father was in jail for most of his young life. He was close to his mother, but she was only 16 when she had him and was also trying to sort her own life out. He was raised by his grandparents and great- grandparents, but says he mostly spent a lot of time alone, on his Bradford council estate. Once he got to school, he was bullied relentlessly, in part because of his size, but also his father\u2019s Pakistani heritage. \u201cI was beaten up quite a bit, because I went to quite a racist school \u2013 being of mixed background, you know. My mum\u2019s English so a lot of people now wouldn\u2019t necessarily know, but it is kind of obvious. I got a real rough time.\u201d</p> <p>His grandfather\u2019s magic manuals and the comic books he used to collect provided an escape route, and he was drawn by the super-powers he found in them. At that age, the magic of fantasy fiction and the trickery of illusion were hard to distinguish. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a TV licence, but the local video store gave me a VHS player. So I used to watch everything. Back then I didn\u2019t comprehend the difference between a documentary and a movie. So I was watching these superhero movies, believing it was a real-life story. That gave me belief in myself, that I wanted to grow up and be like that when I was older. Before magic, I didn\u2019t know who I needed to be, who society wanted me to be as a person. I didn\u2019t totally feel comfortable being myself, because I didn\u2019t feel that I belonged into any particular group. I felt like an outsider.\u201d</p> <p>Dynamo agrees with Kuhn that magic can be powerful, and that power has to be wielded responsibly. But he sees his own belief in superhero-like powers changed his life, and he wants to create the same effect, especially for young working-class Brits who had an upbringing like his.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what to believe, in this day and age. And whether people want to believe what I\u2019m doing is real magic or skill, it\u2019s totally up to them. But I want to inspire the kid who\u2019s living in Bradford now on a council estate and who feels there\u2019s no opportunity for him. He doesn\u2019t know if the country is going to be in a position to provide for him in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Kuhn is not anti-magic, far from it, but he says we need to understand its power. \u201cThere\u2019s an evolutionary drive for us to explore things we don\u2019t understand. A magician like Dynamo has universal appeal because he\u2019s dealing with these raw psychological experiences.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77765c00bc3ae85cca23d08be66a299b48663856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77765c00bc3ae85cca23d08be66a299b48663856/0_0_2206_1324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pulling the trigger: Derren Brown\u2019s infamous Russian roulette stunt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pulling the trigger: Derren Brown\u2019s infamous Russian roulette stunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following day, we head out of the city to a car show in an old racetrack deep in the suburbs. A huge typhoon hit this area a few days earlier, and the whole event was almost cancelled, but instead they\u2019ve made it free to all, so throughout the day families wander around as very rich Japanese men in their early 20s arrive in souped-up muscle cars, find a spot and pop their bonnets to show their engines and the boots to show their sound systems. You can see why Dynamo chose to film here, it\u2019s real-life <em>Tokyo Drift</em>.</p> <p>As night falls, Dynamo gets ready for the big stunt. First, he gets four of the boy racers to line up and try to push him over \u2013 the four of them should easily be able to topple him, but as hard as they push, Dynamo is able to hold steady. Then he ups the ante and gets one of the guys, who can\u2019t be older than 20, to get in his sports car and floor it with Dynamo standing right in front. The guy starts revving, first a little, then a lot. Dynamo is holding the car back with his bare hands. The wheels are spinning, the air filling with exhaust, but the car isn\u2019t moving. I can feel my heart racing, too. There are little kids everywhere, if it went wrong it would be a disaster. Suddenly, Dynamo jumps out the way and the car zooms to the other end of the lot within seconds.</p> <p>In the past when I\u2019ve watched these shows, I\u2019ve felt uncomfortable \u2013 a good magician is a confidence trickster, someone who makes you believe the impossible. I wonder if there\u2019s really more that differentiates David Blaine and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/01/conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-should-be-banned-from-australia-minister-told\" title=\"\">David Icke</a> than the calibre of the company they keep. Kuhn\u2019s research suggests there might not be.</p> <p>Dynamo has tried to change my mind about that. In his vision, the magician is a leveller whose modus operandi is not to take advantage of their audience, but to bring something seemingly impossible into a world that can often feel mundane. Talking to him about his motivation, seeing his big tricks up close, has certainly nudged me towards this lighter view of the dark arts.</p> <p>But it\u2019s after the trick is over, when Dynamo has left and the cameras are packed away, that I become a true convert. I spot the guy whose car it was. He\u2019s still agog, bent over staring at his own tyres, trying to work out what just happened. At one point he just looks up at the sky, as if the answer might be in the stars. I start to believe in the magic of magic.</p> <p><em>All episodes of Dynamo: Beyond Belief are available on Sky and Now TV</em></p>",
  "<p> The first wild stork chicks to hatch in Britain for centuries are expected to emerge next month after three pairs of the huge white birds built nests in West Sussex.</p> <p>Disdaining platforms constructed especially for them, the storks have created their stick nests in the heights of oak trees on the Knepp estate, the centre for <a href=\"https://www.whitestorkproject.org/\">a reintroduction</a> project.</p> <p>White storks are traditionally thought to bring fertility and good luck but have been extinct as breeding birds in Britain since 1416, or possibly during the English civil war.</p> <p>More than 100 birds have been bred in captivity and released at three locations in West Sussex and Surrey, including Knepp, a 3,500-acre former dairy farm that was rewilded at the turn of the century.</p> <p>Knepp is close to the West Sussex village of Storrington, known as Estorchestone or \u201chomestead of the white storks\u201d in the Domesday Book.</p> <p>Storks are monogamous and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/22/white-storks-could-become-first-to-breed-in-wild-in-uk-for-centuries\">last year a young pair laid three eggs in a tree</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/22/white-storks-could-become-first-to-breed-in-wild-in-uk-for-centuries\">top nest at Knepp</a> but the eggs did not hatch. This year, cameras were rigged up beside this old nest but the couple constructed a new nest instead, in which they have laid five eggs.</p> <p>With four other birds having paired up and made nests, conservationists have high hopes that the first wild-born storks \u2013 which eat insects, earthworms and small mammals \u2013 will hatch and fledge this summer.</p> <p>Lucy Groves, the white stork project officer for <a href=\"https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/\">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, one of the partners in the reintroduction scheme, said: \u201cThe female was just coming up to four years old last spring and was a little bit too young to breed but they obviously know what they are doing this year and were ahead of the game. It\u2019s really exciting. It\u2019s going to be a fantastic year.\u201d</p> <p>The Greeks created the myth that storks deliver newborn babies and nesting pairs herald good luck in numerous European cultures. Reintroduction programmes have successfully returned storks to France, the Netherlands and Poland where wild populations build their towering stick nests in villages and towns.</p> <p>Isabella Tree, the co-owner of Knepp with Charlie Burrell, said: \u201cIt\u2019s so funny. We thought we needed to \u2018manage\u2019 them and put up nest platforms and so we did and they\u2019ve turned their beaks up at all of this \u2013 where they want to nest is in the tops of oaks. That\u2019s where they would\u2019ve nested when they were here centuries ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72b93199524ebe7e99371e81ecf7d99f356b649e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72b93199524ebe7e99371e81ecf7d99f356b649e/376_0_5302_3182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The stork chicks are expected to hatch in mid-May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The stork chicks are expected to hatch in mid-May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TravelMuse/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI love the storks\u2019 association with rebirth and bringing new life. They are such a hopeful symbol for rewilding.\u201d</p> <p>White storks migrate south in the winter and some conservationists initially feared that captive-bred birds released in Britain would be unable to cross the Channel.</p> <p>But 22 of the 24 birds bred in captivity by the Cotswold Wildlife Park and released into West Sussex last summer have migrated south to the Mediterranean and north Africa. Storks are faithful to where they are raised and these birds are expected to return to England when they are ready to breed.</p> <p>More than 100 birds are now living wild and in fenced pens at Knepp and nearby sites in a reintroduction scheme masterminded by Burrell and Tree, who have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/15/the-magical-wilderness-farm-raising-cows-among-the-weeds-at-knepp\">wildlife roar back onto their rewilded farm</a>.</p> <p>Knepp is now a hot spot for endangered species including nightingales, turtle doves and purple emperor butterflies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/01/beavers-uk-estate-owners-reintroduction-conservation-flooding\">Beavers</a> have been reintroduced in the fenced part of the farm, alongside free-roaming cattle and horses that mimic the grazing of extinct herbivores.</p> <p><a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/white-storks\">Some of the storks are fenced in open-top pens</a> to protect them from predators and ensure they bond with their \u201chome\u201d range. The birds can fly out when they are ready and also draw in passing wild birds. The male in Knepp\u2019s first pair is an un-ringed wild bird from continental Europe.</p> <p>The chicks are expected to hatch in mid-May, and take 60 days to grow large enough to fly. The British-born wild storks are likely to fly south for three years or more before returning to England when they are ready to breed.</p> <p>The project aims to have 30 wild pairs of storks by 2030 and can take heart from the successful return of another large white bird \u2013 the crane.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s crane population has reached its highest level for more than 400 years with 56 breeding pairs last summer. Natural recolonisation saw cranes return to east Norfolk in 1979 and reintroduction and conservation efforts led by the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and Pensthorpe Conservation Trust have now returned them to the Somerset Levels, Wales, Scotland and the <a href=\"http://www.humberheadpeatlands.org.uk/\">Humberhead Peatlands</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Philippe Sands, 59, is a professor of law at University College London and a barrister. He appears regularly before the international courts: last year he acted for the prosecution in the Rohingya genocide case at The Hague. His memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/22/east-west-street-origin-genocide-crimes-against-humanity-philippe-sands-review\">East West Street</a></em>, won the 2016 Baillie Gifford prize. His new book, <em>The Ratline</em>, is about an Austrian Nazi, Otto von W\u00e4chter, and his wife, Charlotte, who helped him to evade justice when he went on the run in 1945.</p> <p><strong>How is</strong><strong> </strong><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> connected to </strong><em><strong>East West Street</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>In 2010 I went to Lviv, in Ukraine, to give a lecture. That led to <em>East West Street</em>. It was supposed to be about my grandfather, Leon, who grew up there, and Hersch Lauterpacht and Rafael Lemkin [also from Lviv], the jurists who put the terms \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d into international law. But then Hans Frank came into it: the governor of German-occupied Poland, who was hanged at Nuremberg. Following a speech he gave in Lviv, the Jews of the region known as Galicia [Lviv was its capital] were exterminated. I came across a book by Frank\u2019s son, Niklas. We met and became friends, and he introduced me to Horst, the son of Otto von W\u00e4chter, who was the Nazi governor of Lviv from 1942-1944 and Frank\u2019s deputy. Niklas hates his father; Horst doesn\u2019t. I made a documentary about them, then<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06lh2b5\"> a podcast</a> about Otto, and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2020/apr/18/i-was-a-nazi-boy-then-everything-was-gone-philippe-sands-the-ratline-audio-extract\">this book</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> is very different from </strong><em><strong>East West Street</strong></em><strong>, isn\u2019t it? The reader is horrified, but </strong><strong>also gripped; at times, it\u2019s</strong><strong> like a thriller.<br></strong>Yes, and that was the source of bother. I\u2019m really fond of Horst, but he also upsets me [by defending Otto]. I would think: why am I putting myself through this? Then there\u2019s Charlotte. She fascinates me. She\u2019s a Nazi, but what she does for Otto is incredible; there\u2019s something almost beautiful about it. Until May, 1945, he\u2019s pulling all the strings \u2013 then, with one snap of a finger, the power balance is changed. He needs her absolutely.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He did monstrous things, but he was also a father, a lover, a husband, a highly cultured man</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How has Horst reacted to </strong><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>He hasn\u2019t read it yet. He\u2019ll be upset. But other Von W\u00e4chters have already come out of the woodwork. One begged me not to publish; another asked me to forgive Otto. A book like this is worrying to them in terms of their reputation, particularly in the context of Austria, which has not come to terms with the war as Germany has. They think some things are best not talked about.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s remarkable is the way that you show Otto in the round.<br></strong>Yes. It\u2019s unhelpful to describe these men as monsters. He did monstrous things, but he was also a father, a lover, a husband, a highly cultured man. One scene that stays with me is in 1942, when the worst killing is going on. At the weekend, he\u2019s going boating. How do you do it? How do you round people up and murder them, then go home and, say, listen to an opera? This is the question, to which there\u2019s no satisfactory answer.</p> <p><strong>Has writing </strong><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> brought you closer to understanding where such antisemitism comes from?<br></strong>Otto\u2019s is easier to account for. It comes through his dad, a German nationalist: the idea that in Vienna there are all these Jews from the east coming in. But Charlotte was from a little town. There were only 27 Jews there; her family were magnates, not downtrodden. The Catholic church played a role, and I suspect there was also a deep-seated fear of Bolshevism, which was considered a Jewish idea.</p> <p><strong>Is anti</strong><strong>semitism on the rise again? Are there parallels to be made?<br></strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rampant in Britain. It\u2019s there on the far left, and the far right \u2013 and plainly, under Jeremy Corbyn, things were allowed to happen in the Labour party that shouldn\u2019t have. But in Europe, there\u2019s no question it is. The tropes in places like Hungary are very clear.</p> <p><strong>Are you frightened? Can it be stopped?<br></strong>I don\u2019t think history repeats itself, but nor does it learn. You get variations on a theme. When the coronavirus crisis is over, nationalism could be rampant. Or we could remember the lessons of the 30s; that the only way out of recession is via global solidarity and trade. Either way, we need to pay attention. Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/viktor-orban-ditches-mayor-plan-amid-claims-of-coronavirus-power-grab\">new laws in Hungary</a> are unparalleled in Europe. He can rule open-endedly by decree. Let\u2019s consider our own emergency legislation. Yes, it must be reviewed by parliament in six months. But who would have thought that in 2020 we\u2019d have a situation where people over 70 are told they can\u2019t leave the house? How much of a leap is it from that to: OK, we\u2019re going to place the elderly in \u201csafe areas\u201d? To care-home ghettoes?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/18/on-the-trail-of-a-nazi-war-criminal-its-my-duty-as-a-son-to-find-the-good-in-my-father\">On the trail of a Nazi war criminal: 'It's my duty as a son to find the good in my father'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Four million Jews died in Galicia, including your grandfather\u2019s family, yet when Horst tries to defend his father, you remain so calm, so dispassionate.

But I strip the emotion out of my sentences. It\u2019s 30 years of training and the practice of the golden rule of not showing your feelings in court.</p> <p><strong>What difference has </strong><em><strong>East West Street</strong></em><strong>, and everything that has followed from that trip to Lviv, made to your life?<br></strong>It has made the past easier. The war was a dark hole that no one talked about. I think it has made my mum\u2019s life easier, too [his mother, Ruth, was carried as a baby to safety in Paris from Vienna in the arms of a stranger whose identity he was able to discover].</p> <p><strong>Do you know what you\u2019ll write next?<br></strong>Yes, and you couldn\u2019t make it up. There\u2019s a character in <em>The Ratline</em>: a Nazi who escapes to Syria, and then to Chile. He worked for General Pinochet\u2019s interrogation service. The book is about his connection to the events that later catalyse Pinochet\u2019s arrest in London, a case in which I was involved as a lawyer.</p> <p><em>The Ratline: Love, Lies and Justice on the Trail of a Nazi Fugitive by Philippe Sands is published by <a href=\"https://www.weidenfeldandnicolson.co.uk/titles/philippe-sands/the-ratline/9781474608152/\">Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson</a> (\u00a320)</em></p>",
  "<p>For those too young to remember, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/18/how-we-made-men-behaving-badly\">Men Behaving Badly</a></em> was a light-hearted 1990s British and American sitcom about silly blokes doing stupid things. Covid-19 has revived the storyline. But now it\u2019s not so funny.</p> <p>Around the world, authoritarian leaders are exploiting, exacerbating or grossly mishandling the response to the pandemic, placing selfish interest ahead of public good.</p> <p>They are mostly male. Their behaviour is frequently appalling. Unlike harmless Gary and Tony, they are a modern incarnation of TS Eliot\u2019s \u201chollow men\u201d.</p> <p>Sex is relevant, in that female leaders are generally thought to be <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/493434-countries-led-by-women-have-fared-better-against\">behaving better</a>. Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern, and Taiwan\u2019s Tsai Ing-wen are among competent and compassionate women singled out for praise.</p> <p>Yet do the worst-performing leaders share dysfunctional characteristics beyond mere maleness? A war fixation is one. Poverty of imagination is another. They routinely trot out tired martial metaphors and cliches such as \u201cwartime president\u201d, \u201cblitz spirit\u201d, and \u201cfighting the invisible enemy\u201d.</p> <p>Lack of empathy also seems to be a common denominator, even among self-styled \u201cman of the people\u201d populists. This may be a product of class, culture or elite upbringing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcaf9f1a68e950e6914de9a1609eb852b3ffda89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcaf9f1a68e950e6914de9a1609eb852b3ffda89/0_116_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to the media.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has been praised for her leadership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A more decisive factor is a man\u2019s political orientation. Broadly speaking, illiberal leaders who run authoritarian regimes, refuse democratic and legal constraints, abuse civil and women\u2019s rights, reject media scrutiny, tolerate corruption, and believe that they, personally, know best are the worst-behaved, least effective pandemic performers.</p> <p>Donald Trump ticks all the boxes. He is the Covid champ of chumps. His advice last week to inject disinfectant hit new heights of toxic idiocy, even for him. But there are plenty of challengers for the world title.</p> <p>Take Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s \u201cstrongman\u201d president. His initial response to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/turkeys-covid-19-infection-rate-rising-fastest-in-the-world\">growing Covid-19 threat</a> was to put the economy before lives. Erdogan is accused, like Trump, of politicising the crisis, for example by banning fundraising efforts by opposition-controlled city councils in Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara. The impressive performance of Istanbul\u2019s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a possible 2023 presidential rival, is said to worry him more than the disease.</p> <p>Rushed curfews and protective measures have caused confusion and panic-buying. And Erdogan fumbled a chance to foster unity of purpose when an early release of prisoners excluded jailed political opponents, journalists and human rights activists.<br><br>The world expects better of Turkey. In the Philippines, the macho antics of Rodrigo Duterte, a president notorious for celebrating extrajudicial murder, are par for the course. Like right-wingers elsewhere, Duterte minimised the Covid-19 threat, then over-reacted.</p> <p>A typically heavy-handed clampdown has followed belated lockdown measures. Duterte ordered the police and military to kill those who did not comply. \u201cShoot them dead,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/poverty-punished-philippines-tough-virus-pandemic-200413063921536.html\">he urged</a>. \u201cInstead of causing trouble, I\u2019ll send you to the grave.\u201d</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s assumption of emergency powers mirrors power-grabs in other countries with weak systems of democratic accountability. Hungary\u2019s rightwing populist leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, says his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">new power to rule indefinitely</a> by decree can be revoked any time. Opponents fear a tame parliament may never do so.</p> <p>Some of the world\u2019s most authoritarian leaders have reacted with a morbid mix of crass irresponsibility and calculation. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/20/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-denialism-fire-mandetta-mourao-wont-hurt-him/\">appears to hope</a>, Trump-like, that he can turn the poor\u2019s hostility to job-destroying lockdowns to political advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6660836db4c2e7e136a4dab7c3165663591b400b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6660836db4c2e7e136a4dab7c3165663591b400b/0_0_3203_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police check the temperature of motorcyclists in Manila on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police check the temperature of motorcyclists in Manila on Friday.

If Brazil\u2019s economy implodes, Bolsonaro, weirdly, could be the gainer \u2013 unless he is impeached first.</p> <p>China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is also using the pandemic for political ends, as evidenced by the opportunistic arrest last week of 15 veteran Hong Kong pro-democracy figures. Virus-related security and economic fears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">are being exploited</a> to justify an ever tighter crackdown after last year\u2019s failure to halt anti-Beijing protests.<br><br>But the hard men are not having it all their own way. Xi\u2019s carefully nurtured reputation for quasi-celestial infallibility has taken a knock in the wake of the Wuhan disaster. The shine is also coming off India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi.</p> <p>Modi seemed to carry all before him last year, especially following the Kashmir crackdown. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">brutal anti-Muslim pogrom</a> in Delhi barely dented his domestic standing. But self-inflicted economic and social damage arising from clumsy, chaotic anti-virus measures are painting a less flattering portrait of incompetence and irrelevance.<br><br>Likewise the credibility of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who specialises in exporting lethal germs, is in question after a slow start to the fightback.</p> <p>Shielding himself from harm, he-man Putin <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/20/russias-coronavirus-outbreak-why-it-could-be-bad-news-for-president-putin.html\">looks on impotently</a> as Russia\u2019s coronavirus caseload spirals upwards and the global oil price, key source of Kremlin cash, goes the other way.<br><br>In contrast, the pandemic has saved Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, from deserved oblivion. After a third, inconclusive election, and with a corruption trial looming, Netanyahu looked dead and buried. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/netanyahu-and-gantz-agree-to-form-unity-israeli-government\">His resurrection</a> is largely due to unscrupulous use of the virus threat as a national rallying cause.<br><br>Faced by all this bad behaviour, despair is an option. As Eliot wrote in<em> </em>The Hollow Men, \u201cThis is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but with a whimper\u201d. And yet, perhaps not.</p> <p>Progressives can take comfort from the way autocrats and rightwing populists have mostly flunked the Covid-19 challenge. Maybe people around the world, shocked by all the high-handed bungling, will begin to resist and reverse the recent trend towards authoritarianism.</p> <p>It would be reassuring to think so. On the whole, democracies have behaved better during the crisis. But the UK and US responses have been dismal. Maybe that\u2019s because, in both cases, a certain kind of shallow, arrogant man is in charge.</p>",
  "<p>When eventually the coronavirus crisis begins to recede and we return to an approximation of normality \u2013 no matter how socially distanced or how much handwashing it involves \u2013 we can expect some kind of international initiative to prevent, or at least limit, the spread of future lethal viruses. As a species we are pretty good at learning from recent experience. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as the availability heuristic \u2013 the tendency to estimate the likelihood of an event based on our ability to recall examples.</p> <p>But as the moral philosopher <a href=\"http://www.tobyord.com/\">Toby Ord</a> argues in his new book, <em><a href=\"http://www.tobyord.com/book\">The Precipice</a></em>, we are much less adept at anticipating potential catastrophes that have no precedent in living memory. \u201cEven when experts estimate a significant probability for an unprecedented event,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe have great difficulty believing it until we see it.\u201d</p> <p>This was precisely the problem with the coronavirus. Many informed scientists predicted that a global epidemic was almost certain to break out at some point in the near future. Aside from the warnings of legions of virologists and epidemiologists, the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, gave a widely disseminated Ted Talk in 2015 in which he detailed the threat of a killer virus. For a while now, a pandemic has been one of the two most prominent catastrophic threats in the government\u2019s risk register (the other is a massive cyberattack).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"260\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bill Gates\u2019s 2015 Ted talk outlined the pandemic threat.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But if something hasn\u2019t yet happened, there is a deep-seated temptation to act as if it\u2019s not going to happen. If that is true of an event, like this pandemic, that will kill only a tiny fraction of the world\u2019s population, it\u2019s even more the case for what are known as existential threats. There are two definitions of existential threat, though they often amount to the same thing. One is something that will bring a total end to humanity, remove us as a species from this planet or any other. The other, only slightly less troubling, is something that leads to an irrevocable collapse of civilisation, reducing surviving humanity to a prehistoric state of existence.</p> <p>An Australian based at Oxford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a>, Ord is one of a tiny number of academics working in the field of existential risk assessment. It\u2019s a discipline that takes in everything from stellar explosions right down to rogue microbes, from supervolcanoes to artificial superintelligence.</p> <p>Ord works through each potential threat and examines the likelihood of it occurring in the next century. For example, the probability of a supernova causing a catastrophe on Earth he estimates to be less than one in 50m. Even adding all the naturally occurring risks together (which includes naturally occurring viruses), Ord contends that they do not amount to the existential risk presented individually by nuclear war or global heating.</p> <p>Most of the time, the general public, governments and other academics are largely content to neglect most of these risks. Few of us, after all, enjoy contemplating the apocalypse.</p> <p>In any case, governments, as former Conservative minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\">Oliver Letwin</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\"> reminds us in his recent book </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\">Apocalypse </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\">How?</a></em>, are usually preoccupied with more pressing issues than humanity\u2019s demise. Everyday problems like trade agreements demand urgent attention, whereas hypothetical future ones such as being taken over by machines can always be left for tomorrow.</p> <p>But given that we\u2019re living through a global pandemic, now is perhaps an opportune moment to think about what can be done to avoid a future cataclysm. According to Ord, the period we inhabit is a critical moment in the history of humanity. Not only are there the potentially disastrous effects of global heating but in the nuclear age we also possess the power to destroy ourselves in a flash \u2013 or to at least leave the question of civilisation\u2019s survival in the balance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66f2459dfa757a880f139e1002663ec1a75f02b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66f2459dfa757a880f139e1002663ec1a75f02b9/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A health worker waits to accept an Ebola patient in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A health worker waits to accept an Ebola patient in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2018.

If we make the right decisions, he foresees a future of unimaginable flourishing. If we make the wrong ones, he maintains that we could well go the way of the dodo and the dinosaurs, exiting the planet for good.</p> <p>When I speak to Ord over Skype I remind him of the unsettling odds he awards humanity in this life-and-death struggle between our power and our wisdom. \u201cGiven everything I know,\u201d he writes, \u201cI put the existential risk this century at around one in six.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, the 21st century is effectively one giant game of Russian roulette. Many people will recoil from such a grim prediction, while for others it will fuel the anxiety that is already rife in society.</p> <p>He agrees but says that he has tried to present his modelling in as calm and rational a fashion as possible, making sure to take into account all the evidence that suggests the risks are not large. One in six is his best estimate, factoring in that we make a \u201cdecent stab\u201d at dealing with the threat of our destruction.</p> <p>If we really put our minds to it and mount a response equal to the threat, the odds, he says, come down to something more like 100-1 for our extinction. But, equally, if we carry on ignoring the threat represented by advances in areas like biotech and artificial intelligence, then the risk, he says, \u201cwould be more like one in three\u201d.</p> <p>Martin Rees, the cosmologist and former president of the Royal Society, co-founded the <a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/\">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</a> in Cambridge. He has long been involved in raising awareness of looming disasters and he echoes Ord\u2019s concern.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/18/martin-rees-astronomer-royal-interview-brexit\">Martin Rees: \u2018Climate change is a doddle compared with terraforming Mars\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d he says, \u201csimply because our world is so interconnected, that the magnitude of the worst potential catastrophes has grown unprecedentedly large, and too many have been in denial about them. We ignore the wise maxim \u2018the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Letwin warns of an overdependence on the internet and satellite systems, allied with limited stocks of goods and long supply chains. These are ideal conditions for sabotage and global breakdown. As he writes, ominously: \u201cThe time has come to recognise that more and more parts of our lives \u2013 of society itself \u2013 depend on fewer and fewer, more integrated networks.\u201d</p> <p>Complex global networks certainly increase our vulnerability to viral pandemics and cyberattacks, but neither of those outcomes qualify as a serious existential risk in Ord\u2019s book. The pandemics he is concerned about are not of the kind that break out in the wet markets of Wuhan, but rather those engineered in biological laboratories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13ee69bd2fffeb5afd1f2b1cc6d058e3597887bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13ee69bd2fffeb5afd1f2b1cc6d058e3597887bb/0_0_5378_3585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire surrounded by floodwater in February this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire surrounded by floodwater in February this year. The increased frequency of floods is thought to be connected to global heating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Ord draws a distinction between natural and anthropogenic (human-made) risks, he argues that this line is rather blurry when it comes to pathogens, because their proliferation has been significantly increased by human activity such as farming, transport, complex trade links and our congregation in dense cities.</p> <p>Yet like so many aspects of existential threat, the idea of an engineered pathogen seems too sci-fi, too far-fetched, to grab our attention for long. The international body charged with policing bioweapons is the Biological Weapons Convention. Its annual budget is just \u20ac1.4m (\u00a31.2m). As Ord points out with due derision, that sum is less than the turnover of the average McDonald\u2019s restaurant.</p> <p>If that\u2019s food for thought, Ord has another gastronomic comparison that\u2019s even harder to swallow. While he\u2019s not sure exactly how much the world invests in measuring existential risk, he\u2019s confident, he writes, that we spend \u201cmore on ice-cream every year than on ensuring that the technologies we develop don\u2019t destroy us\u201d.</p> <p>Ord insists that he is not a pessimist. There are constructive measures to be taken. Humanity, he says, is in its adolescence, and like a teenager that has the physical strength of an adult but lacks foresight and patience, we are a danger to ourselves until we mature. He recommends that, in the meantime, we slow the pace of technological development so as to allow our understanding of its implications to catch up and to build a more advanced moral appreciation of our plight.</p> <p>He is, after all, a moral philosopher. This is why he argues that it\u2019s vital that, if humanity is to survive, we need a much larger frame of reference for what is right and good. At the moment we hugely undervalue the future, and have little moral grasp of how our actions may affect the thousands of generations that could \u2013 or alternatively, might not \u2013 come after us.</p> <p>Our descendants, he says, are in the position of colonised peoples: they\u2019re politically disenfranchised, with no say in the decisions being made that will directly affect them or stop them from existing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given everything I know, I put the existential risk this century at around one in six</p> <footer> <cite>Toby Ord</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cJust because they can\u2019t vote,\u201d he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be represented.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, there are also concrete issues to address such as global heating and environmental depredation. Ord acknowledges that climate change may lead to \u201ca global calamity of unprecedented scale\u201d, but he\u2019s not convinced that it represents an actual existential risk to humanity (or civilisation). That\u2019s not to say that it isn\u2019t an urgent concern: only that our survival isn\u2019t yet on the line.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest immediate threat is the continued abundance of nuclear weapons. Since the end of the cold war, the arms race has been reversed and the number of active warheads cut from more than 70,000 in the 1980s to about 3,750 today. Start (the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which was instrumental in bringing about the decrease, is due to lapse next year. \u201cFrom what I hear at the moment,\u201d says Ord, \u201cthe Russians and Americans have no plan to renew it, which is insane.\u201d</p> <p>Sooner or later all questions of existential risk come down to a global understanding and agreements. That\u2019s problematic, because while our economic systems are international, our political systems remain almost entirely national or federal. Problems that affect everyone are consequently owned by no one in particular. If humanity is to step back from the precipice, it will have to learn how to recognise its common bonds as greater than its differences.</p> <p>There are many predictions currently being made about how the world might be changed by the coronavirus. The philosopher John Gray recently declared that it spelt the end of hyperglobalisation and the reassertion of the importance of the nation state.</p> <p>\u201cContrary to the progressive mantra,\u201d Gray <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/04/why-crisis-turning-point-history\">wrote in an essay</a>, \u201cglobal problems do not always have global solutions\u2026 the belief that this crisis can be solved by an unprecedented outbreak of international cooperation is magical thinking in its purest form.\u201d</p> <p>But nor can individual countries afford to turn their backs on the world, at least not for long. The pandemic may not engender deeper international cooperation and a keener appreciation of the fact that we are, so to speak, all in it together. Ultimately, though, we will have to arrive at that kind of unity if we\u2019re to avoid far greater afflictions in the future.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Precipice</em> by Toby Ord is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a325).

  "<p>I heard the first cuckoo on Wednesday evening. I was outside the back door splitting logs when the song floated down from the copse on Bryn Arw, the hill behind our house in the Black Mountains. Cuckoos have been coming to the same copse for as long as we have lived here and I have always written down the date of their arrival from Africa. It is an important moment in the turning year, as the lyrics to the traditional medieval round attest: \u201cSumer is icumen in/ Lhude sing cuccu.\u201d</p> <p>My recordings of cuckoos have always been haphazard, though. Some years, because the weather is dreadful or I am working hard and chained to a desk, I fail to get outside. I might first hear<a href=\"https://www.xeno-canto.org/37447\"> the male\u2019s distinctive song</a>, which gives the bird its onomatopoeic name, days after his actual arrival.</p> <p>Other years, I have been abroad for work. This year, however, I have the correct date. There is no doubt, since every evening for the past four weeks I have been in the garden \u2013 weeding the vegetable patch, painting a bench, splitting alder logs and, on occasion, sitting in a chair looking up the hill with pricked ears, waiting for him. The cuckoo arrived on 22 April and I wrote it down in my notebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4b5b2822bea8e86a11aa50aedf8bec8e252edf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4b5b2822bea8e86a11aa50aedf8bec8e252edf3/0_208_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacked alder logs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacked alder logs, with dandelions and lesser celandines in the foreground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Penn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Observing the changing seasons is a fascination as old as the seasons themselves. There is a strange satisfaction in knowing that the arrival of the first cuckoo, with its gratifying intimations of summer round the corner, is a pleasure we partake in with people who lived hundreds and, presumably, thousands of years ago.</p> <p>The first person to actually write down the times of the recurring natural phenomena that mark spring\u2019s arrival was Robert Marsham, a Norfolk squire. In 1736, he recorded the first swallow, the dates different trees came into leaf, first flowering or blossoming dates, first time he heard frogs croaking and rooks nesting, first appearance of butterflies and the earliest singing of the cuckoo. In all, he recorded 27 seasonal occurrences in what he called his \u201cIndications of Spring\u201d.</p> <p>He maintained <a href=\"https://www.robertmarsham.co.uk/about-robert-marsham/indications-of-spring/\">this record</a>, without interruption, for more than 60 years. It became his life\u2019s work. More remarkably still, successive generations of his family continued the record \u2013 until 1958. The field of study the Marshams effectively invented is called phenology.</p> <p>I am no phenologist. This spring, though, I have become a keen and patient student of nature, with notebook in hand. For the first time in my adult life, I have the hours to sensitively bear witness to the delicate, daily changes. And I have taken the trouble to record them, like Marsham. In our small wood, I have observed the succession of wild flowers, all eager for their moment in the sun before the tree canopy closes over them. The sequence started in early March with lesser celandines and, a few days later, primroses; then came sweet violets, wild daffodils, wood anemones and greater stitchwort, in that order; next, yellow archangel flowered by the stream; last week, red campion, garlic-scented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/apr/23/seasons-eatings-wild-garlic\">ransoms</a> and bluebells, the wild flower that has the power of Prozac on the British collective consciousness, all bloomed. They have been entered in the notebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bad77cbcd7219be6ada61580ec0669797ee05de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bad77cbcd7219be6ada61580ec0669797ee05de/0_289_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sessile oaks coming into leaf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sessile oaks are leafing as I write.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Penn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, there are entries about the progression of leafing trees. Elder and horse chestnut were first, in mid-March. Sycamore, then hawthorn, rowan, silver birch and pedunculate oak followed. Beech, field maple and sessile oak are all leafing as I write. I have logged the conspicuous unfurling of the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/country-diary-harts-tongue-ferns-thrive-in-the-gloom-otley-west-yorkshire\">hart\u2019s tongue fern</a> and the first broad buckler fern.</p> <p>The first brimstone and orange tip butterflies are logged. The arrivals of pied flycatchers and willow warblers from sub-Saharan Africa are accounted for. Damson and wild cherry blossom, dandelions, daisies, wasps, red mason bees, nest-building blue tits and song thrushes are all minuted. There are even notes on the time it takes for the alder I have been splitting to oxidise; the process turns the exposed wood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/country-diary-a-chainsaw-massacre-in-the-alder-woods\">a rich orange colour</a>.</p> <p>In fact, keeping a nature diary is beginning to feel like a chore and I\u2019m still not sure why I am doing it.</p> <p>Gilbert White, the best-known nature diarist of the 18th century and a correspondent of Marsham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/11/gilbert-white-fourth-most-published-book-in-english-language-natural-history-and-antiquities-of-selborne-to-go-online\">published </a><em>The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</em>, in 1789, as a weapon in the fight against the \u201csuperstitious prejudices\u201d held by the \u201clower people\u201d of his district in Hampshire.</p> <p>White, like his brother-in-law, Thomas Barker, who kept a punctilious weather diary for six decades, and Marsham, were part of a new breed of amateur naturalists that emerged towards the end of the Enlightenment era. Keeping a journal became the prevailing method of reducing weather and the natural world to a definitive system.</p> <p>Today, phenology is even more important than when White and Marsham lived, because of the insight it provides into the effects of climate change. The largest phenology database, part of a project called <a href=\"https://naturescalendar.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\">Nature\u2019s Calendar</a>, is held by the Woodland Trust. Thousands of people add their own recordings to the website every year and the data is used in academic research.</p> <p>I may add my observations to the database, but citizen science is not the main reason why, this year, I am observing nature with the methodology of an 18th-century country parson. Rather, I am trying to comprehend events by ordering what is around me. As William Faulkner said: \u201cTo understand the world, you must first understand a place.\u201d His place was Mississippi, mine is the Black Mountains.</p> <p>Observing the changing seasons in a diary is also an internally imposed discipline, a form of spiritual self-monitoring, while the storm rages elsewhere. How long the diary will last into summer, I can\u2019t yet tell. For now though, pen poised, I am waiting for the first swallow.</p> <p><em>Rob Penn is the author of </em>The Man Who Made Things Out of Trees</p>",

In lieu of going to bars, pubs or clubs, Britons would be staying in \u2013 and whiling away our time on TikTok.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Madeline Mai-Davis on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@maddiedavies.x/video/6808242769916595461&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6808242769916595461&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@maddiedavies.x&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@maddiedavies.x&quot;&gt;@maddiedavies.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next door neighbour trying hard not to get caught whilst on lockdown... &lt;a title=&quot;foryou&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou&quot;&gt;##foryou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;fyp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp&quot;&gt;##fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryoupage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage&quot;&gt;##foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;viral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viral&quot;&gt;##viral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;tiktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktok&quot;&gt;##tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryoupagethis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupagethis&quot;&gt;##foryoupagethis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;safehands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/safehands&quot;&gt;##safehands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;4u&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/4u&quot;&gt;##4u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c original sound - maddiedavies.x&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6808233740066622213&quot;&gt;\u266c original sound - maddiedavies.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I keep asking 18-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGYpWK/\">Madeline Mai-Davies</a> what it\u2019s like to be an overnight TikTok celebrity, but all she can do is rattle off numbers for me. \u201cSo the bush-man video went viral on 16.5m views,\u201d Mai-Davies says giddily, \u201cand the video where I pretended to surprise my boyfriend naked, now that\u2019s got 12.5m views.\u201d</p> <p>After joining TikTok just six days ago, the unemployed waitress from Stevenage \u2013 like almost everyone else in the hospitality sector, coronavirus cost Mai-Davies her job \u2013 has 210,000 followers. In less time than it takes for a banana to go brown, she has accrued an online following double the circulation of some national newspapers. How does she feel? \u201cTo be fair, it has been a headfuck,\u201d she responds, before reeling off more figures.</p> <p>Mai-Davies became a TikTok influencer after a video she posted of her boyfriend pretending to break the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 by creeping down their road in a grass-covered costume \u2013 went viral. (At the time of writing, it had 1.6m views.) Sudden fame has left Mai-Davies punch-drunk on her own celebrity. \u201c<em>This Morning</em> got in contact with me,\u201d she says breathlessly. \u201cThey want me to FaceTime Holly and Phil. We\u2019ve been in hundreds of articles in 20 different counties.\u201d</p> <p>Becoming a TikTok influencer is now a viable career. \u201cI want to be a content creator and make people laugh,\u201d says 24-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsT2WV/\">Akafi Ali</a>, from London. Ali quit his job as a Sainsbury\u2019s cashier to pursue his TikTok dream: his videos satirise Somali culture or feature Ali on caterwauling form. \u201cEveryone is going to the supermarket to grab toilet rolls!\u201d Ali says in one video. \u201cAre you serious? Just wash your ass!\u201d</p> <p>Ali says TikTok was already popular before coronavirus, but that the lockdown has supercharged it. \u201cThere are a lot more people jumping on,\u201d he says. With this influx of new influencers comes competition. \u201cBefore, if you uploaded a video, you could easily get 100,000 views in the first hour,\u201d says Ali. \u201cBut now you don\u2019t get on the For You page as easily as before.\u201d (For You is the landing page on TikTok, tailored to users\u2019 interests.)</p> <p>Mai-Davies also plans to give the TikTok influencer thing a go and is posting daily videos. \u201cWhen I go to bed, I think about ideas for tomorrow\u2019s video,\u201d she says. She tells me that some young girls have set up a fan page about her on Instagram. \u201cThey write, \u2018I love her so much, she\u2019s my Queen,\u2019\u201d she says. She sounds bemused. \u201cThis is so crazy. How have I got a fan page?\u201d</p> <p>The most important thing to understand about TikTok is that it is anarchic: it has no internal logic or guiding principle. Many TikTok videos are absurdist jokes. People surprise family members, impersonate celebrities or set up elaborate punchlines. The platform frequently has the surreal quality of a fever dream: videos riff on arcane internet ephemera or make nonsensical jokes. Non-sequiturs are common. Creativity is paramount.</p> <p>\u201cSurrealism is embedded into the DNA of the internet,\u201d says Kenneth Goldsmith, author of <em>Wasting Time on the Internet</em>. He sees TikTok\u2019s popularity as a natural reaction to the oppressive mania of a global lockdown \u2013 it is a pressure valve for people cooped up indoors. \u201cThe only response to an existential situation is absurdity and humour,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cIt brings us back to the darker side of surrealism.\u201d</p> <p>On Instagram, we are primped and preening, on Twitter, loudmouthed and strident, but on TikTok, we can just be weird. Which makes it the perfect platform to ride out a pandemic that has nearly one-third of the world\u2019s population trapped at home. \u201cIt\u2019s therapeutic,\u201d Goldsmith explains. \u201cIf we look at Freud\u2019s theorising of the joke, the joke is always about showing humour in the face of death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of embarrassed by it,\u201d says <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGNWao/\">John Palmer</a> of his TikTok account. The 17-year-old, from County Durham, specialises in the sort of hyper-surreal videos you\u2019d expect to jump into through a chalk pavement drawing \u2013 if Mary Poppins used TikTok. Typically, Palmer\u2019s videos refer to popular memes or obscure internet jokes.</p> <p>In one video, Palmer rips a much-memed Michelle Obama soundbite to make a joke about Prince William using coronavirus to leapfrog Charles in the line of succession. In another, he pretends to talk to the squadron of imaginary friends he\u2019s made in self-isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of about finding the template, but pushing the meme as far as it will go, making it weirder and weirder, until it gets to a point where it doesn\u2019t make sense unless you\u2019ve seen everything else before,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt spirals down into something else.\u201d</p> <p>This is TikTok as pure subculture: in order to participate at Palmer\u2019s level, you need to have swum through digital water since childhood, a graceful stroke through each platform \u2013 Facebook, Vine, Instagram \u2013 that is easy and assured. There is no need for gatekeepers: the price of admission to this subculture is simply understanding the joke. \u201cI show it to my parents and they don\u2019t get it,\u201d Palmer explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the meme culture of Gen Z. There\u2019s so much background to memes. You need to have lived through them.\u201d</p> <p>As a TikTok old timer, Palmer is mortified by the platform\u2019s exploding popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to all of the adults discovering TikTok,\u201d he says with a sigh.</p> <p>There\u2019s a simple reason why people are flocking to TikTok: it\u2019s a superb time waster. And in lieu of freedom or gainful employment, right now the only thing the British public has in abundance is time to burn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Rachel Leary on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@rachleary/video/6807502301582871814&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6807502301582871814&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@rachleary&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@rachleary&quot;&gt;@rachleary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my stay-at-home-covid-19-update rave x &lt;a title=&quot;coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;&gt;##coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryou&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou&quot;&gt;##foryou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryoupage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage&quot;&gt;##foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; *contains flashing lights*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c B.B.C.

There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok is designed to be addictive: you can scroll its dashboard for hours without ever running out of content. Its algorithm uses artificial intelligence to observe your interests and deliver videos that fit. Palmer tells me that since downloading TikTok on his phone, his screen time has gone up from seven hours a day to 12.</p> <p>And when you finally tire of scrolling through TikTok\u2019s neverending dashboard, you can start making videos. Palmer only started posting his own videos when the coronavirus lockdown started. \u201cI was locked in the house and had nothing else to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought making a video might be something to do for a day to occupy myself.\u201d He sounds surprised. \u201cBut then I continued with it.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok is a curative to boredom: there is always a new challenge to try or dance routine to learn. \u201cTikTok is a space for the familiar play we\u2019ve seen on the internet for decades now,\u201d says Ryan Milner of the College of Charleston. \u201cChallenges that went around on YouTube or Facebook, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/30/als-after-the-ice-bucket-challenge\">ice-bucket challenge</a> or the Kylie Jenner challenge, are now on TikTok.\u201d</p> <p>And although many TikTok videos may appear inane on first viewing, making a successful TikTok video takes skill, care and creativity. \u201cWhen you\u2019re writing the caption on TikTok, it really has to flow well and have the right syntax,\u201d Palmer says, \u201cbecause if it\u2019s too confusing people don\u2019t like it or ignore it. It has to flow really well.\u201d</p> <p>Leary reshot her most popular TikTok video \u2013 in which she pretends to DJ to the BBC News theme tune using household cleaning products \u2013 to improve her comic timing. \u201cI didn\u2019t instantly look at it and think, that\u2019s so funny,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I refilmed it and the second time I took a swig of wine. That\u2019s the part of the video that people have found the funniest and commented on.\u201d Her instinct was correct: the video has received 151,000 likes and was played on the BBC.</p> <p>Another characteristic of TikTok that makes it well suited to the coronavirus lockdown: it is primarily an indoor platform. \u201cTikTok has always been about being 15 and staying at home,\u201d explains David Nichols of the University of Melbourne. \u201cThat\u2019s the accepted backdrop. And now everyone has to stay at home! So TikTok was made for coronavirus. Not deliberately, but it was.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Instagram, where influencers swagger in front of a rotating backdrop of cocktail bars and tropical beaches, TikTokkers have always filmed themselves at home, in their bedrooms. \u201cInstagram is more for like going out and getting drunk or going on holiday,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cInstagram is superficial. But TikTok is just people posting stupid things and it\u2019s addictive, so you can keep going and going.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the young people I speak to say a variant of the same thing: TikTok used to be uncool, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Palmer tells me that his peers would often write \u201cHere as a joke\u201d on their TikTok bios, because they were embarrassed to be on the app. \u201cIf TikTok came up in conversation, everyone would say, \u2018Urgh, no one goes on that,\u2019\u201d says 16-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGjfv5/\">Libby Atkinson</a>, from Manchester.</p> <p>Coronavirus supercharged a process that was already taking place: the process of TikTok becoming cool. \u201cAll my friends are coming on it because they have nothing to do,\u201d says Atkinson. As a result, more young people are jumping ship, from Instagram to TikTok. \u201cEveryone is moving away from Instagram to TikTok,\u201d says Ali. \u201cIt\u2019s going to become the No 1 app that everyone is using.\u201d</p> <p>This exodus of Gen Z from Instagram to TikTok mirrors the way millennials dumped Facebook in the 2010s. \u201cApps are generational in a half-decade sense,\u201d says Milner. \u201cIt makes perfect sense that Gen Z would have their own platform and it would be TikTok. If you look at Instagram and everyone on it is aged 25 and older, you want to find your own place.\u201d</p> <p>Even as we abscond from Instagram in droves, TikTok would not exist without it. Milner says: \u201cSomething unique about TikTok is how much it is centred on the image of the creator and their physical body\u2026 That wouldn\u2019t have happened had Instagram not made us much more used to having our face and bodies being on camera.\u201d Instagram sandblasted away our self-consciousness: it made us comfortable with being on camera.</p> <p>Where 16-year-olds go, adults follow. Celebrities including <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGFEbf/\">Lizzo</a>, <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGBpRd/\">Britney Spears</a> and <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGYrat/\">Justin Bieber</a> have posted TikTok videos during the lockdown. Non-celebrities are also flooding the app: Leary\u2019s mum has become hooked on the platform. \u201cShe keeps telling me that she can\u2019t stop scrolling,\u201d Leary laughs. \u201cTikTok has made it into the mainstream now,\u201d says Nichols. \u201cIt\u2019s part of popular culture. A year ago, I\u2019d have to explain what TikTok was to adults.\u201d</p> <p>As TikTok grows up, it loses its countercultural edge. \u201cI discovered it through my daughter,\u201d explains Wendy Paintain, a 54-year-old from Lichfield. \u201cShe was throwing herself around the living room, in front of her phone. I thought, <em>what on earth is this rubbish? </em>I downloaded it to have a look. And then I thought, actually, it\u2019s quite entertaining.\u201d She lets rip a loud laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Grandad Joe on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@grandadjoe1933/video/6806714661153557765&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6806714661153557765&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@grandadjoe1933&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@grandadjoe1933&quot;&gt;@grandadjoe1933&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;very sad, we need to do better \ud83d\ude14. video creds @goubtube \ud83d\ude4c. &lt;a title=&quot;staysafe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/staysafe&quot;&gt;##staysafe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;selfisolation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/selfisolation&quot;&gt;##selfisolation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;wishmeluck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/wishmeluck&quot;&gt;##wishmeluck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;supermarket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/supermarket&quot;&gt;##supermarket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;considerothers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/considerothers&quot;&gt;##considerothers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;washyourhands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/washyourhands&quot;&gt;##washyourhands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c If The World Was Ending - JP Saxe ft.

The <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGR6BN/\">Grandad Joe</a> account blew up after Paintain posted a video of Joe looking forlorn in a ransacked supermarket. It went viral, amassing 42.5m views.</p> <p>Since then, Joe has been accepted into the TikTok top creators programme, been invited for TV appearances and has even started to make money from brand partnerships. \u201cHe\u2019s grown really quickly,\u201d says Paintain of her father\u2019s TikTok account. \u201cHe got 1.6 million followers in nine weeks. He\u2019s even got a blue tick!\u201d (An indicator of a verified celebrity.) She takes me upstairs to speak to Joe, who is having a nap. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so popular, really,\u201d Joe tells me. \u201cI\u2019m an old fossil. I guess I\u2019m having my 15 minutes of fame. Did you know that I might be going on the telly?\u201d</p> <p>Alongside these older content creators, official bodies have been using TikTok to publish public health information during the coronavirus pandemic. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has uploaded TikTok videos urging people to stay at home; the World Health Organization has 1.4 million followers on the app. During the Easter bank holiday weekend, when many feared people may break lockdown rules, due to the warm weather, the UK government ran ads on TikTok, asking people to stay at home.</p> <p>Coronavirus trends float through the app, like driftwood. There\u2019s the #iwillsurvivechallenge (where users wash their hands to the Gloria Gaynor anthem), and the #stayathomechallenge, where <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsEtDt/\">NHS workers</a> and TikTok creators urge users to stay indoors, sharing exercise routines or cooking tips to pass the time. (The #stayathomechallenge has more than 2.6bn views.) Bored in the House, the song by Tyga and up-and-coming rapper Curtis Roach, has become <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/BORED-IN-THE-HOUSE-6800281264655026950?lang=en\">TikTok\u2019s unofficial coronavirus anthem</a>: more than 2m videos have been created using the song, with more than 923 million views globally.</p> <p>All coronavirus content on TikTok has a banner linking to reputable news sources. The app\u2019s UK general manager, Richard Waterworth, says: \u201cWe [have] introduced a range of in-app features, notifications and safety measures specifically designed to elevate credible and accurate information from trusted sources.\u201d But preventing the spread of fake news can be difficult to enforce in practice: conspiracy theories linking 5G to coronavirus are easy to find.</p> <p>Healthcare workers have also turned to the app. \u201cTraditional TikTok was a dance platform,\u201d says NHS doctor and former <em>Love Island</em> contestant <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsvwyh/\">Alex George</a>. The 29-year-old has 104,000 followers on TikTok, where he posts videos explaining how coronavirus is transmitted or the correct way to wash your hands. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true any more. People are engaging with health content.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has helped TikTok to grow up. What was once a platform for uninhibited free play, detached from the cares and concerns of the outside world, has become outward facing. Although this is not the first time that TikTokkers have been civic-minded \u2013 during the 2019 Australian bushfires, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/23/australian-teens-turn-to-tiktok-to-mock-pm-over-hawaii-holiday-during-fire-crisis\">users ridiculed Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of the crisis</a> and raised money for affected communities \u2013 coronavirus has pushed TikTok into a new prominence. TikTok itself has pledged \u20ac62m to support European healthcare workers and communities affected by the pandemic.</p> <p>George is hopeful that his videos will communicate key public health messages to a younger audience. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t engage with traditional media forms,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they might watch my TikTok videos and educate their grandparents about how to wash their hands properly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Alex George on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzo/video/6816474944399101189&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6816474944399101189&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@lizzo&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzo&quot;&gt;@lizzo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Omg y\u2019all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c original sound - jeanvictorm&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6812435361357171462&quot;&gt;\u266c original sound - jeanvictorm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sorchamackenzie?lang=en\">Sorcha Mackenzie</a> joined TikTok long before coronavirus. She did so for the same reason many other people will be downloading it right now: because she was lonely.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, I was pretty socially isolated,\u201d explains Mackenzie, a 28-year-old artist from Melbourne. \u201cI was running this gallery across town, in the docklands, and it\u2019s a pretty desolate area.

As the world changes, people who\u2019d never have dreamed of posting videos of themselves dancing in their pyjamas online or lip-syncing in their kitchen, think: why not?</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like such an uncomfortable, incredibly bizarre moment,\u201d says Mackenzie, \u201cand there\u2019s such a big shift in everything. People are forced to take stock of what is important. They lose that sense of ego or barrier of caring about what other people think about them.\u201d TikTok allows us to see others and be seen ourselves. It brings levity to otherwise dark and anxiety-filled days. It lets the air in.</p> <p>Layer by layer, the coronavirus pandemic has peeled away our braggadocio and our hubristic plans for the future and returned all of us to a childlike state.

  "<p>This may come as a surprise, but I have a day job of sorts (I\u2019m an editor for a global group of employment lawyers). I know that nice Mr Sunak said freelance journalists earn about \u00a3200,000 a year when he announced his support package for the self-employed last month, but I don\u2019t know what happened to mine. Was I mis-sold a heap of PPI? Maybe I bought too many avocado toasts and flat whites. Isn\u2019t that how my millennial brethren mislaid the houses they were supposed to own? Either way, my side hustle is indispensable.</p> <p>Apologies for this unlovely insight into how the word-sausage gets made, but lots of people who write full time have a bit on the side, doing things we wouldn\u2019t necessarily boast about at literary parties. It\u2019s hardly news that journalism is beleaguered, rates low and work spread thin. I occasionally used to beat myself up about not having the courage and talent to live entirely from my creative endeavours; no longer. Now, I\u2019m simply grateful, more than ever, for the stability and structure my side hustle brings.</p> <p>The crisis hasn\u2019t really changed the way I work \u2013 I have been #wfh for more than a decade \u2013 but I\u2019m intrigued by how it has changed the way we interact. I have never met most of my colleagues, but I find myself feeling oddly tender towards them. The glib \u201cThanks and kind regards\u201d I used to send their inbox avatars no longer cuts it; I\u2019ve adopted a genuinely sincere \u201cBest wishes\u201d. Usually strictly business, we have taken to tentatively slipping a personal touch into emails. \u201cTake care,\u201d someone writes from Luxembourg. \u201cStay safe,\u201d ends a message from Mexico.</p> <p>I\u2019m fascinated by a sparsely populated Instagram feed with pictures of us in makeshift home offices, laptops on piles of books and balanced on the corners of kitchen tables (physios will have a field day when we all get out). Who would have imagined the rigorously professional X has a small fluffy lapdog? It\u2019s an odd and rather lovely consolation to have work humanised like this; to see we are parents or cat owners; to inspect each other\u2019s mugs.

Colleagues across the world are doing the same; I get emails on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings; at 4 or 5am on weekdays. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s been hard work, because anyone who is not putting their life and health in danger has forfeited the right to say that now. It\u2019s not NHS hard; not Asda-checkout hard.

It might be nice to do a wrist workout trying to lift <em>The Mirror and the Light</em>, or see if I can still murder an easy Chopin prelude, but it\u2019s far nicer to have scaffolding for these shapeless days, and a bit of economic security.</p> <p>My family are bemused at my commitment to keeping the hamster wheel of capitalism turning, but for me, work is identity and sanity. When my best friend and I fantasise about winning the lottery, she says she would stop working in an instant, but I can\u2019t imagine happiness without it. Retirement is theoretical \u2013 I seem to have mislaid my pension, along with that \u00a3200,000 \u2013 but I dread the thought of it anyway.</p> <p>It goes without saying that only some types of work can be a salvation: the ones that are safe, humanely organised and pay a living wage. Our current situation has created and amplified the gaping, uneasy gulfs in the way we work, as it has in so many things. The distribution of work is feast or famine and it\u2019s as unfair as that of other resources. Key workers are frighteningly overburdened, keeping us safe, fed, alive; gig economy workers without job stability or sick pay are working past exhaustion and through illness. Meanwhile many have seen work vanish entirely, or become a logistical impossibility. Friends who invented themselves as nimble, multi-hyphen hustlers \u2013 more because permanent jobs were impossible to find than through any real conviction \u2013 made a virtue out of necessity. Now they are negotiating labyrinthine universal credit applications and facing a deeply uncertain future.</p> <p>Can we do better? We must.

  "<p>Last week, in Oxford, the first volunteers in the first European human trial were injected with a potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">coronavirus vaccine</a>. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s National Institute of Health <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1551432\">received an offer</a> from the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm International Corp to take part in a trial of another potential coronavirus vaccine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/25/africas-covid-19-research-must-be-tailored-to-its-realities-by-its-own-scientists\">Africa's Covid-19 research must be tailored to its realities \u2013 by its own scientists | Monique Wasunna</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two events reveal twin aspects of the global process of drug trials and development. On the one hand, there is the ingenuity and drive that allow a potential vaccine to emerge in a fraction of the time it would normally take, as well as the courage and selflessness shown by the volunteers risking their health to test it. On the other, the increasing use of poorer nations as testing grounds for new medicines, in trials in which the subjects often have, because of poverty and lack of access to health provision, little choice about whether to take part.</p> <p>The details of the proposed Chinese trial are still unclear, but it is part of what many call the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd2441\">\u201cglobalisation of clinical trials\u201d</a>. Until the end of the last century, virtually all clinical trials by western pharmaceutical companies were conducted in Europe or America. The majority still are. But over the past 20 years, US, European and, increasingly, Chinese companies have taken to offshoring trials to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428044/#b2\">low- and middle-income countries</a>. In 2017, 90% of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drugs Agency <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/08/clinical-trials-overseas-data/\">were tested</a> at least in part outside the US and Canada. At a time when so much attention -and hope - is focused on the possibilities of a Covid-19 vaccine, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of what the development of medicines means for most of the world.</p> <p>The reasons for conducting tests offshore are not hard to discern. In lower income countries, regulation is looser, staff cheaper and subjects easier to find, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-019-00008-7\">cutting costs</a> by 30-40%.</p> <p> Take India. It has a huge population, enormous levels of poverty, almost 20% of the global disease burden and a pitiable health infrastructure. It also has highly trained scientists and medics, skilled technicians and good laboratories. As a result, in the first decade of this century, India became the poor country of choice for many pharmaceutical companies. The proportion of <a href=\"http://isid.org.in/pdf/WP179.pdf\">global clinical trials</a> conducted in India rose from less than 1% in 2008 to 5% six years later \u2013 just about on par with the UK.</p> <p>The globalisation of clinical research has many potential benefits. It could help tackle diseases long ignored, develop medical and scientific innovation in non-western countries, improve their health infrastructure and increase the diversity of trial subjects and thereby the quality of the final product. In reality, too little of this has happened because offshore clinical trials have at their heart not a concern for the welfare of subjects or the health of local populations but the need to cut costs and generate profits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In India, many poor people were recruited to HIV trials without knowing that they were taking part in experiments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ethical guidelines for clinical research normally require participating patients to have access to the best available treatments for their condition. But in poor countries, the fact that people are poor has often been an excuse for researchers brushing aside such considerations.</p> <p>A particularly egregious case was in the treatment of HIV in the 1990s. The standard care at that time to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV was a course of the drug AZT. The drug was expensive, so researchers wanted to see if other treatments might work.</p> <p>In the west, the control group in such trials would have received the normal course of AZT. In a series of trials in Africa and Asia, however, the control group received not AZT but a placebo, on the grounds that poor people would normally not have received treatment anyway. Hundreds of babies were born infected with Aids when they might have been free of the virus. As <a href=\"http://soniashah.com/books/the-body-hunters/\">Sonia Shah</a> wrote in her book <em>The Body Hunters</em>: \u201cRather than working to overcome the inevitable barriers of poverty and inequity, many Aids researchers felt compelled to accommodate them.\u201d Too often, that remains the case.</p> <p>In India, many poor people were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20136654\">recruited to trials</a> without knowing that they were taking part in experiments. Thousands died<strong>, </strong> though as no proper records were kept the true figure is unknown<strong>.</strong> Government data indicate <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5553263/\">2,868 deaths</a> between 2005 and 2012 and a <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h6149\">further 2,209</a> between 2013 and 2015; <a href=\"https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/11550-over-24000-clinical-trial-deaths-and-saes-india-ten-years\">others sugges</a>t the total might be much higher. The scandals, court rulings and parliamentary scrutiny led to a tightening of regulations. This in turn led to pharmaceutical companies <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/science/health/india-losing-out-on-clinical-trials-raises-health-worries-1551115944303.html\">pulling out of India</a>, forcing the government to <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4238150/PharmOlam_March2018/PDF/pharm-olam_india_clinical_trials_white_paper_1.pdf?t=1524594556831\">loosen regulations</a> once more.</p> <p>Equally troubling is that clinical trials in poor countries rarely address local health problems. Every year, infectious diseases take a devastating toll in India: 440,000 people die annually from TB. To put that in perspective, more than <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases\">190,000 peopl</a>e have died globally so far from Covid-19. Yet just <a href=\"http://isid.org.in/pdf/WP179.pdf\">0.7% of clinical trials</a> in India target TB. Among children, the biggest killers are diarrhoeal diseases; fewer than 1% of trials concern gastrointestinal infections.</p> <p>More than 12% of Indian clinical trials are, on the other hand, designed to find cures for cancer. That\u2019s half as many again as the total number of trials targeting all infectious diseases. Indeed, there are more trials in India investigating skin problems, including for the development of cosmetics, than for infectious diseases. Cancers and skin problems are important to tackle, but these are conditions that more afflict rich nations \u2013 and the rich in India. The issues that primarily affect the poor still remain largely ignored. Globally, diseases of relevance to high-income countries are investigated in clinical trials <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)61046-6/fulltext\">seven to eight times more often</a> than diseases whose burden lies mainly in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>There is little profit in tackling TB or diarrhoea. There are large bounties in cures for cancers or improvements in cosmetics. And so the bodies of the wretchedly poor become exploited to alleviate the ailments of the comfortably rich.</p> <p>This year or next, we will, it\u2019s hoped, find a vaccine for Covid-19. Once the pandemic is brought to an end, there will still be millions in the global south dying for want of basic medicines and research. Will we take their lives as seriously as we are taking the lives of those devastated by coronavirus? Will we rethink the way that clinical research is conducted and what its priorities should be? Or will we continue to ignore the poor and persist in allowing profit to take precedence over people?</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

  "<p>There have not been too many encouraging graph lines in recent weeks. One that does offer a breath of optimism, however, is the slight downward curve that implies one of the most toxic trends of our times \u2013 the anti-vaxx movement \u2013 might just be in retreat. The shift is incremental, but in a UK-wide survey in mid-March, 7% of people insisted they would refuse to have a coronavirus vaccine if one were available. By early April, with hospital wards and mortuaries filling up, that number had dropped to 5%. Perhaps vaccine conspiracy cannot bear too much pandemic reality.</p> <p>As with the strategies against the virus itself, however, the response to any likely \u201ccure\u201d seems likely to vary from country to country. A similar survey in France, also conducted by the London-based <a href=\"https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/\">Vaccine Confidence Project</a>, suggested 18% of people would refuse a vaccine, while in a poll in New York, the city worst affected by the pandemic, 29% insisted they would not consent, a number that may render any programme ineffective.</p> <p>The depth of misplaced fear about vaccination \u2013 which remains one of the unambiguous triumphs of global public health \u2013 has been further illustrated in widely shared remarks from lockdown. Novak Djokovic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/novak-djokovic-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-tennis\">last week volunteered</a> that he would have to think seriously about whether he could even carry on playing tennis if a vaccine were to become mandatory to travel. The rapper MIA went further in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">informing her 650,000 Twitter followers</a> melodramatically, that \u201cif I have to choose the vaccine or a [location-tracking] chip, I\u2019m gonna choose death\u201d.</p> <p>The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world\u2019s population through immunisation.</p> <p>All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice \u2013 a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/376/376-h/376-h.htm\">Daniel Defoe reported</a> in his <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, to \u201csuppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People\u201d. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile \u2013 and often a similar success rate \u2013 to the efforts to curb the disease.</p> <p>In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">manipulation in the elections of 2016</a>, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory\">Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax</a>, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.</p> <p>Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">acts of vandalism and arson</a> against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/arsonists-attack-phone-mast-serving-nhs-nightingale-hospital\">new Nightingale hospital</a> outside Birmingham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f04146b7f7c20d9d8156d5698993736094abca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f04146b7f7c20d9d8156d5698993736094abca3/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eamonn Holmes on This Morning\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This Morning received more than 400 complaints after presenter Eamonn Holmes gave credence to Covid-19 5G conspiracy theories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV This Morning</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A report from the independent verification charity Full Fact <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/5g-and-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-came/\">last week revealed</a> how this copycat campaign was only the most dramatic expression of a conspiracy theory with different strains, which include \u201cthat all the symptoms [of the virus] are actually caused by 5G\u2026 [and] that there is no disease at all, and the outbreak is a gigantic hoax to enable the government to install 5G under the cover of lockdown\u201d. It should go without saying that there is no possible connection between the 5G radio waves and the spread of a virus. Even so, the government was forced to address the fears, calling them \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d.</p> <p> Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/12/scienceandnature.features1\">interviewing Daniel Dennett</a>, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs \u201cmemes\u201d. Nah, I thought at the time; it will never catch on.</p> <p>In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">A story in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">Wired </a></em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">magazine</a> located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that \u201c5G is life-threatening\u201d, but then added a speculative comment (\u201cI have not done a fact-check\u201d) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The \u201clink\u201d became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in <em>Het Laatste Nieuws</em>, was subsequently withdrawn.)</p> <p>If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the \u201cwet market\u201d for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off\">who was struck off</a> by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of <em>Cancer and the New Biology of Water</em>, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">UK phone masts attacked amid 5G-coronavirus conspiracy theory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down.</p> <p>In their book <em>A Lot of People Are Saying</em>, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as \u201cconspiracy entrepreneurs\u201d.

Their combination with media attention around the decision to allow Huawei to supply some of the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure, and the fact that telecoms engineers were designated key workers, appears to have ignited dangerous lockdown fears. Challenges were laid down in Facebook groups and Reddit threads for \u201cfirestarters\u201d to \u201ctake the 5G out\u201d.</p> <p>Social media platforms, fearing sanction, took long overdue action.

There has been no more virulent \u201cconspiracy entrepreneur\u201d than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: \u201cThis is the plan, folks,\u201d he grunted at his viewers. \u201cThey plan \u2013 if they\u2019ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance \u2013 on killing you.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cthey\u201d were determined \u201cto make sure you don\u2019t learn about the known antivirals\u201d.

  "<p>When coronavirus emerged in China, people across much of the region were quick to start wearing some form of face mask when they went out in public. Memories of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">Sars epidemic</a> were still strong, and there is a <a href=\"https://qz.com/299003/a-quick-history-of-why-asians-wear-surgical-masks-in-public/\">cultural tradition of wearing masks </a>to protect oneself and others.</p> \n<p>In the west, however, even though masks sold out as fast as hand sanitiser in chemists and online as people stockpiled supplies, initially there was widespread reluctance to wearing face coverings in public.</p> \n<p>The divide was so strong that, as racism against people of east Asian heritage rose sharply, some <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Asians-in-US-torn-between-safety-and-stigma-over-face-masks\">stopped wearing masks</a> because face protection had become a focus for abuse, discrimination and stigma.</p> \n<p>A few weeks later, masks and improvised substitutes are rapidly becoming the new normal in cities from New York to Berlin, and those who go out without their nose and mouth covered risk censure or stronger penalties.</p> \n<p>Millions of people are even learning how to create their own as they wait for supplies to return to stores around the world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\" data-alt=\"make your own mask\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\">make your own mask</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Take up has been slow because, for months, scientists and authorities were divided on whether they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/face-masks-coronavirus-covid-19-public\">help slow the spread of the disease</a>. The World Health Organization today still recommends their use by anyone coughing or sneezing, but says healthy people should <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks\">use them only</a> if taking care of someone infected with the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>It seems increasingly likely that where masks do provide a benefit outside a surgical setting, it is for society as a whole, not the individual wearing it. Rather than preventing the wearer picking up an infection, they may be more likely to prevent carriers of the virus from passing it on, whether through coughs, sneezing, during conversation or even while yawning.</p> \n<p>There are concerns that masks may give a false sense of security, as they do not block all particles, and leave the eyes uncovered and open to infection.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d25beb5-14fb-47b4-bd06-0714dbfabc04\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cqLnDhHSJDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But as the coronavirus crisis drags on, and governments look for ways out of economically devastating lockdowns, they are unlikely to vanish any time soon. Here are how different countries have regulated mask supplies and mask-wearing as they battle coronavirus.</p> \n<p><strong>Czech Republic</strong></p> \n<p>The Czech Republic was the first country in Europe to make face covering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/czechs-get-to-work-making-masks-after-government-decree-coronavirus\">mandatory in public</a>, with a decree in mid-March. In an effort to set a public example, the prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, and other politicians have addressed parliament and made television appearances wearing masks. The government claimed the policy helped slow the spread of the disease, and bring the outbreak under control with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/czechs-grapple-with-how-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown\">relatively low casualty numbers.</a></p> \n<p><strong>Taiwan</strong></p> \n<p>Anticipating high demand, Taiwan started rationing masks in January, giving everyone a weekly allowance they could buy at designated pharmacies. The country also invested millions in creating new mask manufacturing capacity, expanding so much that there is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chowleen/status/1252798444244254721?s=20\">quota for Taiwanese living abroad</a>, and started <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-donate-ten-million-masks-172312113.html\">donating masks</a> to some coronavirus hotspots.</p> \n<p>There is no legal obligation to wear a mask, but because of the experience of living through the Sars epidemic, people are used to wearing them in crowded places.</p> \n<p><strong>Germany</strong></p> \n<p>On 15 April, Angela Merkel recommended people wear masks, and since then all 16 German states have made it mandatory on public transport and while shopping. Masks can also include any kind of face covering, such as scarves or bandanas. However, most cities have said they won\u2019t actually enforce the rules or issue fines, because they don\u2019t have enough staff.</p> \n<p>The eastern city of Jena was the first to make mask-wearing mandatory and had a very positive response. The mayor, Christian Gerlitz, said that \u201c99% of the population sticks to the rules\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>Spain</strong></p> \n<p>Masks are not required, but the government advises people to wear them on public transport and in situations where social distancing is difficult, and started handing them out when it loosened the restrictions on non-essential workers. There have also been problems with supply; defective masks from a Chinese company have resulted in 1,000 health workers requiring isolation over fears they may have been infected with the virus.</p> \n<p><strong>United States</strong></p> \n<p>In early April, America\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed months of official insistence that healthy people did not need to wear masks, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">recommended everyone wear non-medical face coverings in public.</a> A national shortage of masks means it is almost impossible to buy them, and this has sparked an interest in sewing across the country as people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/how-to-make-no-sew-face-mask-coronavirus\">try to make their own instead.</a></p> \n<p>President Donald Trump said the guidelines were voluntary, and he would not cover his face, although his wife Melania <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/09/politics/melania-trump-face-mask-coronavirus/index.html\">shared a photo of herself wearing a mask</a>, and encouraged others to do so. Other officials have warned that the face coverings must not replace hand washing and social distancing.</p> \n<p><strong>Japan</strong></p> \n<p>Mask-wearing is common in Japan, but as the country stepped up its battle against the pandemic, it announced early this month that it would supply every household with two washable, reusable masks at a cost to the nation of \u00a3350m. That effort has been marred by complaints about mould, insects and stains, with the government forced to replace some of the face coverings, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-japan-masks-idUSL3N2CA10N\">Reuters reported.</a> Electronics company Sharp has halted online sales of masks until further notice, after its website crashed due to overwhelming demand.</p> \n<p><strong>Hong Kong</strong></p> \n<p>Masks have been worn in public by the majority of the population in Hong Kong since the epidemic began. Their use has been supported, but not mandated, by the government. There have been some tensions over the reluctance of many in the city\u2019s large expat community <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3076796/coronavirus-exposes-cultural-divide-hong-kong\">to cover their faces</a>, and some health experts are now calling for covering up to be made compulsory.</p> \n<p>Despite efforts to tackle the virus, authorities have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/hong-kong-court-upholds-face-masks-ban-despite-coronavirus\">doubled down on an \u201canti-mask ban\u201d</a> brought in last year to try to halt the city\u2019s months-long protest movement.</p> \n<p><br></p>",
  "<p>Britain gets through 2.5 billion of them every year, and the number is set to increase. But despite a growing clamour for coffee chains to make their cups more environment-friendly, the vast majority are used only once, which critics say is a considerable waste of natural resources.</p> <p>One company vying to produce a truly recyclable alternative claims that the UK\u2019s caffeine addiction is responsible for the felling of a million trees a year. An independent study it commissioned suggests that almost 1.5 billion litres of water go into making the cups the UK uses annually.</p> <p>The study, by product-testing company Intertek, claims to be the first to measure the environmental impact of producing, using and disposing of all types of single-use coffee cup. It found that a typical cup requires 0.58 litres of water to produce and has a carbon footprint equivalent to up to 60.9 grammes of carbon dioxide.</p> <p>A 2017 report from<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/inquiry/\"> the UK\u2019s House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee</a> found that only one in 400 cups end up being recycled, with the vast majority going straight to landfill. This suggests that coffee cups that end up in the UK\u2019s landfill sites produce an annual carbon footprint equivalent to over 152,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, similar to what 33,300 cars produce in a year.</p> <p>The audit committee called on the government to set a target to recycle all single-use cups by 2023. It said: \u201cIf an effective recycling system is not established\u2026 by this date, the government should ban disposable coffee cups.\u201d</p> <p>But a major issue for the industry is that even cups promoted as compostable cannot be recycled conventionally. They have to be transported by lorry to one of the UK\u2019s 53 high-temperature industrial composting facilities, which increases their carbon footprint.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with conventional, coated and compostable cups is that they\u2019re all made from virgin paper, and the laminated plastic coating is very hard to remove,\u201d said Malcolm Waugh, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.frugalpac.com/\">Frugalpac</a>, an Ipswich-based company that produces an alternative called the Frugal Cup, which is made almost totally from recycled paper, and which funded the study.</p> <p>\u201cOur answer was to redesign the cup by scrapping the laminated virgin paperboard and instead make the cup out of 96% recycled paper with no waterproofing chemicals, and then lightly attach a separately made plastic food grade liner. Not perfect yet but a damn sight better than the alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>Waugh predicted that using cups made from recycled paper would save a million trees a year in Britain and more than 200 million worldwide.</p> <p>Producing a truly recyclable coffee cup is a key issue for environmental groups. The WWF forecasts that by 2030 the UK will use 33% more cups than it does now.</p> <p>Some major chains are starting to act. Last month, Starbucks announced that it is trialling NextGen <a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/emea/stories/2020/starbucks-begins-trialling-new-nextgen-cup-in-london/\">compostable cups</a>, which are made without the polyethylene lining that makes normal cups hard to recycle.</p>",
  "<p>The US model of capitalism is deeply flawed.

The latest survey of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/24/uk-retail-sales-covid-19-alcohol-stock-markets-confidence-business-live\" title=\"\">German business sentiment</a> was dire, and the outlook will remain so until there is a pick-up in demand for the country\u2019s exports.

Policy is driven by events, not dogma, and as a result is far more creative. So while it was Groundhog Day in Europe, Congress was passing a fresh stimulus bill and the US treasury was doing its utmost to ensure that loans promised to small businesses were actually delivered.</p> <p>There is a pattern here. In 2008-09, the Fed moved more quickly than the ECB to cut interest rates and to introduce the money-creation scheme known as quantitative easing. President Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus package would ideally have been bigger, but it was better than the fetish for fiscal discipline that the EU insisted on. Moreover, it didn\u2019t take long for the Americans to work out that the economy would never really recover unless the banking system was cleaned up. It took years for the Europeans to twig this, which is why the US went into the current crisis with its banks in relatively good health and the EU did not.</p> <p>Indeed, there are justifiable fears about how Italian and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 German banks will withstand the sort of bad-loan losses that look all too likely given the impact of the lockdown on business activity. That\u2019s another reason why the hardliners in Germany and the Netherlands need to think again about coronabonds.</p> <p>No question, the US system has its drawbacks. The lack of a proper social safety net is the main reason Donald Trump is desperate to get the economy out of hibernation, and moving too rapidly could easily backfire.</p> <p>But, as things stand, history is about to repeat itself. As in 2008-09, all developed economies will go into a deep recession, but the US will rebound first and fastest. Europe\u2019s timidity will result in deeper scars. Last time they were just economic. This time they could be political too.</p> <h2>Who needs Davos when you\u2019ve got Zoom?</h2> <p>It should not require a pandemic for the business \u201celite\u201d to realise that Davos should be junked from the corporate calendar. The World Economic Forum\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/24/what-did-we-learn-from-davos-2020\" title=\"\">annual shindig</a> became a laughing stock a long time ago. All those denunciations of global inequality, when made by corporate captains clinking champagne glasses in a Swiss ski resort at shareholders\u2019 expense, are ridiculous.</p> <p>The penny finally seems to be dropping, for which we should give modest thanks. Standard Life Aberdeen, the FTSE 100 asset manager, says its executives won\u2019t go next time and it will allocate its \u00a33m budget \u2013 yes, really \u2013 to something more useful.</p> <p>\u201cWEF has done a lot of good over the years,\u201d claimed its chief executive, Keith Skeoch, contentiously, in an email to staff last Friday, \u201cbut I believe we should focus our efforts and resources closer to home in the locations where we operate around the world. The money will be directed to high-impact community projects to provide relief to people most in need.\u201d</p> <p>One of the WEF\u2019s thin justifications for the existence for Davos is that a gathering of politicians and business leaders helps to create global responses to global risks. The evidence for such a claim was always hard to spot, but never more so than now. Lack of international cooperation has been a defining feature of the world\u2019s early response to the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>Come next January, attendance by corporate bosses at Davos will be very hard to defend. The global economy, almost certainly, will still be depressed. The fleets of corporate jets at Swiss airports, carrying millionaires and billionaires anxious to express their concern over the climate emergency, will be more offensive than usual.</p> <p>Standard Life Aberdeen is the first major name to pull out. It won\u2019t be the last.

And, after a quarter of century of comfortable growth in rental income, during which time some spectacularly ugly shopping centres were built, nor should they.</p> <p>But landlords also make a fair point in the current Covid-19 stand-off over rents: if a tenant can afford to pay, it should. That, formally, is also the government\u2019s position. It\u2019s just that Alok Sharma, the business secretary, seems to have created a free-for-all in his attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/commercial-property-landlords-banned-from-demanding-rent-arrears\" title=\"\">curtail some landlords\u2019 strong-arm tactics</a> on rent collection.</p> <p>The reasoning behind the government\u2019s temporary ban on winding-up orders is fair enough: most high street shops are shut and those companies at risk of collapse should be given some financial breathing space. But then Sharma followed up with a woolly call for other tenants to \u201cpay what they can in recognition of the strains felt by commercial landlords too\u201d.</p> <p>That loose wording is an open invitation for even strong retailers to try their luck. Boots, the chemists\u2019 chain, says it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/boots-and-matalan-join-list-of-firms-targeted-over-unpaid-rents-since-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">\u201cpaused some payments\u201d</a> in the hope of reaching a \u201cfair\u201d agreement with some of its biggest landlords. Why? It\u2019s not even remotely in the struggling camp.</p> <p>Boots is part of the enormous Walgreens Boots Alliance empire, valued on the US Nasdaq market at $38bn. Most of its UK shops are open, as the pharmacies are classed as an essential service. Footfall may be down 65% but, on the other hand, Boots benefits from the government\u2019s scrapping of business rates for retail, leisure and hospitality firms this year. It can clearly afford to fulfil its contractual obligation to pay its rent in full, on time.</p> <p>In practice, landlords will probably lose most of these skirmishes since their biggest fear is empty space, and retail rents were falling anyway before the crisis. But some tenants are exploiting the situation. For a change, a slice of sympathy for landlords is in order.</p>",

Seventeen priorities have been identified \u2013 these include reopening schools, companies returning to work, getting public transport back to normal, the supply of masks and sanitiser, policies on testing, and support for the elderly.</p> <h2>Beijing cracks down on \u2018uncivilised\u2019 behaviour</h2> <p>Beijing\u2019s city government has banned \u201cuncivilised\u201d behaviour such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, in a new set of regulations to improve public hygiene and combat the coronavirus. Rule-breakers will be slapped with fines for offences including not wearing a mask in public when ill, and citizens must also \u201cdress neatly\u201d in public and not go shirtless \u2013 an apparent reference to the so-called \u201cBeijing bikini\u201d, in which men roll T-shirts up to expose their stomachs in hot weather.</p> <h2>WHO warns against \u2018immunity passports\u2019</h2> <p>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/who-warns-against-coronavirus-immunity-passports\">warned against \u201cimmunity passports\u201d</a> for recovered patients, seen as a possible tool for countries preparing to reopen their economies. \u201cThere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from \u001dCovid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,\u201d said a WHO statement.</p> <h2>White House considers replacing health and human services chief</h2> <p>Reports have emerged that Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Wall Street Journal, which cited six people familiar with the discussions, said frustration with Azar was growing but the administration was reluctant to make big changes while the country was seeking to stop the virus, which has killed more than 53,000 people in the US. A White House spokesman told the newspaper that there was no plan to replace Azar.</p> <h2>Cases grow by nearly 1,000 in Mexico</h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Saturday reported 970 new cases of coronavirus infection and 84 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 13,842 cases and 1,305 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely considerably higher than the confirmed cases.</p> <h2>Kim Jong-un\u2019s train possibly spotted in resort</h2> <p>As rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continue to circulate, including reports that he is sheltering from Covid-19, a US-based monitoring group released satellite images of what may have been his train <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/kim-jong-uns-train-possibly-spotted-at-north-korean-resort\">parked at an exclusive resort town</a> in the country\u2019s east.</p> <h2>Australian study finds little transmission between children</h2> <p>A preliminary report, cited by Australia\u2019s chief medical officer as the government advocates the reopening of the country\u2019s schools, says children are unlikely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/children-unlikely-to-transmit-coronavirus-says-study-cited-in-pms-push-to-reopen-schools\">transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults</a>. The study, which is still be peer reviewed, was conducted by the Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS). It examined transmission of the virus in New South Wales schools and childcare centres between March and mid-April.</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia partially lifts curfews, reopens some commercial activity</h2> <p>State media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca, according to Reuters. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will be reopened during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May.</p> <h2>Australia releases controversial coronavirus tracing app</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s coronavirus tracing app was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/26/australias-coronavirus-tracing-app-set-to-launch-today-despite-lingering-privacy-concerns\">set to launch </a>on Sunday, despite lingering privacy concerns. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed downloading the app would not be mandatory, and instead has likened it to a civic duty, such as buying war bonds in the second world war. He also flagged it as a necessary step to relaxing restrictions.</p> <h2>UK prime minister to return to work on Monday</h2> <p>Boris Johnson will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/25/boris-johnson-lockdown-dilemma-grim-virus-data\">return to work on Monday</a> and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing Street spokeswoman has confirmed.

  "<p><strong>Barbeito Rainwater Reserve Madeira, Portugal NV (from \u00a312.75, 50cl, <a href=\"https://bat.wine/\">bat.wine</a>; <a href=\"https://www.buonvino.co.uk/\">buonvino.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cambridgewine.com/\">cambridgewine.com</a>)</strong> In the current situation a lot of us are falling back on the contents of our kitchen store-cupboards, reassessing which products qualify as useless, useful or indispensable. Every day I\u2019ve been thanking the earlier, more innocent edition of me that restocked the spice drawer in a pre-lockdown big shop. And I\u2019ve never been more grateful for my plentiful (if somewhat random) stash of a product that used to be a cook\u2019s essential, but which is actually one of the great lost drinks of our time: the fortified wines of Madeira. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a great and versatile cooking ingredient that can be used for adding depth and gloss to sauces and deglazing pans (my Larousse Gastronomique suggests 1 part Madeira to 3 parts meat juices) or fortifying fruitcakes, among many other things. But the combination of dried citrus fruit and nuttiness and twangy acidic punch in Barbeito\u2019s brilliant example of the relatively light, medium-dry Rainwater blend is way too good to simply lose in the dinner.</p> <p><strong>H&amp;H 10 Year Old Sercial Madeira, Portugal NV (\u00a319.99, 50cl, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a>)</strong> One of the things that makes Madeira the store-cupboard booze par excellence is the fact that it\u2019s pretty much indestructible: it stays fresh and retains its character for years, even after a bottle has been opened. You might think that\u2019s the case for all fortified wines. But if you\u2019ve ever compared a glass of Port or Sherry that\u2019s come straight from a freshly opened bottle with one from the back of the drinks cabinet that was opened a couple of Christmases ago, you\u2019d immediately taste the difference. Madeira\u2019s longevity is the result of its unusual production process: the wines are actually heated during ageing, in heated stainless steel or concrete vats (a process known as the estufa system), or, for the top wines, such as H&amp;H\u2019s invigorating, dry-seeming, spicy-racy 10 Year Old Sercial, by leaving barrels to be warmed by the heat of the sun in the lofts of Madeira lodges in the island\u2019s capital Funchal.</p> <p><strong>Blandy\u2019s Alvada Madeira, Portugal NV (from \u00a312.85, 50cl, <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/\">thewhiskyexchange.com</a>; <a href=\"https://pcwine.co.uk/\">pcwine.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cambridgewine.com/\">cambridgewine.com</a>)</strong> That heating business is not the only eccentricity in Madeira\u2019s winemaking process: the island itself would not perhaps be the first place you\u2019d choose to make wine, the subtropical climate being pretty much the ideal environment for grapes to develop fungal diseases, and the terraced vineyard plots making for hard hand-picking and pruning work. Many of the grape varieties that work here \u2013 sercial, bual, terrantez, tinta negro mole \u2013 aren\u2019t widely planted elsewhere (verdelho and malvasia are somewhat better known). And the high alcohol (somewhere between 17% and 19%) puts a lot of potential drinkers off. So many cards are stacked, then, against the island\u2019s winemakers ever regaining the popularity and reputation they had in the 18th and 19th centuries. And yet, whether it\u2019s a rich, sweet, fruitcakey dessert-partnering youngster such as Alvada, or the febrile acidity and ethereal scents of a rare, decades-old vintage bottling, this is one wine style that deserves to be reassessed.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 26 April 2020 because it incorrectly described Madeira as a Spanish wine.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Social distancing is saving lives every day. But the physical and psychological toll of the lockdown is not spread evenly among us. Care home residents, prisoners and children in the care of the state are just some of those whose health and wellbeing have been disproportionately endangered for the common good. And the enforced social isolation of a lockdown is a particularly terrifying prospect for victims of domestic abuse and their offspring.</p> <p>Abusers so often rely on isolating their victims from friends, family and colleagues in order to prolong and worsen the impact of their abuse. The lockdown has aided and abetted them in their mission to terrorise. Around 6% of adults <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/crime/are-third-domestic-abuse-victims-men/\">report having experienced domestic abuse in the last year</a>, the overwhelming majority of them women; <a href=\"https://www.refuge.org.uk/our-work/forms-of-violence-and-abuse/domestic-violence/domestic-violence-the-facts/\">two women a week</a> are killed by a current or former partner. Since social distancing restrictions came into force last month, there are alarming signs that domestic abuse has surged; the National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52157620\">a 25% increase</a> in calls, and the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-4-000-domestic-abuse-arrests-in-london-in-just-six-weeks-police-say-11978358\">Metropolitan police have reported a 2</a><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-4-000-domestic-abuse-arrests-in-london-in-just-six-weeks-police-say-11978358\">4% increase</a> in charges and cautions for domestic abuse. The pandemic also makes it more difficult for women to access help: not just because they may be constantly monitored at home, but because <a href=\"https://safelives.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/SafeLives%20survey%20of%20frontline%20domestic%20abuse%20organisations%20for%20COVID-19%2030.03.20_0.pdf\">three quarters of domestic abuse services</a> have reported having to reduce their services, because of staff self-isolating and social distancing requirements.</p> <p>This week, the long-delayed domestic abuse bill will return to parliament for its second reading. It comprises some welcome measures, including the creation of a statutory definition of domestic abuse, which includes emotional, coercive and economic abuse as well as physical violence, and the legal establishment of a domestic abuse commissioner. But it goes nowhere near far enough in tackling the hurt that is going on behind closed doors.</p> <p>The nature of domestic abuse means that properly addressing and preventing it is relatively resource intensive: it is not simply a matter of removing a woman and her children from an unsafe situation. Domestic abuse survivors need ongoing support \u2013 first, to be able to leave their abuser, and then to process the trauma that years of damage can inflict. Evidence-based perpetrator programmes are required to reduce the risk of them reoffending, either with their former partner or a new one. None of that comes cheap.</p> <p>Yet the bill provides nowhere near the level of resourcing that is needed to keep women safe. Like all locally funded services, those for domestic abuse have faced significant funding cuts over the last decade. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/housing-secretary-confirms-new-support-for-survivors-of-domestic-violence\">extra funding</a> announced by government in February for refuge services will not fill the gap \u2013 the number of refuge spaces in the UK is almost a third lower <a href=\"https://1q7dqy2unor827bqjls0c4rn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Domestic-Abuse-Report-2020-The-Annual-Audit.pdf\">than that recommended by the Council of Europe</a> \u2013 and there has been no extra funding allocated for community services, which are accessed by most domestic abuse survivors. While the legislation would give the police greater powers to enforce domestic abuse protection orders, the government is planning no resources or training for already stretched law forces.</p> <p>The bill also does nothing to recognise that the government is complicit in the abuse of migrant women through its hostile environment policies. Many have no recourse to public funds and so are unable to access statutory support, leaving them trapped in life-threatening situations. Abused women whose migrant status is insecure are put off from seeking help from the police because it can result in their deportation and separation from their children; too often abusers know this and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/03/domestic-abuse-laws-to-be-brought-back-before-parliament\">use it as yet another weapon of intimidation</a>. All victims of domestic abuse and their children should be entitled to support, regardless of their immigration status.</p> <p>The cost of properly resourcing domestic abuse services pales in comparison to its huge societal cost, which the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-economic-and-social-costs-of-domestic-abuse\">government estimates at \u00a366bn</a> a year. It is small change compared with the vast sums that have been rightly found to protect the economy through the pandemic.

  "<p>When Marama Davidson, ahead of an official trip to New Zealand\u2019s Hawkes Bay, found out that low-income families living in motels there would be evicted to make way for visiting dignitaries like her, she refused to be part of it.</p> <p>After Davidson \u2013 co-leader of the left-leaning Green party that is part of New Zealand\u2019s power-sharing government led by Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour \u2013 saw the headlines, she cancelled the booking and packed a tent in her suitcase instead.</p> <p>\u201cThey were kicking people out of motels that were being used for emergency housing,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I hate that we\u2019ve got people living in motels, but I don\u2019t want to be the reason for them to live in the car for a week.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Davidson had an even better time at the campground during the trip to visit the M\u0101ori performing arts festival Te Matatini, she says. The young performers and their families were staying there too; she fixed her hair and makeup for official events in the communal bathroom block alongside them and \u201cwas stealing all their babies\u201d while groups rehearsed.</p> <p>\u201cCamping is my deal,\u201d Davidson, 46, says. So are the arts; her father is the actor Rawiri Paratene and her mother an activist; she was raised at the heart of a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/google-disney-maori-new-zealand\">M\u0101ori cultural renaissance</a> \u2013 political, linguistic, creative \u2013 with some of New Zealand\u2019s most towering Indigenous writers, artists and agitators as her doting babysitters.

Two other adult children live nearby. Davidson is working \u201c14 to 16 hour\u201d days in politics, representing the Green party on a parliamentary committee set up to scrutinise the government\u2019s response to the virus. She seeks refuge from the chaos in the garage, or with her laptop balanced atop a stack of books on two bar stools in the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand I\u2019ve been able to put my children to bed every night and that has been an absolute luxury for me,\u201d she says, adding that in order to spend time with her family in the evenings, she is often still working at 2am.</p> <p>Politics is emphatically not \u201cfor life\u201d for Davidson, but her husband and children agreed that the chance to lead a political party was worth the sacrifice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Do the work.

Her point about the difficulties of survival on welfare in New Zealand was drowned out by rancour over her wrongdoing, but Davidson says Turei\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d had \u201cchanged the narrative\u201d about poverty in New Zealand.</p> <p>Journalists who ask her about welfare payment increases these days, she says, are on the side of the beneficiaries. But when Davidson learned the woman who mentored her into politics was stepping aside less than two months before the 2017 election , she had \u201ca very raw moment of grief and feeling quite bewildered as to whether I could carry on\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe way I reconciled it was: \u2018Do the work. Get it done,\u2019\u201d she recalls. She cried in her car outside a campaign event. Less than a year later, she was the party\u2019s co-leader.</p> <p>Before Turei had urged her into politics, Davidson worked at New Zealand\u2019s human rights commission for a decade. Her penchant for activism, combined with an absence of ministerial portfolios allows Davidson more flexibility to petition the government than she might otherwise have.</p> <p>Her best-known stand came as an opposition MP when she was thrown out of parliament for objecting to the then-prime minister John Key\u2019s accusation that his opponents supported \u201crapists.\u201d She stood in the debating chamber and referred to her own sexual assault; the demand that she leave prompted a walk-out in support from other lawmakers, many of whom said they had been assaulted too.</p> <p>She spoke further about the abuse, which had happened when she was a young child, on a news podcast in 2018. It generated a huge outpouring \u2013 talkback callers, messages, headlines \u2013 of support and recognition.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to affect you until you see it in broad daylight out in the world,\u201d Davidson says, of sharing the story. \u201cAnd then I saw I saw it all around the place and then I was like, \u2018What have I done?
