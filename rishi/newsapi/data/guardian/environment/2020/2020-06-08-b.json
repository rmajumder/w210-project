class=\"block-title\">Lockdowns reduced infection rate by 81%, study finds</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people\u2019s movements preventing an estimated 3.1m deaths by the beginning of May, with 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say.</p> \n  <p>Outbreak modellers at Imperial College London said that lockdown slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81% and lowered the reproduction number, R, of the epidemic below 1 in all countries they observed.</p> \n  <p>When R is less than 1 the epidemic is in decline because on average, each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other. As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. </p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.</p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans. Some 5.1% of the UK population was infected, according to a report <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">published in Nature</a>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur model estimates that we are very far away from herd immunity,\u201d said Axel Gandy, a professor of statistics at Imperial and co-author on the study. Herd immunity is achieved when enough people are immune to a virus that outbreaks die out naturally. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe upwards of 70% of the population would need to be resistant for herd immunity to kick in. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt tells us we need to be very careful and not to release too much in one go because then you have no control,\u201d Prof Gandy said. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully and do things slowly, so we can backtrack should they not work.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T15:11:40.880Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede31e98f083999a26dc398\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T12:53:36.098Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Authorities in <strong>Pakistan</strong> have stepped up efforts to enforce protocols after the number of coronavirus infections surpassed 100,000. </p> \n  <p>Official statistics released today showed 103,671 confirmed cases and 2,067 from Covid-19.

  "<p><strong>What&nbsp;was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? </strong>James Milner\u2019s incredible goalline clearance at Anfield feels a lifetime ago but there were some green shoots despite a dispiriting defeat to Liverpool that in many ways was symptomatic of Bournemouth\u2019s season to date. Unsettled from the moment Steve Cook was forced off through injury, within 15 minutes Liverpool had turned the tables after seizing on sloppy mistakes. But Eddie Howe was understandably encouraged by the manner in which his side threatened, finding joy on the counterattack and they would have equalised through Ryan Fraser but for Milner\u2019s intervention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/29/eddie-howe-bournemouth-manager-interview-piano\">Eddie Howe: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be told my team didn\u2019t play well by my piano teacher\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A week earlier, they had Chelsea on the ropes but failed to eke out victory. Bournemouth&nbsp;have never been so ensconced in a Premier League relegation battle with nine games to go and, as Howe knows, there is little margin for error when they return.</p> <p><strong>What about now? </strong>Finally, Bournemouth can unleash David Brooks after an injury-plagued 12 months for the winger who has twice undergone surgery because of an ankle complaint. Meanwhile Lloyd Kelly, an exciting \u00a313m arrival from Bristol City last summer, is primed for his first taste of Premier League action after being bogged down by ankle and thigh injuries. The treatment room is sparse compared to March, with Charlie Daniels, who is yet to return to training following knee surgery, set to be the only notable absentee when Crystal Palace visit next weekend. Howe feels this is the strongest squad he has assembled but, until now, there has inevitably been frustration at not being able to fully utilise it. The run-in is tricky, with trips to Wolves, Manchester City and Manchester United but Bournemouth should return with more oomph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>Getting a significant tune out of Ryan Fraser would be a major boon given he confessed to being sidetracked by transfer speculation for the first few months of the campaign.&nbsp;\u201cI wasn\u2019t myself, I didn\u2019t play for the team. I\u2019m honest enough to admit that,\u201d he told the BBC in January.&nbsp;No Bournemouth player has made more top-flight appearances than the winger this season but his influence has undoubtedly waned. Fraser is set to depart on a free transfer this summer, seven years on from joining as a teenager from Aberdeen for \u00a3400,000, and one last hurrah would likely ensure a happy ending for all parties. Bournemouth yielded seven points from the last available nine at home and extending that form behind closed doors would be handy.</p> <p><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? </strong>There has been one blemish \u2013 Jordon Ibe\u2019s foolish decision to breach lockdown guidelines by inviting celebrity barber Nikky Okyere to cut his hair and then publicising his flouting of the rules on Instagram. He posted a since-deleted image of him wearing a mask and a gown that carried the stylist\u2019s rather apt slogan: \u201cBreaking The Rules &amp; Changing The Game\u201d. Bournemouth launched an investigation and Ibe released a grovelling apology.&nbsp;The 24-year-old, who arrived at Bournemouth from Liverpool in 2016 for a then club-record \u00a315m, has been training with the under-21s since December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f7a4233b54b53c0e972ae96d983941f98e488b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f7a4233b54b53c0e972ae96d983941f98e488b8/1227_0_1794_2111/850.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Smith has enjoyed being back in training.\" width=\"850\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Smith has enjoyed being back at training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Any unsung/community heroes? </strong>Howe became the first Premier League manager to take a voluntary pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis, while the squad donated a six-figure sum to Bournemouth Churches Housing Association, which supports victims of domestic abuse. Several players and staff contacted vulnerable and isolated supporters. Adam Smith, who was born in east London, donated 10 iPads to Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow to enable Covid-19 patients to communicate with their families via FaceTime. The club is also considering bearing a message to key workers on their shirts for the remainder of the season after ending its sponsorship deal with betting company M88.</p> <p><strong>Key player in the run-in? </strong>Jefferson Lerma \u2013 the lungs of the team. The combative midfielder is walking a disciplinary tightrope given he is a yellow card away from a two-match suspension, but Bournemouth need him to make his presence felt. His reputation as the team\u2019s bouncer sometimes precedes him but there is more to Lerma than firefighting and putting his head in where it hurts.</p> <p><strong>End-of-season-prediction</strong>

On Monday the US attorney general, William Barr, stated there were no plans to extradite the prince.</p> \n<p>Asked during a Fox News interview on Monday whether the US has officially asked Britain to hand over Andrew, Barr said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of handing him over.

The prince had known the billionaire since 1999 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-what-you-need-to-know\">stayed at several of his residences</a>.</p> \n<p>Andrew has been accused of having sex with a young woman provided by Epstein, Virginia Giuffre, when she was 17 \u2013 a claim he categorically denies. In November the prince was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/19/emily-maitlis-prince-andrew-was-unleashed-he-wanted-to-tell-me-everything\">interviewed by the Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis</a> about his relationship with the disgraced financier.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His remarks sparked a public backlash, and a few days later Andrew issued a statement saying that he would \u201cstep back from public duties for the foreseeable future\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prince, who has always denied any wrongdoing, added: \u201cI continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein ... Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, in January, Berman gave a public statement implying there had been \u201czero cooperation\u201d with the investigation from Prince Andrew. In March, Berman claimed the duke had \u201ccompletely shut the door\u201d on cooperating with the US investigation.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Blackfords hit back, saying in a statement: \u201cThe Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ. Unfortunately, the DoJ has reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming that the duke has offered zero cooperation. In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn 27 January 2020, Mr Geoffrey S Berman, the United States attorney for the southern district of New York, chose to make a public statement about the duke. This led to worldwide media reports that there had been \u2018a wall of silence\u2019 and that there had been \u2018zero co-operation\u2019 by the duke. These statements were inaccurate, and they should not have been made.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn 9 March 2020, Mr Berman made further public statements saying that the duke had \u2018completely shut the door\u2019 on cooperating with the US investigation and that they are now \u2018considering\u2019 further options. Again, the first statement was inaccurate and should not have been made.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statement added: \u201cIt is a matter of regret that the DoJ has seen fit to breach its own rules of confidentiality, not least as they are designed to encourage witness cooperation. Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied by press briefings in the US, he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen. Further, those same breaches of confidentiality by the DoJ have given the global media \u2013 and, therefore, the worldwide audience \u2013 an entirely misleading account of our discussions with them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later on Monday, Berman&nbsp;issued his own public statement in response, saying: \u201cToday, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offences committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, even though the prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally \u2013 through the very same counsel who issued today\u2019s release \u2013 that he would not come in for such an interview.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open and we await word of when we should expect him.\u201d </p> \n<p>A Department of Justice spokesperson in the US said it \u201cdoes not publicly comment on communications with foreign governments on investigative matters, including confirming or denying the very existence of such communications\u201d.</p>",

He said: \u201cWe must capitalise on this moment of change and that\u2019s why I have now tasked City Hall officials to work on an urgent new action plan to be developed with community groups and the police, but all public bodies need to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe plan will look to improve trust and confidence as well as transparency, and is intended to cover how our communities can better scrutinise policy and tactics that are still a source of concern in 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the West Midlands, where BLM protests closed part of the M6 on Sunday night, the police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, said he would convene a meeting of community leaders on Thursday to hear concerns that would be passed on to police.</p> \n<p>A public order policing expert warned of the risk of serious rioting if police were pressured into taking a heavier hand with protesters. Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, said: \u201cThe potential as we move on is for widespread rioting and what we are trying to avoid at the moment is a major escalation of public discontent, which is quite clearly there given the levels of mobilisation that are going on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose levels of mobilisation are very much about police action towards the black community. If we are to ignite a situation where police action is seen to be acting disproportionately again towards that community we are in very dangerous territory indeed.\u201d</p> \n<p>After police stood by and watched the statue toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">statue of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">the colonialist Cecil Rhodes</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happened in Bristol is the catalyst for this protest,\u201d said Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a global surge against anti-blackness which has allowed us to rejuvenate that debate. It\u2019s what we saw with Colston \u2013 it was Black Lives Matter who took down that statue of a slave owner. We\u2019re reaffirming our demands to Oxford that they should themselves take this down as a matter of principle and matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The campaign group\u2019s demand was backed by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. She said: \u201cThe statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. That\u2019s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.\u201d The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she was not endorsing vigilante action, but urged Oriel College \u201cto think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it\u201d. Thames Valley police said they supported the public\u2019s right to peaceful protest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3/0_364_6336_3802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as the action in Bristol, tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday.

As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. <br></p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the <strong>UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany</strong>, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.<br></p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans.

  "<p>The highest-profile presenters on the UK\u2019s biggest black music radio station have accused their own parent company of failing when it comes to responding to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>Capital Xtra breakfast show hosts Yinka Bokinni and Shayna Marie Birch-Campbell said they were \u201cembarrassed\u201d by statements on race issued by Global Radio in response to the recent protests.</p> <p>\u201cAs two black women who front the breakfast show on the biggest black music station in the UK we were honestly embarrassed by the response from Capital Xtra, especially the seemingly \u2018copy and paste\u2019 job in terms of the statement released,\u201d the pair wrote in a joint statement on an internal discussion board, according to messages passed to the Guardian by concerned members of staff.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to receive messages from black people who work in the company who are scared of coming forward and at first we weren\u2019t even sure if this was a forum for presenters to share their opinions, but honestly we don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p> <p>The pair said progress on race needed to be made across Global Media, the privately controlled conglomerate that owns stations including Capital Radio, Heart, and Smooth. It also owns LBC which includes among its presenters the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, whose on-air criticism of the protests has angered some staff at Capital Xtra.</p> <p>Bokinni and Birch-Campbell said: \u201cHonestly, we are exhausted. As black women in the public eye and forward-facing representatives of this company who are actively speaking out against white privilege and fighting for change, we currently don\u2019t feel like we have the backing of the place we call home.

All of our outdoor digital displays will concurrently also carry appropriate messaging.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 12 months, representation for ethnic minorities has increased from 8% to 13%. The Global Academy at which 39% of the students are from a BAME background recently enabled 15 apprentices to start full-time apprenticeships at Global.</p> <p>\u201cAll this said, we recognise there is still a lot of work to do \u2026 Like a lot of businesses, we are honest enough to say that we are still finding our feet and learning fast.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Bristol made a fortune out of the slavery business. For a century and a half, from the late 17th century until the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, its merchants, ships and warehouses played a key role in the extraordinarily cruel system that saw men, women and children taken from West Africa to British colonies in the Americas, where they were forced to provide free labour to sugar growers and rum distillers. Edward Colston, whose statue in Bristol\u2019s centre was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">pulled down by Black Lives Matter protesters</a> on Sunday afternoon and dumped in the river, was a leading figure in the slave-trading Royal African Company. He shared responsibility for the transportation of an estimated 84,000 Africans, around 19,000 of whom are thought to have died at sea.</p> \n<p>Bristol is not unique in owing much of its 18th-century wealth to slavery. The docks of Liverpool and Glasgow were two more hubs of the system. London was its financial and political centre. But the extent of Colston\u2019s philanthropy in his home city, as well as the decision to erect a statue of him there in 1895, have made the local arguments about slavery\u2019s legacy there particularly fraught. Had the city council been able to broker an agreement on the wording of a new plaque that was due to be appended to the statue, acknowledging Colston\u2019s crimes and victims, it might never have been so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\" title=\"\">spectacularly toppled</a>.</p> \n<p>With a police investigation under way and the eventual fate of the statue to be determined, the struggle over Colston\u2019s posthumous reputation is far from over. Already, the weekend\u2019s events have accelerated moves to rename Bristol\u2019s biggest music venue, Colston Hall. In a city that is already deeply divided along racial lines, and where inequality was <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/events-conferences/latestNews/ethnic-inequalities-briefings-january-2017.html\" title=\"\">found by recent research to be growing</a>, the challenge for local politicians and others in favour of change is to carry as large as possible a segment of public opinion with them.</p> \n<p>It will never be possible to draw a neat line between public symbols such as statues or street names and the systemic inequality and prejudice that blight so many lives in Britain. Many of the problems of minority communities are closely tied to poverty and the low-quality housing and health that go with it. But it was not a coincidence that the city where the monument was targeted is well known for being poorly integrated and for its troubling history. Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, who is of African-Caribbean descent, said on Monday that he had found the statue \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-52962356\" title=\"\">an affront to me and people like me</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>The built environment in the UK is chock-full of statues. Conversations about these objects, the spaces they command and the messages they send should be part of a much bigger discussion of our nation\u2019s history. How to remember the vicious business of slavery, and the imperial project that carried on long after it was abolished in 1833, is not just a challenge for Bristol.</p>",

Finally, at about 4am on 2 June when his condition was getting dramatically worse, Narender was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit in Max Patparganj private hospital and put on a ventilator, but only when his family agreed to pay a deposit of 50,000 rupees (\u00a3520).But he was not permitted to stay.</p> <p>\u201cThe next morning, when the test result came through that he had tested positive for Covid-19, the hospital told us they were unable to admit him because there were no beds and no ventilators for Covid-19 patients, so we would have to take him somewhere else,\u201d said Vikas. \u201cI could not believe it.

Somehow, the ritual of putting out washing became my little Covid-zen moment.&nbsp;</p> <p>As things start to loosen up, it\u2019s still the highlight of my working-from-home day.

It means no more regular trips to the hairdresser to hide the dreaded regrowth, no more chemicals and no more exorbitant fees. Freedom!&nbsp;</p> <h2>I took up online learning</h2> <p><em>Denise Cullen<br><br></em>As a forensic psychologist, I need to engage in continuing professional development to maintain registration. Mirroring the transition to remote client consultations through telehealth, the Australian Psychological Society brought lots of its training online. One night I might be participating in a webinar about differentiating child sexual abusers; another night countering violent extremism; the next conducting evaluations remotely.</p> <p>But to balance that up, I\u2019ve also been doing some purely for fun stuff \u2013 Lauren Bath\u2019s online photography course and Ivy Newport\u2019s Flight and Feather encaustic art class.</p> <p>I love the flexibility of online learning \u2013 being able to sign in whenever it suits. It\u2019s also more affordable than attending in-person training. A lot of the APS training was available at no cost; while other online providers offered discounted classes. The informal networking opportunities aren\u2019t the same online, but from a flexibility and cost point of view, it definitely trumps face to face.</p> <h2>I became a runner</h2> <p><em>Josh Taylor</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c56529d7e6be8f08ddee0e7ded4757784f85dc23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56529d7e6be8f08ddee0e7ded4757784f85dc23/0_41_5400_3239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early morning male jogger silhouetted against the skyline of the city of Melbourne, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Taylor: \u2018I get through so many podcasts and I\u2019ve discovered so much more of my local area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Freeman/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the pandemic took hold, my gym closed and I started working from home, I worried about not being able to exercise and lethargy setting in. So I started a combination of walking, jogging and running around my suburb, so I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d just been sitting at my laptop all day.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s something I can\u2019t do without. I\u2019m up to between 6-8km a day. I get through so many podcasts and I\u2019ve discovered so much more of my local area. Parks, shops and restaurants that I never knew were there before.</p> <p>Gyms are reopening later this month, but I am hopeful I can keep this daily habit mixed in with regular workouts. The difficulty will be once the commute to the office returns \u2013 the laziness will set in again. Not to mention Melbourne\u2019s winter.</p> <h2>I detoxed my Instagram feed</h2> <p><em>Melissa Pearce</em></p> <p>Seven days into lockdown it was clear I needed to take a Marie Kondo wand to social media. The content of my Instagram seemed especially off-kilter \u2013 2,697 pages of blue French lace corsets or Costa Rican sunsets. Then it came to me \u2013 to start a fresh with a new page and only follow accounts that would help inspire and comfort.

I had always dabbled in weekly menu planning, getting a large shop and then mapping out the week\u2019s dinners to allow for variety and limiting waste, but frequently, in the pre-times, this would be thrown off by life or the ability to pick up food at a whim.</p> <p>During coronavirus lockdown with our need to limit visits to the shops or deliveries, our badly-kept-to habit took on a new necessity. Taking 10 minutes out at the arrival of a grocery haul sounds tedious, but it meant our meals were more interesting, our food waste fell to zero and we spent about a quarter less on groceries than usual. This one, she\u2019s a keeper.</p> <h2><strong>I learned to balance (on one leg)</strong></h2> <p><em>Steph Harmon</em></p> <p>A boring thing to talk about is how you have finally discovered balance in lockdown. It is much cooler to talk about how you have used this time to learn how to balance on one foot, like a literal child.</p> <p>Two years ago, a physio told me to stand in front of her on one leg and then the other, and narrowed her eyes at me as I fell over immediately, twice. Mortifying.</p> <p>Now, with the freedom of working from home, I suddenly have time for the exercises I lied about doing for six months\u2019 worth of paid consultations \u2013 and two months later, I can balance. Sometimes for a full minute, even 90 seconds; sometimes holding on to my big toe and stretching my lifted leg out in front of me; sometimes kicking it out straight behind me in a yoga pose that is meant to look graceful but in fact looks bad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/20/i-designed-myself-a-syllabus-of-quarantine-goals-then-spent-weeks-eating-cereal-in-bed\">'I designed myself a syllabus of quarantine goals \u2013 then spent weeks eating cereal in bed'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The epic concentration required has the added bonus of completely shutting my mind down in a way I never quite managed with yoga. I pine for the days that I can loudly challenge my colleagues to a balance-off in the shared office kitchen. Until then I will settle for bragging about my dumb skill on a global news site.</p> <h2>I rediscovered reading</h2> <p><em>Shaad D\u2019Souza</em></p> <p>I know it\u2019s something of a cardinal sin for a writer-by-trade to not really be a reader, but for the past few years, I\u2019ve never really been able to find the time (or drive) to read books. Since I started writing and editing, my day-to-day has been a constant jumble of thinkpieces and corrections, news aggregation and email sending. By the time I clock off, there\u2019s little I want to do less than read.</p> <p>Most years, I\u2019m lucky if I finish five books. When the pandemic hit, my full-time contract was cut by about 75%, and many of the outlets I would usually freelance with cut budgets, so I was suddenly left with a lot of spare time and a lot of books I\u2019d accumulated and never read.</p> <p>Now, one of my lockdown joys is reading books again; I re-read Melissa Broder\u2019s The Pisces<em> </em>two weeks ago, and will probably finish Natasha Stagg\u2019s Sleeveless<em> </em>tonight. I\u2019ve got another two books lined up to read after that, and, even though restrictions are slowly lifting, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll kick this habit too quickly. It seems obvious, but I\u2019m finding that reading challenges me to sit with silence and helps build an attention span that\u2019s been getting shorter and shorter.</p> <p>Most of all, reading provides a kind of true escapism, free of notifications and news updates. And nowadays that, above all, is what I crave most.&nbsp;</p> <h2>My hands are finally clean</h2> <p><em>Alyx Gorman</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d7c1484217467c0b79055c90646a4d4a04ebf72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d7c1484217467c0b79055c90646a4d4a04ebf72/0_249_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman washing her hands with soap and water at a sink\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alyx Gorman: \u2018It costs nothing, takes little time, and I\u2019ve come to find the ritual quite pleasant.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: baona/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometime in late February, well before lockdown, we were taught a simple way to stop the spread: don\u2019t touch your face. As this super-cut of people<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/05/coronavirus-officials-touch-faces/\"> touching their faces</a> immediately after telling us not to makes clear, it\u2019s an impossible directive.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the other \u201cstop the spread\u201d suggestion \u2013 regular hand washing \u2013 is incredibly achievable. And I wasn\u2019t doing it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve always washed my hands after using the bathroom or before I cook (I\u2019m not an animal), but that was it. I didn\u2019t wash my hands after handling money. I didn\u2019t wash my hands after grocery shopping. I didn\u2019t wash my hands after being on public transport. And then, because it\u2019s impossible not to, I touched my face.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now I wash my hands routinely and diligently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E\">just like WHO tells us to</a>. It costs nothing, takes little time, and I\u2019ve come to find the ritual quite pleasant. I\u2019m a relatively frequent cold-catcher, but even as the temperatures have dipped, I\u2019ve not gotten sick.</p> <p>It shouldn\u2019t have taken a pandemic to teach me to do this \u2013 primary school should have done the trick.

This ... in my view is racist in itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In some respects Patel\u2019s argument echoed that made by another BAME minister, the equalities minister <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, in a Twitter thread at the weekend.

In 2019, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47670756\">fix a plaque to the pedestal</a> collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/second-colston-statue-plaque-not-2682813\">watering down the text</a>, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026</p> \n   <p>Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bristol\">Bristol</a> was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre?

And there are many, many examples throughout history \u2013 from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, protests on behalf of gay rights \u2013 men and women following these people have been prepared to break the law because they believe that the issue of justice, that they wanted to shine a light on, is a bigger project.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He called for more statues of people like slave traders to be removed.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid the time has come in the United Kingdom to look at these statues and say is it now right to celebrate these people who murdered so many men, women and children.

It explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain.

We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%.</p> \n   <p>We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected. We found that while reported estimates vary between surveys because of differences in wording or in how the survey was completed, chronic loneliness does not seem to have changed significantly as a result of lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>People experiencing chronic loneliness or \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d were also likely to score less well on three of the key measures used to measure wellbeing (ie, happiness), as this chart shows.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042/0_0_1278_1226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"959\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T11:03:24.412Z\">at 12.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede03b68f083999a26dc127\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:24:30.978Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eddfb5c8f083999a26dc0e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:21:14.070Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer's LBC phone-in - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Labour leader, at PMQs and elsewhere, <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> seems to be adopting a strategy of presenting himself as Westminster\u2019s responsible adult, or designated driver \u2013 the leader offering mainstream, sensible, evidence-based politics. He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran.

  "<p>History is made and unmade in a moment. To witness such moments is thrilling. Watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">the statue of Edward Colston pulled down</a> was beautiful. A symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that hurt no one, and one that taught many of us so much.</p> <p>I am trying to learn and listen. Some things about the Black Lives Matter protests are very new and some are very old. No one is interested in white tears, but, hopefully, my political education continues and my views evolve. Before my daughter went off to the protest in London, we had a conversation about direct action. The visceral thrill of pulling down fences at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/20/greenham-common-nuclear-silos-women-protest-peace-camp\">Greenham Common in the 80s</a> remains with me, as does being caught in various riots \u2013 kettled before they used that word. Police horses are scary, I told her, and she was incredulous, as horses belong to the olden days. I told her about being searched under the \u201csus\u201d laws because I was with a friend who had committed the crime of being black and having a decent car.</p> <p>She returned from the protest confident that something else had been toppled: the myth that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/07/extinction-rebellion-arrestables-photo-essay\">the Extinction Rebellion </a>activists were so white and old because&nbsp;young BAME people were not politicised.</p> <p>Why does the statue of a slaver being rolled into the water mean so much? Well, all those saying it should have been done another way can read the recent local history. Councillors in Bristol have been debating whether to remove the statue for years. There was a weird compromise proposed that another plaque be put up noting Colston\u2019s enslavement of an estimated 84,000 Africans, of whom 19,000 died, and that, as a Tory MP, Colston defended Bristol\u2019s right to trade slaves. This plaque met with objections, less \u201coffensive\u201d plaques were suggested and, meanwhile, there he stood, offensively. It was direct action that brought him down.</p> <p>I applaud this, as it brought to the fore Britain\u2019s role in the slave trade, and this is exactly what links the protests here and the protests in the US. We know off by heart the Tory narrative on this: our racism is nicer than US racism. Don\u2019t mention Windrush or Grenfell. Protesters are thugs. And they say this as we see the faces of those who have died in the pandemic, so many of whom just happen to be black or Asian.</p> <p>We play out our identity politics in sad postcolonial denial. Brexit, of course, is the ultimate form of identity politics for those who decry such things. It is much easier to ship the cargo of racism and police brutality across the water than to look at our own history. Our leaders are not only in denial about the long-gone empire; they don\u2019t even seem to understand that the Irish border exists.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can argue over what having a black president achieved, but we know what having a white supremacist in power means</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, they are not the only ones with gaps in their historical knowledge. Mine are huge, and, watching all this, I think about what I learned from living in the US and how I learned it. In the late 1970s, I worked in a restaurant in Louisiana where the very old lady who shucked the oysters said that as a girl she was a slave in all but name \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89051115&amp;t=1591631928184\">what the historians now call \u201cneoslavery\u201d</a>. Slavery didn\u2019t just end when the books told us it did. Every desirable property in New Orleans at the time came with \u201cslave quarters\u201d, although I have no idea what the estate agents call them now. I realised I knew nothing really about the American civil war, but, without understanding that, parts of the US don\u2019t really make sense. The independence that the confederate soldiers fought for was based on what were politely referred to as \u201csouthern institutions\u201d, and the chief institution was slavery. The desperation and poverty of black America cannot be seen outside this context. Nor can the tearing down of confederate flags.</p> <p>Years later in Louisville, where another man was brutally murdered by the police, my friend, the writer David Matthews, took me to the Muhammad Ali Centre. Ali, this great hero, could not eat in the same restaurants as white people in his home town. So many Vietnam vets were there in wheelchairs to pay respects. It stayed with me. We were there to cover Barack Obama\u2019s run for the presidency. We can argue all day over what having a black president achieved, but we sure as hell know what having a white supremacist in power means.</p> <p>So we watch and repeat the phrase \u201cstructural racism\u201d, which is useful, but somehow absolves us of action. It is a harder thing for many to grasp than a statue. This structure does not float above history \u2013 it is its deep foundation. In this country, the reckoning with the days of empire happens mostly on a cultural level. This is part of white privilege, from which I benefit doubtless. As the DJ Clara Amfo, quoting Amanda Seales, said so powerfully: \u201cYou cannot just enjoy the rhythm and ignore the blues.\u201d</p> <p>No we can\u2019t, and it is vital to make the connections between the Black Lives Matter protests everywhere and to educate ourselves. There is much I have not understood; there will be things I continue to not understand. There will be times when other things matter, too. As Audre Lorde said: \u201cThere is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives.\u201d Amen to that.</p> <p>But there are single instances when, as if tuning a radio, the static disappears and suddenly the sound is perfect and resonant, and we can hear what we need to hear: the sloshing as the statue fell unceremoniously into the water and the shrieks of joy from the protesters.</p> <p>Yes. We heard that. We heard it loud and clear.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist.</p>",
  "<p>Finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">Colston </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">has fallen</a>. Would I have tugged the rope? I don\u2019t think&nbsp;so. As attractive as it seems, as right as is the cause, that route seems ultimately problematic. What happens when far-right yahoos reflect their warped view of the world by yanking down a statue they don\u2019t like? They\u2019ll be wrong, of course, but they\u2019ll happily and spuriously claim that a precedent has now been set for such actions.</p> <p>But now that Colston statue has crashed to earth, few will shed many tears about it and Bristol would be foolish to even think&nbsp;of putting him back. Some landmarks we can argue about, but a statue whose inscription actively lauded Edward Colston, who made his riches in the 17th-century slave-trade, in the middle of modern-day Bristol became a daily insult to much of that city\u2019s population and to those of us whose efforts and those of their descendants have made this country what it is.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a valid argument&nbsp;to be had about how history is fairly represented, but we weren\u2019t really having it. Dialogue only occurs when two sides are listening. In this case there was talking but not a great deal of listening. \u201cThere has been a lot of controversy about this statue for many years \u2013 so the question is why didn\u2019t those in the local authority consider taking it down long before rather than waiting for these actions?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/police-federation-chairman-criticises-police-18379750\">said </a><a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/police-federation-chairman-criticises-police-18379750\">John Apter</a>, the chair of the Police Federation.&nbsp;As much as one abhors unlawful direct action, it is important to understand what can happen in a society when democracy seems shorn of good faith, goodwill and responsiveness.&nbsp;</p> <p>This will be a continuing problem for the Conservative government in coming weeks. It will be attempting to grapple with the multiple&nbsp;pockets of turbulence created by the killing of George Floyd \u2013 as evidenced by the resurgent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/07/just-the-beginning-voices-from-the-black-lives-matter-protest-in-london-video\">Black Lives Matter </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/07/just-the-beginning-voices-from-the-black-lives-matter-protest-in-london-video\">movement</a> \u2013 and the allied fear, confusion, and anger surrounding the Johnson administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are different issues, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/censorship-row-over-report-on-uk-bame-covid-19-deaths\">they intersect</a>. If you are black, they both speak to an extraordinary, and lethal, unfairness.&nbsp;</p> <p>And one also clearly feeds from the other,&nbsp;for the pandemic and the&nbsp;world\u2019s reaction to it have already taught us that nothing is immutable. We have in just a few months reshaped our lives, reshaped our economy, emptied our public areas, cut ties we thought would always bind. It has been a revelation. Inevitably the proof that, with the will, we can act decisively to address things we judge vital prompts many to ask: \u201cIf we can move mountains to address a pandemic, how can we continue to say other problems are insoluble?\u201d </p> <p>How can we say that citizens with brown skins suffer longstanding and widespread discrimination \u2013 on the streets, in their schools, in the workplace and the jobs market, in the media, in the criminal justice system \u2013 but that it\u2019s too difficult to do anything about it? How can we say there&nbsp;is no way to address the mindset that defines law enforcement as forcing a knee on to a stricken man\u2019s neck? Our reaction to the pandemic has saved countless lives, but in so doing it has also shown that anything is possible. I believe that revelation did for Colston\u2019s statue and it fuels much of the anger we now see on the streets around the world.</p> <p>Boris Johnson must deal with that, but it is a task for which the prime minister&nbsp;and his government are spectacularly ill-suited. They don\u2019t&nbsp;know how. They have no emotional capital. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-defence-dominic-cummings-anger-from-allies-and-opponents-alike\">Dominic Cummings affair</a> robbed them of any moral authority in the matter of the pandemic, and in the case of the George Floyd reverberations, they were in deficit even before they took office. What <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/07/boris-johnson-history-of-apologies-controversy-burqa-comments\">can the prime minister say</a> to black protesters? \u201cDear people; I feel your pain \u2013 I fret each day about the lives of your piccaninnies. I long to see again your watermelon smiles\u201d? What does he say to protesters about the director of his No 10 policy unit, Munira Mirza? She who complained so bitterly about race equality initiatives <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/theresa-may-s-phoney-race-war-is-dangerous-and-divisive\">on the basis that</a>:&nbsp;\u201cA lot of people in politics think it\u2019s a good idea to exaggerate the problem of racism.\u201d Can she craft&nbsp;a government policy to meet this moment? Don\u2019t hold your breath.&nbsp;</p> <p>Johnson has no ability to respond constructively to the protests on our streets and no ability to show plausible empathy, and so he will respond negatively,&nbsp;framing the debate as a matter of public&nbsp;order,&nbsp;while playing down the iniquities that led people,&nbsp;at a time of widely acknowledged viral risk, on to the street. The marches were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, he said yesterday.</p> <p>\u201cThe police have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism or disorderly behaviour,\u201d added Priti Patel, his home secretary. This is a politician who runs the Home Office, the linchpin of administrative inequality in this country \u2013 it would have been valuable to hear her say something about that. But she won\u2019t,&nbsp;and in any event it would be futile in&nbsp;terms of addressing the current turbulence. Patel backed the key planks of her party\u2019s hostile environment that&nbsp;led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-condemns-home-office-ignorance-and-thoughtlessness\">Windrush scandal</a>. Like Johnson, she has no emotional capital or interest in addressing these problems.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, with Colston\u2019s statue gone, we move into another phase. Protesters feel there is a moment to be seized, but we have a government that is unable to diagnose or constructively respond to it, and utterly ill-equipped to meet it.

But he worried that the discovery hinted at a new kind of pollution, one set to become ubiquitous after millions around the world turned to single-use plastics to combat the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s the promise of pollution to come if nothing is done,\u201d said Peltier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-world-oceans-day\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-world-oceans-day&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-world-oceans-day</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In France alone, authorities have ordered <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/fr/20200404-la-france-a-command%C3%A9-pr%C3%A8s-de-2-milliards-de-masques-en-chine\">two billion disposable masks,</a> said Laurent Lombard of Op\u00e9ration Mer Propre. \u201cKnowing that \u2026 soon we\u2019ll run the risk of having more masks than jellyfish in the Mediterranean,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2676847435931048&amp;id=100008174533123\">he wrote on social media</a> alongside video of a dive showing algae-entangled masks and soiled gloves in the sea near Antibes.</p> \n<p>The group hopes the images will prompt people to embrace reusable masks and swap latex gloves for more frequent handwashing. \u201cWith all the alternatives, plastic isn\u2019t the solution to protect us from Covid.

These are the spouses and children of British citizens. The trauma of forced separation, particularly during a global pandemic, is incredibly challenging \u2013 and what\u2019s worse is, this isn\u2019t going away after lockdown.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople won\u2019t be able to get jobs, and for those who have managed to cling on to one, they\u2019re already working crazy hours to try to meet the requirements for their husband or wife to be with them. Even then, most people still can\u2019t raise the funds.

Owen Wibberley left South Korea in early March to begin a new job in Yorkshire, and applied for a spouse visa for his wife, Misun, to follow with their two young children, both dual British-Korean nationals. Misun\u2019s passport is currently being held at a closed visa application centre in Seoul.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst part is not knowing the result of the visa application,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have informed us that a decision has been made but not what the result is. If it has been rejected then we will have spent all this additional time separated for no reason. At least if they could tell us the result then we could make more concrete plans regarding housing and major purchases, but being in a total state of limbo is infuriating.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, said the government\u2019s limited communication on the issue since the lockdown started was unacceptable.</p> <p>\u201cThe deafening silence from the Home Office is causing huge anxiety for affected couples at what is already a really worrying time. Families need to know whether they are going to have to separate or whether new rules will be introduced enabling them to stay together.

  "<p>\u201cTo be neutral, to be passive in a situation,\u201d the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/28/howard-zinn-america\">Howard Zinn</a> tells us, \u201cis to collaborate with whatever is going on.\u201d If the history of black political struggle in the US \u2013 something Zinn, a white ex-soldier, actively participated in \u2013 teaches us one thing, it is that meaningful political&nbsp;change happens not just when black and brown people take a stand against racism, but when the wider society moves from being neutral to becoming actively anti-racist.&nbsp;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/apr/14/student-nonviolent-coordinating-committee\">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a> (SNCC) was one of the most formidable organisations in the fight for civil rights. It understood that change occurs when people are moved to action. Students in northern US universities, although sympathetic to the plight of black southerners, remained passive supporters, so the SNCC organised \u201cfreedom buses\u201d for students to come and act as observers.&nbsp;</p> <p>These students witnessed lynchings, attack dogs mauling protesters and fire hoses dislocating bones, and they transformed into active anti-racists. Enraged by what they had witnessed, these students wrote home to their parents, often passive opponents of the \u201criotous\u201d civil rights protesters. On hearing of the injustices first-hand and in their children\u2019s voices, many thousands became aligned to the cause, and the entire political climate shifted in relation to the demands of southern freedom movements.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the wake of the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, we have statements of solidarity from politicians, corporations and even <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death\">police forces</a>, but these are mere gestures. To be anti-racist means to involve yourself directly in the movement to end racism, to take action. The first step toward becoming an anti-racist is reckoning with the fact that racism is systemic. As the scholar and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-davis\">Angela Davis</a> remarks: \u201cThere is an unbroken line of police violence in the US that takes us all the way back to the days of slavery.\u201d Race, as the Australian scholar Patrick Wolfe put it, is a \u201ctrace of history\u201d, a tradition travelling through several hundred years and in part facilitating the birthing of the global north and global south.</p> <p>The categorisations of race facilitated colonial conquests, enslavement and exploitative labour regimes \u2013 all engines of capitalism. Today, the political-economic setup of the global economy rests on the availability of a cheap, informal labour force, imperialist warfare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/this-changes-everything-review-naomi-klein-john-gray\">extractivism</a>, the mass incarceration of racialised people and mind-blowing inequalities in educational attainment, wages, housing and healthcare. This deep entanglement of accumulation, dispossession and violence is what is meant by the term \u201cracial capitalism\u201d. For example, in 2016 the Byron burger chain was happily employing migrant staff, some of whom worked 50 hours a week on minimum wage, until it facilitated a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/it-was-a-fake-meeting-byron-hamburgers-staff-on-immigration-raid\">Home Office raid</a> to have them deported. Staff reported that Byron entrapped them in a fake-meeting-cum-sting-operation. Racism and capitalism are inseparable.</p> <p>For these reasons, nearly all anti-racist mass movements worth their salt have recited tirelessly: ending racism, root and branch, would mean ending a global economic order predicated upon it. Anti-racism is anti-capitalist, and vice versa. There are no two ways around it. To be an anti-racist must demand a complete rejection of business as usual. An end to racism demands transformation of the global political-economic setup. This would mean paying workers fair wages across supply chains and ending the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">ethnicity pay gap</a>, which flies in the face of the primary corporate objective of profit.</p> <p>So how can you go from being a passive non-racist to an active anti-racist? Anti-racism is the fight to build a mass-participating anti-racist movement in the workplace, the street and the community. Beyond a protest, a donation, a social media post and a difficult conversation, there\u2019s work to be done in tackling the many day-to-day issues underscored by racism. Learning is an essential part of this journey, so make a reading/listening/watching list and include the autobiography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/13/assata-shakur-civil-rights-activist-fbi-most-wanted\">Assata Shakur</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/malcolm-x-man-behind-myth\">Malcolm X</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/from-emperors-to-inventors-the-unsung-heroes-to-celebrate-in-black-history-month\">Claudia Jones</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/germans-take-to-the-streets-to-celebrate-rosa-luxemburg-karl-liebknecht-berlin\">Rosa Luxemburg</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">Audre Lorde</a>.

Material changes require us to make movements from moments: this is a huge political moment, now we must build a huge political movement. We must all become anti-racist activists, black, white, brown \u2013 all of us. As activists we need to work together, outside the state agencies, which are some of the principal purveyors of systemic racism, to meet the needs of black and brown communities in Britain.&nbsp;</p> <p>Black and brown people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">four times</a> more likely to die from coronavirus than white people. Being an anti-racist activist means first of all taking up the fight for improved healthcare provisions and protective work equipment in these communities. Black and brown people are massively overrepresented in coronavirus-related searches, arrests and fines. To be an anti-racist means to fight against the sweeping new range of policing powers being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\">used disproportionately</a> against working-class racialised communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Criminalisation, gentrification, the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the closing of local public services: these are all arenas of anti-racist activism. So, find your local anti-racist organisation; if it doesn\u2019t exist then set it up. Every youth club, every school staying in the local authority, every saved estate, every anti-deportation and anti-raids group, every local police-monitoring group, will make concrete differences in improving the lives of racialised communities. When enough of these groups exist, are connected and can show solidarity with each other across cities and towns, then, and only then, will we begin to make inroads into tackling systemic racism.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Joshua Virasami is an organiser and artist whose book How To Change It is published on 3 September</p>",

Hansi Flick\u2019s side were invited in and offered a three-course meal with cheeseboard to follow and as Bosz\u2019s plans crumbled in the closing minutes of the first half, when Leon Goretzka and Serge Gnabry helped themselves to goals which swept the visitors into an unassailable 3-1 lead, <em>Die Werkself</em>\u2019s coach could do little but shake his head dejectedly on the touchline.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There was ammunition for Bosz\u2019s critics as Leverkusen made their own problems \u2013 Moussa Diaby surrendering possession to set Bayern on the way to engineering Kingsley Coman\u2019s equaliser, Aleksandar Dragovic flying out of position to create room for Goretzka to waltz through and steer in a shot that Lukas Hradecky could have done better with, or Joshua Kimmich\u2019s straight ball that easily took out the goalkeeper\u2019s protection and let Gnabry lob in a simple third\u2013 in an example of the soft underbelly that it is often claimed his charges have. Yet if the Dutchman can sometimes be justifiably accused of being inflexible from a philosophical standpoint, he couldn\u2019t be held accountable for the way his side waned from their structure, shrinking in their shoes before our eyes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1269274903284514818\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The ball from Kimmich \ud83d\ude0d<br>The finish from Gnabry \ud83d\udc4c<br><br>Bayern just have so many match-winners in the team.

He knew that the missing Kai Havertz, their best player, coveted by Bayern and a revelation since switching to centre-forward, would probably not have made the difference on this occasion. Havertz\u2019s nominal replacement, the very different Alario, had provided a crafty finish for the opener (a moment that seemed several years before by the time the inevitable Robert Lewandowski got his 30th Bundesliga goal of the season) and frankly, it was at the other end that Leverkusen had their difficulties.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe lineup might have looked like a brave one,\u201d Bosz mused afterwards, with a nod to his unsuccessful deployment of Nadiem Amiri and Leon Bailey as wing-backs, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think we played bravely enough. You also have to be brave when you have possession of the ball.\u201d That sort of confidence \u2013 something lacking in Diaby, the author of a very promising season but short of his best here \u2013 was something that Havertz might have provided.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07cdd6aad39ca1895ea15a1e0a03b359f3c39de3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07cdd6aad39ca1895ea15a1e0a03b359f3c39de3/0_0_4477_2985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Alaba in action with Paulinho during the match in front of fan banners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Alaba in action with Paulinho during the match in front of fan banners.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Europe/dpa</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was certainly present in his de facto successor. In bending a stylish consolation goal around a diving Manuel Neuer in the closing moments, substitute Florian Wirtz became the youngest goalscorer in Bundesliga history at the age of 17 years 34 days, 48 younger than Nuri Sahin when he scored for Dortmund against N\u00fcrnberg in 2005. Wirtz showed his own sang froid, barely acknowledging the moment. Bosz appreciated the goal but cared more about the teachings of a tough afternoon. \u201cThe boy had his best lesson today since he started playing,\u201d the coach emphasised.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For Bayern there is glory to come, with two wins from the last four games the maximum required to win the title for the eighth time in a row, even if they face Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach next week minus the banned Lewandowski and Thomas M\u00fcller. They are also just 12 goals short of beating their 101-goal season record from the 1971-72 campaign. For Leverkusen there is just the dogfight for fourth place to follow \u2013 but they are led by a man more sanguine and realistic than his image would have you believe.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything inked,\u201d said Julian Nagelsmann after Leipzig\u2019s disappointing home draw with bottom side Paderborn in relation to the completion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/05/timo-werner-transfer-u-turn-chelsea-liverpool-rb-leipzig\">Timo Werner\u2019s projected move to Chelsea</a>. It\u2019s all technicalities, of course, with the deal only dependent on the Blues paying up before the clause deadline of 15 June (Kicker even suggested a small discount on that near-\u20ac60m fee might be applied). The striker didn\u2019t have his best afternoon, missing a great late chance to settle the game and then seeing Christian Strohdiek strike an equaliser almost immediately, having earlier created Patrik Schick\u2019s opener.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5bd96ad30a6f7aa74be395e0964f0317ff80a5f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5bd96ad30a6f7aa74be395e0964f0317ff80a5f/0_0_5344_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timo Werner in action against Paderborn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timo Werner in action against Paderborn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 It was a great weekend, accordingly, for Borussia Dortmund, who should have beaten in-form Hertha by more than a single Emre Can goal (and were again victims of inexplicable VAR inactivity), but pulled seven points clear of fifth-placed Leverkusen as the three teams behind them all failed to win. After Jadon Sancho\u2019s undershirt display last week, all Bundesliga teams took a knee before kick-off in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Gladbach are still fourth for now, despite an infuriating defeat at Freiburg, where they\u2019ve not won since 2002. Alessane Pl\u00e9a and sporting director Max Eberl were sent off in the space of a minute after Nils Pedersen\u2019s record 24th Bundesliga goal as a substitute (he had only been on the pitch for 63 seconds) sealed the deal for Christian Streich\u2019s Euro chasers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u2022 Some relief, at last, for David Wagner, as Schalke got their first point since the restart thanks to an excellent long-range goal by Everton loanee Jonjoe Kenny at Union Berlin, which changed the course of a game in which they had been a very distant second-best.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1269631242724655104\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udfaf STRIKE \ud83c\udfaf<br><br>What a hit from Jonjoe Kenny! \ud83d\udca5<br><br>Schalke are back in it... <a href=\"https://t.co/y2LPb8RCzM\">pic.twitter.com/y2LPb8RCzM</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1269631242724655104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 And Paderborn\u2019s Klaus Gjasula matched the largest tally of yellow cards received in a Bundesliga season when being booked for the 16th time, taking him ahead of Steffen Effenberg and level with Tomasz Hajto.

  "<p>The UK should have been a world leader in tacking Covid-19. It has<strong> </strong>universal healthcare delivered through a single, joined-up system, a historically strong public health community and outstanding government scientists and scientific advisers. Instead we lead the world in the worst league tables: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-covid-19-cases-and-deaths\">Covid-19 cases and deaths</a>. The initial response from the UK government was too late, but eventually action came. Boris Johnson\u2019s address on 23 March was a strong and clear call to unite and take action together to tackle the epidemic. The whole country visibly got behind the efforts, and by early April there were clear signs the epidemic was slowing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The key tools \u2013 social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation \u2013 only work if people fully engage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the lack of a clear long-term strategy soon became obvious. Government policies have been reactive, based on short-term tactics aimed at media concerns and on short-term visible gains. This lack of strategy is clear to see. The devastating impact on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/why-did-so-many-people-die-of-covid-19-in-the-uks-care-homes\">care homes</a> was entirely predictable, yet still there is no clear strategy of mitigation and future protection. On testing, the much-vaunted targets of 100,000 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/covid-19-tests-exceed-200000-per-day-target-government-claims\">200,000 daily tests</a> will achieve nothing on their own. Testing needs to be an integral part of strategic efforts to control the epidemic. Whole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/26/more-than-two-million-operations-cancelled-as-nhs-fights-covid-19\">sections of the NHS ground to a halt</a> with no attempt at strategic planning, and general practice, which should and could have been at the forefront of efforts to control the pandemic, has been largely ignored and left to its own devices.</p> <p>In the face of a global pandemic, the government has pursued its policies in isolation. Travel policies are out of line with neighbouring countries, Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/uk-government-accused-of-cover-up-over-eu-scheme-to-buy-ppe\">failed to be part</a> of successful EU efforts to secure PPE supplies, and instead of using an internationally tried and tested tracing app, it wasted time and resources trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/07/uk-may-ditch-nhs-contact-tracing-app-for-apple-and-google-model\">develop its own</a>. Most recently we have seen a lifting of lockdown measures while new infections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">are </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">estimated to be 8,000</a> per day and with no effective case-finding system in place \u2013 patently a decision taken against scientific advice.</p> <p>Public confidence is critical to beating this epidemic because the key tools \u2013 social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation \u2013 only work if people fully engage. Two factors have massively dented public confidence, threatening control efforts. First, the obvious lack of a clear long-term strategy, which creates the impression of a government that is not in control. Second, a series of political mishaps. The health secretary blaming PPE shortages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/matt-hancock-urges-public-not-to-overuse-ppe\">on NHS staff</a>. The prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-week-of-staying-alert-that-left-the-government-in-a-daze-coronavirus-boris-johnson\">confused address</a> to the nation on 10 May. And a top government adviser \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">Dominic Cummings</a> \u2013 breaking the very spirit of collective action needed to defeat the epidemic.</p> <p>If we are to control this epidemic, we need the whole country to be united in a collective effort. To achieve this we need to restore trust in the government. A starting point would be an unequivocal apology for the mistakes made so far. For each major error we need a clear plan in place for how the negative impact will be mitigated. We then need a clear long-term strategy for minimising the future impact of the epidemic, covering the possibilities of us getting an effective or partially effective vaccine, or no vaccine at all. This strategy needs to be explained to the whole population, and as new measures are announced, they must be presented as part of this overall strategy.</p> <p>First, the government needs to be transparently guided by the scientific advice. When policy goes against that advice, as it appears to have done with recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/uk-lockdown-must-not-be-lifted-until-covid-19-transmission-is-understood-say-scientists\">relaxations in the lockdown</a>, we need a clear justification. As a scientist I accept that there will be times when wider political or economic considerations mean the chosen policy goes against the science. But we need to know the rationale to build and maintain public trust.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/after-six-months-of-coronavirus-how-close-are-we-to-defeating-it\">After six months of coronavirus, how close are we to defeating it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, we need a strategic, systematic approach to testing for Covid-19 with all results linked to people\u2019s NHS health records. This would allow us to understand how the virus is circulating in the community, in institutions, schools and workplaces, and what measures are needed to control it. Third, we need much clearer international cooperation with our partners in Europe and beyond. Fourth, we need a clear plan to minimise future damage and suffering in the care sector. And, finally, we need a clear plan to restart the currently paused functions of the NHS and engage general practice in the fight against the virus, for example as an integral part of the crucial contact-tracing initiative.</p> <p>Only with a clear strategy will we be able to unite the nation in a collective shared response to the epidemic, with everyone accepting that there will be hardship and discomfort, but that together we can beat this. The alternative could leave us facing years of continued devastation. Without collective, united action underpinned by a clear long-term strategy, I fear for us all.</p> <p>\u2022 Liam Smeeth is dean of the Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</p>",
  "<p>My grandfather, Bob Weighton, who has died from cancer, was an engineer, teacher and counsellor. He was 112, and had been the oldest man in the world for 58 days. The Guinness Book of Records delivered a certificate to him confirming this status two days after his last birthday on 29 March.</p> <p>Bob was born in Kingston-upon-Hull, east Yorkshire, to Arthur Weighton, a vet, and Eliza (nee Pitts). He was the middle child of seven, and he recalled his childhood fondly even though his early years also coincided with the first world war. Bob remembered seeing Zeppelins bombing the city and sheltering with his family under the dining room table. Unusually for the time he attended Boulevard Municipal secondary school until he was 16, his father paying \u00a33 a term so he could do so.</p> <p>A marine engineering apprenticeship in the shipyards of Wallsend in Newcastle upon Tyne followed. Qualifying at the time of the Great Depression, Bob was unable to find work so decided to take up a teaching opportunity in Taiwan. After sailing east and arriving in 1933 Bob settled in for a year before going to Tokyo for two years to learn Japanese, the official language of Taiwan at that time. He returned to the island to teach at a missionary school in Tainan.</p> <p>In 1937 Bob married Agnes Kinver in Hong Kong. Agnes was also a teacher and they had met when at teacher training college in Selly Oak, Birmingham, before Bob left for Taiwan. The couple\u2019s first child, David, was born there in 1938 and when war looked imminent they decided to return to the UK in the following year.</p> <p>Their passage home was halted in Vancouver, Canada by the outbreak of the second world war. All merchant shipping was requisitioned for the war effort leaving the family stranded. They sought refuge at the only address they had in Canada, which was in Toronto. While in Canada, Bob and Agnes had two more children: Peter (my father), who died in 2012, and Dorothy. During this time Bob often had to work far away from his young family, including as an aeronautical inspector in Hartford, Connecticut in the US.</p> <p>Towards the end of the war he was employed by the British Political Warfare Mission in Denver, Colorado, to produce propaganda and translate Japanese military communications. The family eventually returned home to the UK in 1946. They settled into a new life in Hatch End, Middlesex, and Bob took up a position as a lecturer in marine engineering at what is now City University, London. Agnes went back to teaching and together they provided counselling to couples through the Marriage Guidance Council (now Relate).</p> <p>Bob retired in 1973, beginning one of the longest retirements in the history of social security. He was never lonely \u2013 although Agnes died in 1995 \u2013 or unoccupied. He was involved with the church and community in Alton, Hampshire, where he lived, wrote a regular column on the environment, used his second bedroom as a workshop and he loved to meet people, whether they be old friends or new.

  "<p>My daughter, Juliet Saunders, who has died unexpectedly aged 25, had an enormous capacity for creating love and happiness, and for expressing her distinct personality without words, thus transcending the limitations of her condition.</p> <p>She was born to me and my husband, Francis, in Goodmayes, Essex. I was teaching French at a girls\u2019 comprehensive school and Francis was the purchasing manager for a paint manufacturer. Soon after her birth, Juliet was diagnosed with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, whose features include short stature, hearing impairment, feeding and learning difficulties.</p> <p>Prompt intervention by her GPs in Seven Kings, Ilford, and by Maria Smith, a community paediatric nurse, led to the life-transforming insertion of a gastrostomy tube at Great Ormond Street hospital when she was less than three months old. Thereafter, Juliet was able to develop until - with our determined support and that of her childminder \u2013 she could eat the pureed food on which she subsequently relied.</p> <p>She attended Newbridge school until the age of 19 and then transferred to Eastway Romford for day care. Both offered a warm, nurturing environment, with numerous stimulating activities, making Juliet happy and safe; so many staff members exceeded their professional duties to offer affection.</p> <p>Juliet had an immense capacity to connect with others: noisy football fans who made her laugh; boisterous Spanish boys who wrote a kind note in uncertain English; musicians in Avignon who played just for her; guides who greeted her on visits to Audley End House and Eastbury Manor; National Gallery personnel who presented her with a special badge; staff at the Ritz who unwisely let her play their piano \u2013 every outing offered an unexpected kindness.</p> <p>Juliet was a full member of society, albeit with support. She enjoyed entering public spaces (including the People\u2019s Vote march in 2019); she couldn\u2019t speak, yet she had a voice. She was unaware of her disabilities and only wanted to be happy. And she was: she adored art and photographs, often seizing the ID cards of security guards, and loved toy shops, her Riding for the Disabled sessions, music and presents \u2013 becoming impatient with those who unwrapped too slowly.</p> <p>She is survived by me and Francis, her grandmother Lilian, five aunts, four uncles, 10 cousins and her childminder, Dawn Smith, who took her into her heart and family for 25 years.</p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>Small fishing boats, fish markets and female workers are among the categories worst affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis on the world\u2019s fisheries, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/home/en/\">research</a> has found.</p> <p>Supply chains around the world have been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and artisanal fishing \u2013 small boats \u2013 has borne the brunt, according to the annual report on fisheries by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). While industrial fishing fell only by about 6.5% in April, a large proportion of small vessels around the world have been in effect confined to port, and their markets are uncertain.</p> <p>In parts of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, more than 90% of small-scale fishing fleets have had to stop fishing owing to a lack of markets and falling prices.</p> <p>The closure of restaurants, hotels and catering has cut off markets for small boats and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-severe-shock-to-uk-fishing-as-markets-dry-up\">led to falling prices</a>, and the resulting disruption has led to an increase in waste, according to an appendix to the annual report, published on Monday for World Oceans Day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-world-oceans-day\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-world-oceans-day&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-world-oceans-day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Some of these effects are hard to quantify as yet. The main report was prepared before the coronavirus crisis hit, so the appendix contains only preliminary information rather than extensive research, but it indicates a growing difficulty for many small fishing fleets around the world.</p> <p>Women make up at least half of the labour force in fisheries and fish farms, and have been particularly affected by the Covid-19 crisis, according to the report. The economic impact of restricted sales and the difficulty of finding routes to market has been compounded by the closure of processing operations and markets, where many women are employed, and by the risk of infection they face when working in fish processing warehouses or markets. Many have had to work longer hours under unsafe conditions.</p> <p>Countries are urged to keep their supply chains running and their borders open to trade in fish \u2013 about 38% of fish is internationally traded \u2013 to help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/fishermen-face-bleak-year-as-pandemic-bites\">small-scale fishers cope amid the crisis</a>.</p> <p>While small fishing fleets have faced hardship, some massive industrial trawlers have kept up their operations \u2013 Greenpeace recently tracked the movements of some mega trawlers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/13/russian-supertrawlers-off-scottish-coast-fears-uk-marine-life\">around the UK coast</a> \u2013 to the consternation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/government-throws-englands-fishermen-a-10m-lifeline\">local fishing fleets</a>.</p> <p>Philip Evans, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\u201cThis continuing industrial fishing activity is in the context of an ocean in crisis, with many fish populations already on the brink of collapse. Once the pandemic is over, attention must turn again to reforming global fisheries governance and placing at least 30% of the world\u2019s oceans off limits to fishing activity, to give fish populations space to recover from decades of destructive industrial fishing activity.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/08/what-lies-beneath-our-love-affair-with-living-underwater\">What lies beneath: our love affair with living underwater</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Around the world, fish consumption reached a record high last year, according to the FAO\u2019s report. Per capita consumption hit 20.5kg for the year and is expected to increase, with total fish production predicted to rise to 204m tonnes in 2030, which would be an increase of 15% on 2018.</p> <p>Fishing was worth about $400bn (\u00a3316bn) around the world in 2018, according to the report, of which close to half was from fish farming, in which China is the global leader.</p> <p>\u201cFish and fisheries products are recognised not only as some of the healthiest foods on the planet, but also as some of the less impactful on the natural environment,\u201d said Qu Dongyu, the director general of the FAO.</p> <p>But more effort is needed to improve the management and rebuilding of fish stocks, or increased consumption will come at the expense of serious damage to fish populations. More than a third of fish stocks globally are fished at unsustainable levels, according to the FAO.</p> <p>There has been some success in the past year in fostering more sustainable fisheries, according to the report, which points to tuna fisheries, of which two-thirds are now fished at sustainable levels. While insufficient, that represents substantial progress, as the proportion fished sustainably has risen by 10 percentage points in two years, the report says.</p> <p>\u201cThe improvement, the fruit of contributions from many stakeholders, attests to the importance of active management to reach and maintain biological sustainability, and serves to underscore how urgently we must replicate such approaches in fisheries and regions where management systems are in poor shape,\u201d said Manuel Barange, the director of the FAO\u2019s fisheries and aquaculture department.</p> <p>Despite the report\u2019s upbeat findings, concerns remain around the fishing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/01/bid-for-first-eco-labelled-bluefin-tuna-raises-fears-for-protection-of-king-of-fish\">tuna</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/03/booming-demand-for-tuna-driving-unsustainable-level-of-fishing-report\">as the Guardian has reported</a>, highlighting the difficulty in squaring the global demand for a sustainable source of protein and the poor governance that prevails in many fishing areas.</p>",

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families.

  "<p>Pubs have urged the government to clarify \u201chalf-baked\u201d plans to reopen beer gardens, amid confusion over whether some will be permitted to serve drinks before the end of the month.</p> <p>A group of cabinet ministers nicknamed the \u201cSave Summer Six\u201d are reportedly considering proposals to allow beer gardens in England to host drinkers from as early as 22 June as part of an effort to avert 3.5m job losses in the struggling hospitality sector.</p> <p>But publicans, brewers and the pub industry trade body said many would struggle to be ready in under three weeks and called for certainty about the government\u2019s timetable.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to reopen our nation\u2019s pubs safely and viably as soon as possible, but we urgently need a clear decision on whether we can reopen pub beer gardens early,\u201d said Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association (BBPA).</p> <p>The trade body, which represents the UK\u2019s largest pub-owning companies, has previously warned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/pubs-struggling-through-coronavirus-crisis-ask-for-extra-support\">40% of the UK\u2019s 47,000 pubs</a> could shut for good due to lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>It wants the government to allow all pubs to open from 4 July, the date the government initially put forward as the earliest possible opportunity, and it has also said the 27,000 UK pubs with outdoor space should be the first to be allowed to open their doors.</p> <p>But it said a sudden acceleration of the plans would leave many pubs unable to restock draught beer and put safety measures in place quickly enough, with at least three weeks required.</p> <p>Proposals to allow beer gardens to open from 22 June were first reported on Sunday night in the Financial Times, which cited three Whitehall officials. The government has since refused to confirm whether the earlier date is under consideration.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said only that officials were \u201cworking at pace to develop safe ways for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at the earliest opportunity it is safe to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers are expected to discuss proposals at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, potentially including a reduction in physical distancing requirements to 1 metre from 2 metres.</p> <p>Greg Mulholland, a former MP who chairs the British Pubs Confederation, said the government\u2019s plans appeared \u201chalf-baked\u201d, warning that the lack of clarity could make it impossible for pubs to be ready at short notice.</p> <p>He also voiced fears that pub companies might use the 22 June date as an excuse to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/10/we-wont-survive-the-coronavirus-lockdown-without-rent-relief-publicans-say\">charge struggling tenants rent</a>, even if distancing rules made it impossible for them to open.</p> <p>JD Wetherspoon\u2019s founder, Tim Martin, said opening some pubs would at least offer some confidence that the industry is returning to business as usual.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/22/more-than-30000-pubs-and-restaurants-could-stay-shut-after-lockdown-coronavirus\">More than 30,000 pubs and restaurants 'may not reopen after lockdown'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFew pubs will be able to make a profit using outdoor space only but partial reopening will provide a psychological boost to a beleaguered industry,\u201d said Martin. \u201cIt will signal the intent of the government to make progress towards normality, which will be welcome.\u201d</p> <p>Almost 700 of Wetherspoons\u2019 867 pubs have a beer garden, roof terrace or patio, and the company has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/22/jd-wetherspoon-pubs-reopen-lockdown-staff-goggles\">set out plans for a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/22/jd-wetherspoon-pubs-reopen-lockdown-staff-goggles\">pandemic-era pub</a> involving bar staff wearing goggles and protective screens between tables.</p> <p>Mark Daniels, the landlord of the Brewers Arms in Worcester, said he would be keen to open his beer garden, but doing so inside a fortnight would be difficult.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIf things were right I\u2019d jump at it. We\u2019ve lost a lot of business already in what has been great weather with two bank holidays. But there are more issues to look at. If you can\u2019t operate fully would there be rent supplements involved? Also, brewers will need to know as soon as possible to be able to supply the demand.\u201d</p> <p>Some small craft brewers fear that a short-notice timetable would put them at a disadvantage to global brewing corporations.</p> <p>Sam McMeekin, a co-founder of the Gipsy Hill brewery in south-east London, said: \u201cIt is unbelievably complex to get fresh beer going again. It takes us about 25 days to get kegged beer ready and it takes a big brewer about four.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019ve got 15 days\u2019 notice they can have fresh beer ready and available. They\u2019ve also got the benefit of power over their suppliers, which helps them get the ingredients, even if it\u2019s on credit. For us, people will be demanding payments for our next barley delivery.\u201d</p> <p>McMeekin said small brewers would also be much harder hit if the pubs they sell to go out of business without paying their bills.</p>",
  "<p>When the Neameh sailed out of Colombia on 4 May, it should have been a routine shipment: just over 4,000 cattle, on their way to Egypt, an important hub for the global trade in live animal exports.</p> <p>But accusations of cocaine smuggling and a police raid of the ship&nbsp;lengthened the journey.</p> <p>As the Neameh sailed into the mouth of the Mediterranean in the early hours of 21 May, it was apprehended close to Gibraltar by Spanish customs agents and the Spanish navy on suspicion of cocaine trafficking.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s health ministry did not allow any of the cattle to disembark, or the offloading any carcasses, while customs and police searching the ship were unable to use sniffer dogs because of the stench.

Many others were in agonising pain, with no remedy.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIt was hell,\u201d one witness told Europa Sur, describing a scene of overcrowding and animals \u201cbarely able to stand on their feet\u201d. The Spanish interior ministry referred requests for comment to the police, who did not respond to questions about the operation or its outcome.&nbsp;</p> <p>The search was eventually called off and, without public explanation, the ship continued its journey the next morning. &nbsp;By the time the vessel docked in Damietta on Egypt\u2019s northern coast, according to the ship\u2019s records, 34 animals had died, although their bodies were not on the boat. </p> <p>Officials from the Egyptian agriculture ministry who inspected the vessel on arrival in Damietta on 29 May <a href=\"https://www.cairo24.com/2020/05/29/%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9-24-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%8F%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%81/\">described</a> the animals as being in a \u201cmiserable condition\u201d.

Everyone has a right to investigate, but not to harm people. This was barbaric.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Some of the 42 crew members were forcibly sequestered in one part of the ship, he said, while others were taken to a nearby police station. While 20 were normally tasked with taking care of the livestock, just three or four labourers were permitted to care for the animals while the search took place.</p> <p> The ones chosen were apparently unfamiliar with what needed to be done to keep them safe and healthy. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t conduct proper feeding and watering,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cattle lay down, but normal practice is to get them up and then put out the feed so that no cattle jump on top of one another. When they do this with so few people these things happen. It\u2019s a big issue.\u201d The result, he claimed, was poor conditions on board.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/live-export-animals-at-risk-as-giant-global-industry-goes-unchecked\">Live export: animals at risk in giant global industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shawkat rejected any suggestions that lack of care for the animals prior to their unexpected arrival in Spain was responsible for the distressing conditions witnessed in Algeciras. Instead he blamed the unplanned stop for the problems. \u201cDuring the search they spoiled the feed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a limited amount for the destination. But with these delays \u2026 it\u2019s hell what happened to the ship, it was in really bad shape. For animal welfare, it\u2019s a big violation.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He also dismissed any possibility that the Neameh was smuggling cocaine, or that the poor conditions on board could have made it easier to hide a cache of drugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one reason, there was no one allowed to go on board [in Colombia] due to Covid-19, and no one allowed to leave the ship. It\u2019s out of the question.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Multiple Colombian government agencies did not respond to requests for comment about the Neameh smuggling cocaine.&nbsp;</p> <p>The tale raises questions about links between the global narcotics trade and the animal industry. In Colombia in the 80s, for example, <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/146771NCJRS.pdf\">Pablo Escobar\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/146771NCJRS.pdf\">cartel</a> was reported to have strong links with the Colombian Cattlemen\u2019s Association.

Why, critically, was the ship allowed to leave Spain when conditions potentially breached EU <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2018/621853/EPRS_STU(2018)621853_EN.pdf\">regulation</a>s which say that animals being transported in or out of the EU must comply with animal welfare standards?</p> <p>\u201cThe Neameh only obtained attention by authorities and the media because of the suspicion of drug trafficking. However, vessels like Neameh transport animals across the globe every day and mostly remain unnoticed by the public,\u201d said Sophie Greger of Animals\u2019 Angels, which works to protect animals from live transport. </p> <p>Throwing dead cattle overboard from freighters is illegal on the Mediterranean, where the practice sometimes results in carcasses washing ashore in coastal towns or on <a href=\"https://www.menorca.info/menorca/local/2019/04/27/655333/arrojar-vacas-barco-mar-practica-prohibida.html\">islands like</a> Menorca.

However, the survey\u2019s compilers noted that Poland\u2019s poor showing was affected by the large number of newly identified sites \u2013 419 out of 606; this meant monitoring was incomplete. Of the 187 sites which were classified, they said, about 70% were found to be excellent.</p> <p>Only 5% of monitored sites across Europe failed to reach the minimum rating of \u201csufficient\u201d.

In many areas, water companies are legally allowed to discharge untreated sewage into waterways, but having rivers designated as bathing areas means these outflows can be curtailed.</p> <p>Swimmers are also warned that the EEA data is from last year and so does not take into account the impacts of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/16/2019-was-bad-year-for-floods-and-drought-in-england-say-charities\">unusually wet winter</a> followed by an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/uk-spring-the-sunniest-since-records-began-says-met-office\">exceptionally dry spring</a>. Bathers are advised to check before setting out and to heed the government\u2019s rules on physical distancing, as well as any local restrictions in force.</p> <p>Out of 22,295 bathing sites in Europe, nearly 85% were of excellent quality, according to the EEA report. Cyprus, Austria, Malta, Greece and Croatia topped the list with more than 95% of all sites proving to be of excellent quality. </p> <p>The EU\u2019s environment commissioner said countries should not take high quality water for granted. \u201cClean bathing water is usually taken as something that is gifted, but it\u2019s actually one of the European collective achievements,\u201d said Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of hard work by many people over many years. This year\u2019s report once again confirms that European citizens can continue to enjoy very high quality standards when bathing in European waters and all measures must be taken to continue along this path.\u201d</p> <p>Before the UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/the-eus-effect-on-blackpools-beaches-before-and-after-pictures\">forced by EU regulations to clean up beaches</a> and inland waterways, many were unfit for swimming and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/03/brexit-would-return-britain-to-being-dirty-man-of-europe\">heavily polluted</a> with sewage or other effluent. Campaigners are concerned that the UK could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/these-three-post-brexit-bills-bulldoze-a-hole-through-environmental-protections\">water down some of its environmental commitments</a> after Brexit without firm EU directives to follow on measures such as water and air quality.</p> <p>The quality of UK beaches has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/27/uk-beaches-europe-cyprus-malta\">risen and fallen in recent years</a>, and can vary markedly based on factors such as droughts, which cause sewage to back up, followed by heavy rain, which can flush it out into rivers and on to beaches. This year\u2019s showing continues a poor run compared with earlier this decade, however, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/21/quality-uk-beaches-wet-weather\">83% of beaches were rated excellent in 2011</a>.</p> <p>After Brexit the UK can still submit to monitoring by the EEA, which as part of its remit reports on several other European or neighbouring states that are not EU members, including Iceland, Greenland, Norway and Turkey.</p> <p>\u201cRegular monitoring and assessment of bathing water are essential for ensuring that we maintain the already very high quality across Europe and, where needed, we take effective measures to address water pollution,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, the executive director of the EEA. \u201cCleaner bathing waters do not only benefit our own health and wellbeing, but also the health of the environment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 and 12 June 2020 to include detailed figures for Poland and to make it clear that the country\u2019s poor showing was affected by a large number of sites where monitoring was incomplete, and that of those sites which were classified, about 70% were found to be excellent.</p>",
  "<p>With the US presidential election looming, equal rights groups and others on the left say the protests<strong> </strong>sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death can translate into a surge in young people voting in November.</p> <p>While Donald Trump\u2019s autocratic response to the demonstrations has shocked young people into action in the US and beyond, advocates believe the movement against police brutality has energized youth voters to think beyond the presidential election, which could have a real impact on state and local elections, where decisions about policing and criminal justice are made.</p> <p>Around the country, people running for local office say they are already seeing a spike in enthusiasm among 18- to 29-year-olds, who historically vote in smaller numbers than their elders.</p> <p>\u201cI have so many young kids reaching out to our campaign, saying: \u2018How do we volunteer, can I intern to learn more, I\u2019d really like to run for office,\u201d said Nada Elmikashfi, a 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.nadaforwisconsin.com/\">candidate for state senate</a> in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u201cI think whatever political apathy afflicted our generation, it isn\u2019t a choice any more.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Elmikashfi, who has been part of protests in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, said the brutal death of Floyd has \u201cbrought a lot of attention on down-ballot races\u201d, but she isn\u2019t sure whether that enthusiasm will carry over to the presidential election, where Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for his responses to the demonstrations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64da25304afa6480725db6d2252d97f1fce0dac3\"> <img

</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom conversations that I\u2019ve been having with people my own age, and whether this is right and wrong, it\u2019s this idea that the Democrats are putting Trump as \u2018This is the sole reason you should vote for us\u2019,\u201d Elmikashfi said.</p> <p>\u201cI think constituencies across the country are put in a tight spot, where you have a fascist president who is incredibly destructive to America, but then you also have Democratic party leadership that isn\u2019t very progressive, that doesn\u2019t uplift the working class, but that feels entitled to your vote.</p> <p>\u201cYoung kids understand Trump is more damaging, the question is: is it really gonna change under Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to Floyd\u2019s death, and the ensuing surge in protests nationwide, has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-police-oversight-board/\">included him musing</a> that police officers could shoot suspects in the leg, \u201cinstead of in the heart\u201d, a suggestion that seemed to overlook the issue of people of color being apprehended at far higher rates than white people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The former vice-president, who is 78 years old, struggled to attract young supporters during the Democratic primary, weighed down by a problematic record that includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html\">opposing bussing minority students</a> to different school districts, and his lead role in a 1994 \u201ctough on crime\u201d law that some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">blame for mass incarceration</a> in the US, and seems in danger of misjudging the level of emotion and the desire for change.</p> <p>\u201cThe death of George Floyd is emblematic of everything that\u2019s wrong with America, whether it\u2019s how we handle Covid, to the existing racism and police brutality that black and brown communities have suffered for years,\u201d said Moumita Ahmed, who is <a

said Floyd\u2019s death, along with the recent killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\"> in Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\">Breonna Taylor</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\"> in Kentucky</a> had \u201copened eyes for a lot of young people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger generation are just so much more aware and active and ready to make a difference,\u201d said Ahmed, who co-founded the group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bernlennials\">Millennials for Bernie</a>, which supported Bernie Sanders during his 2016 and 2020 election campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people are going to start paying attention to local elections,\u201d Ahmed said.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government can do a lot, but the local government has a lot of power in the police departments. They can do so much more than the federal government.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d/0_0_3900_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is precedent for protest movements prompting real change. In recent years the youth-led protests against gun violence following the Parkland school shooting, led to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/26/18145305/gun-control-violence-parkland-effect-2018\">stronger gun laws</a>, while young climate activists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/the-weekly/democrats-climate-change-green-new-deal.html\">succeeded in drawing attention to the Green New Deal</a> environment legislation, which many Democratic politicians have since endorsed.</p> <p>On Monday George Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence Floyd, called for people to vote in November, particularly in statewide and local elections like Ahmed and Elmikashfi\u2019s. That effort to build on the energy of the past two weeks is being supported by organizations like <a href=\"https://www.organizing20.org/\">Organizing 2.0</a>, <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">NextGen America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, which aims to build equal rights in the US.</p> <p>Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the <a href=\"http://naacpyc.org/\">NAACP youth &amp; college division</a>, said it has been registering people to vote at demonstrations, demonstrate how the voting process works and help people find their voting precincts. Loftin said young people had been stunned by Trump\u2019s advocating of violence against protesters and \u201cencouragement of police violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is resonating with young black voters across the country, they\u2019re paying attention,\u201d Loftin said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re done. So that is definitely a motivation to go to the polls. I want to be clear \u2013 it\u2019s not a scare tactic. We\u2019re not afraid of Donald Trump being president for another four years.\u201d</p> <p>Loftin said the NAACP has also encouraged people to take part in the 2020 census, a once-a-decade event that will influence the amount of government funding neighborhoods receive, and potentially how they are represented in Ccongress. Like Ahmed and Elmikashfi, she said local races are just as important as the headline-grabbing Trump v Biden election.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a laser focus on district attorney races, mayoral races, district races, the president and what their decisions are going to mean for how black folks in this country walk and experience their everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of participating in elections was on the minds of people at a protest in New York City on Tuesday, where thousands walked through Manhattan to demonstrate at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another stage of this movement that does need to happen. I think voting is important,\u201d said Justin Withers, 23.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that this does change the voting. I hope it does. We\u2019ve failed in the past but I hope now because it\u2019s so many people that people will finally wake up.\u201d</p> <p>Just 46.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\">voted in the 2016 presidential election</a>, compared with an overall turnout of 61.4%. The highest turnout, meanwhile, was among people aged 65 and over, who are statistically more likely to be conservative.</p> <p>In the 2018 midterms, the less glamorous elections that re-elect members of the House of Representatives and some senators as well as local officials, 36% of young people voted \u2013 although this was a big increase on the 20% of 18 \u2013 29-year-olds who voted in the 2014 midterms.</p> <p>That could suggest interest and awareness is growing among younger voters. Although Withers, who lives in Brooklyn, predicted that despite renewed enthusiasm, the turnout in 2020 would remain relatively low among people of color \u2013 due to efforts in states around the US to make it more difficult for black people, and other minority groups, from voting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">the Voting Rights Act was weakened</a> in 2013, many states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/nov/07/which-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election\">brought in laws making it more difficult to vote</a>, from purging people from electoral rolls if they have not voted in a given amount of time, to preventing efforts to register voters, to requiring government-issued photo ID to vote \u2013 something people of color and low-income Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">are less likely to have</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is voter suppression is still happening,\u201d Withers said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still 10 times harder for the people who know what\u2019s right, for the people who are minorities, to be able to vote. That\u2019s still a problem. And because of that I know that it won\u2019t be the numbers we want.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Justine Landis-Hanley and it\u2019s Monday 8 June.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand lifts Covid-19 restrictions \u2026</strong></h2> <p>New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/08/i-did-a-little-dance-pm-ardern-declares-new-zealand-covid-19-free-video\">announced her government would abandon all coronavirus restrictions from midnight tonight</a>, after health officials confirmed the recovery of the country\u2019s last known Covid-19 case.</p> <p>There are no active cases of Covid-19 in the country for the first time since 28 February. New Zealand has recorded fewer than 1,500 cases of coronavirus, and 22 deaths.</p> <p>Border restrictions will remain in place, meaning only New Zealanders and their families will be allowed to enter the country and must stay in government-run quarantine for a fortnight.</p> <p>But Ardern said the fight was not over for New Zealand, warning they would \u201calmost certainly see cases here again\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is not a sign that we have failed; it is the reality of this virus.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2026 and lays out conditions for NZ-Australia travel deal</h2> <p>Ardern has quelled the idea of a possible travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia that would allow residents to travel between both countries without quarantining.</p> <p>She said Australia would first need to be \u201cin a similar position\u201d to New Zealand, with no active Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason that New Zealanders, as of tomorrow, will be able to move around with freedom that very few other countries in the world have is because we are maintaining those restrictions at the border.\u201d</p> <h2>End of free childcare announced</h2> <p>The Morrison government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/australian-government-to-end-free-childcare-on-12-july-in-move-labor-says-will-snap-families\">announced it will roll back its free childcare scheme</a>, introduced on 12 July at the height of the pandemic.</p> <p>The education minister, Dan Tehan, said fees would be capped at what they were in February, and extra subsidies would be provided to eligible families whose employment has been affected by coronavirus.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s childcare spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, has criticised the government\u2019s \u201csnap back\u201d change, saying that \u201cthis could well act as a handbrake on the economy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf women and families are not able to access affordable childcare, how are they going to get back to work?

  "<p>In November 1966, the Gemini 12 spacecraft, carrying two astronauts, splashed down in the Pacific. The four-day mission was a triumph, proving that humans could work in outer space, and even step into the great unknown, albeit tethered to their spacecraft. It catapulted the US ahead of the USSR in the space race.</p> <p>From then, Nasa\u2019s goal was to beat the Russians to the moon. That meant weeks rather than days in space, in an isolated, claustrophobic environment. There was one perfect way to prepare humans for these conditions: going underwater. The world was gripped. If we could land people on the moon, why not colonise the ocean as well?</p> <p>Nasa scientists were not the first to dream of marine living. Evidence of submarines and diving bells can be found as far back as the 16th century.

The first, in 1962, was suspended 10 metres under the water off the coast of Marseilles, but Conshelf II was a starfish-shaped \u201cunderwater village\u201d that sat on the seabed proper, 30 metres down in the Red Sea off Sudan. It contained all the accoutrements of <em>la vie louche</em>, including television and radio. Cousteau used it as a base to explore the ocean in his yellow submarine, descending to 300 metres to capture the deepest footage yet recorded.</p> <p>His team spent 30 days beneath the waves, and in the process changed humanity\u2019s relationship with the ocean by proving that \u201csaturation diving\u201d could allow people to spend long periods underwater. By diving to a certain depth, divers saturate their bodies with the inert gases in air. This allows them to exist at the extreme pressure of the ocean floor. It typically involves breathing a mix of helium and oxygen, to avoid the possibility of the bends and nitrogen narcosis.</p> <p>Conshelf sparked a craze.

This is in large part due to the marine biologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/06/oceanographer-sylvia-earle-the-world-is-holding-its-breath-for-australia\">Sylvia Earle</a>, one of the most famous explorers of her generation. In 1969, Earle made history with Mission 6, when she and an all-female team of scientists spent two weeks on Nasa\u2019s habitat <a href=\"https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2014/07/17/project-tektite-i-and-the-birth-of-the-underwater-construction-teams/\">Tektite</a> (named after meteor remnants on the seabed). This Virgin Islands research facility was for studying aquatic life \u2013 marine science, engineering and construction underwater \u2013 and small-crew psychology in extreme conditions. The research was for the Apollo missions and the moon landing was just months away.</p> <p>Built by General Electric, Earle and her team would enter Tektite through what she calls an \u201cunderwater door\u201d \u2013 emerging as if from a swimming pool into the deep-sea two-up, two-down apartment. It was dry, climate-controlled and comfortable, with carpets, bunks and a hot freshwater shower to wash off the salt. It even had a microwave.</p> <p>\u201cNasa had a team of psychologists watching to get insight into behaviour of living in isolation,\u201d says Earle today. \u201cWe were there as guinea pigs: our research was on the oceans, their research was on us.\u201d</p> <p>But Tektite wasn\u2019t just a research station \u2013 it was a vision of stylish underwater living. With their scientific gear and Charlie\u2019s Angels wetsuits in their Bond-villain lair, Earle and her team caused a media sensation.</p> <p>\u201cThey called us the aquababes, the aquanaughties, all sorts of things,\u201d Earle recalls with a snort. \u201cWe speculated what they would say about the astronauts if they were seen the same way \u2013 would they be the astrohunks?\u201d</p> <p>Habitats such as Glaucus, Conshelf and Tektite were built as tributes to humankind\u2019s abilities, but their true achievement was to spark an entirely different understanding of marine animals. \u201cBack then we could only explore using nets, and just saw dead bodies \u2013 not living creatures. Having the continuous interaction allowed us to get to know individual animals,\u201d Earle says. \u201c[In underwater habitats] we could stay, the way you look at bears or birds: we were there for the long haul, 24 hours a day or night. It was possible to see how a little group of damselfish reacted when a predator tried to swipe their eggs, for example.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107f23d980ca9a675905b3ea847ecd66e1d9113d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107f23d980ca9a675905b3ea847ecd66e1d9113d/0_175_4215_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Lucas with team leader Dr Sylvia Earle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineer Peggy Lucas and team leader Dr Sylvia Earle in Nasa\u2019s Tektite habitat in the Virgin Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8a25664671cca5fd3dac51edbef503544c96852a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a25664671cca5fd3dac51edbef503544c96852a/0_147_2500_1582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s cutaway view of the Tektite II habitat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cutaway model of Nasa\u2019s Tektite II habitat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NOAA Central Library Historical Fisheries Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f95a49a585d6c3d54f8e0b5362f0f7669edbb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f95a49a585d6c3d54f8e0b5362f0f7669edbb1/0_186_5478_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sylvia Earle diving.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sylvia Earle diving off Magic Point, New South Wales, Australia, with a Port Jackson shark in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou look at a school of fish and they all look alike, but when you <em>really</em> look at them \u2013 well, it\u2019s like a bunch of people getting on the New York subway: a fish would say they all look the same, but we know they\u2019re different. Getting to appreciate the individuality of creatures other than humans was a breakthrough for me \u2013 it reinforces that you can\u2019t just lump them all together.\u201d</p> <p>But, in 1973, the world was shaken when Opec declared an oil embargo. Energy prices in the west skyrocketed. At first, the oil shock fuelled even wilder fantasies of a watery future, straight out of science fiction. Architects and designers imagined whole cities underwater, fed by hydropower stations, with deep-sea mining using freight submarines.</p> <p>Much like living in space, though, it\u2019s extremely difficult to live underwater. Aquanauts spending months in saturation suffered intense pressures on their body tissues \u2013 their brains, nervous systems. There were also interpersonal problems. As the marine biologist Helen Scales notes in her 2014 radio documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04fzc7m\">The Life Sub-Aquatic</a>:\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever lived in a house with anyone, the first thing you do is storm out if you have a quarrel. You\u2019re not going to do that [underwater].\u201d</p> <p>Advances in robotics changed the game. Much of the research being done by Earle and her colleagues could be more efficiently performed by humans operating devices remotely from the surface. By the end of the 70s, the US government pulled back on its efforts. The moon missions were over. So, it seemed, were the ocean habitats.</p> <p>A few people refused to let the dream die. One was Australian <a href=\"http://www.lloydgodson.com/underwater-projects.html\">Lloyd Godson</a>. His habitat, BioSub, experimented with sustainability. Fuelled by solar panels, it featured a support system adapted from work by American high school students, with algae removing the CO2 from his exhalations and creating oxygen. In 2007 he moved in. It worked \u2013 sort of. \u201cBy day 12 I was lethargic, getting really irritated with people asking questions,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cMy wife told me to call it a day.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 Godson spent 14 days underwater at the Legoland aquarium in Germany and used a fixed bicycle to set a world record for generating electricity underwater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30599a1d35d873f6d6ca534e7dca309eb0332d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30599a1d35d873f6d6ca534e7dca309eb0332d25/0_156_11896_14868/800.jpg\" alt=\"The SeaOrbiter designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SeaOrbiter, designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Rougerie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Better funded is the French architect Jacques Rougerie, who has built a career designing underwater habitats and environments. \u201cI had the pleasure of going on Cousteau\u2019s Calypso, participating in expeditions, talking to the crew \u2013 and what he created was a fascination for underwater living,\u201d Rougerie says from his office in Paris. \u201cThe early explorers opened the chamber of the possible for humanity. When you are underwater you feel like you\u2019re in a new dimension \u2013 floating in space, like an astronaut.\u201d</p> <p>Citing Leonardo da Vinci as an inspiration, Rougerie designs sea museums, underwater laboratories and habitats, and his foundation hosts an <a href=\"https://www.fondation-jacques-rougerie.com/\">annual competition</a> for students to conceive of underwater villages. Rougerie himself has twice lived for long periods underwater, and both times he didn\u2019t want to return to land. \u201cSadness invades you,\u201d he says. \u201cI was happy to come back and see family, but the first thing you think of is the next experience.\u201d</p> <p>Rougerie\u2019s ultimate goal remains that old 1960s dream: a proper underwater village, housing up to 250 people. In his vision, these aquanaut settlers would live in osmosis with the ocean, in a self-sufficient, autonomous community running on renewable marine energy such as tidal power, wave sensors and ocean thermals.</p> <p>Perhaps most ambitious of all is <a href=\"http://www.seaorbiter.com/\">SeaOrbiter</a>, Rougerie\u2019s take on the International Space Station for the ocean. It looks like a floating seahorse: two-thirds of its 51 metres are submerged, with panoramic windows, the lower section acting to stabilise a huge sail-shaped portion above water.</p> <p>\u201cThe goal, above all, is to help the climate and biodiversity by exploring across the grand currents of the ocean,\u201d he says. \u201cTo float 24/7 on a permanent structure, a combination of men and robots with a scientific purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Rougerie\u2019s claims that he has secured Chinese investment, SeaOrbiter appears no closer to pushing off.</p> <p>Indeed, after all the projects of the past 50 years, only one permanent underwater habitat remains on the entire planet: <a href=\"https://medium.com/predict/aquarius-reef-base-an-actual-underwater-lab-and-the-last-of-a-dying-breed-eacb5b7989c7\">Aquarius Reef Base</a>, a research station run by Florida International University and which sits 20 metres down on the seabed off the Florida Keys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b07ca532794af8364d22c0dbe0d7de57b75984e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b07ca532794af8364d22c0dbe0d7de57b75984e/0_117_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fabien Cousteau waves from inside Aquarius Reef Base, a laboratory 63 feet below the surface in the waters off Key Largo, Florida in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fabien Cousteau waves from inside Aquarius Reef Base, an ocean-floor laboratory off Key Largo, Florida in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilfredo Lee/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aquarius plays host to a stream of people \u2013 scientists, film-makers, astronauts, even Jacques Cousteau\u2019s grandson Fabien \u2013 who want to experience time underwater. As part of Nasa\u2019s Extreme Environment Mission Operations (Neemo), the Canadian astronaut <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygNRHpLD10\">Chris Hadfield</a>, famous for singing David Bowie songs aboard the International Space Station in 2013, used Aquarius to train.</p> <p>But Aquarius is still just a small research station, with room for just six people. In the 21st century, underwater \u201cliving\u201d has become almost exclusively the preserve of hotels and resorts that sell \u201cexperiences\u201d to guests via underwater glass ceilings and fish windows. The world\u2019s largest underwater <a href=\"https://under.no/\">restaurant</a> opened in Norway in 2019. Submerged hotels in the <a href=\"https://www.conradmaldives.com/\">Maldives</a>, <a href=\"http://www.poseidonresorts.com/\">Fiji</a>, Dubai and Singapore use elevators to take guests below the waterline, and feature amenities such as <a href=\"http://www.poseidonresorts.com/\">Poseidon\u2019s undersea chapel</a> (\u201cfor a wedding ceremony or vow renewal truly unlike any other\u201d), and are a lot more comfortable than Tektite ever was.</p> <p>Instead, the architects and scientists who still look to aquatic habitation spend most of their time thinking not about underwater cities, but floating ones. Long the refuge of the poorest city dwellers, such as the vast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/23/makoko-lagos-danger-ingenuity-floating-slum\">Makoko floating slum of homes on stilts in Lagos</a>, houses on water have become newly popular as waterfront property prices \u2013 and sea levels \u2013 have risen across the world.</p> <p>So far, most of this effort to colonise the water has gone into land reclamation projects, such as the Odaiba island in Tokyo, or South Korea\u2019s Songdo \u201csmart city\u201d. Architects in Dubai even tried to create a scale model of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/13/not-end-the-world-return-dubai-ultimate-folly\">entire Earth off its coast</a>. However, reclamation is expensive, and requires constant maintenance to keep the ocean from reclaiming the space.

His firm <a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/floating-cities-the-next-big-real-estate-boom/\">Waterstudio</a> builds floating buildings, mainly in the Netherlands, to help cities be more resilient. Recently, Olthuis started adding submerged levels to his structures. \u201cIn Holland the licences for dwellings on the water are small, but they say nothing about living underwater.\u201d</p> <p>The goal is partly ecological, Olthuis says. \u201cTen years ago, it was about proving that a structure did not have a negative effect \u2013 but now it\u2019s about also having a positive effect.\u201d He points to the \u201crigs to reefs\u201d principle where abandoned oil rigs have been transformed into habitats for ocean life. Waterstudio\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/projects/sea-tree/\">Sea Tree</a><a href=\"https://www.waterstudio.nl/projects/sea-tree/\"> </a>builds on that concept: it\u2019s a platform that attracts birds, bees, fish and water plants into a single dense floating structure that can be moved between cities. He says the first Sea Trees have been commissioned by a Chinese developer in Kunming, who was asked to create a tourist attraction after a dam permanently altered the landscape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-world-oceans-day\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-world-oceans-day&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-world-oceans-day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Bjarke Ingels Group last year revealed a concept for a buoyant municipality called <a href=\"https://oceanix.org/\">Oceanix City</a> \u2013 a modular system of floating islands clustered in multiples of six to form a kind of archipelago. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.seasteading.org/\">Seasteading Institute</a>, founded by PayPal\u2019s Peter Thiel and the grandson of the economist Milton Friedman, continues to pursue its libertarian goal of floating communities living outside the boundaries of national law. The Chinese construction giant CCCC has a design similar to Oceanix City, while the architect Vincent Callebaut has imagined a city called <a href=\"http://vincent.callebaut.org/object/080523_lilypad/lilypad/projects\">Lilypad</a> with a series of oceanic skyscrapers that would house 50,000 people.</p> <p>\u201cI see blue cities,\u201d says Olthuis. \u201cNot floating cities. Just a city growing over water, taking advantage of the floating structures but in the same pattern as on land \u2013 a kind of Venice but floating, that can be used in New York, Miami \u2026 any city that\u2019s threatened by water.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdfe6e786b707b12a6b2ae8423463435e88e87da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdfe6e786b707b12a6b2ae8423463435e88e87da/0_1_1850_1110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An artists\u2019 rendering of the Sea Tree project \u2013 a structure to attract fish and other wildlife to an area.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist\u2019s rendering of the Sea Tree project by Dutch architects Waterstudio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Waterstudio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0762fd43b844d92de49c7c116864573f02fc0989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0762fd43b844d92de49c7c116864573f02fc0989/0_0_3000_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"OceanixCity \u2013 a modular system of floating islands clustered to form an archipelago.

Rougerie says that time beneath the waves changes our outlook on the planet, helping inspire the environmental movement. It\u2019s why continues to sponsor the competition to design underwater cities. \u201cThe biggest threat to our ocean is man: pollution, chemical and plastic.

  "<p>Locust swarms threaten a \u201crolling emergency\u201d that could endanger harvests and food security across parts of Africa and Asia for the rest of the year, experts warn.</p> \n<p>An initial infestation of locusts in December was expected to die out during the current dry season. But unseasonal rains have allowed several generations of locust to breed, resulting in new swarms forming. </p> \n<p>Huge swarms of locusts have been causing devastation across swathes of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Erratic weather conditions and storms have aided their path. As a result, countries have been battling the pests for months to avoid a hunger crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3d69dfa8-21c8-416e-b666-8db3e4dc4393\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In normal times, locusts are not usually a threat. Desert locusts are a type of grasshopper that feed off vegetation but are usually solitary.</p>\n    <p>But when conditions bring them together, their behaviour completely changes. As few as two locusts touching each other can create a connection that starts them forming into groups. This unlocks their destructive \u201cgregarious\u201d state that changes their behaviour and even colour.</p>\n    <p>Rains help the swarms to form. The moisture turns deserts into ideal habitats for breeding and the locusts feed off the growing vegetation. In two generations, the number of locusts can increase 400-fold.</p>\n    <p>They easily devour fields of crops and when the food dries up, they move on. \u201cBands\u201d of wingless, gregarious locusts move in the same direction, while adult winged \u201cswarms\u201d migrate by air in search of greenery.</p>\n    <p>Dry weather usually kills them off naturally but when things change, plagues begin. A combination of ideal breeding conditions and a lack of control operations can allow unchecked breeding, which is what happened in Yemen in 2018. Two cyclones within months of each other created long breeding periods that allowed the numbers to grow 8,000-fold and the war in the region meant the locusts were not detected and destroyed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Desert locusts, which live in areas between west Africa and India, cause the most devastation and like to breed in moist conditions.

The moment you can think, even unconsciously, that one race is superior to another, that is the beginning of murder. It is the beginning of genocide.

All it takes is realising that to passively sanction the diminishment of anyone\u2019s humanity on any ground is to begin to sanction your own diminishment too. This really isn\u2019t rocket science. Racism is a failure of humanity. It is a failure to be human. This lack of empathy is part of the problem that is destroying the world. The lack of empathy extends not just to humans but to other species, and even to the planet as a whole.&nbsp;</p> <p>That police officer who pressed his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck snuffed out one life, but lit a universal fire. It is deeply moving that the world has responded not to the death of a great man or woman, but to the killing of one of the Earth\u2019s poor and seemingly insignificant people.&nbsp;</p> <p>We know what to do. We must tear out the unconscious racism in our spirit. We must insist on the human rights of all peoples. We let people live their freedom, and their possibilities, within the law. This is a great moment in the life of humanity and it is rich with the possibilities for change.</p> <p>Maybe \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will begin the real change that our world so desperately needs.

  "<h2>Top story: It\u2019s like the toppling of Saddam statue, says historian</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start your week.</p> \n<p>Anti-racism campaigners have claimed a symbolic victory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">after protesters in Bristol toppled a statue to the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston</a> that has long been the focus of anger in the city. Demonstrators driven by the worldwide reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis gathered at the memorial on Sunday before attaching ropes to it, hauling it down and then pushing it into the docks. The historian David Olusoga&nbsp;compared it to the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Iraq but home secretary, Priti Patel,&nbsp;called the incident \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Colston made a fortune from the slave trade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests\">but was honoured by the city for his philanthropy</a> to churches, almshouses and schools, some of which still bear his name. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">After a weekend of protests all over the country</a>, ministers have been criticised by black politicians and campaigners<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/ministers-face-backlash-over-suggestions-that-britain-is-not-racist\"> for claiming that Britain is not racist</a>.

  "<p>The moment Gareth Thomas found out he was HIV positive, all he could imagine was the Aids epidemic. Sensational images of his future took over: frailty, shame, isolation, social exclusion. He remembered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/04/how-we-made-dont-die-of-ignorance-aids-campaign\">Norman Fowler\u2019s tombstone advert</a> and the people with leprosy he learned about at school who were banished to colonies. He thought it was a death sentence.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an overriding feeling that my life was over,\u201d says the former Welsh rugby captain. \u201cIt\u2019s like somebody holding a gun to your head and pulling the trigger \u2013 how do you explain how that feels?\u201d</p> <p>It has been almost nine months <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gareththomas14/status/1172979157762039810\">since Thomas announced </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gareththomas14/status/1172979157762039810\">he was HIV positive</a>. A BBC documentary, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0008yrh/gareth-thomas-hiv-and-me\">Gareth Thomas: HIV and Me</a>, aired shortly afterwards. He timed the announcement to coincide with his taking <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-wales-49713288/gareth-thomas-takes-on-ironman-wales-to-break-hiv-stigma\">part in an Ironman triathlon</a>. It was a carefully orchestrated media campaign to drive home a very simple message: HIV didn\u2019t weaken him. He was in control. His life was not over.</p> <p>Thomas is probably the most famous person who has talked about living in the UK with HIV. The Terrence Higgins Trust conducted a survey shortly after his announcement and found that 74% of British adults were aware he had HIV, which was helped by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50440058\">Prince Harry\u2019s public show of support</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I knew about HIV was everything I shouldn\u2019t have known about HIV,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very historical, very past tense and very unfactual.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/04/living-with-hiv-always-get-asked-are-you-going-to-die\">Like many people living with HIV</a> today, Thomas takes one pill every day at 6am, which stops the virus from replicating in his body. Modern antiretroviral medication reduces the virus in the bloodstream to such an extent that a person becomes \u201cundetectable\u201d \u2013 they are unable to pass on the virus through sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef3006211760e6b3707c1714567ca759ddccd554\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef3006211760e6b3707c1714567ca759ddccd554/0_0_2204_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Thomas playing against the All Blacks for the Lions in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing against the All Blacks for the Lions in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beginning of lockdown got him in a \u201cright old tizz\u201d, he says, speaking via Zoom from his home near Bridgend, Wales, where he lives with his husband, Stephen Williams-Thomas. Hearing the word \u201cvirus\u201d on the radio constantly brought him back to darker times \u2013 and the fear he felt about finding out he was HIV positive. He cried a lot.</p> <p>Now he is in a more comfortable rhythm. \u201cIn the first week of lockdown, I thought: I\u2019ve got to get super-fit, learn maths, read books and bake banana bread. There was all that pressure that you can\u2019t waste time. Now I just do the stuff I want to do.\u201d This includes walking the dog and spending lots of time with his husband, \u201cwhich is really nice because it\u2019s not something we are used to\u201d. His work, as a media commentator and campaigner, is at a \u201cbare minimum now\u201d, in contrast to its usual hectic pace \u2013 and the house-move just down the road that was supposed to be completed is on hold. \u201cI\u2019m not buying into the pressure of having to fill my time just because I\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p> <p>Is it hard to be still, as someone who built a career out of competing? \u201cPeople think competitors are winners, or people who have to concede. I\u2019m competitive because I enjoy competition \u2013 not because I feel like I have to achieve something. I really found this \u2013 not having any competition for probably the first time ever in this world \u2013 quite calming.\u201d</p> <p>He first got married in 2001, to Jemma Thomas, whom he had known at school. He came out to her in 2006, and she supported him through his public announcement of his&nbsp;sexuality. Their divorce was finalised in 2010 and Thomas married Stephen a few years ago, without fanfare. In fact, he made the marriage public only after revealing his HIV diagnosis, thanking his partner for his support. Carrying such a secret is familiar territory for Thomas \u2013 when he came out publicly in 2009 at the age of 35, becoming one of the first professional athletes to do so, he said he had endured \u201cyears of despair\u201d keeping his sexuality a secret from his wife, friends, family and colleagues. Even today, he shuts down any questions about his marriages.</p> <p>Thomas shot on to the professional rugby scene in 1994, aged 20, playing for his home town, Bridgend. He made his international debut just a year later against Japan. It was playing for Wales that cemented his reputation. Career highlights include captaining Wales in 2005 to the first grand slam in 27 years, in 2007, before going on to become the country\u2019s most capped rugby union player (he was overtaken by Stephen Jones in 2011).</p> <p>To come out in the macho world of rugby was, at the time, extraordinary. To come out as HIV positive in 2019 felt similarly enormous. \u201cIt felt much more shameful,\u201d he says. He won\u2019t say when he was first diagnosed, in order to protect his previous partners, but it was some time ago. Unlike his sexuality, he felt he would be blamed for his HIV status and told that he should have been more careful. \u201cThis was something that I felt people wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac8b5a76564534f8c4052ea1ab89cab910a77085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac8b5a76564534f8c4052ea1ab89cab910a77085/0_69_3124_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Harry attending a Terrence Higgins Trust event with Gareth Thomas at Twickenham last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Harry attending a Terrence Higgins Trust event with Thomas at Twickenham last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He would be proved right. For evidence that stigma against those with HIV is still very much alive, consider the manner with which Thomas was forced to tell his parents. One day, having stayed with them, his father was driving him to get a train to London. They noticed a man standing in the road. His father pulled over to check if he was OK.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a reporter. He stuck his head in the window and he said to my father: \u2018Do you have any comment about your son having HIV?\u2019 I put the window up and I said to my father: \u2018Just drive.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thomas reassured his father that it was \u201cjust the press looking for a story\u201d. Thomas boarded the train to London and his father went home. The reporter followed his dad.</p> <p>\u201cHe knocked on the door and my mum and my dad answered,\u201d says Thomas. They noticed a recording device in the reporter\u2019s pocket. Again, the reporter asked them to comment on their son\u2019s HIV status. His parents refused and closed the door. \u201cThen I had the phone call from my mother, in tears. I have never felt like I was so far away from home in my entire life.\u201d</p> <p>When Thomas arrived back in Wales that night, he went to his parents\u2019 house and told them everything. They, too, had very little understanding about the realities of being HIV positive in the UK today. \u201cWhat this journalist didn\u2019t know is that my parents thought I was gonna die \u2013 they didn\u2019t know any different.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas and his legal team were granted an injunction<strong> </strong>preventing the newspaper from revealing that he was HIV positive. It was the catalyst for Thomas deciding to go public, however, and he began making the BBC documentary. Before its release, though, his legal team were unable to prevent a story running in the Sun about an unnamed sports star who was about to reveal that he had HIV.</p> <p>Thomas says the article was \u201cthe biggest load of bullshit to do with HIV\u201d. Why does he think there is still an appetite to expose people as HIV positive? \u201cBecause people don\u2019t know that much about HIV, it is a really easy subject to sensationalise. There are not that many public figures who are open about it.\u201d</p> <p>He is still angry about losing his autonomy over the situation. Thomas is incredibly close to his family, especially his parents, and is fiercely protective of them. \u201cIt was my right to pick the moment to tell my family about this. It wasn\u2019t somebody else\u2019s right to force that moment upon us. I can never pick that moment again.

Since then, he has counselled other athletes on coming out, including a few footballers.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a media witch-hunt,\u201d says Thomas about the intense focus on the potential first openly gay Premier League player. \u201cIf it\u2019s taking up column inches now, when there isn\u2019t one, imagine what it will take up when the reality comes our way.

He will probably be remembered as much for his achievements off the field as those on them \u2013 he has used his platform to champion issues close to him: LGBTQ+ equality, mental health and, more recently, raising awareness about HIV.

Of course, we\u2019re in a highly contentious region, where we don\u2019t have easy access or easy communication with our neighbours.

Orange tips danced in spring meadows of cow parsley and hedge garlic, small tortoiseshells overwintered on dusty shed beams, and white admirals fed on bramble flowers by a local ford. Commas followed me north when I moved to Northumberland, a species extending its range, but not the <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/butterflies/brimstone\" title=\"\">brimstones</a> that were a zing of lime yellow in the rambling garden. I haven\u2019t seen those for many years.</p> <p>So it was with a bolt of recognition that I spotted a large yellow butterfly as I was putting away my gardening tools in the late afternoon heat. I chased it excitedly with my phone for 10 minutes, as it jerked and kinked over the vegetables, pausing for a second on some woody cranesbill, where I got a distant shot as an initial record. With a strong, determined flight, it favoured the red campion in my wildflower meadow and, with careful stalking, I managed a closer photograph. The acid yellow of its sculpted wings looked dazzling next to the vivid pink flower.

Their caterpillar food plants, though, are the leaves of buckthorn and alder buckthorn, neither of which are known to grow in this area and why there are <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/butterflies/brimstone\" title=\"\">so few recorded here</a>.</p> <p>On average there are just two brimstones a year in this county.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s special relationship with the US may end if Donald Trump wins a second term, some of the UK\u2019s most senior retired diplomats and Conservative foreign policy specialists have said.

It also reflects diplomatic outreach to the UK by Biden\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, Antony Blinken.</p> <p>UK diplomats have instead been looking to form a broader alternative alliance of democracies that dilutes dependence on the US.</p> <p>Rory Stewart, the former Conservative international development secretary, said in one assessment: \u201cIf Trump comes in for another four years that will be very challenging for the global system and for Britain\u2019s relationship with the US.

Almost since Suez, they have been our default.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2000f3bb783a203f464d704123c6d5e9faa6fb5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2000f3bb783a203f464d704123c6d5e9faa6fb5f/0_21_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK had taken for granted for years that it would fall into line with US foreign policy position,&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;Any change to that would require a rethink by the&nbsp;Foreign Office&nbsp;because it&nbsp;\u201csometimes had no idea what an independent policy would feel like\u201d.</p> <p>Sir John Sawers, the former head of M16 and a former UK ambassador to the UN, also said Trump\u2019s re-election would be problematic. \u201cThere is no doubt President Trump is the most difficult president for us to deal with,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHe does not really feel that sense of being part of that transatlantic community, he does not really believe in alliances. He does not really believe in American leadership in the world. We are seeing in this pandemic for the first time what a crisis is like without American leadership. It is the first time in our lifetime we have experienced that.</p> <p>\u201cIf he gets elected for a second time some of the changes we have seen in the past few years will become embedded and entrenched and then, absolutely Britain will not be so much a bridge between the US and Europe. We will need to be bounding closely together with our European partners\u201d .</p> <p>Speaking before the Black Lives Matter protests, he said the election was poised 50-50, and that if Biden were elected the UK would not simply be able to get back into bed with the US as it had been in the past. He called for \u201cmiddle-level powers to come together to tackle China and climate change\u201d. Both men were speaking at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics.</p> <p>In a sign of British diplomats\u2019 despair with Trump, Sir Peter Westmacott, a former ambassador to Washington, said: \u201cI would love to say, as we look to the future, would it not be nice to see political leadership also addressing old-fashioned principles such as accountability, respect for the rule of law, independent judiciary, telling the truth, institutional independence and indeed the importance of a free press?</p> <p>\u201cThat may not be what public opinion is crying out for, but they are not very far removed from the principles that \u2026 Biden believes in. Otherwise the chances of the western world retaining any sort of moral leadership and giving itself the right to call out other people when they behave badly will be gone forever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99/0_134_2655_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Westmacott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Westmacott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Debate is fierce in British diplomatic circles about whether Trump merely marks the acceleration of a pre-existing trend to a more disengaged US, and whether Biden is either willing or able to reverse the trend.</p> <p>Blinken has tried to reassure British diplomats that Biden will re-engage with multilateral institutions, and told the London thinktank Chatham House that US leadership would return. \u201cWhen Joe Biden looks at the world, one thing stands out. Whether we like it not, the world tends not to organise itself and, for 75 plus years, the US played the leading role in working to organise the world, establishing the institutions, writing the rules and setting the norms,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are not doing that, then one of two things happen. Either someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our interest and values, or no one is, and that can be even worse. Then you have a vacuum which tends to be filled by malevolent things before good things. So the US has a responsibility and self-interest in leading with humility.\u201d</p> <p>Many senior former UK ambassadors are desperately hoping Washington will lead again. One said: \u201cI think that if you have a different, more internationally minded leadership in the US then a lot of what has happened over the past few years can be reversed. If we get another four years of this leadership, then some of the bonds and some of the cement that holds the west together, and holds Europe and America together will be broken forever. If things change in November then we can recapture things if we get the right sort of leadership in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The same diplomat also said, however, that Biden might \u2013 like Barack Obama \u2013 see Europe and particularly Germany as his primary interlocutor: \u201cIf you get a Joe Biden presidency in the US, then the relationship will focus again on Europe, on Germany and France, and we may feel a little neglected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674/0_0_2468_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kay Nietfield/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that although Boris Johnson was closer to Trump than most European leaders, the importance of the special relationship was overrated. \u201cIf I\u2019m brutally frank it has not been that special for awhile,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Obama wanted to know what Europe thought about something his first call was to Merkel.\u201d</p> <p>Another ambassador from Tony Blair\u2019s time as prime minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to imagine restored American leadership to a multilateral world. I do not think it is all over, but it does make the November election incredibly important. I cannot see that happening under a Trump II administration. It\u2019s possible, however, to imagine Joe Biden trying to lead us back to a more normative, multilateral and cohesive world.\u201d&nbsp;He pointed to Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw 9,500 US troops from Germany as a sign of the pressure likely to be placed on Nato if he is re-elected.</p> <p>In his address to Chatham House, Blinken gave the impression that the US under Biden would seek to revive the Iran nuclear deal Obama signed but which Trump abandoned. Although he was unremitting in his criticism of Iran\u2019s behaviour in the Middle East, he stressed that the original deal was designed to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and not its wider behaviour.</p> <p>Blinken was also critical of China for its lack of transparency over the coronavirus, and called on Beijing to be a responsible stakeholder, a phrase first used in 2005 by the then US assistant secretary of state Robert Zoellick.</p>",

Like a belligerent orator at Speakers\u2019 Corner, they kept getting moved on until they either wound up in the darkest corners of the web, or mumbling on podcasts in code about the \u201cdark forces\u201d they could not name.</p> <p>While some in the wellness world appear to have had a terrible time of it, the restrictions actually feed into their ur-narrative. That is:&nbsp;evil forces, including big tech (like YouTube and Facebook which have been removing content), big media and big government are intent on silencing them.&nbsp;</p> <p>This shutting down, or censorship as they call it, further fuses their experiences with figures in the alt-right (including Alex Jones and Steve Bannon), veterans of no-platforming and first amendment wars. These \u201ctrauma bonds\u201d, which strengthen and unite disparate movements, is a maturation of <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537903.2011.539846\">the trend of Conspirituality</a>, a term coined by Charlotte Ward in 2011 in an article published in the Journal of Contemporary Religion.&nbsp;</p> <p>She noted the overlap between wellness and new age groups and the alt-right as being a \u201cbroad politico-spiritual philosophy based on two core convictions, the first traditional to conspiracy theory, the second rooted in the New Age: 1) a secret group covertly controls, or is trying to control, the political and social order, and 2) humanity is undergoing a \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 in consciousness. Proponents believe that the best strategy for dealing with the threat of a totalitarian \u2018new world order\u2019 is to act in accordance with an awakened \u2018new paradigm\u2019 worldview.\u201d</p> <p>Spending time in this Conspiritual world, it\u2019s easy to see the ecosystem. The same arguments or phrases start appearing, whether you are listening to a podcaster broadcasting from his basement in Byron Bay, or reading the Medium post of a philosopher and yoga teacher based in upstate New York.&nbsp;</p> <p>Down the rabbit hole, listening to dozens of wellness podcasts and YouTube broadcasts, the same themes keep arising: fear as a means of social control, fear as a hormone response that weakens the immune system, how social distancing and intensified hygiene practices ruin the body\u2019s natural immune response, the unhealthy body (the body with pre-existing conditions) being a body that is more reliant on and easily controlled by the state and Big Pharma.&nbsp;</p> <p>Deeply embedded and perhaps central in the connection between the wellness industry and conspiracy is the notion of sovereignty over our bodies. For believers, the sovereign body is the body in a \u201cpure\u201d state, not reliant on chemicals to heal, and trusted to fire up its own immune response when confronted with a virus \u2013 even a novel one like Covid-19.&nbsp;Believers aren\u2019t dissuaded by the facts: all the pure bodies that died because there wasn\u2019t a smallpox or polio or chickenpox vaccine.</p> <p>For many in the wellness industry, a pure body is their life\u2019s work. Don\u2019t underestimate their fight.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>\u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist and the author of Wellmania (Black Inc)</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 to clarify that acupuncturists, yoga studios and alternative medicine&nbsp;practitioners&nbsp;were only forced to close in some countries.</p> <p><br></p>"
