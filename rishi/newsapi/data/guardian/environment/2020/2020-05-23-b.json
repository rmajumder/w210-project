  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Fresh witnesses cast doubt on lockdown behaviour of UK PM\u2019s aide </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">New testimony from sources</a> suggests that Dominic Cummings, chief aide to the British prime minister, made at least two trips from London to Durham, and travelled to tourist hotspots in the north-east of England. The reports have led to a chorus of calls for the spin doctor to be sacked, including from the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and SNP, while Labour called for an urgent investigation.</p> <h2>Police rebut UK government claims over chief adviser</h2> <p>Durham constabulary have insisted they did speak to Cummings over allegations he broke the lockdown. The rebuttal came after Downing Street claimed that \u201cat no stage was [Cummings] or his family spoken to by the police about this matter\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>New York\u2019s daily death toll falls below 100 for first time since March</strong></h2> <p>Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York had recorded 84 new deaths from coronavirus on 22 May, the first time the figure has dropped below 100 since late March. He also eased the ban on group gatherings, altering restrictions to allow up to 10 people to meet up.</p> <h2><strong>French death toll falls below Spain for first time in 10 days</strong></h2> <p>France recorded a further 250 deaths, bringing the total to 144,806. However, after confirming several hundred deaths on Friday, Spain\u2019s death toll stood at 28,678 on Saturday, 346 more than France. This is the first time the Spanish toll has overtaken the French for 10 days, giving Spain the world\u2019s fourth-highest death toll after the US, Britain and Italy.</p> <h2>Trump causes controversy with golfing trip</h2> <p>Donald Trump has stirred fresh controversy after travelling from the White House to play a round of golf at his Virginia club. Despite a rising American death toll, which is now approaching 100,000, Trump has been keen to return the US to normality, and encouraging states to kickstart their economies.</p> <h2>UK government to put <strong>\u00a3283m into restoring public transport</strong></h2> <p>The British government has announced it is investing \u00a3283m into getting public transport back to normal services, having been cut back during the coronavirus pandemic. However, transport secretary Grant Shapps said that even a fully restored service would only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing.</p> <h2>German religious gathering led to more than 40 infections</h2> <p>More than 40 people have been infected with coronavirus after attending a mass in Frankfurt earlier this month. Six were admitted to hospital. The service was held on 10 May, a few days after the reopening of places of worship in Germany, the daily Frankfurter Rundschau reported. Germany began to relax the restrictions put in place to control the spread of the virus at the beginning of May, after a strong decline in new cases, but fears remain of a second wave in the country.</p> <h2>India to organise special trains for migrant workers</h2> <p>The Indian government has pledged to organise special trains to get at least 3.6 million stranded migrant workers back to their homes. Many have been walking for hundred of miles, after becoming stranded in cities where work ceased to be available due to the pandemic.</p> <h2>Cyprus beaches reopen</h2> <p>Beaches in Cyprus have reopened, as the country marks its first day of zero new cases of coronavirus since its first cases were reported on 9 March. Residents had only been allowed to swim, but can now congregate on the beaches as long as they remain spaced apart. Only members of the same family can participate in water sports together.</p>",

But a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/one-final-viral-infusion-trumps-move-to-block-travel-from-europe-triggered-chaos-and-a-surge-of-passengers-from-the-outbreaks-center/2020/05/23/64836a00-962b-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html\">new Washington Post story</a> reveals how that decision and the muddled messaging surrounding it may well have sealed the country\u2019s coronavirus fate.</p> \n  <p>While Trump points to his travel ban of China as evidence of his proactive response, mounting evidence indicates the outbreak was \u201cdriven overwhelmingly\u201d by Europe:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The images [of airport chaos] showed how a policy intended to block the pathogen\u2019s entry into the United States instead delivered one final viral infusion. As those exposed travelers fanned out into U.S. cities and suburbs, they became part of an influx from Europe that went unchecked for weeks and helped to seal the country\u2019s coronavirus fate.</p> \n   <p>Epidemiologists contend the U.S. outbreak was driven overwhelmingly by viral strains from Europe rather than China. More than 1.8 million travelers entered the United States from Europe in February alone as that continent became the center of the pandemic. Infections reached critical mass in New York and other cities well before the White House took action, according to studies mapping the virus\u2019s spread. The crush of travelers triggered by Trump\u2019s announcement only added to that viral load.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And <em>about</em> that China ban, which has become the bulwark of Trump\u2019s defense of his administration\u2019s response:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When Trump moved to block travel from China in January, there were few indications of disruption at affected airports. But while the president has depicted that decision as one he made before anyone else recognized it was necessary, in reality major airlines were forcing his hand.</p> \n   <p>Delta and American had announced on Jan. 31 they were suspending routes to China before Trump announced the restrictions. United informed the White House it had already decided to do the same but was willing to hold off on announcing it publicly if Trump was prepared to act swiftly in issuing an order, officials said. Eager to claim credit for acting to contain the virus, Trump\u2019s announcement came within hours.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Trump arrived back at the White House following this morning\u2019s golf outing at 2.41pm, according to a pool report. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec97e9a8f08a1782fa805fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T19:52:45.383Z\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported 1,595,885 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 24,268.</strong> The number of deaths had risen by 1,852 to 96,002.</p> \n  <p>The figures, which have just been announced, were correct as of 4pm ET on Friday, and compared with the same count a day earlier.</p> \n  <p>If you\u2019re wondering about any discrepancies, it\u2019s possible that the CDC figures do not reflect cases reported by individual states.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9795a8f08a1782fa805f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T19:29:35.994Z\">8.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Arkansas governor <strong>Asa Hutchinson</strong> has warned of a second peak of Covid-19 in the southern state nearly 30 days after the first during his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6sdJil9IY\">coronavirus response media briefing</a> on Saturday in Little Rock. </p> \n  <p>The state\u2019s health department reported 163 new coronavirus cases with two more lives lost in the last 24 hours, he said.

Bryan Armen Graham will be here to take you through the day later, but for now, I\u2019m your guide. </p> \n  <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/15/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland</a>, <strong>the US has now recorded 1,601,260 cases and 96,002 deaths</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Rates are slowing in some states hard-hit in the first part of the outbreak, New York notably among them, and increasing elsewhere. Nonetheless, most states are attempting some form of economic reopening \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">nearly 40m Americans have filed for unemployment under lockdown</a>, after all \u2013 and debate is raging over whether those states moving fastest are moving too fast for safety.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the American summer, and the title of this piece by Amanda Holpuch, Nina Lakhani and Khushbu Shah rather sums up the question: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/america-coronavirus-covid-19-second-wave\">America begins to unlock for summer \u2013 but is it inviting a disastrous second wave?</a></strong></p> \n  <p>Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think so, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">on Friday at the White House</a> he invoked powers he doesn\u2019t have to say governors<strong> should reopen all places of worship</strong> and if they didn\u2019t, he would. Once again, he can\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t if it came to it, do that. <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/can-federal-government-override-state-government-rules-social-distancing-promote-economy\">Tenth amendment, etc</a>. As for the motivation behind Trump\u2019s curt announcement, there are reports that his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-churches-evaneglicals-coronavirus-274842\">support among evangelicals is slipping</a>.</p> \n  <p>That would be intensely worrying for Trump in <strong>a re-election year already marked by economic meltdown</strong>. On the upside for the president, on Friday a gaffe by his notoriously gaffe-prone opponent, Joe Biden (if he were a British football manager, he would\u2019ve earned the standard honorific \u201cthe Gaffer\u201d many years ago), showed how swiftly and ferociously the Trump campaign machine still runs.</p> \n  <p>Some say Biden needs only to stay in his Delaware basement to beat Trump. But on Friday, from his basement, the former vice-president told an African American radio host if you \u201c<strong>have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black</strong>\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">Biden apologised as the Trump campaign pounced</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/black-americans-joe-biden-democratic-party-relationship\">liberals too</a>.</p> \n  <p>So there\u2019s that, and any resultant fallout, to consider along with all things coronavirus-related.</p> \n  <p>In the meantime, some further reading. Khushbuh Shah reports from Georgia, a Republican state turning slightly more Democratic, on how one\u2019s view of how soon to reopen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/23/georgia-coronavirus-us-reopening-covid-19-brian-kemp\">depends largely on the way one votes</a>: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/23/georgia-coronavirus-us-reopening-covid-19-brian-kemp\">\u2018It depends on your politics\u2019: Georgia\u2019s uneven reopening breaks along party lines</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div>",
  "<p>Muslims worldwide prepared to celebrate Eid under lockdown, with the strictest governments bringing in 24-hour curfews for the holiday \u2013 but across the world the slow march is continuing out of coronavirus quarantine.</p> <p>For the first time since the beginning of the outbreak, China said it had recorded no new cases of the virus; <strong>Spain</strong> joined <strong>Greece</strong> in saying it would be reopening to foreign tourists from July, and also said its football league would start again next month.</p> <p>There was positive news from <strong>Africa</strong>, with World Health Organization\u2019s office for the continent <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/news/africa-covid-19-cases-top-100-000\">saying that the pandemic</a> \u201cappears to be taking a different pathway in Africa\u201d. It has taken 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases, and mortality rates have been lower than in Europe and the US.</p> <p>Swift action to close borders and bring in lockdowns, as well as the continent\u2019s relatively youthful demography \u2013 with more than 60% of the population under 25 \u2013 may have helped slow the spread of the virus and limited its impact.</p> <p>\u201cFor now Covid-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.</p> <p>\u201cIt is possible our youth dividend is paying off and leading to fewer deaths. But we must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases.\u201d</p> <p>The global toll now stands at more than 5.2m cases and 339,000 deaths. Over a quarter of all confirmed infections and fatalities are in the <strong>United States</strong>; the <strong>UK</strong> has the second highest death toll; while <strong>Russia</strong> has the second highest number of cases.</p> <p>In <strong>India</strong>, where case numbers are still rising two months into a lockdown, the government has pledged to organise special trains to get at least 3.6 million stranded migrant workers back to their homes. Many have walked hundreds of miles to escape cities where work abruptly dried up.</p> <p>Muslims this weekend will celebrate Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, but the coronavirus has cast a long shadow over one of year\u2019s most important holidays. Normally a time to gather with friends and family, this year millions will be confined to their homes, worried about work, or without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ubvescrjEiDI/\" data-alt=\"Covid deaths in selected countries\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ubvescrjEiDI/\">Covid deaths in selected countries</a> <figcaption>Covid deaths in selected countries ahead of Eid al-Fitr.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are round-the-clock curfews in countries including <strong>Turkey</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong> and <strong>Jordan</strong> for the duration of Eid, to prevent any kind of gatherings. <strong>Egypt</strong> has extended a nighttime curfew.

It comes after fighting intensified between the warring sides despite the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cDo not carry out any offensive operations against the enemy anywhere, if any action is taken against you by the enemy, defend yourself,\u201d wrote spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, adding that the ceasefire was declared solely for Eid festivities. The Afghan government has just welcomed the move.</p> <p>Many religious groups have been pushing for places of worship to reopen, with Donald Trump on Friday adding his voice of support by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">ordering churches, mosques and synagogues open</a>, even though he has no authority to do so.</p> <p>But religious gatherings have repeatedly proved sources of mass infection, across faiths and continents. Most recently a cluster of more than 40 cases in <strong>Germany</strong> was traced back to a mass held in Frankfurt on 10 May, a few days after the church reopened for services. Six people were admitted.</p> <p>In the US, the virus claimed another major corporate casualty. Car-hire firm Hertz, which is 102 years old, filed for bankruptcy protection, after revenue particularly from airport car hire dried up. But New York began a gradual opening up, where small groups of up to 10 people will be allowed to gather, if they stay six feet apart or wear face masks.</p> <p>In <strong>China</strong>, despite a recent flare up of cases in the north, the virus still appears to be under control. The country has sealed its borders to all non-citizens for several weeks, to help prevent it resurfacing.</p> <p>Beijing\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province and no confirmed new cases. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said.</p>",

One is acting as a de facto prosecutor in the disciplinary case. The other threatened the student with contempt of court proceedings this week for attempting to cite documents in his defence that had been obtained under subpoena in a separate legal matter.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Pavlou stormed out of a disciplinary hearing decrying it as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d. No verdict has been handed down but the student told Guardian Australia he is already preparing a supreme court of Queensland appeal, with the high-profile free speech advocate, barrister Tony Morris QC, in tow.</p> <h2><strong>Death threats and \u2018separatist activities\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On 24 June last year, a Hong Kong democracy protest at the university was crashed by a pro-Beijing group, many of whom could not be identified as enrolled students.</p> <p>Video of the incident shows Pavlou involved in an altercation, after first being set upon by the counter-protesters. He is knocked to the ground. The police are called.</p> <p>The aftermath of that event largely set in motion what followed: an increased focus on the university\u2019s relationship with China, and Pavlou escalating his activism.</p> <p>Emails released by the university this week show on the evening of the brawl, a deputy vice-chancellor sent a message to the Chinese consulate in Brisbane to explain how it had handled the situation.</p> <p>Two days later the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, released his own statement praising the \u201cspontaneous patriotic behaviour\u201d of the pro-China members of the crowd, and effectively, Pavlou claims, accusing him of \u201canti-China separatist activities \u2013 a capital crime in China\u201d.</p> <p>Recently prior to the incident, the university had made Xu an adjunct professor, but issued no public announcement.</p> <p>\u201cHave a think about the contrast,\u201d Pavlou says. \u201c[The vice-chancellor] has allowed this guy to remain at the university, after applauding violence on campus.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s apparently me who has put their reputation at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Pavlou subsequently sought a court order, similar to a restraining order, against Xu, who he claims endangered him. That case is ongoing.</p> <h2><strong>Ties to China in the spotlight</strong></h2> <p>The University of Queensland, one of the prestigious \u201cgroup of eight\u201d institutions, has arguably the strongest ties to China of any in Australia. Before the coronavirus pandemic about 40% of its international cohort \u2013 about 7,000 students in total \u2013 were from mainland China.</p> <p>H\u00f8j was, until recently, a consultant to Beijing\u2019s global Confucius Institute headquarters \u2013 known as Hanban \u2013 and a member of its governing council, which is responsible for more than 500 institutes operating in universities and schools across the world.</p> <p>UQ\u2019s Confucius Institute was one of several to <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/universities-rewrite-confucius-institute-contracts-amid-foreign-influence-scrutiny-20200310-p548my.html\">renegotiate its contract with Hanban</a>, amid foreign influence concerns.

I don\u2019t see any evidence that discussion of human rights issues vis-a-vis China is somehow silenced or sort of muted in Australian campuses.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the university says disciplinary matters were initiated in response to complaints, and were guided by the UQ\u2019s processes and values.</p> <p>\u201cThe claim that an ongoing student disciplinary matter is politically or financially motivated is simply not true.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a responsibility to ensure that all students and staff feel that they are able to express their opinions \u2013 not just those with the loudest voices. Holding different opinions is part of everyday life at university \u2013 that\u2019s what we must continue to protect and stand for.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is important to recognise is that \u2018free speech\u2019 does not absolve us from our responsibilities to ensure other members of our community, including vulnerable people, are not intimidated or vilified.</p> <p>\u201cThe university takes our duty of care to students and staff seriously. Our values are not \u2018sport\u2019, they are not \u2018satire\u2019 and we can\u2019t ignore them if that is more convenient.

  "<p>\u201cIt is not like George Best turning up in town.\u201d Ask Stephen Vaughan, the chief executive of Wasps, about whether marquee players add to the opposition\u2019s gate receipts when they visit and he gives a blunt response.

They understand life has changed. We have very little revenue coming in and we are spending considerable time looking at parts of the business, including the playing side, and how we can be more efficient when we are able to open the doors again. We have talked to the players and coaches about what it will look like and they have not held back in their views.\u201d</p> <p>Similar conversations have been held throughout the Premiership in recent weeks, which is why many clubs were angry when Bristol broke ranks this week when they said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/bristol-put-forward-ashton-gate-venue-for-premiership-rugby-union-restart\">they would oppose the recommendation of Lord Myners</a>, in his recent report on the salary cap regulations, that the provision for two marquee players outside the cap should be reviewed, as well as any attempt to lower the cap from its current \u00a37m, which has another season to run.</p> <p>\u201cEvery club is entitled to its opinion,\u201d says Vaughan, who this week became the group chief executive, adding the portfolio of events at the Ricoh Arena to the fields of sport, marketing and commerce that he had been in charge of since August after seven years at Gloucester. \u201cBristol\u2019s vision is to win league titles and Europe and if they have the money to back it up, their strategy will not be cutting the salary cap. You will always get a couple of outliers with rich backers but the majority of clubs have a really sensible approach.</p> <p>\u201cYou only have to look at the accounts of clubs in general to realise that pretty much every one makes a loss and does not work as a sustainable business. The lack of revenue now will only heighten that problem. Even though players have had a salary cut of 25%, it does not go very far in covering the massive costs of running that department when there is no income being generated.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic has shone a light on the unsustainability clubs were at already and the majority neither want nor will be able to continue to operate in the new world in the same way we did then. We believe a collective approach is better than everyone doing their own thing: one of the Premiership\u2019s objectives is to have a competitive league and it is because each club is paying within a few shillings of its rivals.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughan sympathises with Bristol who, after years in the Championship, have the means to tilt at the big time. \u201cIt is not their fault they have an owner in the rich list and wants great things for the club he loves. I have no malice with them, but it will sit differently with those who may not think it is in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve during this pandemic. Collective action is sensible in the light of the hole in revenue every club will face.

In Austria, vaccine scepticism was similarly rife, with 18% of those questioned saying they would reject vaccination.</p> <p>In Germany, where 9% opposed vaccination in April, the figure may have since increased as the virus has claimed fewer victims relative to other countries. A parallel survey by the university of Erfurt found the number of Germans asked whether they would take a Covid-19 vaccine when it became available had dropped from 79% in mid-April to 63% last week.</p> <p>In the UK, where ORB International surveyed opinions from 6 to 7 May, 10% of respondents said they were unwilling to be vaccinated.</p> <p>While scientists predict that immunising about 70% of the population could be sufficient for the virus to vanish, there are concerns that a noisy minority could seize the narrative around vaccination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a real fear of an unholy alliance between esoteric leftwingers, the far right and the Reichsb\u00fcrger movement</p> <footer> <cite>Natalie Grams, doctor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Germany\u2019s foreign minister Heiko Maas has jokingly advised the public to \u201ckeep a lot more than just a 1.5-metre distance\u201d from those spreading conspiracy theories, but fears of the movement growing into a force equivalent to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/pegida-germany-anti-immigrant-group-polarising-dresden\">Pegida protests against Angela Merkel\u2019s asylum policy</a> seem to be shaping the thinking in Berlin\u2019s seats of power.</p> <p>In spite of some scientists calling for mandatory vaccination against Covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/german-health-minister-migration-patriotism\">health minister </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/german-health-minister-migration-patriotism\">Jens Spahn</a> has said he would favour a voluntary programme, while the mooted introduction of \u201cimmunity passports\u201d for those who have been vaccinated or developed antibodies was withdrawn from a new \u201cpandemic law\u201d that passed through the Bundestag this month.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real fear of an unholy alliance between esoteric leftwingers, the far right and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/germany-fears-radicalisation-of-reichsburger-group-after-attacks-on-police\">Reichsb\u00fcrger movement</a>,\u201d said Natalie Grams, a doctor and author who specialises in debunking claims about the effectiveness of alternative medicine.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to people strongly opposed to vaccinations, you are usually looking at 2-4% of the population in Germany.

Anti-vaxxers are exploiting this uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>In France, anti-vaccination sentiments are seen as a phenomenon of the current millennium, fed by a wider distrust of central government. In German-speaking countries, by contrast, wariness of vaccination programmes dates back to the 19th century.</p> <p>In the first half of the 20th century, anti-vaxxer views converged with anti-semitism: the Third Reich was rife with conspiracy theories presenting vaccination programmes as a Jewish plot to either poison the German nation or \u201csubmit humanity to Jewish mammonism\u201d.</p> <p>Some historians believe that voluntary vaccination programmes against Covid-19 would not only be less politically risky but also more effective at protecting the population from coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to vaccination programmes, the debate is rarely about the disease itself but about the relationship between the individual and the state\u201d, said historian Malte Thiessen, who runs the Institute for Westphalian History in M\u00fcnster. \u201cIn Germany this is a question that goes back to the 19th century: can the government force people to be healthy?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain to reopen to foreign tourists from July</h2> <p>The Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that tourism from foreign visitors will be allowed from July. S\u00e1nchez said the Spanish government would \u201cguarantee\u201d the tourists would not bring the virus to Spain, although it is unclear exactly what measures will be taken.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez said that central and regional governments had been planning the reopening of the tourist industry for weeks, as he encouraged Spaniards to plan domestic holidays and told overseas visitors that \u201cSpain will be waiting for you from July\u201d.</p> <h2>PM\u2019s top aide says he will \u2018obviously not\u2019 resign</h2> <p>Dominic Cummings has said he will \u201cobviously not\u201d resign over reports that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">broke lockdown restrictions</a> in March. Transport secretary Grant Shapps told the UK\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing that Boris Johnson\u2019s top aide had the prime minister\u2019s full support, and denied reports that Cummings was spoken to by the police over the alleged rule breaking.</p> <h2><strong>UK death toll rises to 36,675</strong></h2> <p>Shapps also told the briefing that 36,675 people had died in the UK across all settings, including hospitals and care homes, an increase of 282 fatalities since Friday.</p> <h2>La Liga to restart in June</h2> <p>Spanish football\u2019s La Liga <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/23/la-liga-given-all-clear-to-resume-season-after-three-month-break\">will return</a> after a three-month break in the week beginning 8 June, with plans to restart the first division with the Seville derby on 12 June. Announcing the restart, prime minister S\u00e1nchez said that the \u201cworst has passed\u201d in Spain, and that the country was now at \u201cthe end of the tunnel\u201d.</p> <h2>Iran relaxes lockdown on eve of Eid</h2> <p>Iran has begun reopening businesses, religious and cultural sites on the eve of Eid al-Fitr, and announced that all workers in the country will return to work from next Saturday. Museums and historical sites are set to reopen on Sunday, in order to coincide with the celebrations that end Ramadan, the Muslim holy fasting month, and saints\u2019 shrines will reopen on Monday.</p> <h2>New York eases restrictions on group gatherings</h2> <p>The governor of New York has signed an order allowing up to 10 people to assemble as long as they stay at least six feet from each other or wear face masks if they must stand closer \u2013 an easing of the state\u2019s ban on gathering in groups. People in New York City were also told they could visit beaches this weekend, but that they are not allowed to swim.</p> <h2>Thailand begins vaccine tests on monkeys</h2> <p>Researchers in Thailand have begun testing a coronavirus vaccine on monkeys after a positive trial in mice. The country\u2019s minister of higher education, science and research and innovation, Suvit Maesincee, said researchers hoped to have a \u201cclearer outcome\u201d of the effectiveness of the vaccine by September. It is one of at least 100 vaccines being developed worldwide.</p> <h2>Second refugee camp outbreak in Malaysia</h2> <p>Authorities in Malaysia have confirmed that there has been another outbreak of coronavirus cases in a detention centre for undocumented migrants. The Semenyih detention centre near the capital of Kuala Lumpur, which houses around 1,600 detainees, has reported 21 new cases of Covid-19. Earlier this week, 60 cases were reported among 1,400 detainees at the Bukit Jalil centre.</p>",
  "<p>Covid-19 is nature\u2019s way of making bad situations worse. From the moment it turned the world upside down, you could have predicted that the Chinese Communist party would have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/xi-critic-professor-this-may-be-last-piece-i-write-words-ring-true\">arrested whistleblowers</a> and covered up the threat to humanity.

Or in the case of tens of thousands who trusted Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, die needless deaths.</p> <p>No one, however, would have predicted this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/just-7-per-cent-of-stockholm-had-covid-19-antibodies-by-end-of-april-study-sweden-coronavirus\">news item</a> from last week: \u201cCovid-19 deaths in Sweden were the highest in Europe per capita in a rolling seven-day average between 12 and 19 May.\u201d It confirmed that Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell\u2019s \u201cmitigation\u201d strategy of allowing shops, restaurants, gyms, schools and workplaces to remain open was a deadly folly. It does not even seem to have produced herd immunity. Just 7.3% of Stockholm\u2019s inhabitants had developed Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.</p> <p>All those deaths for so little point. In Sweden of all places. A country where the need to protect society from harm is knitted into the national consensus, and whose supposed moderation produced the spectacularly inoffensive music of Abba and the furniture of Ikea. Sweden\u2019s position may be graver than the weekly figure implies, Lena Einhorn, a Swedish virologist and author, told me. Recorded cases of Covid-19 follow a bell curve. All severely infected countries, including the UK, are seeing infections fall as they move down the far side of the curve, apart from Trump\u2019s America and Sweden. In both instances, they have <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/a/WbVnJL/dodstalen-i-sverige-ar-katastrofalt-hoga\">declined slightly</a> then hit a plateau.</p> <p>The Swedish sickness is a political as well as a medical disaster. Professor <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/strategic-and-technical-advisory-group-for-infectious-hazards/members/biographies/en/index2.html\">Johan Giesecke</a>, an adviser to the Swedish government alongside Tegnell, became a star of the rightwing web as he lectured other governments on the <a href=\"https://unherd.com/thepost/coming-up-epidemiologist-prof-johan-giesecke-shares-lessons-from-sweden/\">futility</a> of their tough measures. British Conservative commentators have boomed out claims that Sweden showed there was no need to close the UK economy. Sweden had <a href=\"https://thecritic.co.uk/come-on-boris-its-time-to-end-the-lockdown/\">\u201cheld its nerve\u201d</a>, they gushed, in much the same way communists once gushed about the Soviet Union. They praised Johnson for holding his nerve for a few weeks while he let the virus run amok, but damned him as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/lockdown-sceptics-coronavirus-brexit\">\u201cscaredy cat\u201d</a> and \u201cpant-wetter\u201d as he <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/briton-nervous-nelly-europe-need-deal-coronaphobia-fast\">U-turned</a> and locked Britain down. Don\u2019t be too quick to scoff at pundits who never made it out of the prep-school playground. They may talk like prepubescents but their readers are running and wrecking the country.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every foreign visitor notices Sweden's respect for institutions and the faintly stultifying conformity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The right should not be our first concern, however, and not only because Sweden\u2019s dead deserve better. The tragedy of the Swedish outbreak is that it is a warning of what happens to countries that trust too much. We are not used to thinking about such dangers of too much deference. Across the world, strongmen have successfully undermined it in country after country. The media are biased against the leader. The civil service is filled with saboteurs. The judges aren\u2019t impartial. As they suspend parliaments and persuade their supporters that bad news is fake news, they leave them with nothing left to believe in except the leader and his party.</p> <p>Sweden has resisted the global turn towards demagoguery. Every foreign visitor notices the respect for institutions and the faintly stultifying conformity. Richard Orange, our correspondent in Stockholm, offered me the wonderful word <em>\u00e5siktskorridoren</em>, \u201copinion corridor\u201d: the narrow range of views that respectable people hold. They are not constant. They can pass from social democracy to neoliberal conservatism. But while Swedes are trapped in a corridor, it seems as if they can never change. And then, all of a sudden, and with no debate, they shift to a new corridor and carry on as if nothing has happened. Anyone who has seen Labour switch from Corbynism to Starmerism without blinking an eye will recognise the phenomenon. Swedish journalists tend to see themselves as having a duty to prop up society as well as report on it. Such is their deference that last week, Frode Forland, Norway\u2019s state epidemiologist, complained that there had been almost no critical media coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/20/sweden-becomes-country-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-per-capita/\">high death rate</a> in Sweden. It is with a rare twinge of patriotic pride that I say that no one could level this charge at the British media.</p> <p>The Swedish public and press have trusted Tegnell. Sticking by him has become a nationalist badge of honour, and not because politicians are urging voters to believe in Swedish exceptionalism. A half-mad tub-thumper, like Trump, or blustering second-rater, like Johnson, does not lead Sweden\u2019s government. It is a respectable coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals. If Tegnell had said Sweden should have locked down rather than remain open, the politicians and public would have obeyed his orders as faithfully.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/just-7-per-cent-of-stockholm-had-covid-19-antibodies-by-end-of-april-study-sweden-coronavirus\">Just 7.3% of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by end of April, study shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Put like this, Sweden sounds like an authoritarian technocracy intolerant of opinions and individuals that don\u2019t fit in. But at the start of the pandemic, most countries were as trusting. In South Korea, Germany, Taiwan and New Zealand that trust has been justified. Britain saw a wave of support for a government that frittered it away with its repeated displays of tardiness and ineptitude. If Britain shows the dangers of a weak state and incapable politicians, Sweden shows what happens when you place too much trust in a handful of administrators, without first protecting yourself with a robustly argumentative culture that allows you to question whether they are right.</p> <p>Sweden\u2019s loss belongs to the world. If and when the virus returns, no one, not even the Brexit right, will be able to say that Sweden has proved we don\u2019t need to wreck the economy and risk mass employment because it has shown a better way. We will just have to endure it. Again.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

What a day.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Cummings has the \u201cfull support\u201d of the prime minister, despite travelling 250 miles to County Durham during the lockdown.</strong> Boris Johnson faced rising pressure to sack his key adviser after the Guardian and Mirror revealed he drove from London with his wife and child to his parents\u2019 property in Durham after his wife developed coronavirus symptoms after lockdown was introduced in March. It remains unclear what the prime minister knew about Cummings\u2019 whereabouts while he was self-isolating with the illness and \u201cstaying put\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/grant-shapps-defends-dominic-cummings-over-lockdown-breach\">Pressed on the issue at the daily press briefing, Grant Shapps</a> said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you the PM provides Mr Cummings with his full support.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Senior cabinet ministers publicly backed the PM\u2019s top aide, suggesting the issue was simply one of good parenting and had been politicised.</strong> This contradicted an earlier statement from Durham police which said it acted in line with national policing guidance when officers reiterated the advice around essential travel to the owner of the property in Durham. Cummings justified the journey by saying his four-year-old son would have been left without care and so they were \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d, even though his wife was symptomatic at the time and the public had been advised against all but essential travel, not to let children be around their grandparents, and for anyone with symptoms (and their households) to self-isolate immediately for 14 days. </li> \n   <li><strong>Labour and the SNP have each written to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, asking for an urgent inquiry into what the prime minister knew about the incident and what role the government played in keeping it under wraps.</strong> The SNP have called on the head of the civil service to investigate \u201cthe rule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up\u201d of Cummings\u2019 lockdown journey \u201cas a matter of serious public concern\u201d. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have written to Sir Mark Sedwill seeking an immediate investigation into the rule-breaking and the Tory government\u2019s cover-up - and to call for Dominic Cummings to resign or be sacked.</p> \n   <p>Boris Johnson must answer serious questions about his role in this incident and the cover-up - including when he found out, when he heard about the police action, why Mr Cummings wasn\u2019t sacked immediately, and why he kept the public in the dark for eight weeks until a newspaper broke the story.</p> \n   <p>Dominic Cummings\u2019 position is completely untenable.</p> \n   <p>This is a matter of leadership and judgment for the prime minister who must prevent lasting damage to his government and his own reputation.</p> \n   <p>Millions of us have made huge sacrifices over the months to obey the rules, while Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser was breaking them.</p> \n   <p>There cannot be one rule for the Tory government and another for the rest of us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government seemed to suggest it is now up to individuals to ensure they are safeguarding themselves or people within their household.</strong> This has left many people wondering why, if there was always room for interpretation, people were instructed clearly to stay at home and observe social distancing since 23 March. It has left many parents across the country angry that they have struggled during lockdown with childcare, made sacrifices and not accepted help from relatives in order to adhere to the rules and protect loved ones.</li> \n   <li><strong>However, the guidance remains that anyone showing symptoms should take themselves out of society immediately and the whole household should self-isolate, Dr Jenny Harries reiterated.</strong> The deputy chief medical officer for England added that there was an element of \u201ccommon sense\u201d when it came to safeguarding if there was an individual at extreme risk, eg a sick child, elderly person or clinically vulnerable individual.</li> \n   <li><strong>And the government released new funding to restore public transport back to a full timetable.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>And that brings us to the end of a long, tumultuous day for Boris Johnson\u2019s government.

And if it was indeed fine all along, why wasn\u2019t clear guidance on this subject given to the broader population? </p> \n  <p>The government has insisted that Cummings was well within the rules when he travelled 260 miles from London to Durham during lockdown. Cummings said he wanted help from his family caring for his young son if he and his wife became too ill to do so alone.</p> \n  <p>When Alex Duell and his wife began experiencing coronavirus symptoms, they turned down the offer of help from her mother, who lives 30 minutes away and was desperate to help looking after their two young children, because it went against government advice. Duell said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Had we accepted her help, we would have felt too guilty for breaking the rules of \u2018stay at home\u2019.</p> \n   <p>Whilst Dominic Cummings was heading to Durham to receive support for childcare whilst suffering from coronavirus symptoms, myself and my wife found ourself in the same position.</p> \n   <p>Cummings said he did the right thing, we all want the best for our families, but we have been forced to do this in light of the government advice. </p> \n   <p>Once again the general public have been let down, the sacrifices we all make mean nothing to this government if they so blatantly break the rules then fail to accept any responsibility.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Another couple who fell ill with symptoms in mid-March, said they did not travel the half mile to take their primary-aged children to their grandparents or the 50 miles to take them to an aunt and uncle, because they, too, were mindful of the \u201cstay at home\u201d message. They said it never occurred to them that they could or should do differently.</p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s guidelines at the time stated:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Can I leave my home while self-isolating?</p> \n   <p> If you or someone you live with has symptoms of coronavirus: <br></p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>Do not leave the house for any reason</strong> \u2013 if you need food, or medicine, order it online or by phone, or ask someone to deliver it to your home.</li> \n    <li><strong>Do not have visitors in your home</strong> \u2013 including friends and family</li> \n    <li><strong>Do any exercise at home</strong> \u2013 you can use your garden, if you have one</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T14:15:00.659Z\">at 3.15pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9227a8f0886ce4f5d910d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T13:18:44.079Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the moment <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong> told reporters he did the \u201cright thing\u201d by travelling 260 miles from London to Durham to be near relatives during the lockdown. </p> \n  <p>Cummings is facing calls to quit over the journey, which he made when his wife had Covid-19 symptoms.

I had not thought so, but the government\u2019s defence of<strong> Dominic Cummings</strong> \u2013 who is claimed to have respected the guidelines despite driving 260 miles with suspected coronavirus \u2013 raises questions that millions of people will want clarifying. Were we all mistaken? What did \u201cstay home, save lives, protect the NHS\u201d actually mean?</p> \n  <p>When <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> introduced the UK lockdown he gave \u201ca very simple instruction - you must stay at home\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>The rules, announced in a speech on 23 March, stated that people would only be allowed to leave the house for limited purposes. </p> \n  <p>These were shopping for basics, one form of exercise a day, travelling to and from work, but only where absolutely necessary, and medical needs. </p> \n  <p>The government\u2019s guidance on circumstances in which a person may leave their home stated: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>For work, where you cannot work at home. </li> \n   <li>Going to shops that are permitted to be open - to get things like food and medicine. </li> \n   <li>To exercise or spend time outdoors. </li> \n   <li>Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid illness or injury, escape risk of harm, or to provide care or help to a vulnerable person. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>No mention was made of childcare in the published guidance. Reinforcing the message, Johnson said people should not meet family members who do not live with them. </p> \n  <p>The rule on meeting family was unequivocal: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home. You should keep in touch with them using phone or video calls.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Only in exceptional circumstances were people allowed to attend relatives\u2019 addresses; for example, to drop off food or medicine to their door. </p> \n  <p>However, Dr <strong>Jenny Harries</strong> said at the daily Downing Street press briefing on 24 March that a small child could be considered \u201cvulnerable\u201d. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Clearly if you have adults who are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance. And if the individuals do not have access to care support - formal care support - or to family, they will be able to work through their local authority hubs.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Even now the lockdown rules have been relaxed slightly, visiting friends or family in their own homes is still off limits. The current guidance states: \u201cAs with before, you cannot visit friends and family in their homes.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The government guidance also said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (Covid-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.

Boris Johnson is facing mounting pressure to sack his closest aide following reports he breached lockdown rules in March. </p> \n  <p>A joint investigation by the Guardian and Mirror newspapers revealed that police spoke to Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s key adviser, after he visited his parents\u2019 home in Durham, 264 miles from his London home while he had coronavirus symptoms in late March. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">Pressure on Dominic Cummings to quit over lockdown breach</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Cummings and his wife, who was also experiencing symptoms, stayed with his parents while self-isolating. A source close to Cummings denied a breach of the coronavirus rules to the BBC, saying the couple needed childcare help. They added that the couple had stayed in a separate building at the property.<br></p> \n  <p>Only days earlier, the government had told the public to avoid all non-essential travel, to not meet family members who do not live with them, and to stay at home \u2013 with fines in places for those who broke the rules \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">both Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had tested positive for Covid-19</a>. Anyone with coronavirus symptoms was also instructed to self-isolate at home and not to leave the house for seven days - even for essential supplies. The prime minister had also said clearly that children should not be left with grandparents or older relatives \u201cwho may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Labour demanded No 10 \u201cto provide a very swift explanation for his actions\u201d. The party\u2019s vice chair, Tulip Sadiq, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> If accurate, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government\u2019s guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel. </p> \n   <p>The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings. Number 10 needs to provide a very swift explanation for his actions.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, tweeted: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines he will have to resign. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Dominic Cummings\u2019 position is completely untenable \u2013 he must resign or be sacked.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But a source close to Cummings said there is \u201czero chance\u201d he will resign.</p> \n  <p>Cummings is the latest high-profile figure to have broken the government\u2019s lockdown rules.

  "<p>A consensus has emerged that the only route out of the lockdown is with government cash. From across the political divide there is support, offered reluctantly in some quarters, for the idea that only state-funded agencies will have the financial muscle and the will to put the wheels of the economy in motion once the pandemic has receded.</p> <p>Private-sector companies emerging from the deep freeze will need to tiptoe before they run, hence the Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturing\u2019s proposal of an initial three-day week. Theirs must be a slow re-emergence, observing physical distancing.</p> <p>This broad level of agreement, even from ardent free-market thinktanks, should give the Treasury the level of political cover it craves as public debts spiral and beloved texts of conventional economic thinking are tossed in the bin.</p> <p>This time is different. A pandemic is different. Unlike a financial crash, it shuts down all parts of the economy, not just the banks, and turns millions of consumers into nervous spenders, not sure if their job will survive into next year. And unlike in a financial crash, the moral element is missing. There are no bankers to blame, or spendthrift households who should have known better than to borrow six times their income.</p> <p>Given this consensus, it is curious that Rishi Sunak is shrinking from the task of using the state\u2019s resources for the next phase of the rescue programme, having spent so much time and money, and gained so much kudos, in the first stage.</p> <p>Panic appears to have gripped the Treasury following a series of forecasts that estimate the cost to the exchequer at more than \u00a3300bn this financial year \u2013 a sum that will push the overall debt-to-GDP figure from just north of 80% to nearer 120%.</p> <p>But ministers shouldn\u2019t be alarmed by simple percentages. They should focus on the cost of servicing the public debt, which is falling by the day. Last week the Treasury borrowed an extra \u00a33.8bn from international investors in the form of a three-year bond. Such is the panic in global markets at the moment, the interest rate was negative, so lenders expect to get slightly less back in three years when the bond matures.</p> <p>If the government can borrow at next-to-zero interest, financing the debt is not going to be difficult. And this situation is likely to persist for a long time. And when the cost increases, it will only be because growth has accelerated, in which case the government will have higher tax revenues and can afford higher debt payments.</p> <p>That\u2019s not Sunak\u2019s view. He is prey, according to those who deal with him, to a Treasury cautiousness dating back more than 100 years. There is a sense, and it is no more than that, of the UK nearing a borrowing limit beyond which its public finances become unstable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a Tory government, so the best Sunak can do is still worth something</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No one who talks about the limit can say when it will be reached. Former Treasury permanent secretary Nick Macpherson has hounded his erstwhile colleagues with tweets pointing out how weak they are in the face of demands for bailouts.</p> <p>When the prime minister backed down after previously blocking a campaign to lift the immigration surcharge for NHS staff, Macpherson took the opportunity to berate Sunak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/soundmoney?src=hashtag_click\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a>, saying this government has yet to hold the line on any \u201ctough\u201d spending decision since coming to power. </p> <p>Macpherson has been joined by George Osborne, who you would think was disqualified from discussing the subject after 10 years of pushing through austerity cuts, especially to public health budgets, that left Britain woefully unprepared for a pandemic.</p> <p>Osborne is kinder to the current chancellor but also breaks with the consensus to warn that the money will need to be paid back.</p> <p>The US won\u2019t be thinking about repaying its debts, even though they are likely to soar above 130% of GDP. Japan won\u2019t be tackling its 260% debt-to-GDP ratio and the eurozone countries will in aggregate see their debts climb towards 100% without any means to get them down again.</p> <p>There is no appetite in any developed country for further austerity. And nor should there be. Far from austerity, policies to spur growth with further support from government are what is needed. That\u2019s not to say the crisis management of the economy cannot include a redrawing of taxes that shifts the balance from income to wealth and tackles longstanding inequalities.</p> <p>But this is a Tory government, so the best Sunak can do is still worth something. And that is to confront his officials with outside thinking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/more-help-needed-for-british-industrial-sector-says-head-of-make-uk\" title=\"\">justify state subsidies</a> for business, not just during the lockdown, but to promote growth next year \u2013 and the year after.</p>",

  "<p>They\u2019ve picked apart the holiday experience, lingering on moments such as breakfast buffets, poolside lounging and golf tee times. As officials in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands gear up to receive tourists as early as July, every aspect of travel is being recast against the backdrop of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cWe call it a global laboratory for safe tourism,\u201d Cristina del R\u00edo Fresen of the region\u2019s tourism ministry told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe\u2019re analysing every link in the chain \u2013 everything that has anything to do with the tourist experience, we want to make it safe from a health perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Since the start of this month, she has led a team of more than 200 people, including health and industry professionals, to hammer out protocols for everything from hotels to restaurants and museums. The aim is to rebrand the islands, which include Lanzarote and Tenerife, as tourist destinations that offer safety along with the usual sun, sand and sea.</p> <p>The new protocols, which begin in July, embrace physical distancing: hotel common areas are set to be enlarged and sunbeds moved apart; buffet breakfasts will be served, making use of partitions to separate guests from the food and extra serving staff; and all-inclusive vacations will rely on either automated machines or extra staff to serve drinks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3838ec928a6c2ffaa465556fe8e471ca002f116a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3838ec928a6c2ffaa465556fe8e471ca002f116a/0_0_5424_3629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The crowded main beach at Playa Blanca on Lanzarote before the Covid-19 outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The main beach at Playa Blanca on Lanzarote before the Covid-19 outbreak.

The Canary Islands rank as one of Europe\u2019s most tourist-dependent regions, last year receiving more than than 15 million visitors who <a href=\"https://www.hosteltur.com/133303_el-turismo-aporta-ya-el-35-del-pib-en-canarias.html\">generated around 35% of the region\u2019s GDP</a> and some 40% of the region\u2019s jobs. More than 13 million of these tourists arrived from outside Spain\u2019s borders, including some five million from the UK.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tale that echoes across Spain, which is the world\u2019s second most-visited country. The tourism industry, which accounts for 12% of the country\u2019s GDP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/spain-coronavirus-response-analysis\">came to an abrupt halt</a> in mid-March as the country battled coronavirus, with more than 28,000 lives claimed.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fear-tempers-relief-in-madrid-as-spain-begins-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdown\">Spain slowly staggers out of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns,</a> the government has come under pressure to follow countries such as Italy and Greece in setting a firm date for the return of tourists. It responded to their call on Saturday, with prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announcing the country would reopen to international tourism in July.</p> <p>\u201cForeign tourists can now start planning their vacations to Spain \u2026 Today we\u2019re sending a message to all: Spain will be waiting for you from July,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez. He promised that safety would be a hallmark of Spanish tourism. \u201cWe\u2019re guaranteeing that tourists will not run any risks, nor will they bring any risk to our country.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the lofty promises, Spain could see a loss of some 70 million tourists this year \u2013 as much as 85% of last year\u2019s numbers \u2013 said travel journalist and analyst Fernando Gallardo.

  "<p>When Iain Morris and Damon Beesley, the writers behind the hit schoolboy comedy <em>The Inbetweeners</em>, came up with an idea for a sitcom set in a floundering top-flight football club the inspiration was not, as you might expect, an on-pitch incident but rather a chance meeting on an aeroplane almost a decade previously.</p> <p>\u201cI found myself sitting next to a footballer named Damien Delaney on an 11 and a half hour flight and we had a fascinating conversation about the reality of footballers\u2019 lives,\u201d Morris says of the meeting that sparked the genesis of <em>The First Team</em>, which begins on BBC Two on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cHe said \u2018I\u2019m single in London with hours to fill, what do I do with my time?\u2019 and I immediately thought there\u2019s a whole interesting world to be explored. Plus we wanted to write about masculinity and entitlement and it felt like football was one of the last workplaces where you deal with a particular kind of male environment.\u201d</p> <p>The result is a raucous comedy that both lampoons football\u2019s excesses \u2013 the rabid ever-complaining fans, over-the-top cars and spotless, barely inhabited mansions \u2013 and is surprisingly sympathetic to the three young men (a rising star, a youth academy graduate hoping to break through and a new American transfer not entirely sure why he\u2019s been signed) at its centre.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re still idiots like<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/01/puerile-provincial-and-prophetic-how-the-inbetweeners-became-a-classic\"> the characters in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/01/puerile-provincial-and-prophetic-how-the-inbetweeners-became-a-classic\">The Inbetweeners</a></em> but the difference is that while those characters could say almost anything because nobody cared for these guys, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d says Beesley. \u201cThey\u2019re young men making the sort of mistakes that all young men make but they don\u2019t have the anonymity the rest of us do, so it really is sink or swim.\u201d</p> <p>Aware that the show itself would sink or swim according to how accurate it appeared \u2013 \u201cwe wanted it to feel authentic as well as funny\u201d \u2013 the duo, with the help of Matty Lawrence, the former Millwall and Crystal Palace defender, spoke to everyone from former and current players, \u201cincluding high-profile internationals\u201d, to club doctors, coaches and press officers, managers, chairmen and CEOs.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to say exactly who we spoke to in case people presume certain storylines are based on them but Tom Werner, the executive producer of the show, is also the chairman of Liverpool so that\u2019s a fairly big hint,\u201d says Morris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7fc8c5d0ced6ac57c9ade4946483cefd55e4c93a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fc8c5d0ced6ac57c9ade4946483cefd55e4c93a/0_45_2058_1235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Characters from The Inbetweeners in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Characters from The Inbetweeners in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the interviews, however, that provided the most insight into the ridiculous side of the beautiful game. \u201cWe spoke to one footballer who said that the reason footballers get married early is because kids fill up time,\u201d says Beesley. \u201cBefore, when he was single, he hadn\u2019t known what to do with himself but now he had two kids and it was great because he was never bored.\u201d</p> <p>There were darker stories too, particularly from former footballers who were playing \u201cduring that sweet spot where the wages were good but the social media wasn\u2019t as prevalent so they could behave like rock stars without getting caught,\u201d says Beesley.</p> <p>Those stories fed into the character of Petey, the club\u2019s aggressive King Lad, played by Theo Barklem-Biggs with all the swagger of a man who has never been told \u201cno\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s an amalgamation of all the monsters we\u2019d heard about from older generations,\u201d adds Morris. </p> <p>And while the crude jokes \u2013 from sight gags involving dog poo to a storyline revolving around toilet roll \u2013 flow as thick and fast as <em>The Inbetweeners</em> fans would hope for, <em>The First Team</em>\u2019s real strength comes from the warmth of its central relationships.</p> <p>\u201cThe difference between this and previous football shows is that they\u2019ve tended to focus on the big explosive moments like winning the league or the cup,\u201d says Morris. \u201cWe wanted to shine a light on the small comedies of life instead.

In this economy?!</h2> <p>In news that should surprise absolutely nobody, Americans are having fewer kids. US birthrates have fallen to a 35-year low, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr-8-508.pdf\">new federal data</a>. Around 3.75m babies were born in America in 2019, down 1% from the previous year. Birthrates dropped among women of basically every age and race group, but <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/498724-us-birth-rate-hits-35-year-low\">rose slightly among women in their early 40s</a>.</p> <p>The total fertility rate (which estimates the number of births that a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetime) is also at a record low. American women are now projected to have about 1.71 children over their lifetimes, which is below the rate of 2.1 needed to completely replace a generation.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out why Americans are having fewer kids. The government makes a big song and dance about how much it loves fetuses, but it is actively hostile to parents. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/maternity-leave-us-policy-worst-worlds-richest-countries\">US is the only OECD country</a> without national statutory paid maternity, paternity or parental leave, for one thing. Then there\u2019s the financial cost of simply delivering the kid. America is the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america\">expensive place in the world to have a baby</a> \u2013 and it may be one of the only places in the world where hospitals charge you <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-37555048\">just for holding your child</a>. One couple found a $39.35 charge on their hospital bill for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-37555048\">skin-to-skin\u201d contact</a> after their baby was born.</p> <p>Because of the Kafkaesque nature of America\u2019s healthcare system, it\u2019s hard to pin down how much the cost of an average birth is, but one 2013 estimate put it at around <a href=\"http://transform.childbirthconnection.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cost-of-Having-a-Baby-Executive-Summary.pdf\">$32,093</a>. That\u2019s just for an uncomplicated vaginal birth, by the way. If you have a complicated pregnancy and bad (or no) insurance you can very easily find yourself getting bankrupted by the medical bills.</p> <p>Once you have the child, you have to deal with astronomical childcare costs. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/why-child-care-so-expensive/602599/\">The Atlantic</a> notes that, since the 1990s, childcare costs have grown <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5909651/5-charts-that-show-child-care-in-the-us-is-brokenBut\">twice as fast</a> as overall inflation. The average cost of a full-time childcare program is now <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/THP_The51__Cascio_0419.pdf\">$16,000 a year</a> \u2013 which, in some states, is more than university tuition. Meanwhile, many millennial parents are <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations/\">still paying off their own student debt</a>.</p> <p>While there have been a lot of jokes about a coronavirus baby boom, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/covid-19-fertility-birth-rate-baby-boom-pregnancy-1003104/\">experts think it is likely</a> that the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic will cause birth rates to drop further. Now, more than ever, kids are becoming a luxury only a few can afford.</p> <h2><strong>Lana Del Rey engages in some \u2018misogynoir\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a rather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/chrissy-teigen-alison-roman-food-fight\">Alison Roman-esque move</a> the singer recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/21/lana-del-rey-criticising-peers-undermines-feminist-argument\">lashed out at a group of female artists</a>, most of whom were black women.

I\u2019m not sure exactly what Del Rey was trying to communicate as her Instagram post was sort of incomprehensible. However, it sounded a lot like she was saying that Beyonc\u00e9 et al are morons who have had it easy, while Del Rey is a Very Serious Artist who has been vilified and called anti-feminist by the press for glamourizing abuse in her lyrics. After a lot of backlash, Del Rey is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52767934\">insisting she\u2019s not a racist</a>.

  "<p>If bread is rising, sourdough is soaring. Along with pasta and toilet rolls, flour was among the first products to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/14/grains-flour-shortage-tells-us-about-who-we-are\">vanish from supermarket shelves</a> and Covid-19 inspired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/17/easy-bread-recipes-for-home-baking-soda-bread-cornbread-dan-lepard\">a home-baking boom</a>. While Google searches for \u201cbread\u201d tripled in the UK in the weeks after mid-March, those for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-crisis-loaf-bread-sourdough-bake-off-flour-yeast-lockdown\">\u201csourdough\u201d </a>rose sixfold. Sourdough differs from most bread in that it contains no baker\u2019s yeast, relying instead on a fermented \u201cstarter\u201d of water and flour to provide lift. This also provides its sour flavour and chewy texture.</p> <p>It could be the reduced availability of baker\u2019s yeast in shops, or perhaps the time-poor with a theoretical interest in sourdough finally found time to don their aprons. Whatever the reason, the sourdough revival has gone into overdrive. Vanessa Kimbell, author of <em>The Sourdough School</em> and regular contributor to Radio 4\u2019s <em>The Food Programme</em>, says she has seen a 50% increase in Instagram followers and a 25% increase in membership of her online Sourdough Club, and that \u201cthe phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1a203fb290c9a21ffbdda6a433c0216ffb4346f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a203fb290c9a21ffbdda6a433c0216ffb4346f/0_0_2736_3418/800.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco\u2019s Josey Baker\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco\u2019s Josey Baker. Locals insist the city\u2019s environment gives their sourdough a unique taste, but scientists counter that the microbes involved are found globally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DPA/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, many sourdough newbies have found that producing beautiful, tasty loaves isn\u2019t as easy as it looks on social media. Maybe it\u2019s time for a new approach. The transformation of dough into a light and airy loaf is, after all, chemistry in action, with a good side of physics. The complex relationships between the yeasts and bacteria that power starter fermentation are the domain of the microbiologist. Whether you\u2019re a beginner left holding bricks that taste of dough, or an accomplished amateur looking to further up your game, perhaps what you need is a refresher in the science of sourdough.</p> <h2>What should I feed my starter?</h2> <p>To replace the baker\u2019s yeast that most breads need to rise, sourdough requires some starter \u2013 a self-sustaining fermentation of flour, water, wild yeasts and bacteria that produce lactic and acetic acids. You might be able to get some starter from a local baker, or you can make your own \u2013 by combining small equal quantities of water and flour and letting it ferment for around five days.</p> <p>Once you have established a starter you need to <a href=\"https://www.sourdough.co.uk/how-to-refresh-a-sourdough-starter/\">feed and maintain</a> it with additional flour and water. All-purpose, refined wheat flour can be used. Most enthusiasts prefer stoneground wholegrain flours because they contain more of the microbes and enzymes needed to drive fermentation. They can, however, make a starter higher maintenance, requiring precise timing of feeding. Many opt for a more forgiving rye flour-based starter, and some use flour blends.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I fed our starter sifted bread and whole wheat flours, it would ebb and flow in health, activity and consistency,\u201d says San Francisco baker <a href=\"http://www.joseybakerbread.com/\">Josey Baker</a> (yes, that\u2019s his real name). \u201cI\u2019ve had the best luck with wholegrain rye flour, which seemed to stabilise it in a way that has worked very well for us for years.\u201d An underperforming wheat flour starter that has lost its vigour can be pepped up with a rye flour boost. Some mix in extras like grapes or yoghurt, though this isn\u2019t necessary if you\u2019re using good flour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"669e288c939e9b4193fa5109a4287ea4c352143f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/669e288c939e9b4193fa5109a4287ea4c352143f/0_2078_3567_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some bakers add yoghurt or grapes to their starters to boost the bacterial content of their dough; purists say this is unnecessary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some bakers add yoghurt or grapes to their starters to boost the bacterial content of their dough; purists say this is unnecessary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Hoggins/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How does my starter\u2019s diet affect bread flavour?</h2> <p>Flours consist mostly of starch (70-80%) and proteins (10-15%). During fermentation, enzymes in the flour break the starch apart into smaller, more digestible units, making sugars available to yeasts and bacteria. The microbes digest these sugars, generating carbon dioxide, acids and alcohol as byproducts.</p> <p>Rye-based starters attract more heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, which produce vinegary acetic acid and give bread sour, fruity flavours. Wheat flours encourage homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, which only produce lactic acid, making for softer, cereal flavours, while wholewheat adds a malty, nutty taste.</p> <p>Use of more water and warm weather encourages microbes that will generate a sweeter-tasting loaf. To add sourness, rest your dough in the fridge, possibly overnight, as lower temperatures favour the activity of bacteria that produce acetic acid.</p> <h2><strong>Where do the microbes in my starter come from?</strong></h2> <p>Some bakers in San Francisco, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200402-why-san-francisco-does-sourdough-best\">which is famous for its sourdough</a>, swear their loaves can\u2019t be produced elsewhere. There is a species of lactic acid bacteria called <em>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</em>, which produces a characteristically sour flavour, although it has been found in sourdoughs across the world.</p> <p>Scientists at North Carolina State University (NCSU) used DNA sequencing to identify the microbes in starters sent to them by more than 500 participants in their <a href=\"http://robdunnlab.com/projects/sourdough/\">Global Sourdough Project</a>. \u201cWe found there is incredible diversity across different sourdoughs, even those from the same neighbourhoods,\u201d says microbiologist Dr Anne Madden, of NCSU. In a follow-up study, the team asked 18 bakers from 14 countries to make starters using the same flour and method, and then assembled them in Belgium to make bread. The microbes in their starters were <a href=\"https://msphere.asm.org/content/msph/5/1/e00950-19.full.pdf\">most similar to those in the flour</a> they used, but were also reflected in those found on the bakers\u2019 hands. \u201cThis suggests an intimate relationship,\u201d says Madden. \u201cEither the hands are adding microbes to the starters or the starters are adding microbes to the hands.\u201d The group hope to find out more through the <a href=\"http://robdunnlab.com/projects/wildsourdough/\">Wild Sourdough Project</a>, launched in April, in which they are asking citizen scientists to make starters and record their characteristics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1df6834b778714b524218dd42b8586013ef16ee3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1df6834b778714b524218dd42b8586013ef16ee3/0_0_3735_2240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man's hands kneading bread dough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kneading boosts the development of gluten in the dough, the key factor in giving a loaf the good structure that will help it rise properly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria_Hunter/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Should I knead, or stretch and fold?</h2> <p>It depends whether you need your bread by lunchtime. Despite much talk to the contrary, there is no gluten in dry flour. Rather, it contains proteins called gliadin and glutenin, which, once hydrated, combine to form gluten, which can absorb twice its weight in water. It is also sticky, stretchy and elastic. The strength and structure of a good loaf rests on a scaffolding of fine strands of gluten. \u201cYour gluten network acts like a balloon that keeps the gas produced by the yeast inside,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.sourdough-summit.com/de/speakers/speaker/32-karl-de-smedt\">Karl De Smedt</a>, who runs a library of sourdoughs in St Vith, Belgium. The collection currently maintains 128 sourdoughs from 25 countries, some of which date back to the 19th century. \u201cWithout a good gluten network your bread cannot rise and you will end up with a brick,\u201d adds De Smedt.</p> <p>Kneading adds energy and oxygen to dough, speeding the development of the gluten, allowing speedier baking. In \u201cno knead\u201d recipes, edges of the dough are stretched and folded back in, and then left to develop. This process is repeated several times, before the dough is left to swell for a longer period. \u201cYou only need to knead if you want to be quick,\u201d says Kimbell. \u201cBut if you give your dough a proper, vigorous mix, you can also let the gluten develop during a long, slow fermentation.\u201d</p> <h2>How do I get a more open crumb?</h2> <p>Lots of factors affect the \u201ccrumb\u201d, or internal structure, of your loaf. Many amateur bakers want to know how to produce lighter bread with larger holes. \u201cTo achieve a very open crumb, you need a good flour with a high protein, say 13-16%,\u201d says De Smedt. \u201cThis allows you to produce a nice gluten network which is responsible for retaining the gas.\u201d</p> <p>The water content of your dough is also key. Beginners often slop in too much too quickly and then panic when their dough becomes gloopy and so throw in extra flour. Kimbell\u2019s top tip is to start with about three-quarters of the water in your recipe, mix slowly and add splashes as you go. Greater water content makes for softer dough and bigger bubbles. \u201cIt is easier to blow up a balloon with thin skin than one with thick skin, and by adding more water your dough becomes more like a thin balloon,\u201d says De Smedt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7cdd75cee8a2c6dcfb3dff647d75937b6c0b737\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7cdd75cee8a2c6dcfb3dff647d75937b6c0b737/0_5_3624_4525/801.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Kimbell and her Dutch oven\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Kimbell and her Dutch oven. Trapping water vapour during baking can delay crust formation; this allows the loaf to ferment and expand for longer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georgia de Lotz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want larger air pockets, be gentle when handling your dough, otherwise you\u2019ll knock out the gas needed to make them. But while big holes make for nice Instagram pictures, some focus on structure at the expense of more important attributes. \u201cAny fool can make big holes once they understand gluten and water,\u201d says Kimbell. \u201cThe true art is in creating something that is complex, soft, tender, nourishing with both sweetness and light sourness.\u201d</p> <h2>Why do I need steam during baking?</h2> <p>Sugars and amino acids on the loaf\u2019s surface start to react at about 150C in the Maillard reaction, a process that gives seared foods a distinctive taste and colouring. Add steam into the oven and it will condense on the cold surface of your loaf and delay crust formation. Keeping the bread\u2019s surface flexible for longer allows for a final burst of fermentation and gas bubble production, while also allowing existing bubbles to expand. It allows the loaf to stretch so that it becomes light and airy. Many cook their sourdough in a Dutch oven or under a cloche to trap water vapour from the dough and create steam.</p> <h2>Is sourdough healthier than baker\u2019s yeast bread?</h2> <p>The lactic acids in sourdough neutralise phytates in flour that when consumed in large amounts can prevent the body absorbing minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc in bread. They also slow the release of glucose into the bloodstream, lowering the bread\u2019s glycemic index and preventing insulin spikes. The lactic acids also make gluten more digestible, and reduce the chances of gluten intolerance. A study published in December by <a href=\"https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/sciencetechnology/phd-sustainable-energy-technologies/phd-students-set/person/32209-marco-gobbetti\">Prof Marco Gobbetti</a>, of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, in Italy, found sourdough to be more digestible than bread made with baker\u2019s yeast. Sourdough fermented for longer periods <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31817104\">made healthy individuals feel more full more quickly</a>, and those who ate sourdough had higher amino acid concentrations in their blood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1afe81c22ae7d199ca4c234b625f7a304910b889\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1afe81c22ae7d199ca4c234b625f7a304910b889/142_0_1078_1262/854.jpg\" alt=\"A particularly artful loaf from Hove baker Paul Robinshaw, @_flour_water_salt on Instagram.\" width=\"854\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A particularly artful loaf from Hove baker Owen Cochrane, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_flour_water_salt/\">@_flour_water_salt on Instagram</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Is making sourdough a science or an art?</h2> <p>That depends who is making it. De Smedt believes it is best approached as a science. Josey Baker believes that to do it properly requires both perspectives. \u201cUltimately bread is made, not in labs but in homes and bakeries, by people with subjective opinions using their skills, intuitions, emotions and other intangibles that science doesn\u2019t attempt to address,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to make bread relying only on one or the other, then you\u2019re leaving something important out.\u201d</p> <p>Kimbell agrees that while science can point bakers in the right direction, there\u2019s much more to making a great sourdough loaf than manipulating variables based on data analysis. \u201cYou can totally geek out on the amazing science of the microbial fermentation process,\u201d she says. \u201cOr you can slow down, lose yourself in the moment and fall in love with it. You use your hands, your heart and your mind to get to know the dough, feel it, understand it, and sense what it needs. The only other time you get to connect like that is, let\u2019s be honest, when you meet a new lover.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2020 to correct a picture caption. An earlier version had incorrectly attributed the loaf made by Owen Cochrane to another baker, Paul Robinshaw.</p>",

It contradicted Johnson\u2019s repeated vow that there would be no checks.</p> \n<p>The IfG, however, suggests that more sweeping changes will be needed than those admitted by Gove. \u201cThe protocol creates a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which the UK will be legally obliged to administer under supervision from EU institutions,\u201d it states. \u201cNorthern Ireland will remain part of the UK customs territory but will be required to align with EU rules on customs and regulations.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe UK government must recognise the scale of the implementation task and make it a government priority even in these difficult times. The UK needs to scale up existing systems for customs administration, design and implement new systems for tariff administration and compensation and develop new capacity for regulatory checks.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith UK ministers only recently publicly stating what additional processes may be needed, progress so far has been slow. With 64 departments, public bodies and agencies across the UK with scope for involvement in the implementation of the protocol, clarity on what is required is key.\u201d</p> \n<p>Its analysis also warns that the protocol arrangements will be voted on by the Northern Ireland assembly every four to eight years, making it a \u201cpotentially destabilising issue\u201d for years to come.</p>",
  "<p>At 2.30pm Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/07/maria-balshaw-fresh-slate-tate-modern-african-american-new-director-exhibitions-society\"> Maria Balshaw,</a> director of Tate art museums and galleries, convene on screen \u2013 the new abnormal \u2013 for a conversation about the Covid-19 crisis and how they plan to help their institutions survive it. Norris is first to admit our get-together is not ideal as his blurred silhouette appears: \u201cI\u2019m at home, in the bedroom, because it\u2019s the best internet spot. If things get really bad, I\u2019ll have to speak to you on the phone.\u201d Balshaw, at home in Kent, is similarly quick to identify the idiosyncrasies in her new working life: \u201cI\u2019ve got my museum director husband [Nick Merriman, chief executive of Horniman Museum] with me \u2013 we rotate in and out of this room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a \u00a3110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a \u00a3160m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/arts-council-england-promises-160m-to-buoy-public-during-lockdown\">emergency package across the cultural sector</a>, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown?</p> \n<p>But before looking ahead, it is necessary to look back \u2013 not least because of the way time seems to be behaving in our new world (moving so fast in one sense, so slowly in another). I begin by asking Norris and Balshaw to remember how they felt as they locked down their institutions. Did they have any idea what was to come?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Arts&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F10d2ecbb86b88b9c952abc700dc2e3038daa3954%3Fcrop%3D727_183_2269_1362&amp;left-caption=Rufus%20Norris.%20Photograph%20by%20Ellie%20Kurttz&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9f3248ca010a2e55ba710c1852e70db7f180c213%3Fcrop%3D0_223_2616_1570&amp;right-caption=Maria%20Balshaw.%20Photograph%20by%20Jeff%20Spicer%2FGetty&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Rufus Norris and Maria Balshaw\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=Arts&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F10d2ecbb86b88b9c952abc700dc2e3038daa3954%3Fcrop%3D727_183_2269_1362&amp;left-caption=Rufus%20Norris.%20Photograph%20by%20Ellie%20Kurttz&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9f3248ca010a2e55ba710c1852e70db7f180c213%3Fcrop%3D0_223_2616_1570&amp;right-caption=Maria%20Balshaw.%20Photograph%20by%20Jeff%20Spicer%2FGetty&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\">Rufus Norris and Maria Balshaw</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Rufus Norris</strong>: It was very odd because we were told in the most blunt, ill-considered way that people were not to go to theatres before we were given any warning or told to shut.

Possibly six. Now we\u2019re at a moment where we have to think about more than the recovery of individual institutions and our sectors. We\u2019ve got to start thinking: how do we shape the world for the new normal?

Maria and I are in different sectors from that point of view \u2013 our business is about bringing large groups of people together. About 60 to 70% of the National\u2019s income comes from people visiting and buying tickets. We\u2019re very supportive of the government\u2019s policy on social distancing.

People coming back is what we need. I agree with Rufus the job retention scheme has been a godsend but we\u2019ll also need further financial backing from the government. And any challenge for the Tate will be even more threatening for smaller institutions. This is going to be a period of the most acute challenge the arts ecology has ever faced.</p> \n<p><strong>And will smaller theatres survive?<br>RN</strong>: Without support \u2013 no. If this goes on much longer, it\u2019s very hard to imagine any theatre surviving. Whatever it means for the National, you can multiply several times for regional theatres. A lot of our work now is about advocacy to make sure the government, under huge pressure as it is, understands what our sector contributes and how urgent it is that a nuanced, informed view of helping us survive is taken on by them.</p> \n<p><strong>How worried are you by surveys reporting that many people are frightened by the relaxation of lockdown? Does your role include a need to reassure the public?<br>MB</strong>: Our world has changed beyond recognition. It\u2019s understandable people feel fearful. Museums, galleries and the arts have a huge role to play in rebuilding social confidence. People may have to come differently \u2013 book a time slot, come in one way, leave another way. We\u2019ll need to reassure the public the numbers will not put them at risk. And this is urgent because of another challenge our country now faces: people\u2019s emotional wellbeing, social connections and mental health.</p> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: The worst thing would be if we opened too early because of financial need. If we rushed back and audiences came to our spaces and we hadn\u2019t looked after them properly and they got sick \u2013 that must not be allowed to happen. It would be a disaster if we opened up and had to close down again. Reassurance will only be possible when the time is right.</p> \n<p><strong>I gather you\u2019ve been ill with the virus yourself, Rufus?<br>RN:</strong> I was very ill for a couple of weeks but thankful it didn\u2019t take me to hospital.

You can see the hunger for it and people\u2019s desire to create themselves. The silver lining of what we\u2019re going through is that people have been given time back and are using it to make paintings, throw pots, watch theatre, dance and sing.</p> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: Or they\u2019re also going back to their photographs or getting creative in the kitchen or garden \u2013 the surge of creativity is really encouraging. There\u2019ll be a generation, won\u2019t there? The lockdown generation \u2013 who really got on with stuff while they had the space.</p> \n<p><strong>MB</strong>: I was particularly moved by the singing on balconies in Italy. It\u2019s people saying: I\u2019ll not be silent in the face of fear. It gets to the heart of why we make art. And then there was Sacha Lord\u2019s livestream Hacienda-style Manchester club night that went on the <em>whole </em>night, attracted millions and raised funds for that bit of the creative sector. What a brilliant idea \u2013 people raving in their own homes! That\u2019s an image I want to hold on to\u2026.</p> \n<p><strong>Meanwhile NT at Home is hugely popular and has received more than \u00a3100,000 in donations\u2026</strong><strong><br>RN:</strong> It\u2019s had 8 million views in the last five weeks. We weren\u2019t expecting the donations but are now able to pay the actors. We\u2019re introducing a broader range of titles.

People have discovered so many new things digitally. It\u2019s the hook that\u2019s going to give them confidence to step out of their front doors again. I\u2019ve made some wonderful discoveries during lockdown such as the live stream of <em><a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/onscreen/watch-party-broken-wings/\">Broken Wings</a></em><a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/onscreen/watch-party-broken-wings/\"> by ENB </a>\u2013 a ballet about Frida Kahlo.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b36e5edc7fa8f783ecd8ad086582811dd2d720b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b36e5edc7fa8f783ecd8ad086582811dd2d720b/0_146_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"English National Ballet has been live-streaming the Frida Kahlo-inspired Broken Wings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">English National Ballet has been live-streaming the Frida Kahlo-inspired Broken Wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: English National Ballet</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: I\u2019ve found a variety of things \u2013 I especially enjoyed <em>The Fireman\u2019s Ball</em> by Milo\u0161 Forman. I watched it with my partner and our two sons \u2013 a simple film, a satire. It appealed to our particular, weird, family taste. It\u2019s hilarious. We have, obviously, been spending a lot more time together as a family \u2013 the one unadulterated, wonderful upside of lockdown.</p> \n<p><strong>Are you in touch with colleagues in Europe and the US?<br>MB</strong>: We\u2019re actively in conversation in Europe, North America and beyond \u2013 we\u2019re having Zoom meetings with colleagues in Italy and China because they\u2019re at a different phase \u2013 there\u2019s a huge amount to learn from them. We\u2019re having brilliant creative conversations about how to reschedule touring exhibitions, make sure nobody loses out and let things happen over a longer time frame.</p> \n<p><strong>RN: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/09/on-my-radar-david-lans-madonna-nuri-bilge-ceylan-golborne-road-message-in-a-bottle-black-jeans\">David Lan</a> [playwright and director] recently organised a call with European, American and British artistic directors. In normal times, theatre can be a competitive environment but we all believe in what this sector brings to society and we\u2019re working together.</p> \n<p><strong>Will lockdown/coronavirus make a good subject for art/theatre?<br>RN</strong>: Yes \u2013 although it is difficult when you\u2019re in the middle of something to understand what impact it will have. But new writing is sure to emerge\u2026 If we reopen in September, what will people want to watch? They\u2019re going to be nervous. We\u2019ll have to give them a good reason to come and make it a real event\u2026</p> \n<p><strong>MB:</strong> Early in lockdown, one of my staff \u2013 an artist \u2013 sent a lovely message saying: \u201cThe artists among us have been practising lockdown for some time.\u201d Unlike theatre-makers, artists depend on time apart. But it is possible lockdown might make artists focus in a new way. The deep emotional issues raised by this virus will infiltrate their minds as they have ours.</p> \n<p><strong>What specifically are the emotional issues?<br>MB:</strong> We\u2019ve been going through a period of collective mourning because we took everyday social contact for granted \u2013 that sense of ourselves as human beings as part of a larger social whole. That\u2019s been fundamentally challenged. We operated societally and individually as though we could overcome anything. We could fix things, cure things or pay to get ourselves out of difficult situations. None of those options has been open to us. Living with a sense of uncertainty is what people have been having to get used to. You can see they\u2019re desperate for resolution: <em>please tell us the answers.</em> The truth is we don\u2019t know how we are going to recover. Yet once we know we can reopen, I think we\u2019ll definitely be ready.</p> \n<p><strong>RN</strong>: Having been starved of live art, it\u2019ll be like coming back to food you have been denied, there\u2019ll be a great appetite for it.

  "<p>No, I don\u2019t have any illusions about what I\u2019ve become since the start of this year. Like so many other slightly uncomfortable things in my life, this occupation started as an ill-defined joke. Wouldn\u2019t it be funny, I thought to myself, if I bought a games console for the first time in a decade. If nothing else, wouldn\u2019t it just be a small, deserved protest against the stresses of adulthood?</p> <p>When I tried to explain this decision to my loved ones, it was greeted with<strong> </strong>tolerant concern. In the nothing days between Christmas and new year my partner asked if this was a distraction I really needed in a busy life. \u201cJust wait a bit,\u201d she said, as if speaking to a slightly unruly child, \u201cuntil you\u2019re really sure it\u2019s what you want.\u201d And in what felt like seconds later, there I was, in a Peckham computer exchange shop, queuing furtively for a secondhand Xbox One with a couple of reliably blockbuster games to go with it.</p> <p>The first weeks were a blend of ironic detachment and oppressive nostalgia. It felt acceptable to limit myself to a few hours of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/10/fifa-how-to-set-up-your-own-video-game-sports-tournament\">F</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/10/fifa-how-to-set-up-your-own-video-game-sports-tournament\">ifa</a> or GTA 5 each week, with their veneer of mainstream conformity. This was a habit that could easily be checked and kept under strict control. The world was still what it used to be \u2013 we had social lives, went to work on packed public transport; the great outdoors was still accessible beyond our front doors. Back then, the idea of admitting that I\u2019d become a part-time gamer was something shameful enough to be concealed from all but my closest friends.</p> <p>It took the world being put on hold for the stance of myself and others to soften. Now, my aimless nighttime drives through the pretty chaos of Los Santos has gathered an undeserved dignity. They\u2019re no longer symptoms of an undiagnosed regression into adolescence, but a form of escapism to be envied. In mid-March, a friend I\u2019d confided in about my initial purchase was tapping me for advice. How much, where from, what games to buy? He and I certainly weren\u2019t alone in those early days of panic: game sales experienced a global surge as people across the world sheltered at home. In the UK, digital downloads <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-03-28-what-is-happening-with-video-game-sales-during-coronavirus\">rose by 67%</a> week-on-week during March, while during the window of social distancing before the strict lockdown was enforced<strong> </strong>physical sales jumped by 218%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfe651457564a6318080cf20f9717a1214cd03ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfe651457564a6318080cf20f9717a1214cd03ea/31_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal Crossing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Animal Crossing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No game better represents the convergence of adolescence and escapism than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/23/family-friendly-animal-crossing-takes-video-game-top-spot-amid-lockdown\">Animal Crossing</a>. The latest edition of Nintendo\u2019s wildly popular social simulator has become the definitive game of lockdown, its gentle utopianism making it a perfect fit for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/animal-crossing-covid-coronavirus-popularity-millennials.html\">the coronavirus moment</a>\u201d. It\u2019s a deceptively simple affair, a soft-edged, primary-coloured universe, where the player builds a society on their own personalised island paradise. There isn\u2019t any violence or human nastiness, and certainly no threat of a creeping pandemic. The game even follows real-world time, its slow yet dynamic little universe giving players a sense of control that is absent from our current reality.</p> <p>On the last afternoon before the lockdown began in force, I returned to the computer exchange shop. The line was noticeably longer, the crowd more diverse in its mixture of callow part-timers and hardened enthusiasts. I reached for the biggest game I\u2019d heard of. If any game were to obliterate the empty hours to come, or transport me far beyond suburban south London, it would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar\">Re</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar\">d Dead Redemption 2</a> \u2013 the \u201cmature\u201d epic set during the terminal decline of the old wild west. The dissonance between my living room and the vast expanse on screen would have been odd enough in the best of times, let alone during the confinement of the present. Now, the game\u2019s internal universe, with its hyperrealistic natural landscapes and sublime vistas, is soothing in its certainties, an effective distraction from the world outside.</p> <p>Like most things, I suppose this response to the present has roots in the deep past of my own life. As with so many children of my generation, I was enamoured with computer games. There was certainly no embarrassment about this fixation in my tight-knit friendship circle. When my mother died a few months after my seventh birthday, games were an escape from this new reality. Weekends were spent at friends\u2019 houses, playing Nintendo 64 until our eyes glazed over and we dropped into an exhausted sleep. A couple of years later, in 2002, I was given a Gamecube by my grandmother and aunt, who I lived with as my legal guardians. This console, the first that I\u2019d owned, felt like the realisation of my wildest dreams. There wasn\u2019t too much money around in our lives, and I felt a surge of pride that it would be my turn to play host to my friends in our basement flat, staying up all night in front of whatever cheerfully demented multiplayer game we could get our hands on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/silver-lining-lockdown-wotsits-spaghetti-toast-proustian-madeleine\">The surprising silver lining of lockdown: Wotsits and spaghetti on toast | Eleanor Margolis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, a completely immersive escape has always been unattainable,<strong> </strong>and perhaps unhealthy. It\u2019s one thing taking temporary refuge from a painful reality, quite another to ignore it entirely. I\u2019m under no illusions about the limits of my partially rediscovered enthusiasm for computer games and what it says about life in this current climate. In real terms, they still form a very minor use of my time. Far more is taken up with other equally useless pursuits, though I don\u2019t say that with a sneer. My life is happiest when it has enough gloriously pointless distractions to smooth down its more strenuous parts. Of all the things to feel guilty about, a few snatched hours on virtual horseback in Red Dead Redemption 2 doesn\u2019t feel like one of the most pressing right now.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/may/20/can-virtual-reality-help-get-you-through-lockdown\">Escapism</a> isn\u2019t a dirty word, as long as its limits are recognised.

  "<p>\u201cHours and hours of badgers doing bugger all.\u201d That was the stark verdict of one member of a focus group we spoke to before launching <em>Springwatch</em> in 2005.

Who would have thought that knowing whether a brood of baby blue tits would survive the night would grip the nation? <em>Springwatch</em>, it turned out, was genuine \u201creality TV\u201d.</p> <p>The series also captured the attention of the media, which at the time could be sniffy about homegrown wildlife. In the <em>Guardian</em>, Blake Morrison wrote a feature headlined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jun/16/realitytv.environment\">\u201cWild at heart\u201d</a>, noting, with some surprise, that \u201cBritain is quietly falling in love with nature again\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have seen a huge increase in the number of young people on our digital platforms</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Flowers, producer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A decade and a half later, that relationship is still going strong, and on Tuesday, <em>Springwatch</em> returns <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qgm3\">in its usual primetime </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qgm3\">BBC Two</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qgm3\"> slot</a>. Arguably, it has never been so relevant: as presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/21/chris-packham-urges-tv-makers-to-shout-louder-about-nature-crises\">Chris Packham</a> says, \u201cWhile we are all confined to our homes, for wildlife this is the busiest time of year.\u201d</p> <p>But the lockdown has brought huge technological and logistical problems for the production team. How on earth do you reinvent a three-week-long series, normally staffed by more than 100 people at a single, central location, so that it meets the new social distancing rules?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>Springwatch</em>, Stephen, but not as we know it,\u201d is how Chris sums it up.</p> <p>The BBC Studios Natural History Unit is inventive and resourceful, and soon came up with a plan. Specialist nest finders, led by wildlife expert Nigel Bean, have set up remote cameras on nests at various locations; footage is then fed to the story developers \u2013 keen young naturalists, each working independently \u2013 who monitor any interesting behaviour.</p> <p>Selected material can then be viewed and discussed by the presenters \u2013 Packham, Iolo Williams and Gillian Burke \u2013 who will be confined during the live broadcasts to the areas around their own homes: in the New Forest, Wales and Cornwall, respectively.

A highlight for nature-lovers during lockdown has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/04/chris-packham-launches-lockdown-springwatch-facebook-birdwatching-wildlife-garden\">The Self-Isolating Bird Club</a> \u2013 a series of daily broadcasts on social media, fronted by Chris and his stepdaughter Megan McCubbin, with presenter Lindsey Chapman.</p> <p>This really caught the nation\u2019s attention: during an eight-week run, it has gained almost 8 million individual views and 132,000 comments, from tens of thousands of avid followers. At this time of confinement, there is an eager audience out there, keen to learn more about the natural world. .</p> <p>Flowers hopes that <em>Springwatch</em> will attract new fans who have become more interested in the world around them since the lockdown. \u201cWe have seen a huge increase in the number of young people engaging on our digital platforms, which we are delighted about \u2013 we can\u2019t wait to see what will happen in the three weeks to come,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Back in 2005, <em>Springwatch</em> marked a turning point in the way we think about the natural world. Until then, most wildlife programmes were filmed in exotic foreign locations and featured lions, tigers and sharks \u2013 not blue tits and badgers. Yet it turned out that the life-and-death struggles faced by the bird families were just as gripping \u2013 perhaps even more so \u2013 as watching big game on the African savannah.</p> <p>The programme also changed the broadcasters\u2019 relationship with their audience by pioneering user-generated content in the form of home videos, and using online message boards for viewers to communicate with the production team. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/22/otters-badgers-and-orca-whales-can-the-pandemic-help-rewild-britain\">Otters, badgers and orcas: can the pandemic help rewild Britain?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That special relationship with the viewers is still the key to the programme\u2019s success. <em>Springwatch</em> is already up and running online, with 24-hour live streaming from remote wildlife cameras on up to four different channels; while every weekday at 9am Hannah Stitfall is showing videos and stills sent in by viewers. As Chris says, \u201cWe would love to hear from anyone with a story to tell about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/22/country-diary-the-new-normal-in-lockdown-isnt-that-new-after-all\">what they\u2019re seeing during lockdown</a>: from their windows, in their gardens or while taking daily exercise.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago, some of my former colleagues wondered if <em>Springwatch</em> had, begun to fade in the nation\u2019s affections. But like the BBC itself, this crisis has brought out the best in a programme that has become a genuine national treasure.</p> <p>At this time of unprecedented crisis, more and more people \u2013 especially the four out of five Britons who live in towns and cities \u2013 are discovering a connection with the natural world. For them, and for those of us for whom nature is central to our lives, three weeks of live wildlife is just what we need.

  "<p>\u201cThis is a time to take a lesson from mosses,\u201d says Robin Wall Kimmerer, celebrated writer and botanist. Her first book, published in 2003, was the natural and cultural history book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/feb/05/1\">Gathering Moss</a></em>. She grins as if thinking of a dogged old friend or mentor. \u201cWhat is it that has enabled them to persist for 350m years, through every kind of catastrophe, every climate change that\u2019s ever happened on this planet, and what might we learn from that?\u201d She lists the lessons \u201cof being small, of giving more than you take, of working with natural law, sticking together. All the ways that they live I just feel are really poignant teachings for us right now.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the end of March and, observing the new social distancing protocol, we\u2019re speaking over Zoom \u2013 Kimmerer, from her home office outside Syracuse, New York; me from shuttered South Williamsburg in Brooklyn, where the constant wail of sirens are a sobering reminder of the pandemic. The occasion is the UK publication of her second book, the remarkable, wise and potentially paradigm-shifting <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2014/dec/16/the-best-nature-books-of-2014\">Braiding Sweetgrass</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2014/dec/16/the-best-nature-books-of-2014\">: </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2014/dec/16/the-best-nature-books-of-2014\">Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants</a></em>, which has become a surprise word-of-mouth sensation, selling nearly 400,000 copies across North America (and nearly 500,000 worldwide). In January, the book landed on the New York Times bestseller list, seven years after its original release from the independent press Milkweed Editions \u2013 no small feat.</p> <p>A mother of two daughters, and a grandmother, Kimmerer\u2019s voice is mellifluous over the video call, animated with warmth and wonderment. Her delivery is measured, lyrical, and, when necessary (and perhaps it\u2019s always necessary), impassioned and forceful. She laughs frequently and easily. Today she has her long greyish-brown hair pulled loosely back and spilling out on to her shoulders, and she wears circular, woven, patterned earrings. Behind her, on the wooden bookshelves, are birch bark baskets and sewn boxes, mukluks, and books by the environmentalist Winona LaDuke and Leslie Marmon Silko, a writer of the Native American Renaissance.</p> <p>\u201cSitting at a computer is not my favourite thing,\u201d admits the 66-year-old native of upstate New York. Our original, pre-pandemic plan had been meeting at the Clark Reservation State Park, a spectacular mossy woodland near her home, but here we are, staying 250 miles apart. A distinguished professor in environmental biology at the State University of New York, she has shifted her courses online. It\u2019s going well, all things considered; still, not every lesson translates to the digital classroom. For one such class, on the ecology of moss, she sent her students out to locate the ancient, interconnected plants, even if it was in an urban park or a cemetery. To collect the samples, one student used the glass from a picture frame; like the mosses, we too are adapting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"289b34e35409dc165285d55839c55d13e973c5e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289b34e35409dc165285d55839c55d13e973c5e1/0_150_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moss in the forest around the Bennachie hills, near Inverurie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moss in the forest around the Bennachie hills, near Inverurie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t really see plants or understand plants or what they give us,\u201d Kimmerer explains, \u201cso my act of reciprocity is, having been shown plants as gifts, as intelligences other than our own, as these <em>amazing</em>, creative beings \u2013 good lord, they can photosynthesise, that still blows my mind! \u2013 I want to help them become visible to people.<em> </em>People can\u2019t understand the world as a gift unless someone shows them how it\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p> <p>In her debut collection of essays, <em>Gathering Moss</em>, she blended, with deep attentiveness and musicality, science and personal insights to tell the overlooked story of the planet\u2019s oldest plants. For <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em>, she broadened her scope with an array of object lessons braced by indigenous wisdom and culture. From cedars we can learn generosity (because of all they provide, from canoes to capes). From the creation story, which tells of Sky woman falling from the sky, we can learn about mutual aid. Sweetgrass teaches the value of sustainable harvesting, reciprocal care and ceremony. The Windigo mindset, on the other hand, is a warning against being \u201cconsumed by consumption\u201d (a windigo is a legendary monster from Anishinaabe lore, an \u201cOjibwe boogeyman\u201d). Ideas of recovery and restoration are consistent themes, from the global to the personal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think about grief as a measure of our love, that grief compels us to do something, to love more</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In one standout section Kimmerer, an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, tells the story of recovering for herself the enduring Potawatomi language of her people, one internet class at a time. (It\u2019s meaningful, too, because her grandfather, Asa Wall, had been sent to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, notorious for literally washing the non-English out of its young pupils\u2019 mouths.) The resulting book is a coherent and compelling call for what she describes as \u201crestorative reciprocity\u201d, an appreciation of gifts and the responsibilities that come with them, and how gratitude can be medicine for our sick, capitalistic world.</p> <p>In the years leading up to <em>Gathering Moss</em>, Kimmerer taught at universities, raised her two daughters, Larkin and Linden, and published articles in peer-reviewed journals. (A sample title from this period: \u201cEnvironmental Determinants of Spatial Pattern in the Vegetation of Abandoned Lead-Zinc Mines.\u201d) Writing of the type that she publishes now was something she \u201cwas doing quietly\u201d, away from academia. But she chafed at having to produce these \u201cboring\u201d papers written in the \u201cmost objective\u201d scientific language that, despite its precision, misses the point. What she really wanted was to tell stories old and new, to practice \u201cwriting as an act of reciprocity with the living land\u201d. Through soulful, accessible books, informed by both western science and indigenous teachings alike, she seeks, most essentially, to \u201cencourage people to pay attention to plants\u201d. And she has now found those people, to a remarkable extent.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything remotely like it,\u201d says Daniel Slager, publisher and CEO of the non-profit Milkweed Editions. He describes the sales of <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> as \u201csingular\u201d, \u201cstaggering\u201d and \u201cprofoundly gratifying\u201d. Since the book first arrived as an unsolicited manuscript in 2010, it has undergone 18 printings and appears, or will soon, in nine languages across Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Pulitzer prize-winning author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/16/richard-powers-interview-overstory\">Richard Powers</a> is a fan, declaring to the New York Times: \u201cI think of her every time I go out into the world for a walk.\u201d Robert Macfarlane told me he finds her work \u201cgrounding, calming, and quietly revolutionary\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/16/richard-powers-interview-overstory\">Richard Powers: \u2018It was like a religious conversion. I realised the natural world isn\u2019t ours\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, <em>Braiding Sweetrgrass</em> has engaged readers from many backgrounds. \u201cI think when indigenous people either read or listen to this book, what resonates with them is the life experience of an indigenous person. It is part of the story of American colonisation,\u201d said Rosalyn LaPier, an ethnobotanist and enrolled member of the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana and M\u00e9tis, who co-authored with Kimmerer a declaration of support from indigenous scientists for 2017\u2019s March for Science. \u201cPart of it is, how do you revitalise your life? How do you relearn your language? How do you recreate a new relationship with the natural world when it\u2019s not the same as the natural world your tribal community has a longstanding relationship with? It\u2019s a common, shared story.\u201d</p> <p>Other lessons from the book have resonated, too. Jessica Goldschmidt, a 31-year-old writer living in Los Angeles, describes how it helped her during her first week of quarantine. \u201cI was feeling very lonely and I was repotting some plants\u201d and realised how important it was because \u201cthe book was helping me to think of them as people. It\u2019s something I do everyday, because I\u2019m just like: \u2018I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to touch a person again.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s being revealed to me from readers is a really deep longing for connection with nature,\u201d Kimmerer says, referencing Edward O Wilson\u2019s notion of biophilia, our innate love for living things. \u201cIt\u2019s as if people remember in some kind of early, ancestral place within them. They\u2019re remembering what it might be like to live somewhere you felt companionship with the living world, not estrangement. Though the flip side to loving the world so much,\u201d she points out, citing the influential conservationist Aldo Leopold, is that to have an ecological education is to \u201clive alone in a world of wounds\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe tend to shy away from that grief,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut I think that that\u2019s the role of art: to help us into grief, and through grief, for each other, for our values, for the living world. You know, I think about grief as a measure of our love, that grief compels us to do something, to love more.\u201d Compelling us to love nature more is central to her long-term project, and it\u2019s also the subject of her next book, though \u201cit\u2019s definitely a work in progress\u201d. \u201cThe way I\u2019m framing it to myself is, when somebody closes that book, the rights of nature make perfect sense to them,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really trying to convey plants as persons.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The vulnerability we're experiencing in the pandemic is the vulnerability that songbirds feel every day of their lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Key to this is restoring what Kimmerer calls the \u201cgrammar of animacy\u201d. This means viewing nature not as a resource but like an elder \u201crelative\u201d \u2013 to recognise kinship with plants, mountains and lakes. The idea, rooted in indigenous language and philosophy (where a natural being isn\u2019t regarded as \u201cit\u201d but as kin) holds affinities with the emerging rights-of-nature movement, which seeks legal personhood as a means of conservation. Kimmerer understands her work to be the \u201clong game\u201d of creating the \u201ccultural underpinnings\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLaws are a reflection of social movements,\u201d she says. \u201cLaws are a reflection of our values. So our work has to be to not necessarily use the existing laws, but to promote a growth in values of justice. That\u2019s where I really see storytelling and art playing that role, to help move consciousness in a way that these legal structures of rights of nature makes perfect sense. I dream of a day where people say: \u2018Well, duh, of course! Of course those trees have standing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Our conversation turns once more to topics pandemic-related.<strong> </strong>Kimmerer says that the coronavirus has reminded us that we\u2019re \u201cbiological beings, subject to the laws of nature. That alone can be a shaking,\u201d she says, motioning with her fist. \u201cBut I wonder, can we at some point turn our attention away to say the vulnerability we are experiencing right now is the vulnerability that songbirds feel every single day of their lives? Could this extend our sense of ecological compassion, to the rest of our more-than-human relatives?\u201d</p> <p>Kimmerer often thinks about how best to use her time and energy during this troubled era. Though she views demands for unlimited economic growth and resource exploitation as \u201call this foolishness\u201d, she recognises that \u201cI don\u2019t have the power to dismantle Monsanto. But what I <em>do</em> have is the capacity to change how I live on a daily basis and how I think about the world. I just have to have faith that when we change how we think, we suddenly change how we act and how those around us act, and that\u2019s how the world changes. It\u2019s by changing hearts and changing minds. And it\u2019s contagious. I became an environmental scientist and a writer because of what I witnessed growing up within a world of gratitude and gifts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA <em>contagion of gratitude,\u201d</em> she marvels, speaking the words slowly. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to think about what that would be like. Acting out of gratitude, as a pandemic. I can see it.\u201d</p> <p><br><em>\u2022 Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer is published by Penguin </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/braiding-sweetgrass-9780141991955.html\">https://guardianbookshop.com/braiding-sweetgrass-9780141991955.html</a></p>",

And in one way it feels overdue. But should we be looking at cancellation at all?</p> <p>In Germany this Friday, two weeks after the resumption of the men\u2019s Bundesliga, and in the same week the fate of the WSL and Championship will likely be confirmed, the Frauen-Bundesliga season will resume.</p> <p>It has been widely reported that players and clubs in the WSL and Championship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/wsl-players-mentally-checked-out-want-season-end-agent-alan-naigeon-womens-football\">do not want to see out the remainder of the season</a>, though it was only last Wednesday that clubs were finally asked to consider cancellation formally and the nuances of it. However there are serious questions to be asked about the role that the FA, the Premier League and Premier League clubs have played in paving the way for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/inessa-kaagman-its-not-just-sport-minded-at-everton-its-personal\">Inessa Kaagman: 'It's not just sport-minded at Everton, it's personal'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The DFB and DFL \u2013 the German FA and the league, respectively \u2013 have pulled together to provide support across the sport, including the elite women\u2019s game. In England, the Premier League, to which the FA has been touting the running of the WSL, has shown no such solidarity.</p> <p>Suggesting similar measures to Germany for the English game feels extreme, radical and unrealistic. The short-term spending required to complete the season safely comes with the warning that there could be long-term financial implications. The idea that there could be ways to generate new income or push the biggest Premier League clubs into making the same financial sacrifices as those top Bundesliga clubs for the greater good and health of the game, and in the name of equality, does not seem to have ever been on the table.</p> <p>The FA and Premier League will talk the talk when it comes to equality and \u201cfootball for all\u201d but it seems an asterisk needs attaching and a footnote saying \u201cunless it asks questions of the might and morals of the market-driven Premier League\u201d.</p> <p>Two of the questions put to clubs in the WSL and the Championship this past week were whether clubs could possibly meet the necessary safety requirements to finish the season and whether they have the financial resources to do so. We have the opposite of German solidarity, with the onus on individual clubs to magic their way through this crisis. That has an effect on morale. If clubs fear they cannot provide a safe environment, and players feel their clubs cannot do so unaided, of course they are going to favour cancellation.</p> <p>The lack of financial support, the lengthy period of uncertainty and an unwillingness to bring football\u2019s resources together to navigate this crisis means the feedback to the FA\u2019s questions will likely go only one way, because they have engineered it to make completion unviable, risky and scary.</p> <p>If we assume the leagues will be cancelled, what then? The bonus for the FA should clubs favour deciding the league based on the table as it stands or using a points per game formula is that there is little movement. Any PPG formula, weighted or unweighted, will see Chelsea leapfrog Manchester City to the WSL title. With Chelsea not having played every team in the league, a tricky match against Everton outstanding, City would be right to feel aggrieved. Any version of the table puts those two in the driving seat for Champions League spots, though.</p> <p>However, with only 71.9% of WSL games and 67.3% of Championship games completed it is hard to see, in leagues with 12 and 11 teams, respectively, and where one game can dramatically shift standings, how any formula can provide a fair outcome.</p> <p>A bigger decision is whether to continue with promotion and relegation. Aston Villa are six points clear of Sheffield United at the top of the Championship, while Liverpool are bottom of the WSL table, one point behind Birmingham having played a game more. There will be a clamour for Liverpool to avoid the drop and there is a legitimate argument for the expansion of the WSL. But to promote and not relegate is hugely inconsistent and contrary to the attempt to ensure sporting integrity is maintained. It would also leave the second tier with 10 teams next season. In a nine-month season, Championship clubs would be expected to build momentum and support with an average of one home league game a month.</p> <p>The effect of these decisions though, feels insignificant. Why? Because it will be dwarfed by the impact of the decision to sidestep equity.</p>",

He served up an abbreviated menu including his two signature dishes \u2013 artichoke soup with truffles and parmesan, and a ballotine of poultry with foie gras and a truffle vinaigrette.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has forced restaurants to roll down their shutters across the UK too. But over the past few weeks, behind these darkened windows the restaurant kitchens have been a hive of activity.

She has had to furlough her staff and has been in the kitchen with her husband, Neil Borthwick, and their lodger, Salvatore, cooking up to 40 covers every Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThere are just three of us and I\u2019m doing lots of the cooking myself, so it\u2019s actually been very busy, and the feedback we\u2019ve had from customers has been really good. I can see us carrying this on once this is all over as it\u2019s been a real success.\u201d</p> <p>Hartnett said customers still wanted good food even though they were confined to their homes, with some even making multiple orders from different restaurants.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen photographs on social media of their meals with gnocchi they\u2019ve ordered from me and chops that they\u2019ve got from the River Cafe. I think people will still want to come out to restaurants regardless because they like that experience, but this has shown that they also want this type of food in their own home.\u201d</p> <p>For chefs who have not been able to reopen their businesses even to offer takeaways, such as Mary-Ellen McTague in Manchester and Mark Birchall, who clocked up two Michelin stars within two years of opening his Lancashire restaurant, the lockdown has been an opportunity to turn their talents to charitable work.</p> <p>McTague, who runs the Creameries in the suburb of Chorlton, launched the Eat Well MCR hospitality collective in response to the crisis. \u201cWe tried doing takeout for a week but it was really difficult to socially distance so we stopped.

The pandemic is forcing everyone to be more creative since the conventional ways of doing business, including campaigning, are not possible.\u201d</p> <p>Obama has a robust social media presence with millions of Twitter followers, and Jarrett pointed to Obama\u2019s endorsement of Biden, which took the form of an online video now that campaign rallies have become a thing of the pre-pandemic past.</p> <p>\u201cI think you can tell from the video that he rolled out with his endorsement, one very useful platform is President Obama\u2019s social media platform where he has more followers than any other politician by far.\u201d</p> <p>According to a Democratic strategist familiar with Obama\u2019s thinking, the former president is eager to campaign for Democrats \u201cup and down the ballot\u201d in 2020. He plans to follow the lead of the Biden campaign as well as that of the main Democratic campaign arms \u2013 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and other umbrella organizations.</p> <p>Obama was an active surrogate to boost Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections but since then has taken a more restrained approach to the national spotlight. He has only waded into current politics a few times and mostly on an indirect basis.</p> <p>Most recently, though, he delivered a commencement speech for college graduates where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/barack-obama-coronavirus-donald-trump-criticism-speech-covid-19\">said</a> the coronavirus pandemic had \u201cfinally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing\u201d. Obama didn\u2019t mention Trump by name but the speech was widely regarded as a direct allusion to the president. It could also herald what Obama\u2019s public appearances in the final months of the 2020 presidential campaign would be like.</p> <p>Separately, during a closed event with thousands of supporters and Obama alumni, the former president <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/politics/obama-flynn-coronavirus-trump.html\">warned</a> that the justice department\u2019s decision to drop charges against the former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn put the rule of law at risk.</p> <p>Campaign veterans and strategists say Obama is useful less as an attack dog going head to head with Trump and more as someone who highlights a positive vision of why voters should elect Biden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92/0_19_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Obama endorses Joe Biden via online video link.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Obama endorses Joe Biden via online video link.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo me, Obama is the world\u2019s best character witness,\u201d said Teddy Goff, who was digital director for Obama\u2019s second presidential campaign. \u201cYeah, he can make the case that Trump is bad. He can certainly validate the case for Biden\u2019s policies. But essentially he\u2019s the most popular political figure on planet Earth and the one guy he entrusted with the single most important appointment of his life was Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>But Obama could also persuade more people to vote.</p> <p>Meg Ansara, who was national regional director for Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign and more recently battleground states director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said one of the key priorities, especially in this environment, is voter registration.</p> <p>\u201cI think voter registration is a huge place,\u201d Ansara said, adding that persuading undecided voters is important for someone like Obama as well. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that you need to do both in the bulk of these battleground states.\u201d</p> <p>There have been moments during the last three years when Democrats had wondered why Obama didn\u2019t speak out more against Trump or weigh in more during the Democratic primary. That\u2019s actually an asset now and adds weight to when Obama does speak out, said Guy Cecil, who runs the Priorities USA Super Pac.</p> <p>\u201cI think in some respects the Biden campaign benefits from the fact that Obama has not spent three and a half years in the political limelight, attacking the president, attacking the administration, engaging in a back-and-forth with [Trump],\u201d Cecil said. </p> <p>Corey Platt, a veteran Democratic strategist and campaign manager, said that Obama and Biden have done a good job of appearing together so far and he should keep doing that rather than just focusing on going head-to-head with Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI think he if continues to remind people about competency and progress under his administration it will make people feel good about Biden, change and sanity. If he engages Trump I think that could backfire,\u201d Platt said. \u201cHe can help articulate Biden\u2019s vision for what happens next year and promote confidence in getting through this crisis together.\u201d</p>",

The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which opened in May for gig workers and self-employed individuals, has received 28,000 applications. The state\u2019s outdated unemployment system created a huge backlog in applications, forcing the recently jobless to wait weeks or, for some, more than a month for their first payments.</p> <p>The governor has extended the quarantine until the end of June, which has helped bring the number of arrivals to Hawaii from the usual 30,000 to less than 1,000 most days. The mandatory 14-day quarantine requires that everyone arriving in the state or traveling between islands must go directly from the airport to their home or hotel. During the quarantine period, all food must be delivered. Those who break quarantine face a maximum fine of $5,000 and/or imprisonment of up to one year.</p> <p>Local lawmakers have budgeted $36m for airport temperature cameras, which the governor said at a press conference on Monday would be part of the future screening process for arrivals to Hawaii\u2019s airports. \u201cIt does allow us to identify those who are most sick in a way that can be less intrusive than other screening methods,\u201d Ige said.

Standing in the Daveys\u2019 small wood, it is hard not to get carried away by visions of what might happen if a nation of gardeners turned their hands to forestry.</p> <p>\u201cBeing among it and just listening to the sounds of nature is priceless, really. And you\u2019re expanding your knowledge. You\u2019re learning about different things all the time,\u201d Steve says, expressing his love for summer evenings in the forest after a day driving his taxi. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any formal qualifications in land management or forestry.

Many owners buy their land to help promote biodiversity and reverse the effects of poor woodland management. The Daveys are no different.</p> <p>Six years before they purchased <a href=\"https://www.woodlandwildlife.co.uk/\">their plot </a>in 2018, the woodland was clear-felled and replaced with more than 2,000 non-native Sitka spruce, which are commonly grown in commercial plantations in the UK and are poor for biodiversity.

The insects, the invertebrates, they\u2019ve got to be catered for. If you haven\u2019t got those, then the whole ecosystem is not so healthy. Having the grass areas, the ponds, they\u2019ll create a huge amount of wildlife,\u201d says Steve.</p> <p>After the second world war, agriculture became more intensive and the widespread availability of plastic meant that less wood was needed to make furniture and tools. Many woodlands that were previously looked after were left to their own devices and now it is estimated that <a href=\"https://www.rfs.org.uk/media/552717/woodland-management-missed-opportunities-in-england-and-wales.pdf\">just over 40% of UK woodland</a> is either unmanaged or undermanaged.</p> <p>Management often mimics natural processes such as storm damage, which creates areas of wildlife-rich dead wood. Coppicing \u2013 cutting back trees to ground level on a five- to 20-year cycle \u2013 allows light to reach the forest floor. Before humans, large grazing animals such as bison would have browsed forests to maintain areas of low growth. This mix of dead wood, healthy trees, saplings and open spaces creates a rich mosaic of habitats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not owners, we\u2019re custodians of this bit of ground and these trees</p> <footer> <cite>Tony Upson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA well-managed woodland is more likely to have greater biodiversity than an unmanaged woodland.

  "<p>As we approach the end of Ramadan, the Eid al-Fitr celebrations will be taking place this weekend. Yet Eid is going to look and feel very different this year. That for British Muslims it\u2019s taking place in lockdown, through a global pandemic, is painful and heartbreaking.</p> <p>Eid al-Fitr follows weeks of fasting and marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It is full of rituals and traditions that involve the entire family: we put on new clothes and attend prayers, followed by a rich breakfast of roasted vermicelli (<em>sawaiyan</em>), sweet halwa and channa curry. The feast continues with an elaborate lunch, at least it does in our household: my mother is not happy until there is chicken biryani, haleem, fried fish, lamb chops and kebabs.</p> <p>But, I reminisce: this is the experience I\u2019ve had until now, where parents, siblings, in-laws, nieces and nephews all meet, kiss, hug and wish each other eid mubarak. So far it has never crossed my mind to celebrate Eid without immediate family.</p> <p>Despite having left home more than two decades ago and living in a different city, I always make it home for Eid. I was once based abroad, more than 4,000 miles away, but I took a seven-hour flight to Heathrow, spent two hours on the train and a short ferry trip so I could be home. The shock and delight on my family\u2019s faces as I arrived unannounced is something I still remember over a decade later. </p> <p>Having to celebrate Eid on my own this year? I guess there is a first time for everything.</p> <p>The current situation demands that we protect our loved ones by staying away. In England, people of black Caribbean background are most at risk, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">7</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">8 deaths per 100,000</a>, while those of Indian or Pakistani origin have between 30-35 deaths per 100,000. It\u2019s a frightening number but we should take comfort in the fact that these are extenuating circumstance that perhaps will not be repeated again in our lifetime. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/ramadan-during-coronavirus-may-seem-disheartening-but-its-the-ideal-time-for-reflection\">Ramadan during coronavirus may seem disheartening but it's the ideal time for reflection | Heba Shaheed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the best way to accept the situation is to look to the past. I recall my grandmother saying how hard it was for her and the family not to see her son \u2013 my dad \u2013 for more than nine years after he left Pakistan to come and study in England in the late 1960s. It now feels sad to think that he was all alone, spending all those Eids so far from his family. I have never before understood the true hardship and loneliness of his time, when it took nearly a month to send and receive letters.</p> <p>Many ethnic minorities have lost loved ones to the pandemic or are in isolation due to health issues, and for Muslims, being unable to come together as a family will be painful and hard. Not being able to console each other, hold hands, hug or simply sit next to each other seems cruel. We must adapt and support our families and communities in new ways. For this one year we will have to make do with Eid gatherings on Zoom and House Party. But let us be grateful for the technology that makes it possible to see and talk to our loved ones at the touch of a button.</p> <ul> <li><p>Aisha Riaz is assistant production editor at the Guardian Guide<br></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I want to talk sunscreens. Always, really \u2013 but now more than ever. I\u2019ve heard that because we\u2019ve seen sun exposure drastically curtailed during this unique spring, people are dispensing with sun protection when they do go out.

But it\u2019s still possible to enjoy a little sunshine and get the feelgood vitamin D fix we all need, without making oneself more vulnerable to skin cancers and sun damage.</p> <p>Last year, the New Scientist suggested that white people need only between two to eight minutes unprotected in afternoon summer sunlight a day, with 25-35 minutes for brown or black people, in order to obtain our vitamin D. This can be achieved by turning unprotected arms upwards; it needn\u2019t involve basking naked in the midday sun, face frying.

That\u2019s the first thing.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware that my expectations of you are too high, and I know your opinion of me, ie you, a year ago, is that you were naive. You weren\u2019t, you were just scared. One of the things that got us through were misplaced dreams that Something Good May Come From It; that society had stalled and required a reset \u2013 and boy, did it get one \u2013 so allow us that please, without too much cynicism.</p> <p>It was like that time your computer turned off \u2013 do you remember? \u2013 and you hadn\u2019t saved your script for hours. You didn\u2019t turn it back on immediately to see what was left. You went downstairs, made tea, paced, nearly cried, and waited, your world frozen in aspic, not knowing, once you rebooted the machine, what would have survived and what was gone for ever. If any of the things that you loved survived, be happy.</p> <p>If theatre has survived, then go, and every now and again look around you, at those hundreds of people sitting so close, sitting in the dark as a collective and listening to stories, and marvel at how mad and brilliant that is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"241bb2c26c18f58500281d7f163e79762380d0c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/241bb2c26c18f58500281d7f163e79762380d0c8/0_0_1098_914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of bird on tree outside window with someone holding a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"832\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Don\u2019t ever dare say something as stupid as, \u201cOh wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have one day of that again, the world on pause\u201d?

Have you found an effective vaccine and treatment, and if so, are they widely available in low-income countries as well?</p> <p>I hope you can look back with some pride and say, yes, people like me made a difference. I hope our public health leadership was embraced by government, and we were able to minimise deaths and the long-term consequences of both the disease and the control measures.</p> <p>My research career has focused on HIV, another devastating infection that spread rapidly across the globe. In the 39 years since the first Aids death was recorded in the UK, around 25,000 people have died here.

But rather than despair, you will marvel, as I already do, at the pace of scientific advance in these early months. Surely some of this will have borne fruit. You will smile, either at my naive optimism, or with satisfaction that we have started to turn this around, as we did with HIV.</p> <p>You will no doubt be in the midst of a political and ideological struggle over what the new normal should look like. Public inquiries will be under way to see if I and many others have been right in saying that the government\u2019s slow response was reckless; there will be scrutiny of the way contracts are handed to government allies, of how the crisis was used to further the privatisation of public services at the expense of transparency. I hope you are among the voices urging an end to this.</p> <p>Have you started shaking hands yet? I expect you\u2019re still wary of travel, but please tell me you have managed to get back to the Lake District, and bagged a few more Wainwright peaks.</p> <p>We are locked down in our nuclear unit of two parents and two adult sons. In rediscovering old videos, having more meals together, and virtual catchups with wider friends and family, we are creating some lovely new memories for you. But then the guilt resurfaces: so many people are isolated at home, or trapped in abusive relationships; many more are in overcrowded conditions with no access to outdoor space.</p> <p>I hope when you reply, you will tell me you are still speaking out.

Like millions of others who were forced to stop and think, an awful illness gave you the chance to consider your priorities. Being a misanthropic git, that did not mean wanting to spend more time with friends and relatives, lovely though they are. It meant appreciating that less is more. Before becoming ill you were doing too much, spreading yourself too thinly.

As I write, many people are enthusiastically predicting that community is back, that greed is out. I\u2019m not so sure. Even when we\u2019re convinced we\u2019ve shaken off old habits, they have a tendency to creep back until, unnoticed, they\u2019re as much at home as ever. Will your neighbourhood WhatsApp group still be active, or will it have become an occasional forum for stupid videos? Will all those independent shops and cafes be thriving on the love everyone <em>said</em> they discovered for them, or will months of shutdown and online ordering have killed them off for good?</p> <p>I hoped that, as a society, we\u2019d rebalance our excessive individualism with a renewed sense that no one is an island, and that who we are is intimately connected with our relations to others. I also hoped we\u2019d learn that knowledge acquisition is a collective effort that requires drawing on a range of expertise, not simply your own conviction that the virus would go away, or \u201cfollowing the science\u201d, if that means consulting a narrow group of specialists.</p> <p>It feels like a time of momentous transformations, but I fear that you, like the rest of the world, overestimate your capacity for change.

I know you\u2019re probably very busy, what with everything that\u2019s been going on. The whole Nobel prize thing in particular: nice hustle, sir! Anyway look, as I say, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very busy, so I won\u2019t keep you long. I wanted to talk to you about the elephants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57313860dfd6bb7e2dff7328772cfc6f809e7a54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57313860dfd6bb7e2dff7328772cfc6f809e7a54/0_0_1031_1143/902.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a man looking at an elephant behind bars\" width=\"902\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There was a time when you couldn\u2019t venture any further than two kilometres from your front door. There was a time when, if you wanted to do something, anything at all, that thing basically had to be going for a walk in the park. At first, you may recall, this seemed unbearable. The boredom! The undifferentiated glutinous mass of days! The levelling of the entire landscape of the future! (\u201cNothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it\u2019s awful!\u201d as your fellow Irish Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/beckett\" title=\"\">Samuel Beckett</a> memorably put it.)</p> <p>But then, eventually, you started to explore the park a bit more. Your standards for what constituted an interesting and pleasurable experience, the highlight of a given day, were radically lowered. And this, it turned out, was no bad thing. It was just very nice, actually, to walk through the park and listen to the sound of the wind rustling in the trees and the unseen animals making their various noises from inside the closed zoo.</p> <p>Do you remember the day you discovered that you could glimpse the elephants through a service gate at the rear of the zoo? What a thrill it was to press your face to the gate, and to see four or five elephants just going about their business. And how you did it again the next day, and the next. Maybe it\u2019s hard to remember what a pleasure this was \u2013 maybe it\u2019s been eclipsed by the memory of the king of Sweden presenting you with a cheque for 9m kronor.</p> <p>But I think you should try to remember it. I think you should remember the elephants, sir, and how great it was to see them, and how much pleasure there still was in the world, even when its radius was only two kilometres.</p> <p><em>Mark O\u2019Connell is the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end\" title=\"\">Notes</a> </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end\" title=\"\">From</a> </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end\" title=\"\">An Apocalypse</a>, published by Granta at \u00a314.99</em></p> <h2>\u2018My big hope is that, by the time you read this, there will be a vaccine\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Hugh Pym, broadcaster</strong></p> <p>Dear Hugh,</p> <p>None of us will ever forget these months: long, exhausting days for me and my BBC colleagues, but nothing like the punishing shifts put in by NHS and social care staff. Spending a day at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge was a humbling experience, and I won\u2019t ever forget the time a London hospital ran out of critical care beds for coronavirus patients, or when a senior NHS official told me they were \u201cscared\u201d. There were fears the NHS would be overwhelmed. But, thanks to extraordinary efforts, it coped when it was needed most. </p> <p>My big hope is that, by the time you read this, there will be a vaccine, and drugs and therapies available. Hopefully the world\u2019s finest scientific minds, including British research teams, will have cracked it, with pharmaceutical companies working for the common good, at cost and not for excessive profit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d231ef2c6ac96c2e436b8288539a61d7cdc0a07e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d231ef2c6ac96c2e436b8288539a61d7cdc0a07e/0_0_582_1508/386.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of person holding Save Our NHS poster\" width=\"386\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I hope we will have begun to value all health and care workers, and pay them accordingly. We will need a big rethink of social care and how it is funded, and a full appraisal of what funding the NHS needs to continue delivering the outstanding care we have all applauded every week. There is a backlog of work postponed that has to be addressed, and things will no doubt be done differently.</p> <p>Much of the work of GPs has been carried out remotely, by phone or video; many doctors say this has allowed them to talk to more patients and freed up time for face-to-face consultations with the sickest. More virtual hospital outpatient appointments should also be possible. This should be one of the positives to come from the crisis. </p> <p>I have cherished time spent with my family during lockdown, rediscovering the joys of backgammon, jigsaw puzzles and proper workouts in the garden. I hope we never live through another period when we cannot see older relatives. They deserve better than being left to cope alone. They have at least begun to get to grips with Zoom, including a virtual Scrabble game organised by my brother. I hope the spirit of quizzes and chats with extended family and friends continues, and that we will live our lives more simply, making more time for others and worrying less about the immediate pressures of daily life. We should ensure that those who felt isolated are looked after and that the burden of loneliness felt by many is lifted.</p> <p><em>Hugh Pym is BBC News health editor</em></p> <h2>\u2018I hoped this plague would sweep lightly over my country, but feared otherwise\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Bernardine Evaristo, author</strong></p> <p>Dear Bernardine,</p> <p>I thought plagues were a thing of the past until history proved otherwise. I hoped this one would sweep lightly over my country, leaving zero fatalities, but feared otherwise, and have been proved right. I\u2019m shocked at the incompetence and arrogance of my country\u2019s government from the start to the end, and how people were misled to their deaths. I\u2019m shocked at how my country reclaimed the dubious position as a world leader with our disproportionately high number of deaths. How can this small and prosperous island corner over 10% of <a href=\"https://covid19.who.int/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgdbnkqzH6QIVzbTtCh2UiwCgEAAYASAAEgKosvD_BwE\">the world\u2019s virus-deceased</a>?

I\u2019ve been writing a lot of small commissions as well as self-filming for online festivals and events. The plague and quarantine have forced me to pause and reflect, but I won\u2019t be writing about it in my next book. We\u2019re in the middle of it right now and it will take time to process. In a year\u2019s time I will have started a new novel and it will be Covid-19-free. I\u2019m pretty sure readers will soon tire of the pandemic fiction that will be hitting the shelves around now.</p> <p>I imagine that I will be relieved to have survived, and grateful for the vaccine that will be inoculating the human race. Hallelujah. I will be grateful that climate change has shot up the agenda, because reduced gas emissions during lockdown proved the science of global warming to non-believers. I will be grateful we are once more able to congregate and enjoy social communion with others. I will be grateful that people will be safely back at work, and earning, and that students and school pupils will be back in their classes, sitting side by side, and learning. I will be grateful that the feeling of community spirit that emerged when we were at war with an invisible enemy, survives. I will be grateful that those who showed their unsuitability for leadership are no longer in power.</p> <p>But I will miss the quiet of the city, which sounded more like the countryside. I will remember watching a crow pecking at a rubbish bag, before strutting down the empty road outside my window, like an alpha male without a care in the world. I remember thinking how quickly London could become a jungle overrun by feral pigeons, cats, foxes and rats, strolling around in the middle of the day like they own the joint.</p> <p>I will remember missing going into cafes, seeing theatre, meeting up with family and friends. And I will miss the cleaner air of the city from this time, and the slower pace, and I will be deeply grateful that my own life did not come to a full stop. This is what I will have learned, to take nothing for granted - to count my blessings every day.</p> <p><em>Bernardine Evaristo is author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/girl-woman-other-9780241984994.html\" title=\"\">Girl, Woman, Other</a>, which won the Booker </em><em>prize in 2019 and is published by Penguin at \u00a38.99</em></p>",

It also raises hopes that South Korea \u2013 a country long considered one of the world\u2019s worst <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/latest/south-korea-leads-list-of-2016-climate-villains/\">climate villains</a> \u2013 will set a global example by accelerating the shift away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>Lee was invited to stand as a candidate for the president Moon Jae-in\u2019s Democracy party in last month\u2019s legislative elections. She proposed a green new deal in the campaign manifesto as a way to appeal to young voters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"684567da67d4f0346ce50101ba428b940606f3de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/684567da67d4f0346ce50101ba428b940606f3de/0_0_1089_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soyoung Lee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soyoung Lee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office of Lee Soyoung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was the first to suggest that,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to decarbonise Korean society. This is my personal mission. That is why I went into politics.\u201d</p> <p>Winning her seat in a landslide, she is now part of a ruling coalition with a huge majority to push through any measures it chooses.</p> <p>The government\u2019s priority is to boost the economy after the Covid-19 crisis. South Korea has won praise around the world for its handling of the health pandemic, but its powerful industrial conglomerates have taken a big hit from the downturn in global trade.</p> <p>Many business leaders and veteran ministers want recovery to focus purely on digital technology. But civil society and lawmakers like Lee have persuaded the president that it is possible to create jobs and raise climate ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear the green new deal is the way for us to go,\u201d Moon <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/05/113_289851.html\">announced this week</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to lay out a grand plan for the green new deal to harmonise with the establishment of digital infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>For the president, the priority is job creation and demonstrating to the world that South Korea is a responsible member of the international community.</p> <p>Recent history gives cause for scepticism. This high-tech nation has a low-grade energy supply. After the 2008-09 financial crisis, the government promised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/21/south-korea-enviroment-carbon-emissions\">\u201cgreen growth\u201d strategy,</a> but the plans for more river protection and bike lanes were an excuse for construction companies to pour more concrete than ever.</p> <p>In the years since, coal use and carbon emissions have surged. The country is calculated to have $106bn of fossil fuel assets incompatible with the Paris climate agreement \u2013 more than any other nation. In 2016, activists described South Korea as the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/latest/south-korea-leads-list-of-2016-climate-villains/\">biggest carbon villain</a>.</p> <p>Analysts say this time is different because the president has already set a goal of raising the share of electricity coming from renewables from 3% to 20% by the end of the decade. That will require an investment of about 100tn Korean won (\u00a366bn).</p> <p>Byunghwa Han, a senior analyst at Eugene Investment and Securities and a longtime advocate of renewables, said the political stars were now finally aligned.</p> <p>\u201cI am very optimistic. This is the best opportunity in Korea since I have been involved in this field since 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is very ambitious about the green new deal and, with a strong majority in the national assembly, the president can enact policies with no roadblocks.\u201d</p> <p>Lee vowed to prevent a repeat of the last greenwashing project. \u201cToday is totally different. In our green new deal, the starting point is the reduction of emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to legislate measures for a 2050 net zero goal, phase out coal earlier and enhance our ambitions for renewable energy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11a088fbca1c665add810011991fba0fca7887d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a088fbca1c665add810011991fba0fca7887d9/0_85_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soyoung Lee announcing the Green New Deal manifesto at the press conference during the general election\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soyoung Lee announcing the Green New Deal manifesto at the press conference during the general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office of Lee Soyoung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The central test of the government\u2019s convictions will be cuts to domestic coal consumption and overseas financing of coal projects. South Korea plans to generate 30% of its electricity from this dirtiest of fossil fuels by 2030. Lee says this would make it impossible to reach the net zero goal by 2050.</p> <p>South Korea could make a still greater contribution to global climate efforts if it halted support for coal plants in south-east Asia. It is one of only three nations \u2013 along with China and Japan \u2013 that still provide loans for such projects, which are blackballed by most nations and a growing number of international financial institutions.</p> <p>\u201cIf we stop this funding, it will show the transition in our country and across the global community,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe need to give up on sectors that make short-term profit.\u201d</p> <p>The companies that have the most to lose, including the power utility Kepco and the heavy engineering conglomerate Doosan, are already pushing back. Local media report heated disputes among ministers, who say coal is important for developing nations.</p> <p>Lee argues South Korea will have more stranded assets the longer it delays transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cIt makes economic sense to change. These kinds of businesses will not be viable in the future.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming weeks, the green new deal will dominate discussions of the new session of the national assembly, another sign of how far the climate has moved up the political agenda.</p> <p>Lee credits the school strike movement for raising awareness. She has campaigned for decarbonisation for many years and worked as a lawyer on climate litigation suits, but she says there was little public support until recently.</p> <p>\u201cI was a minority in civil society, but the global school strikes sparked a lot of activism in Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cGreta [Thunberg] inspired Korean youth. Last October we had a climate emergency demonstration with 5,000 people. That was the biggest so far. There was also a big one in May. I join them them all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Her journey from the streets and the courtroom to the corridors of power is a sign of how Generation Greta is coming of age. Lee says there is still a long way to go.</p> <p>She estimates that just 10 of the 300 legislators are seriously committed to climate issues. \u201cIt is definitely still not mainstream,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the green new deal is now at the centre of political discussion for the first time. We need to see whether this means a sudden revolutionary change or the start of something incremental.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to be over optimistic about securing a tremendous budget with huge goals. But it is important that the government is setting targets and moving in the right direction.There is a lot of value in that. We will do our best to make South Korea a model in this, as it has been in its handling of Covid.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After weeks stuck indoors, many of us have a very good idea of which bits of our home we would like to improve. Some have already been moving through their DIY to-do lists but with the bank holiday weekend here and restrictions on lockdown easing in parts of the UK, it is the perfect time to get going on a new project \u2013 big or small.</p> <p>Medina Grillo, an award-winning DIY and home improvement blogger at <a href=\"http://www.grillo-designs.com/\">grillo-designs.com</a>, says now is an opportunity to tackle projects you may have previously put off. \u201cDIY helps to structure your day a bit more and it keeps you from feeling too bored,\u201d she says. She has painted a small wall in her entrance hall, hung up a few pictures and waxed a coat rail over the past few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve DIYed something, it\u2019s sort of the same feeling you get after a good workout session. A sense of pride and achievement that you did that,\u201d she says. \u201cIn most cases it does save money as you won\u2019t need to hire a tradesperson or splash out on expensive furniture. You can upcycle or build your own homeware that is one-of-a-kind and customised to suit your style.\u201d</p> <p>DIY shops and hardware stores have been allowed to stay open throughout the lockdown \u2013 and they have been busy. Recently, Draper Tools, one of the large hand and power tool distributors, said it was experiencing strong demand in areas such as its painting and decorating products, where there had been a 20% increase.</p> <p>With spare cash at a premium, many of us will be looking for ways to do DIY on a budget. In normal times, borrowing tools, either from friends and family, or a local <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/24/library-of-things-borrowing-scheme-conquer-world\">library of things</a>, is a good way to cut costs.

DIYers can borrow a range of items including sanders, drills and pressure washers, which will be delivered to their door in a bag. Borrowing a <a href=\"https://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/catalogue/borrow-hedge-trimmer-cordless\">hedge trimmer</a>, for example, costs \u00a38 a day, with a minimum hire time of two days, and there is a \u00a31 membership fee when you make your first booking.</p> <p>Secondhand specialists such as eBay and Gumtree are another place to look for tools and materials. So, too, are neighbourhood forums and local WhatsApp groups \u2013 often people advertise things they are trying to get rid of and want nothing or very little for them. It is also worth posting in these groups if there is anything specific you want to borrow, as people often have tools sitting unused. Again, you will need to consider how to receive the items safely. The coronavirus can survive on surfaces, so ensure you are wearing protective gloves when touching products or leave them for 72 hours before you begin your DIY.</p> <p>If you are buying kit new, check the retailer\u2019s websites or give them a call before turning up at a store because demand has been high and lots of items have been out of stock. Most retailers are delivering \u2013 although the consumer group <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/05/diy-shopping-during-lockdown-online-problems-and-new-diy-store-opening-times/\">Which? says it has heard from many shoppers</a> who have been hanging on for their purchases.</p> <p>There are plenty of jobs you can do that do not require a big outlay on specialist equipment. Kate Watson-Smyth, the founder of the blog Mad About The House and the author of 101 Interior Design Answers, says her top tip for those who do not want to pick up a power tool would be to paint. \u201cIt\u2019s transformative and affordable,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you get it wrong, it\u2019s easy to redo.\u201d She suggests going for calming colours for rooms \u201cwhen there are likely to be more people at home and pressure on space than before. You can always come back to the bright, energising colours later when this ends\u201d.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t feel like tackling the walls, or don\u2019t need to, you can still make a difference to your environment. \u201cConsider painting the woodwork such as skirting boards, doors, architraves and window frames and radiators to match [the walls]. This will make the space feel bigger, the walls look taller \u2013 and therefore the ceilings higher \u2013 so it will all feel more spacious.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For paint, often the best prices can be found at non-specialist shops</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For paint, often the best prices can be found at non-specialist shops.

Wilko and B&amp;M are also worth checking before you buy. And for items such as sugar soap and white spirit, pound shops are often a good bet.</p> <p>Pound shops are also a good source of random cans of paint, which can be used to paint accessories and add a splash of colour to your home \u2013 you can paint plain picture frames, revamp a wooden chair or paint a shelf, or all three, for a couple of quid. Popping in on the off-chance there is something you like is not an option at the moment but if you are there for other items, it is worth visiting the DIY section.</p> <p>Friends, family and neighbourhood groups are also good places to pick up half tins of paint that others may have left from their projects. Again, you will have to think about how to quarantine things.</p> <p>As well as indoors, you may have a garden to think about. Old pallets can be used to create your own furniture \u2013 there are lots of videos on YouTube showing you how to make tables and chairs. You will need some sandpaper, as the wood is usually unfinished and could give you nasty splinters.</p> <p>Old garden furniture can get a new lease of life with a bit of paint, although sadly indoor paint won\u2019t work. For future years, look out for garden paints in the sale at the end of the summer \u2013 shops such as Wilko often heavily discount these in September to start to make room for Christmas goods. In the meantime, shop around for paint. For Cuprinol Garden Shades Seagrass, for example, <a href=\"https://www.bmstores.co.uk/products/cuprinol-garden-shades-seagrass-2-5l-305675\">B&amp;M is charging \u00a315 for 2.5 litres</a>, while most retailers are charging \u00a320.

DIY doesn\u2019t always have to mean power tools or large renovation projects. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as having an idea and following through with it \u2026 by yourself. And that could be as basic as screwing a loose door back so it doesn\u2019t creak or adding a coat of varnish to a new table.</p></li> <li><p>Spray paint a home item that may not be the colour you want. I\u2019ve recently spray-painted a utensil rail from silver to brass and it was super-easy and quick to do.</p></li> <li><p>Hang a gallery wall with nails or self adhesive strips. You can use old tea cloths inside your frames or even add baskets/hats to add texture to your wall. Be creative!</p></li> <li><p>Reapply the sealant around your bathroom or kitchen counter tops if they are looking a little grubby or mouldy. There are some brilliant YouTube videos to show you how.</p></li> <li><p>Jet wash your garden decking or tiles.</p></li> <li><p>Recover an old lampshade. Grab some fabric or wallpaper scraps and give a worn, dated lamp a makeover with a bit of glue/self-adhesive spray.</p></li> <li><p>Have you got any jars or glass bottles lying around? Upcycle them into vases or storage with a little paint and/or glue.</p></li> <li><p>Do you have furniture in need of some loving? You can upcycle items by changing the handles, painting, staining or covering with sticky-back vinyl. Add wallpaper to the backing of an old bookcase.</p></li> <li><p>Use things such as grout pens to refresh kitchen or bathroom tiles.</p></li> <li><p>If you are using things such as paint, always make sure the room is well ventilated.

  "<p>For the last few years, every time my mum called me out of the blue I would brace myself for the news that my gran had died. A few weeks ago, after misfiring so many times, that premonition was finally proved correct.</p> <p>Because the country was under lockdown, and I was hundreds of miles from where she lived in Melrose in the Scottish Borders, there was never any question that I would attend the funeral. Immediately, I seized upon this as being \u201cthe hardest part\u201d. It seemed like the only aspect of someone dying at 97 years old that could be thought of as unfair or tragic.</p> <p>After some consideration, we decided not to have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/remote-rituals-in-a-time-of-coronavirus-mourners-find-comfort-where-they-can\">virtual funeral</a>, on the basis that having to mess around with the necessary technology might detract from the solemnity of the occasion; it wouldn\u2019t be very dignified if half the mourners were kicked off the Zoom call after 40 minutes. This decision made sense, I think; the last time I spoke to my family online we were accidentally Zoom-bombed by a bewildered stranger, something which would have been less funny in the context of a memorial service.</p> <p>In the end, five people were allowed to attend. I\u2019m told that it was a beautiful service; it was a bright, clear day and, from the crematorium, you could see the Eildon hills that my gran had loved so much.</p> <p>But not being able to be there felt profoundly wrong, an insult to her memory that even the context didn\u2019t quite excuse. I was also sad that we couldn\u2019t have a wake, that we didn\u2019t get the chance to get drunk as a family, tell sentimental stories and cry. Over the next week, my mum dug out old photos of her and sent them over WhatsApp: as a young woman in her nurse\u2019s uniform, then, later in life, cradling my younger brother or smiling from a hilltop.</p> <p>As nice as this was, it wasn\u2019t quite the same as being able to pore over them together. Like so many other people this year, we missed out on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/22/eddies-last-farewell-a-funeral-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-photo-essay\">rituals of grief</a>. I think that this, along with the death toll itself, is one of the cruellest aspects of the pandemic.</p> <p>Having been in the unusually fortunate position of getting to the age of 27 without experiencing a major bereavement, it\u2019s possible that I have an inflated and naive sense of what attending a funeral can achieve. Elsewhere in my personal life, I\u2019ve realised that the concept of closure never quite plays out as you\u2019d like it to. If you feel bad about something, there\u2019s never a silver bullet that will make that go away.</p> <p>And yet still I imagine that mourning after a funeral would be something more pure and direct than what I feel now, which is not much of anything, that it would allow me to rise to a summit of grief and then descend. Maybe there\u2019s an element of self-flagellation at play. Maybe I\u2019m worried that I just don\u2019t feel sad enough about the death of someone I loved. At least a funeral would have allowed me to weep in public and confirm it.</p> <p>In some ways, though, there could be worse times to be bereaved. At the time of the funeral, streets across the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/an-unreal-city-coronavirus-lockdown-in-london\">were quiet</a>, the headlines were grave, the world at large was imbued with a sense of loss. As far as we know she didn\u2019t die of Covid-19, nor was she in a care home, which meant I felt a kind of imposter syndrome thinking of her death in this context. But still, grief felt like something that clicked into a larger narrative.</p> <p>Now, just a few weeks later, that sense of national mourning has all but disappeared. The parks are filling up again, the newspapers are shifting to triumphant jingoism; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/may/08/uk-marks-75th-anniversary-of-ve-day-in-pictures\">on VE Day</a>, people danced in the street. The fact that I had been unable to go to the funeral and then, less than a month later, people were breaking lockdown to do the conga and dress up as aeroplanes filled me with a finger-wagging self-righteousness. I will allow that there are greater tragedies than for a grown man to lose his 97-year-old grandmother and I don\u2019t expect the nation to observe a period of mourning on my behalf, but sometimes the jolliness of the national mood feels like an insult to the dead, to all of them. The longer this goes on, the lonelier grief feels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/14/its-grief-upon-grief-the-harsh-reality-of-funerals-in-lockdown\">'It\u2019s grief upon grief': the harsh reality of funerals in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How can you explain why your grandmother was a good person without sounding banal?

But, you know, most people love their grandparents; in that sense, our relationship was very special and not special at all.</p> <p>Lockdown is a state of suspended reality. As such, I\u2019ve struggled to process the fact of her dying. It hasn\u2019t sunk in; I just don\u2019t quite believe it.

I wish I could speak to her one last time, while knowing that one last time wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p> <p>I try not to think of all the times, over the years, when I could have called her but didn\u2019t, because I was hungover or caught up in some transient personal drama or simply couldn\u2019t be bothered.

  "<p>Of my two big lockdown projects, one is well ahead of schedule: the iron table legs I am restoring have been stripped and primed, and are ready to paint, fully two weeks before the delivery date for the top I ordered.

The muffin he tore into small crumbs which he balanced on his wing mirror.</p> <p>The only time I went with him was shortly before his retirement, when he agreed to take me to his office on his day off to fill a cavity for free. As we pulled up outside the deli, dozens of birds flew down from the surrounding trees and landed all over his car. They waited there until he returned with the muffin and then, in my memory, queued patiently to perch on the wing mirror, one at a time.</p> <p>What I once viewed as a disturbing eccentricity has, during lockdown, become a personal ambition.

  "<p>It was never a foregone conclusion, but with three poll results in the last three weeks putting National\u2019s support at around 30%, the chances of Bridges remaining as leader were increasingly slim. By 1pm on 22 May, the parliamentary National party had sealed his, and deputy Paula Bennett\u2019s, fate.</p> <p>The new leader, Todd Muller, now faces the unenviable task of clawing back the centre right voters who appear, for now, to have deserted National in droves.</p> <p>Was this a necessary spill so close to an election? And will National be rewarded as a result? While commentators claim that the poll results were devastating, those with a long memory will remember that National has been here before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/new-zealand-opposition-to-vote-on-leader-as-polling-shows-party-at-near-record-low\">New Zealand's opposition leader Simon Bridges dumped after crash in popularity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bill English was polling in the mid-20s before the party\u2019s loss in the 2002 election. Before that, both Jim Bolger (in 1996) and Jenny Shipley (in 1999) had also experienced polls in the low 30s three months out from an election (although both were prime ministers). In none of these three cases were the leaders rolled.</p> <p>To be fair, 2020 is a completely different time.</p> <p>Voters worldwide appear much less tolerant and trusting of politics, and opinion polls drive parties and the media to distraction, in ways not seen 30 years ago. Across the Tasman, these two factors have propelled a cycle of churning through political leaders, on both the left and the right, in an effort to hold onto power.</p> <p>In New Zealand, Bridges, and now Muller, are up against a leader of the left who is doing for Labour what Key did for National. When National won 45% the vote in 2017, but was unable to form a government, there was a gnashing of teeth, followed quickly by a steely eyed determination to be \u201cby far the strongest opposition party that the Parliament has seen\u201d.</p> <p>And the strategy seemed to be working. Even after English\u2019s departure, the National base remained loyal \u2013 with National regularly ahead of Labour in the polls.</p> <p>But this success came with a risk. Because National had lost only 2% of the vote and three seats in 2017, this was a very large opposition, unlike any seen before under the Mixed Member Proportional electoral system. Of the 55 MPs elected in 2017, 15 are list MPs, drawn from as far down as 42nd on National\u2019s list. And for the past two-and-a-half years, these 15 MPs were no doubt satisfied their chances of being returned in September 2020 (possibly to government) were pretty good.</p> <p>This represented a false sense of security and perhaps just a little hubris. The chances of National continuing to hold 45% of the seats at the 2020 election were going to be tough. But the shock of a 15-percentage-point decline in support was clearly too much for the party, and no doubt for many of the list MPs in particular, including senior opposition members Paul Goldsmith and Michael Woodhouse, who risk losing their positions should National\u2019s stocks not improve.</p> <p>Can Todd Muller and his deputy Nikki Kaye save National from this prediction of decimation in four months time? Most commentators recognise that this leadership team has reach \u2013 Muller represents the rural, somewhat conservative, traditional side of this broad church that is the National party, while Kaye appeals to the urban liberal green-leaning National voter, and she has considerable ministerial experience, which will offset Muller\u2019s lack thereof.</p> <p>Their first job is to win back centrist voters \u2013 from Labour but also from ACT. Support for ACT has crept up incrementally from 2017, from 0.5% to close to 2%. But this increase has come at the expense of National supporters who presumably thought that National would need a partner after the next election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/21/jacinda-arderns-global-renown-is-great-but-she-must-do-more-for-women\">Jacinda Ardern's global renown is great, but she must do more for women | Jennifer Curtin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some centrist voters are likely those who left Labour for Key and are slowly returning \u201chome\u201d. But National\u2019s base also seems to have shifted away under Bridges. Key, and Joyce, excelled over three election cycles at securing both the electorate and party vote from their supporters. Indeed, only a small percentage of National voters split their vote in 2017, so Muller needs to rekindle that loyalty.</p> <p>He has the capacity to do this. He is a long-standing party member with strong networks in business and the rural sector; he stood out as a clear communicator in negotiating an agreement on the zero carbon bill with the Greens. And it is important to remember that while \u201cpreferred prime minister\u201d is what the polls measure, this includes more than likability, which Ardern has in spades.</p> <p>Our New Zealand election study shows voters also want to know their leader is competent and trustworthy, with a dash of likability \u2013 this was why English proved popular. So Muller, and Kaye, together have a real chance at rebuilding National\u2019s support to within 40% by September and save the careers of their once-senior colleagues.</p> <p>However, their second job might not be so easy. We do not yet know how many supported Muller as opposed to Bridges, and if it was close, and there remains some resentment amongst Bridges supporters, there is a risk of white-anting.</p> <p>That said, the party\u2019s coffers look healthy, and the donations may continue to flow if National under Muller\u2019s leadership can present itself, once again, as the preferred economic manager for a post-Covid 19 recovery. It certainly now has nothing to lose.</p> <p><em>Jennifer Curtin is professor of politics and public policy at the University of Auckland.</em></p>",

He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Sweden has received considerable media scrutiny in recent days. According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/20/sweden-becomes-country-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-per-capita/\">coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world</a>, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK.

In fact, there has not been much public debate or organised opposition to the strategy. The deaths have indeed shocked many Swedes, especially the disproportionately high number of deaths among those over 70 in care homes and those from working-class, immigrant backgrounds. The debates, however, seem to be taking a more socioeconomic angle. In other words, the reasons for these deaths are being blamed on structural, economic, and social deficiencies \u2013 but not on the strategy itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/sweden-u-turn-controversial-covid-19-strategy\">Why Sweden is unlikely to make a U-turn on its controversial Covid-19 strategy | Tae Hoon Kim</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T18:07:44.933Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec7ea0e8f0886ce4f5d8a05\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T15:21:38.106Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Africa reaches 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have now been reported across Africa, according to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).</p> \n  <p>According to the <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/covid-19/\">interactive coronavirus dashboard</a> hosted on the African Union health agency\u2019s website, there have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent from Covid-19, while 39,416 people have recovered. </p> \n  <p>Unlike other regions, particularly Europe to the north, the coronavirus has been slow to spread across Africa.
