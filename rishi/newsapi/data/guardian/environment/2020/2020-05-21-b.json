We are very concerned about rising cases in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile Europe\u2019s director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the agency responsible for advising governments, including the UK, on disease control, has said that Europe should brace for a second wave of infections \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">The question is when and how big.

That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>Here are the top developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">World sees largest daily rise in cases</a>. </strong>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections</a></strong>, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. </strong>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June</strong>, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. </strong>South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said.</li> \n   <li><strong>France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system</strong>, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures</strong>. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal.</li> \n   <li><strong>Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees</strong> who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan</strong>. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d</strong>. Trump referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China\u201d, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid.</li> \n   <li><strong>Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries</strong> \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Latin America\u2019s infection rate overtakes US and Europe</h2> <p>Latin America has reported more new coronavirus cases than either the United States or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> for three days in a row, driven by high numbers in Brazil, Peru and Mexico, CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins University and World Health Organization data shows. The region reported at least 32,854 new cases on Wednesday, more than half of which were in Brazil.</p> <h2>Italy\u2019s death toll could be 60% higher than assumed</h2> <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll in March and April could be nearly 19,000 higher than the official figure of 32,000, the national social security agency said Thursday. As of Friday, the pandemic has claimed 32,486 deaths in Italy, of which 26,715 have been in Lombardy alone, Europe\u2019s worst affected region.</p> <h2>Brazil\u2019s PM to sign off federal aid programme</h2> <p>Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro said he will sign off a 60 billion-real ($10.72 bn) federal aid programme for states and cities hit by coronavirus, but asked governors for support by freezing public sector pay increases.</p> <h2>British government acted too slow, says scientific adviser</h2> <p>A scientific adviser to the British government has said that he would have liked ministers to have acted \u201ca week or two weeks earlier\u201d in the virus pandemic. Ian Boyd, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises ministers on Covid-19, said it would have made \u201cquite a big difference\u201d to the death rate.</p> <h2>Chechnya\u2019s leader <strong>Kadyrov</strong> possibly ill with Covid-19</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/head-of-chechen-republic-hospitalised-with-suspected-covid-19\">Ramzan Kadyrov</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/head-of-chechen-republic-hospitalised-with-suspected-covid-19\"> is in a Moscow hospital </a>suffering from suspected coronavirus, Russian news agencies reported, adding that the ally of Vladimir Putin was \u201cunder medical supervision\u201d and in a \u201cstable\u201d condition.</p> <h2>Russian economy battered by Covid-19</h2> <p>Russia\u2019s industrial output fell by 6.6% in April compared to the previous year, with its economy predicted to shrink by up to 6% in 2020. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> imposed a \u201cnon-working\u201d period across the country at the end of April, and Russia\u2019s Audit Chamber predicts that the number of unemployed will grow from 2.5 million to eight million this year.</p> <h2>Remote working is here to stay for Facebook workers</h2> <p>Half of Facebook\u2019s workforce could shift to permanent home working by the end of the decade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/facebook-coronavirus-remote-working-policy-extended-years\">founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed</a>, saying it was \u201cquite possible\u201d that over the next five to 10 years about 50% of staff at the company could be working from home.</p> <h2>California pastors to defy stay-at-home order</h2> <p>More than 1,200 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> pastors say they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/21/california-pastors-services-stay-home-order\">will resume in-person services this month </a>in defiance of governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s stay-at-home order to slow the spread of coronavirus. California has more than 85,700 coronavirus cases and more than 3,400 deaths.</p> <h2>Puerto Rico to reopen economy</h2> <p>Puerto Rico will cautiously reopen beaches, restaurants, churches, malls and hair salons next week under strict new rules as the US territory emerges from a two-month lockdown that stifled business activity on an island that now has a 40% unemployment rate.</p>",
  "<p>Members of stable staff will not be forced to go racing if they have concerns about possible infection when the sport resumes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/newcastle-will-host-first-horse-racing-meeting-on-return-for-sport-in-june\">possibly as soon as a week on Monday</a>. An agreement in principle has been hammered out between the staff trade union and trainers, in case some are still concerned after the sport\u2019s detailed protocols on safety are published next week.</p> <p>Those protocols will not include a requirement for staff to take Covid-19 tests before attending the races, according to George McGrath, chief executive of the National Association of Racing Staff. Instead, there will be several precautions designed to reduce risk to a minimum, including online education and temperatures being taken on arrival at the track.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/21/talking-horses-wesley-ward-to-send-horses-but-not-people-to-royal-ascot\">Talking Horses: Wesley Ward to send horses but not people to Royal Ascot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have an agreement with the National Trainers Federation and I\u2019ve also heard it from numerous trainers, that no member of staff will be made to go racing against their will,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to be in a position where they\u2019re going to have to walk into an environment that they feel is unsafe.</p> <p>\u201cBy the same token, those that may feel unsafe do not have a right to dictate to others, who do feel safe, that they shouldn\u2019t go racing. We\u2019re still working on some wording with the NTF but every trainer I\u2019ve spoken to and every engagement I\u2019ve had with the NTF has been positive in that respect. They\u2019re absolutely willing to make whatever concessions they can, so that the staff feel as safe as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Doubts about the accuracy of the available Covid-19 tests, together with the logistical difficulties of a testing regime, have steered racing\u2019s power-brokers away from using them, McGrath said. \u201cCan you imagine a travelling head lad, at the races five or six days a week? You\u2019d have to take a test every day and that\u2019s going to be difficult if you\u2019re leaving the yard at 6am and not getting back until 10pm.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, staff must complete <a href=\"https://www.naors.co.uk/news/covid-19-short-elearning-course/\">an e-learning course</a> about safety protocols and complete a questionnaire. On arrival at the track, their temperature will be tested. \u201cAnybody\u2019s who\u2019s above the level, I think it\u2019s 37.8C, will not be admitted and nor will anyone travelling with them.\u201d<br><br>McGrath believes the same regime will apply to all attendees of racing behind closed doors. \u201cWe were keen to have a consistent approach, so you didn\u2019t have a scenario where maybe jockeys were getting an antigen test but maybe the BHA staff weren\u2019t. The only way to achieve that consistency was to take the route that we have.\u201d<br><br>He pointed out that, with overnight stops at the races currently impossible, staff face very long days if taking a horse from, say, Lambourn to Newcastle. \u201cBut, to be realistic, everybody\u2019s going to take a hit to one degree or another. There isn\u2019t an awful lot we can do about it. We have to play our part in the resumption as well.</p> <p>\u201cNo canteens will be open, no bars, no betting, no showers. It\u2019ll be hard work. I\u2019m confident that the vast majority of staff are as keen to resume racing as any other stakeholder, but we\u2019re going to have our concerns, just as others will.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be safe in terms of minimising the risk. Safe, once upon a time, meant no risk and no danger. Safe in Covid-19 times means we\u2019ve minimised the risk and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve done everything we can reasonably do. I can\u2019t wait to get back racing.\u201d</p>",

The territory has long had a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, but legal observers and human rights activists fear legislative change within China will undermine Hong Kong\u2019s legal framework. \u201cThe obvious worry is that in China, we have seen \u2018national security\u2019 \u2026 being used as an excuse for all sorts of human rights abuses, including the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of dissidents,\u201d said Hong Kong barrister Wilson Leung. The proposed new laws follow significant protests which have rumbled on since June 2019 in the former British territory, described by analysts as the most serious unrest in 23 years.</p> \n<p><strong>Continued early withdrawals of superannuation will damage the sector\u2019s ability to invest in nation-building infrastructure,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/22/nation-building-investments-at-risk-if-early-superannuation-withdrawals-continue\">the head of a major Australian super fund has warned</a>.

  "<p> On Tuesday night ABC TV aired<em> </em>Getting Their Acts Together, a fly-on-the-wall look at Adelaide festival artistic directors Rachel Healy and Neil Armfield as they criss-cross Europe to assemble this year\u2019s program. From the constant air travel to the now-surreal scene of an unwell Armfield dosed up on cold and flu tablets before attending a packed French premiere in 2019, viewing their quest from the discomfort of 2020 carries a foreboding subtext: this would all be impossible today.</p> <p>\u201cTheir job is to scour the globe for the most spectacular acts of our time,\u201d narrator Annabel Crabb explains, and despite abundant bickering and occasional creative differences, Healy and Armfield appear united in their idea of what the festival should be. Armfield speaks of a global search for \u201cwork that is genuinely great, that is the best in the world\u201d, while Healy fondly recalls her childhood in Adelaide, where the festival routinely exposed her to \u201csomething from another world\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/15/we-put-on-theatre-no-matter-what-what-will-australian-stages-look-like-post-pandemic\">'We put on theatre no matter what': what will Australian stages look like post-pandemic?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such values are consistent with a more traditional model of curated arts festivals, but these days they\u2019re not universally shared. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/20/bigger-is-not-always-better-adelaide-festival-looks-increasingly-out-of-step\">UNSW academic Caroline Wake wrote earlier this year</a>, Adelaide festival\u2019s international focus has increasingly stood apart from its peers, which are prioritising works that deeply engage with their cities and the nation. In 2020, new Australian work was thinner on the ground than past years, and as <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/theatre/adelaide-festival-laid-on-a-feast-but-where-was-the-indigenous-work-20200316-p54aes.html\">Steve Dow observed in the Sydney Morning Herald</a><em>, </em>the lack of First Nations-centred work was conspicuous: there were more revivals of British works that premiered in 1996 <em> </em>than there was new Indigenous theatre or music.</p> <p>Other cities have different approaches. \u201cIt\u2019s actually about what it means to be Australian,\u201d said Sydney festival artistic director Wesley Enoch of his 2020 program, which foregrounded First Nations stories and the legacies of colonisation. At Perth festival, Iain Grandage described his inaugural spread as \u201ca celebration of our place, our home\u201d and \u201ca chance to acknowledge our great Western Australian artists and celebrate their visions for a shared future\u201d.</p> <p>Each festival has its own history, scale and context within its city. In a place like Adelaide \u2013 which is regularly skipped over by touring productions that flock to eastern capitals \u2013 the pulling power of a major festival has its own value.</p> <p>But as the coronavirus crisis shuts us off from the word and hits pause on the entire arts industry, each one of these events has a rare opportunity to take stock and ask exactly what they\u2019re here for.</p> <p>Of course, this might happen out of necessity. Most Australian festivals rely on some imported acts, but with European summer festivals from the Edinburgh Fringe to Festival d\u2019Aix-en-Provence cancelled and theatres closed, the international marketplace from which such programs are cherry-picked is in indefinite shutdown.</p> <p>But out of uncertainty lies opportunity. Falls festival has <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/falls-festival-pushing-ahead-all-australian-2020-21-lineup-covid/12218898\">already flagged plans to return with an all-Australian bill for 2020/21</a>, in a welcome show of support for a local music industry rocked by venue closures and cancellations. The performing arts sector has fared no better, particularly among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/06/we-are-witnessing-a-cultural-bloodbath-in-australia-that-has-been-years-in-the-making\">small-to-medium companies that were already disproportionately affected</a> by years of declining Australia Council funding. They\u2019re also often the ones producing the most innovative new Australian work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Redirecting money to new Australian commissions would provide an immediate, much-needed stimulus to our cultural sector</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With high profiles, comparatively secure government funding and established philanthropic networks, major arts festivals are in a position to make a difference. At one point in Getting Their Acts Together, Adelaide festival\u2019s annual bill is placed at $20m \u2013 around four times the amount of money the Australia Council has scraped together for its Covid-19 resilience fund.</p> <p>And after months of cancellations and pushbacks there will be no shortage of compelling shows by Australian artists and companies looking to make up for lost time \u2013 and income \u2013 in 2021. Allowing these orphaned works to fill the hole of overseas programming \u2013 and redirecting money otherwise spent on airfares and big-ticket international draws to an ambitious program of new Australian commissions \u2013 would provide an immediate and much-needed stimulus to our cultural sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email\">Saved for Later: sign-up for Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some festivals are already embracing this idea. On Thursday it was revealed Melbourne International Arts festival would trade in its \u201cinternational\u201d label entirely for the new title Rising. As its first act the rebranded festival announced, it would channel $2m in funding from its cancelled August program to commissioning new work by Victorian artists for 2021. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Darwinfestival/status/1262915633299304449\">Darwin festival has also revealed plans</a> to make its August 2020 program a \u201chyper-local\u201d one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4698fac8dd3193f7e040189999743cd2bc6c392c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4698fac8dd3193f7e040189999743cd2bc6c392c/156_260_3240_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rising\u2019s co-artistic directors Gideon Obarzanek and Hannah Fox\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It challenges us to champion local artists without being parochial\u2019: Rising\u2019s co-artistic directors, Gideon Obarzanek and Hannah Fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Creative Victoria</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis moment has forced us to think deeply about the future of festivals and about how we can build greater sustainability,\u201d Rising co-artistic director Hannah Fox says. \u201cIt challenges us to champion local artists without being parochial and to find new ways to stay connected internationally.\u201d</p> <p>The global network of festivals and fringes will inevitably return in some form post-Covid, and one moment in Getting Their Acts Together illustrates how this exchange can go both ways. On a scouting mission to Edinburgh International festival 2019, Armfield and Healy are rocked by the death of Wangkatjungka actor Ningali Lawford-Wolf, who was starring in Armfield\u2019s Edinburgh staging of Kate Grenville\u2019s The Secret River. Lawford-Wolf\u2019s death is devastating, but to see First Nations actors and a challenging Australian story on a British stage (albeit one mediated by a trio of white storytellers in Armfield, Grenville and playwright Andrew Bovell) is stirring.</p> <p>But The Secret River \u2013<em> </em>originally staged by Sydney Theatre Company in 2013, before being revived as the centrepiece of Armfield and Healy\u2019s first Adelaide festival in 2017 \u2013 is just one play, and a seven-year-old one at that. Imagine the breadth, calibre and impact of Australian stories that our festivals could help commission, nurture and unleash every year.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://iview.abc.net.au/show/getting-their-acts-together\">Getting Their Acts Together</a> is now streaming on ABC iView</em></p>",

Does the prime minister think it is right that careworkers coming from abroad and working on our frontline should have to pay a surcharge of hundreds, sometimes thousands of pounds to use the NHS themselves?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And Johnson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have thought a great deal about this, and I accept and understand the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. Like [Starmer] I have been a personal beneficiary of carers who have come from abroad and frankly saved my life. I know exactly the importance of what he asks. </p> \n   <p>On the other hand, we must look at the realities. This is a great national service \u2013 it is a national institution \u2013 that needs funding, and those contributions help us to raise about \u00a3900m.

They had been previously given a one-year exemption.</p> \n<p>However, just 24 hours earlier, at prime minister\u2019s questions, Johnson had dug in over the charge in an exchange with Starmer. He justified the fee because of the financial contribution it made to the NHS, which he estimated at \u00a3900m.</p> \n<p>Figures from the House of Commons Library showed that \u00a3917m was raised over four years from all migrants paying the surcharge. The library estimated it would cost about \u00a335m a year to exempt all NHS staff, and more for care workers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The SNP, Lib Dems and other opposition parties also voiced their concerns about the charge, while emotional social media videos by Syrian hospital cleaner Hassan Akkad on the plight of the lowest-paid healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic have been shared thousands of times.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt was among the leading voices calling for the U-turn, despite introducing the fee in 2015 during his time as health secretary. The now chair of the health select committee urged the government to change its mind just as No 10 announced it was dropping the surcharge.</p> \n<p>Speaking to Nick Robinson on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Political Thinking podcast, he said: \u201cGiven the sacrifices that we\u2019ve seen during the coronavirus pandemic, low-paid frontline health and care workers need to be thought about differently, and I think one of the ways that we could do this is by looking at that surcharge, so I very much hope the government will do something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite the mounting pressure, Tory MPs were still surprised by the speed at which Johnson changed tack. An increase to the surcharge was a manifesto promise in last year\u2019s general election campaign.</p> \n<p>The education select committee chair, Robert Halfon, who was one of the four Tory MP rebels who said the charge should be abandoned, added: \u201cI had no idea this was going to happen \u2013 not in a million years. I think it\u2019s impossible to say to NHS workers in very low-paid work, who are risking their lives to look after us, that we are going to whack a few hundred quid charge on them. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt was just unpalatable to the British people. I welcome that the prime minister has listened. This raises a much bigger issue, and if there\u2019s any silver lining to Covid-19, I hope this means a relentless focus on how we can help the low-paid.\u201d</p> \n<p>Conservative MP William Wragg, who was the first to say he would support Labour in its bid to scrap the surcharge, said Johnson had \u201cshown true leadership\u201d and had listened and reflected.</p> \n<p>Former Conservative cabinet minister David Mundell said the shift was the right thing for Johnson\u2019s government to do. \u201cIt was inconsistent with the deep gratitude everyone feels for NHS staff at this time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, former Conservative party vice-chair and MP for North Thanet, Sir Roger Gale, said it would \u201crightly be perceived as mean-spirited\u201d, while Andrew Boff, a senior Tory on the Greater London assembly, said: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my party, but this is not its finest hour. These people have saved lives, then we give them a bill.\u201d</p> \n<p>The former Tory party chair Chris Patten said the fee would be \u201cimmoral and monstrous\u201d.</p> \n<p>Another senior Tory, Bob Neill, chair of the justice select committee, said the charge was \u201ca small sum in the overall scheme of things\u201d and the government should show generosity of spirit as a nation.</p> \n<p>Tory MPs in Scotland and London were said to be very uneasy with the fee as they are the regions that rely most heavily on migrant labour in the healthcare sector and where immigration policies can be hard to defend. The Royal College of Nursing had also wanted health workers to be exempt from the \u201cunfair\u201d charge.</p> \n<p>So far during the crisis, 181 health service and 131 care staff have died, according to government figures.</p> \n<p>The reversal is being viewed as a victory for Starmer. Following the announcement, he called the decision \u201cthe right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next.\u201d </p>",

It is now truly the nation\u2019s epic\u201d. Kinzer cast White House incumbent George W Bush as Ahab and, as his whale, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, revenge against whom no price in American lives and treasure seemed too expensive.</p> <p>Now Trump blames everyone else for his own manifest failings as man and president, his revenge worn most acutely by the legions of his dead and dying citizens.</p> <p>Those who haven\u2019t read the novel might have seen John Huston\u2019s 1956 movie with Gregory Peck as Ahab. Regardless, most know it doesn\u2019t end well as they sail into darkness, towards that spectacular moment of mutual destruction.</p> <p>Two months in, I\u2019m savouring the novel, reading a few pages daily as we sail closer to the moment of truth amid compelling digressions into cetology (the chapter on who\u2019s who in the whale world somehow remains, while wholly extraneous to plot and narrative, the stuff of writerly genius), ships, harpoons, sea ecology, the tension between the economy and environment \u2013 and extinction.</p> <p>This time round I\u2019ve found Ahab more disturbed and disturbing. Melville\u2019s characters \u2013 especially the crew \u2013 are more intriguing as the Pequod sails ever further from New Bedford\u2019s safe harbour. It\u2019s a fabulous slow-burn (654 pages plus illustrations), the tension rising and falling with the seas ventured.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a Job\u2019s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals \u2013 morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could possibly go wrong?

But perhaps timelessness is the true measure of a great novel.

There have been repeated studies into the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/03/when-and-why-diversity-improves-your-boards-performance\">positive outcomes of diverse boards</a>, while the past three months have thrown into sharp relief the industries that actually are \u201cessential\u201d to society; industries <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-women-essential-workers.html\">traditionally described as \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019</a> such as health, education, retail and social work.</p> <p>In other words, our culture is beginning to recognise the fundamental role women play \u2013 and have always played \u2013 in modern life. In the world of sport, while women have been largely invisible in public-facing positions, they have nonetheless formed the backbone of the industry for generations, whether as athletes or as those who fed, clothed, drove, cleaned and cheered them from the sideline.</p> <p>It is these women that Australia\u2019s historic joint bid with New Zealand to host the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup acknowledges. That is why the presence of Johanna Wood, president of New Zealand Football and the only woman leader of any of the nominating bids, matters; by spotlighting the private contributions women have made to public life, the \u201cAs One\u201d bid embodies the shift that both the sporting and cultural world is currently experiencing.</p> <p>Of all four bids at the final stage \u2013 Brazil, Colombia, Japan, and Australia/New Zealand \u2013 it is the latter that embraces the momentum women\u2019s football in particular has generated in recent years; a momentum captured in the chants of \u201cequal pay\u201d that roared around the stadium during the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup final, and acted upon two months later when Fifa announced $1bn for women\u2019s football over the next four years.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than the game, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Wood tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s the legacy we can leave. We\u2019re modelling gender equality.</p> <p>\u201cNew Zealand was one of the first football member associations that gave pay parity to the Ferns \u2013 that was March of 2018 \u2013 followed by Australia in November, 2019. And in terms of gender equality, New Zealand has led the way for a century, because we were also the first country to give women the vote.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about football both on the pitch and off the pitch. Players are at the centre of our bid, but it\u2019s also about the leadership of the game, the governance of the game, the coaching of the game, the match officials, the administrators, the volunteers; there are a lot of women who\u2019ve given time to the game. So it\u2019s about creating that legacy and supporting and recognising women for what they do.\u201d</p> <p>In metaphorical terms, the joint-bid has taken on unexpected significance over the past three months. The international collaboration between the two nations\u2019 governments \u2013 particularly when it comes to travel arrangements for sporting teams \u2013 shows that As One isn\u2019t a superfluous catch-phrase. In a world that feels more fractured than ever, the appeal of such a sentiment strikes a much-needed tone; a reminder of the power of co-operation and togetherness.</p> <p>\u201cFifa is really big on collaboration,\u201d Wood says. \u201cSo here you\u2019ve got collaboration between nations and between confederations, which is huge. We all know that Covid-19 has had a huge impact on the world, so there will be information [in the pre-vote presentation] around how we manage Covid as two countries and as a region.</p> <p>\u201cBoth governments in Australia and New Zealand are committed to the bid. They see it as a ground-breaking tournament. In terms of the impact of Covid, the prospect of hosting the World Cup brings huge economic and social benefits, from employment to tourism. It\u2019s going to bring a positive to both communities across our countries.\u201d</p> <p>The Australian government agrees. In a statement, the federal minister for sport, Richard Colbeck, said: \u201cThe government [\u2026] recognises the significant additional benefits of hosting the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup \u2013 including improving attitudes towards gender equality in sport and strengthening Australia\u2019s reputation as a world leader in the promotion of women\u2019s sport and as a premier host of major international sporting events.</p> <p>\u201cThe government also acknowledges the important role sport, in particular major sporting events, will play in reactivating the Australian economy as we transition to a Covid-safe environment. We remain committed to bringing major sporting events to Australia and the economic benefits they bring with them.\u201d</p> <p>There is also a growing feeling the As One bid has moved into pole position after Japan was forced to delay the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 a decision with far heftier economic consequences for the country than can perhaps be appreciated at this stage \u2013 while Brazil and Colombia continue to see huge surges in coronavirus cases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/wsl-players-mentally-checked-out-want-season-end-agent-alan-naigeon-womens-football\">WSL players have mentally 'checked out' and want season to end, says agent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, even in the pre-pandemic world, none of these three bids emphasised the cultural shifts taking place in global football regarding gender equality.</p> <p>Over the past five years, the women\u2019s game has seen an unprecedented surge of interest and corporate investment, culminating in over one billion people watching the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup tournament.

  "<h2>NOTE TO SELF: MUST GET BLACKOUT BLIND</h2> \n<p>Frivolous sadness-related similes and metaphors are tough in a time of intense global misery. In many ways, The Fiver would suggest it\u2019s best to avoid them together. It\u2019s probably enough just to say something is sad rather than trying to find something of comparable sadness, especially if the level of sadness you are feeling really isn\u2019t very far up the sadness scale. For example, The Fiver ran out of ketchup while preparing a hot dog the other day, and had no choice but to continue with nothing but mustard. It was, as our empathetic reader will no doubt appreciate, an unhappy situation. I suppose you could say that we were approximately as sad as a dog that can\u2019t find its squeaky ball in the brief period before it is distracted by a squirrel, but unhappy would almost certainly do.</p> \n<p>Conjuring a perfect metaphor/simile is harder than a granite tank, particularly on the hoof. It\u2019s no coincidence that a list of the top 10 worst lyrics in the entire history of popular music compiled in 2007 featured \u201cmore sacrifices than an Aztec priest\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re about as easy as a nuclear war\u201d and \u201cslowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball\u201d. Similes might sound very clever in the author\u2019s head, but in fact many people find them less impressive than a really tired, wilted old flower from, like, a garage or something. And so to Luis Enrique, coach of Spain\u2019s national team, who recently went on a show about basketball to talk about football. The decision-making here already seems questionable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/20/atalanta-gian-piero-gasperini-serie-a\">Atalanta's Gian Piero Gasperini: 'Players who aren't used to working hard scare me'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It quickly became clear that the 50-year-old treats viruses with much the same disdain as he does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/27/luis-enrique-sacked-robert-moreno-spain-disloyal-no2-euro-2020\">a sometime assistant\u2019s coaching career</a>. \u201cI would have had no fear,\u201d he said, asked whether a slightly younger him would have been willing to throw himself back into pitch-based rough-and-tumble despite prevailing viral concerns. \u201cOn a personal level, I\u2019m not worried about the virus but aware that there could be an impact on older people and those susceptible to greater suffering.\u201d And what, he was asked, about the spectacle of elite football being played behind closed doors? \u201cIt\u2019s sadder than \u2026\u201d he began. Now, where is this sentence going? Because really it\u2019s not very sad at all, is it? It\u2019s far from ideal, to be sure, but we can probably stop there. But the sentence has been started and there\u2019s no backing down now. It\u2019s got to finish somehow. \u201cIt\u2019s sadder than dancing with your own sister,\u201d he sighed.</p> \n<p>And, well, this is true. It is sadder than dancing and families, and sadder than rainbows and butterflies and fluffy bunny rabbits and lambs frolicking in long green grass and ice cream and laughter. It is sadder, in short, than things that are not sad. Sure, one might prefer to have someone else to dance with, but your own sister will certainly do. Luis Enrique had successfully avoided idiocy, at the expense of producing a simile that was about as revealing as a blackout blind inside a sealed box, wrapped in thickly lined curtain. \u201cWe have to remember, I guess, that this is big business and I understand that with football back, it may serve as a way of helping people in dealing with confinement,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWatching football in these circumstances is certainly odd.\u201d Fair point. Add it to the list of certainly odd things we\u2019re doing at the moment. It\u2019s a long one, and growing by the hour.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cYou must grow and improve, day by day, because if you do not improve, you are done.

The overall mood could not be described as festive \u2013 apprehensive, more like. Is this really who we are? Or should that be, who we <em>were</em>? Thanks to Covid-19, The Uncertain Kingdom already has a time-capsule quality to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54ba6e230abe37db6bc1b9bf4267c8d255cb551a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54ba6e230abe37db6bc1b9bf4267c8d255cb551a/0_120_1997_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Jencks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Jencks: \u2018We need to do quite a lot of shouting. And a lot of sighing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The so-called Festival of Brexit (now scheduled for 2022), was the direct inspiration for The Uncertain Kingdom, explains its instigator, <a href=\"https://www.electricshadowcompany.com/people\">John Jencks</a>: \u201cI was in the bath listening to Radio 4. It was November 2018, and there was an announcement about a post-Brexit festival that would bring us all together again and make us feel so proud of being British. And I groaned .\u201d Like many Britons, Jencks, a producer and director best known for his film adaptation of Stephen Fry\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/01/the-hippopotamus-review-stephen-fry-novel-roger-allam\">The Hippopotamus</a>, was not convinced the time was yet ripe for \u201cbringing us all together\u201d. \u201cActually we needed to do quite a lot of shouting. And a lot of sighing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I thought the idea of a cultural response to this very febrile moment was utterly important.\u201d</p> <p>Jencks called on two producer colleagues, <a href=\"https://theuncertainkingdom.co.uk/the-team\">Georgia Goggin and Isabel Freer</a>, and they set up a fund to commission 20 shorts, with a budget of \u00a310,000 each. Some film-makers were invited directly, and there was an open call for proposals that received more than 1,100 applications. There were no rules, but each film had to \u201cmake an argument about Britain\u201d. The aim was less to present a coherent work than a diversity of perspectives. \u201cWe started to compare ourself with exhibitions, such as<a href=\"https://www.museumbookstore.com/blogs/blog/sensation-one-of-the-most-controversial-art-shows-of-all-time\"> Sensation</a>,\u201d says Jencks, citing the controversial 1997 British art show.</p> <p>The objective was not to provoke controversy per se, but seeing the results, and the conspicuous absence of flag-waving national pride, it is no great stretch to anticipate criticisms of \u201cdoing down Britain\u201d or pursuing a \u201clefty agenda\u201d. Britain\u2019s creative communities are generally progressive, and despite the producers\u2019 efforts to bring more right-leaning film-makers on board, political \u201cbalance\u201d was always going to be a challenge. \u201cThere are celebratory, joyous moments in a lot of the films. They\u2019re not uniformly negative,\u201d says Jencks. \u201cThey don\u2019t use the idea of Britishness as a punching bag. They are critical of Britain and our times and where we find ourselves, maybe because the idea of Britishness is so oblique.\u201d</p> <p>The Uncertain Kingdom might not use \u201cBritishness\u201d as a punch bag but it does literally use Cameron\u2019s head as one. The punching occurs in Strong Is Better Than Angry, directed by <a href=\"http://hopedicksonleach.com/\">Hope Dickson Leach</a> (best known for 2016 rural drama<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/14/the-levelling-review-mark-kermode-somerset-hope-dickson-leach\"> The Levelling</a>). It was a filmed at a women\u2019s kickboxing class in Edinburgh, where a diverse group talk about their anger, its causes \u2013 and who they\u2019d most like to punch. As well as Cameron, the list includes Donald Trump, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Brett Kavanaugh and Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/carrie-lam-blames-hong-kong-education-system-for-fuelling-protests\">Carrie Lam</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2d2c4523a277b2005dc52bd840970aca9aaf9600\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d2c4523a277b2005dc52bd840970aca9aaf9600/0_101_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hope Dickson Leach with the Cameron head on set of Strong Is Better Than Angry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Political punch bag: Hope Dickson Leach with the Cameron head on set of Strong Is Better Than Angry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director says she was kickboxing to deal with her own anger at the time. \u201cProfessional stuff, but also it was #MeToo, and watching the government flailing around with Brexit.\u201d Dickson Leach maintains that rather than condoning violence against public figures, her film is about \u201cpunching up\u201d. \u201cI sort of wanted it to be shocking that women had these violent fantasises that drove us,\u201d she says. \u201cAround #MeToo, there was a lot of conversation between women about how anger was disallowed. Cinema is a space for violence and fantasy, so I didn\u2019t want to hold back. In the end I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not going to be scared by this, and if there\u2019s public anger, then so be it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other films in The Uncertain Kingdom are less violent but no less direct in their criticism. Headline issues take on a personal dimension in short documentaries such as <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759049/\">Carol Salter</a>\u2019s Left Coast, on a Blackpool food bank, or <a href=\"https://www.ellen-evans.com/\">Ellen Evans</a>\u2019s Motherland, on victims of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/lambs-to-the-slaughter-50-lives-ruined-by-the-windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, black Britons recently deported to Jamaica. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really consider themselves anything but British,\u201d says Evans, who in a previous life was an immigration caseworker for an MP. \u201cTo be sent back to a place that the British state is deeming to be their home, but personally doesn\u2019t feel like it, is such a shocking thing.\u201d The uncertainty of the deportees\u2019 status could be seen as a mirror to Britain\u2019s uncertainty about its own identity. \u201cI was really interested in asking a question about what it means to be British, and more fundamentally, who gets to decide?\u201d</p> <p>The Uncertain Kingdom has its lighter moments. In Verisimilitude, an actor in a wheelchair rankles at being a \u201cdisability consultant\u201d to a narcissistic, able-bodied star. In Swan, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004692/\">Mark Addy </a>plays a man preparing for a new, elite tier of British citizenship which involves being transformed into a swan. And in The Conversation, communication difficulties between a young black man and his white partner are expressed in the form of an intense, physical dance routine. \u201cThere are visceral feelings we all share but can\u2019t put into words,\u201d says film-maker <a href=\"https://www.lanremalaolu.com/\">Lanre Malaolu</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd1dad1f9d00c085593f2fe01096f9e571577b85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd1dad1f9d00c085593f2fe01096f9e571577b85/53_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lanre Malaolu\u2019s short The Conversation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Communication difficulties in Lanre Malaolu\u2019s short The Conversation, starring Onyemachi Ejimofor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent events have given some of the films an unintended resonance. In Death Meets Lisolette, a young girl in a seaside town finds Death (played by Outnumbered\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/16/hugh-dennis-my-family-values\">Hugh Dennis</a>) locked in a barn. Her grandmother has early-onset dementia and is looking for a way to end her life, so the girl makes a deal. What was intended as a gentle comedy, now feeds into a national reassessment of attitudes to mortality and the elderly. The film\u2019s images of a Grim Reaper stalking the beaches, scythe in hand, chime uncannily with recent news footage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/florida-grim-reaper-beach-interview\">a campaigner who did exactly the same thing in protest at the premature reopening of beaches in Florida</a>.</p> <p>With Britain effectively on pause, these films give us a snapshot of the country as it was, and ask whether it\u2019s one we really want to return to. \u201cWhen I think about the individual ideas in the films, none of them have gone away,\u201d says Jencks. \u201cThey\u2019re all going to be waiting for us once we get out of the world we currently we find ourselves in \u2013 or they have been exacerbated by it, like isolation and loneliness, for example.\u201d</p> <p>The Uncertain Kingdom initiative has recently commissioned a 21st film, says Jencks, to be made under lockdown conditions. The original intention was to hold community screenings showing four or five of the most relevant films, followed by audience discussion. Jencks hopes that can still happen. \u201cA little bit of bloodletting and shouting might let us get to a point where we <em>could</em> have a post-Brexit festival of Britain. I\u2019m not against that, except if it is being used to paper over cracks or stuff a sock down someone\u2019s throat. There are loads of brilliant things about this country and they should be celebrated, but we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://theuncertainkingdom.co.uk/\">The Uncertain Kingdom is out 1 June</a> on BFI Player, Curzon Home Cinema, iTunes, GooglePlay and more</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>When the coronavirus struck, the British government repeatedly said it was among the best-prepared countries in the world \u2013 with some justification. As recently as October, an <a href=\"https://www.ghsindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2019-Global-Health-Security-Index.pdf\">international review </a>of pandemic planning ranked the UK the second best prepared country in the world (behind the US). </p> \n<p>Two months on, any breezy confidence has evaporated. The government is facing growing complaints over a series of policy missteps that critics say are responsible for the worst death toll in Europe. </p> \n<p>How did a country that supposedly had one of the best pandemic plans in the world end up suffering one of the worst outbreaks? </p> \n<p>A review of official documents and interviews with politicians, national security advisers and experts in risk management suggests one answer may be that ministers stuck closely to the recommendations of a well-honed plan for a different disease: the flu.</p> \n<p>The origin of the UK\u2019s strategy for a catastrophic influenza pandemic was a tractor blockade at a Cheshire oil refinery in September 2000. Several dozen farmers, angry about the cost of fuel, blockaded the Stanlow oil refinery and refused to leave until the Labour government agreed to a reduction in duty.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d231d924e0259c86d1b175293dc68384f968eb75\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d231d924e0259c86d1b175293dc68384f968eb75/0_37_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmers with a tractor blockade the Stanlow oil refinery in 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2000 refinery blockade led civil servants to fear that civil emergencies could bring down a country.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The blockade began on a Friday. By Wednesday, the UK was on the brink of collapse. Copycat groups <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/921903.stm\">obstructed other fuel depots</a>. Enormous tailbacks of panic-buying motorists stretched out of petrol stations and down motorways. Fire engines and ambulances were days away from running dry, and NHS trusts faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/14/tonyblair.oil\">cancelling elective surgeries</a>. One supermarket started rationing.</p> \n<p>The protests ended and ministers later agreed to freeze fuel duty. But according to politicians and civil servants in government at that time, the shock of the fuel crisis sparked a realisation at the highest levels of Whitehall that civil emergencies could bring down a country.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor a few days, a few hundred protesting people outside fuel depots brought the country to a halt,\u201d said Sir Peter Ricketts, a diplomat and later David Cameron\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cThe shock of suddenly finding the country stopped because of a few fuel depots being blockaded was a real wake-up call.\u201d</p> \n<p>Within just the following year, the UK suffered more fuel protests, floods, foot-and-mouth disease, and the aftermath of September 11. Tony Blair\u2019s government decided a completely new approach to civil emergencies was required, and established a revised and expanded civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, backed by new legislation.</p> \n<p>The ambition was \u201cto create something which was better suited to the way in which the UK is run\u201d, said Bruce Mann, the director of the unit from 2004 to 2010. Civil contingency planning would cascade downwards through tiers of government, he said, all the way from Whitehall to networks of local emergency response groups.</p> \n<p>Mann\u2019s unit dealt with a \u201crelentless\u201d series of civil emergencies during his six years in charge, including periodic outbreaks of infectious disease, endless fuel supply crises including the explosion at the Buncefield fuel refinery, bird flu scares, and the aftermath of terrorist atrocities both domestic and overseas, including the 7 July 2005 bombings.</p> \n<p>But the team also had a second responsibility: predicting entirely new risks and anticipating how the government might respond. Within its first year the unit drew up the national risk register, a comprehensive catalogue of all the civil emergencies that could conceivably strike the UK, which continues to be updated annually. At the top of the list \u2013 then and now \u2013 was an influenza pandemic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/the-wrong-kind-of-government-to-deal-with-a-pandemic\">The wrong kind of government to deal with a pandemic | Letter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Early versions of the register now read as eerily prescient. \u201cIn addition to the severe health effects, a pandemic is also likely to cause significant wider social and economic damage and disruption,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61934/national_risk_register.pdf\">stated the 2008 register</a>. \u201cNormal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, shortages and distribution difficulties.\u201d Deaths would range from 50,000 to 750,000.</p> \n<p>\u201cPandemic influenza has been one of the top risks in the risk register for a long time,\u201d said Miles Elsden, a mathematician and former government scientist who specialises in contingency planning. Elsden helped coordinate meetings of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. \u201cEverybody had been expecting something to come along,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reasonable worst-case scenario that was the basis for most of the planning was Spanish influenza,\u201d he added, referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">the 1918 flu pandemic</a> that killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide.</p> \n<p>Prof Lindsey Davies, a public health doctor, was brought in as the UK\u2019s first national director of pandemic influenza preparedness in 2006. Having been handed the \u201cfairly skeletal\u201d existing plan, Davies began battling for additional resources. To get them, she would need to force ministers to realise the potential scale of a pandemic crisis. Together with Mann she coordinated the first major nationwide simulation of a flu pandemic in 2007, codenamed <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/132988/winter_willow_lessons.pdf\">Winter Willow</a>.</p> \n<p>One question surrounding the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus is whether it implemented recommendations from a second, 2016 flu pandemic simulation, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">The report, which was leaked to the Guardian</a>, made several recommendations that appear to have been overlooked.</p> \n<p>But Winter Willow was the far larger exercise. Where Cygnus involved 950 people, Winter Willow marshalled more than 5,000 people, including government ministers, civil servants, emergency planners, NHS staff, and emergency services personnel to coordinate the first real attempt to test how the UK would hold up under the strain of a pandemic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The result was transformative. \u201cThat was absolutely a turning point for us, because people at that stage realised what [a flu pandemic] could do,\u201d Davies said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t exaggerate it at all; if anything we underplayed it. We had a sort of moderate pandemic scenario, rather than the worst-case one. But even then,\u201d she added, \u201cwe ran out of face masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as pinpointing holes in the planning, Winter Willow galvanised ministers into taking the threat of a pandemic seriously. \u201cMinisters, when they were faced with the reality of it, suddenly realised that this actually could be disastrous,\u201d Davies added.</p> \n<p>Several changes of government later, and after a decade of austerity, pandemic planning appears to have slowly dropped off the radar.

The emergency pandemic stockpile contains millions of doses of Tamiflu and Relenza to help alleviate the worst of the symptoms for anyone catching the new flu disease, and a National Flu Pandemic Service would distribute them. Stockpiles of existing flu vaccines that might be effective against the new strain would be distributed to inoculate health workers, while contingency contracts with pharmaceutical companies would be spun up to manufacture more flu drugs.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s most recent national security risk assessment, compiled last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/preparing-for-pandemic-national-security-risk-assessment-coronavirus\">predicted a potential catastrophe</a> in the event of a flu pandemic: trillions of pounds in damages, deaths in the five figures, disruption lasting for months. </p> \n<p>However, the risk assessment\u2019s prediction for the potential impact of a new disease like a coronavirus was staggeringly off target. The worst-case scenario for a novel infectious disease in the UK, the government\u2019s risk assessment said, \u201ccould be on the scale of <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/6458609/looking-back-toronto-sars-outbreak/\">the </a><a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/6458609/looking-back-toronto-sars-outbreak/\">Sars outbreak in Toronto, Canada</a>\u201d, which involved 438 probable and suspected cases and 44 deaths. Economic damage would be limited to a few billion pounds, mostly from nervous tourists staying away.</p> \n<p>The British government\u2019s focus on flu, and the failure to look at how Asian countries were responding to the coronavirus, was recently described by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt as \u201cone of the biggest failures of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetimes\u201d. \u201cIt is now clear that a major blind spot in the approach taken in Europe and America was our focus on pandemic flu rather than pandemic coronaviruses, such as Sars or Mers,\u201d he told parliament.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16737aed75da4f87593c635fba3ad43eab97afc6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16737aed75da4f87593c635fba3ad43eab97afc6/0_171_3150_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A postman delivers swine flu leaflets in Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Almost every major UK disease outbreak in the last 100 years has been some form of flu.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The extent to which Boris Johnson\u2019s government stuck to a protocol laid out in its flu pandemic plans is made clear by reviewing the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\">2011 strategy for responding to a flu pandemic</a> (the most recent published version available). It reads like an extraordinarily precise description of the steps the UK government did (and did not) take in its initial response to Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Mass gatherings such as football matches and live music events would continue, in part to \u201chelp maintain public morale\u201d. There would be no quarantining of international arrivals at airports, though passengers would be encouraged to report any symptoms upon arrival. Face masks would not be recommended for use by the public. There is no mention whatsoever of healthy people being confined to their homes in an attempt to prevent transmission.</p> \n<p>Perhaps most striking is that the decision to wind down contact tracing on 12 March, widely viewed as an error that has hamstrung the UK\u2019s ability to fight back against the coronavirus, is also alluded to in the government\u2019s flu pandemic strategy.</p> \n<p>Its first \u201cdetection and assessment\u201d phase ( seemingly an analogue for the \u201ccontain\u201d phase of the coronavirus response) describes how the focus would shift away from \u201cactively finding\u201d and isolating confirmed and suspected cases, and instead turn to treatment of the disease once there was \u201cevidence of sustained community transmission of the virus\u201d. It even anticipates that detection and assessment could itself be a \u201crelatively short\u201d phase, depending on the circumstances.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The flu strategy bluntly concludes: \u201cIt will not be possible to halt the spread of a new pandemic influenza virus, and it would be a waste of public health resources and capacity to attempt to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is one obvious but important reason why the UK may have focused its attention so much on planning for influenza: following Spanish flu in 1918, subsequent pandemics included Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1967, and swine flu in 2009. Barring HIV/Aids, almost every significant disease outbreak for the past hundred years has been some form of flu.</p> \n<p>A Department of Health spokesperson acknowledged that several steps taken by the government resemble those set out in the strategy, but cautioned against interpreting this as the result of some blinkered focus on the document. While useful, they stressed, the strategy would have been only one of several elements considered by government scientific advisers, alongside emerging data from Wuhan as well as new research into the nature of the virus.</p> \n<p>They added that contact tracing did not stop when Britain moved to the delay phase, but was instead focused on specific settings at risk of infection such as residential care homes. \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice,\u201d they said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof David Tuckett, an expert in decision-making under uncertainty who runs a research group called <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/clinical-educational-and-health-psychology/research-groups/centre-decision-making-uncertainty/cruisse\">CRUISSE</a> at University College London exploring how organisations can respond to \u201cradical uncertainty\u201d, has some sympathy for ministers. It would be natural for ministers to turn to their flu pandemic plan, he said, because it was the only one they had \u2013 but that can be precisely the peril of placing assumptions into the core of your plan.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have a model based on your central case, and you have a whole set of useful things you\u2019ve learned from some exercise or other,\u201d Tuckett said.

You can tell as much, just from a cursory spin \u2013 if it is possible to give a cursory spin to something that\u2019s 22 tracks long and lasts 80 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05ab6727b9d56f60c3f73490cce64629aa5633d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05ab6727b9d56f60c3f73490cce64629aa5633d9/0_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1975: Notes on a Conditional Form album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1975: Notes on a Conditional Form album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first thing you hear is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/time-to-rebel-greta-thunberg-makes-musical-debut-on-the-1975-track\">an ambient instrumental backing a lengthy speech</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a>. That\u2019s followed by a yowly punk track, a burst of post-dubstep experimentation, a mainstream pop song, a bit of Radiohead-circa-Kid-A meandering, a song that sounds like Teenage Fanclub, a melancholy acoustic ballad that might have been made for the soundtrack of a quirky indie romcom, something that recalls the more commercial end of baggy-era alt-rock, Radio 1-friendly faux-gospel-infused piano balladry and a guest appearance from FKA twigs. As you reach the hour mark, and they keep piling on the musical styles \u2013 sax-solo-assisted 80s MTV rock, a house tune featuring dancehall star Cutty Ranks \u2013 the experience feels less like listening to an album than randomly flicking through Spotify. You start to think: God, what next? Technical death metal? Something that sounds like Bucks Fizz? The pipes and drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards?</p> <p>Of course, eclecticism is part of the 1975\u2019s appeal. They started life as the kind of slick alt-rock band that even the NME hated: one reason they\u2019ve vastly outstripped their peers in that musical area is their understanding that we live in an age when generic boundaries and tribal loyalties have collapsed. If everyone likes a bit of everything, why not try and reflect that? This concept has served them well in the past, but their fourth album feels stretched to an incoherent breaking point.</p> <p>Randomly flicking through Spotify is bound to throw up some duds, and so it proves. There are fantastic songs on Notes on a Conditional Form, where their melodic deftness shines or their desire to experiment yields dividends: Then Because She Goes is beautiful; If You\u2019re Too Shy (Let Me Know) and Me &amp; You Together Song are gleaming examples of the 1975\u2019s way with a straightforward pop song; Bagsy Not in Net\u2019s combination of high-drama orchestration and UK garage-influenced rhythm really works, and Guys is an authentically touching depiction of the band\u2019s formative years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do7B74dyEVs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Do7B74dyEVs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But it\u2019s easy to lose them amid the inconsequential instrumental interludes, the stuff that sounds like throwing ideas at a wall in the hope they stick, or that\u2019s allowed to ramble on past its sell-by: as Yeah I Know or Having No Head amble along, it\u2019s hard not to notice that once the band start fiddling with tech, they tend to forget about writing tunes. You end up applauding their diversity while wishing they\u2019d been a bit more stringent with the blue pencil.</p> <p>The lyrics, too, are a mixed bag. Matty Healy has a good handle on the complexities and contradictions of millennial life, he\u2019s empathetic \u2013 take Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America\u2019s sweet, sad vignettes of closeted gay suburban teens \u2013 and he\u2019s frequently funny: hearing a celebrity ex\u2019s song on the radio leads him to protest \u201cthey\u2019re mugging me off across a nation\u201d. But he\u2019s also rather too self-conscious in his desire to be the Voice of a Generation: the distorted blast of People is authentically bracing, but the lyrics keep addressing \u201cthe kids\u201d, something it\u2019s hard to do without sounding like Rik Mayall favouring the rest of the Young Ones with one of his poems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/16/the-1975-matty-healy-im-not-an-avocado-not-everyone-thinks-im-amazing\">Matty Healy: \u2018I\u2019m not an avocado \u2013 not everyone thinks I\u2019m amazing\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similarly, Healy\u2019s penchant for painful honesty frequently shades into updates on his inability to keep it in his pants that sound perilously close to humble-bragging, and there\u2019s a lot of ponderous self-examination regarding the downsides of rock stardom. In fairness, he seems aware that ponderous self-examination regarding the downsides of stardom is seldom a vote-winner \u2013 \u201chave a complain about your fame,\u201d he sniffs at persons unknown, on Tonight (I Wish I Was Your Boy) \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t stop him doing it. It\u2019s a sympathetic soul indeed who hears the opening lines of Playing on My Mind (\u201cWill I live and die in a band? / My consciousness controls my hand\u201d) without an involuntary roll of their eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0o5xjCboti8vXhdoUG9LYi?si=HGp2JJeoRrGzkcVJ2OGV9A\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0o5xjCboti8vXhdoUG9LYi\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>To all of which, the 1975 might reasonably respond: that\u2019s the point, stupid. They obviously want to be a band that reflects their era. Oversharing, the humblebrag, a surfeit of ponderous self-examination and a self-consciousness that comes from feeling as if you\u2019re always being watched and judged on social media are all \u2013 like the aforementioned collapse of music\u2019s generic boundaries and the confusion of abundance with quality \u2013 hallmarks of modern-day life. It makes Notes on a Conditional Form a curious thing, an album whose flaws are inherent in what it sets out to do: music for the no-filter generation, with all the good and bad that entails.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVuHLPBlwd8\">Collard: F</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVuHLPBlwd8\">avour</a></strong><br>Sumptuous, super-soft street soul - if that isn\u2019t a contradiction in terms \u2013 that might have been designed to soothe the lockdown-fevered brain.</p>",

The two forms of the drug, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause abnormal heart rhythms, which could be of additional concern in somebody who is overweight.</p> \n<p>But preventive measures against infection are urgently needed for health and care workers on the frontline and with no vaccine expected anytime soon, a major trial has begun, aiming to test the protective effect \u2013 if any \u2013 in 40,000 health workers. Brighton and Sussex University hospitals and the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford have begun enrolling volunteers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The study is being led by the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/thailand\">Thailand</a>, which is supported by the University of Oxford and Wellcome Trust. The drug has been widely used in Thailand in the past to treat malaria. Participants will be recruited from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.</p> \n<p>\u201cCovid-19 is a major risk for frontline healthcare workers around the world,\u201d said Prof Sir Nicholas White of the University of Oxford, who is based in Bangkok and is joint leader of the trial, called Copcov.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe really do not know if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are beneficial or harmful against Covid-19. The best way to find out if they are effective in preventing Covid-19 is in a randomised clinical trial. That\u2019s what Copcov is \u2013 and why we\u2019re doing this study.\u201d</p> \n<p>His co-investigator, Prof Martin Llewelyn at Brighton and Sussex medical school, added: \u201cEven though the lockdown has brought the rate of infection right down in the UK, healthcare workers will continue to be at risk of Covid-19, especially as measures are relaxed. A widely available, safe and effective vaccine may be a long way off. If drugs as well tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19 this would be incredibly valuable.\u201d </p> \n<p>Hospitals are setting up to join the trial in Thailand and south-east Asia, Italy, Portugal, Africa and South America. However, the welcome drop in the number of cases in many countries will make all ongoing trials in drugs and vaccines a slower process, as fewer health workers are infected or protected.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Health workers who take part will be randomly allocated either the trial drug or a placebo. In Asia, the trial drug will be chloroquine and in Europe and Africa it will be hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been used for treating malaria for more than 60 years and are generally regarded as very safe drugs. Until recently 300m chloroquine treatments were given for malaria every year \u2013 it is less used now because of resistance and the development of artemisinin drugs.</p> \n<p>Side-effects are usually mild and include stomach upset and nausea, headache and temporary blurring of vision, but too high a dose can be dangerous and lead to death. There is concern that the drugs can prolong the electrocardiogram QT interval, causing an irregular heart rhythm. People who already take other drugs that could cause this side-effect should be careful, <a href=\"https://www.tropmedres.ac/covid-19/copcov/copcov-key-messages\">say the scientists on their trial website</a>, \u201cbut for healthy people who are not taking regular medications which prolong the QT interval, there should be no concerns about cardiotoxicity\u201d.</p>",

She was aghast at the news that his son was now coordinating the government\u2019s response to victims.</p> <p>\u201cThey have no right to play with the memory of all those that Jorge 40 has murdered, tortured, disappeared and displaced,\u201d said Jim\u00e9nez. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive, it\u2019s insensitive and it\u2019s plain wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Her sentiments were echoed by Luz Marina Hache, the spokeswoman for <a href=\"https://movimientodevictimas.org/en/\">Movice</a>, a group representing victims of crimes committed by state agents.</p> <p>\u201cWhat justice can victims hope for with this announcement?\u201d Hache asked.</p> <p>The conflict between the Colombian state and leftist rebel groups including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc) left 260,000 dead and displaced over 7 million. State-aligned paramilitary groups, like the one led by Jorge 40, committed some of the bloodiest atrocities of the 52-year civil war.</p> <p>In 2004, Jorge 40 participated in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/14/colombia.sibyllabrodzinsky\">controversial demobili</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/14/colombia.sibyllabrodzinsky\">sation programme</a> and confessed to about 600 crimes, though he took no blame for any murders.

  "<p>There\u2019s a place at the University of Utah where 450 entrepreneurs, from freshmen through to graduates, are trying to start companies. \u201cIt\u2019s the most vibrant, energetic space on campus,\u201d says Cory Stokes, chief digital learning officer at the university. \u201cWalk in on any day and you will see students prototyping apps, creating logos or marketing materials for all kinds of startups, from bioscience to outdoor recreation to health technology.\u201d</p> <p>These are students who\u2019d probably succeed regardless, but their chances are boosted by digital tools which allow their creativity to blossom.</p> <p>Seven years ago the University of Utah pioneered a new digital-centric approach that, to the traditionally change-resistant higher education sector, may have seemed risky. It wanted to teach its students how to use a raft of tools for creating videos, websites, apps, infographics and more, but unlike most institutes that teach these programs only to certain student groups \u2013 such as entrepreneurs \u2013 Utah rolled this out for all of its students. Student retention has risen by 13% over a decade, staff are on board and employers are happy to hire emerging graduates. These former students also do well in the thriving tech scene locally, where there are at least four tech firms valued in billions of dollars: Qualtrics, Domo, InsideSales and Pluralsight.</p> <p><strong>How has the university done it?<br></strong>This has been achieved partly by working closely with experts from Adobe, and incorporating Adobe Creative Cloud and all its applications and services into the curricula. University leaders were intrigued \u2013 would the ability to use Photoshop, for example, allow students to create work in different ways? And would this use of technology be genuinely engaging and inspiring? Utah answered with a resounding yes, going on to join the Adobe Creative Campus programme, which includes some 30 global universities that all believe digital literacy has a place in higher education and are keen to tell others how they\u2019ve done it.</p> <p>This is about more than software, says Sebastian Distefano who\u2019s responsible for developing Adobe\u2019s global strategy for higher education and has worked closely with Utah\u2019s team. \u201cWe discovered our Creative Cloud tools can really impact teaching and learning beyond areas where there\u2019s an obvious fit,\u201d he says. \u201cOur partnership with the University of Utah helped us understand what is valuable and how to make it successful.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What can students do?<br></strong>Using tools from Creative Cloud such as Illustrator (graphics design) and Premiere Pro (video creation), students might create a podcast or put together a documentary, rather than submit several thousand words of an assignment. History students might publish a magazine exploring events, biologists might create an infographic to explain a public health matter or chemists might design an app teaching chemical principles with a game. In doing so, learning is enhanced, says Stokes. Students acquire visual, audio and narrative skills prized by employers. \u201cStorytelling is in our nature as human beings,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a way to get students thinking about deeper concepts and how to express them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fb457d0df00e4644eea332b04f47f89ad8a2c2e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb457d0df00e4644eea332b04f47f89ad8a2c2e1/0_177_5304_6630/800.jpg\" alt=\"The University of Utah, which has pioneered a new digital-centric approach to learning.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The University of Utah, which has pioneered a new digital-centric approach to learning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Titensor/Image courtesy of the University of Utah</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While creative students might take to these like a duck to water, it\u2019s new ground for many engineers, scientists and humanities students. \u201cMost of these students have never used a creative tool in their lives \u2013 they\u2019re used to being in a lab,\u201d says Stokes. \u201cBut they find they can communicate their passion for a subject, or explain research that appears unapproachable.\u201d In future work, they\u2019ll be equipped to communicate complex ideas and win over audiences, an essential skill in today\u2019s society, he says.</p> <p>The work students produce reflects a rich learning experience, says Stokes. To create a podcast, video or visual story, a student will have to distil the fundamental knowledge, analyse and evaluate it and think how best to communicate it and reflect upon it \u2013 all key pedagogical goals. \u201cWhen they graduate they can show skills that differentiate themselves from others, and that\u2019s really powerful. That\u2019s what universities are about.\u201d</p> <p>And graduates also emerge with a portfolio of digital artefacts \u2013 which is better, says Distefano, than reams of written work that may never see the light of day. \u201cThey are shareable, accessible in perpetuity.\u201d</p> <p>As a large employer, Adobe knows how difficult it is to find \u201cwork-ready\u201d graduates regardless of their academic prowess. <a href=\"https://campusadobe.com/jobskills/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research by Adobe</a>, looking at millions of job advertisements and CVs, shows that soft skills are critical to hiring managers and individuals with these qualities can be hard to find. Digital literacy \u2013 the ability to use digital tools to solve problems \u2013 nurtures better communication, critical thinking and collaboration \u2013 the \u201csoft\u201d skills identified by the World Economic Forum as critical for the future.</p> <p>But as Stokes is well aware, asking dyed-in-the-wool academics to change their teaching and curricula is fraught with problems. \u201cAcademics don\u2019t want to appear unprofessional in front of students,\u201d he says. But there\u2019s a misconception that they can\u2019t teach with technology unless they have completely mastered it \u2013 which is false. \u201cSome systems such as Adobe Spark are so approachable you can get going with just a 20-minute consultation,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then many gravitate towards more complex tools.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tomorrows-campus-today/2020/may/21/digital-literacy-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter\">Digital literacy: what is it, and why does it matter?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adobe has also been on hand to walk faculties through unknown territory, says Distefano. Staff can also benefit from wisdom shared by other universities and individual members of Adobe\u2019s digital literacy thought leaders, who share examples of how they\u2019ve integrated Creative Cloud into their assignments. \u201cOur partnership is about supporting those initiatives at uni \u2013 we don\u2019t just drop the software and run. We can show them how tools could help in teaching or adapting the curriculum,\u201d says Distefano.</p> <p>And the University of Utah has just trained up 10 tech student ambassadors who will help educate students and academics about what\u2019s possible with creative digital tools. There\u2019s a business case for revamping the university\u2019s digital offering too, says Stokes \u2013 with more students staying the course; \u201cand our transformation of pedagogy via Adobe is a big part of that\u201d. More engaged students, adept in digital tools, will eventually return to the university as academics equipped with digital expertise \u2013 a virtuous circle, he says.</p> <p>\u201cI think educators have to follow the same advice I give to students,\u201d says Courtney Miller, a US academic who now works within education strategy at Adobe. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to take risks, play and have fun.

  "<p>With campuses closed through Covid-19, and teaching and exams shifted online to protect student and staff welfare, digital literacy has never looked more important.</p> <p>But digital literacy is not, as many understand it, simply the ability to use a computer. Loosely defined,<strong> </strong>it\u2019s an umbrella term for a range of competencies, such as coding, internet and computer mastery, that are used to locate, assess, create and communicate information.</p> <p>And it\u2019s critical to the career success and learning outcomes of students in every discipline.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere\u2019s no institution that has not been profoundly impacted by digital technology,\u201d says Todd Taylor, an Adobe pedagogical evangelist and Eliason distinguished professor of English at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. \u201cWhether you\u2019re studying science or social science, you need digital literacy to contribute as a worker in the current digital economy.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor says digital literacy goes way beyond mastering the basic functionality of digital tools;<strong> </strong>it involves understanding the process behind the task and<strong> </strong>adapting that knowledge and skills to other technology platforms.<strong> </strong>Many knowledge workers create and disseminate content via a multitude of modalities <strong>\u2013 </strong>videos, podcasts, mobile apps and more.</p> <p>This requires \u201chard\u201d technical and \u201csoft\u201d cognitive skills.<strong> </strong>The specific mixture differs between jobs,<strong> </strong>but most occupations demand a degree of digital literacy, says Taylor.<strong> </strong>An artist creating an exhibition poster via Adobe InDesign won\u2019t need to code, for example,<strong> </strong>but needs to be proficient in the software,<strong> </strong>and understand their genre, content and design elements such as typography.</p> <p>Technology is not just transforming the way we work;<strong> </strong>it\u2019s changing how we teach and learn. From video lectures to virtual collaboration software, higher education is being digitised, and the Covid-19 outbreak has only hastened this process.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the next iteration of teaching, and digital literacy is central to success in the classroom,\u201d<strong> </strong>says Sid Dobrin, chair of the English department at the University of Florida and director of the Trace Innovation Initiative.</p> <p>Current students grew up with Google. Their comfort with technology is off the charts. But digital literacy is<strong> </strong>\u201cabout moving them away from being passive, disconnected consumers of content to becoming active, connected, content creators\u201d, says Taylor.</p> <p>Higher education must evolve too, so students can function fully in a digital society.<strong> </strong>Some 30 higher education institutions<strong> </strong>in the US<strong> </strong>have joined Adobe\u2019s Creative Campus programme, a powerful peer network for sharing ideas.</p> <p>They aim to foster digital literacy using the<strong> </strong>Creative Cloud platform,<strong> </strong>a suite of digital apps and services that can be embedded into every syllabus.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s the gold standard,\u201d says<strong> </strong>Taylor.<strong> </strong>\u201cThere\u2019s an app for every stage of learning,<strong> </strong>from Spark for beginners<strong> </strong>to Premiere Pro, which is used to edit some Hollywood films.\u201d</p> <p>Working with such tools can nurture some of the most sought-after soft skills in graduates, such as critical thinking and creative problem-solving abilities.<strong> </strong>The process of creation is inherently collaborative and, editing a video, for instance, often involves thinking critically about how to creatively present and convey information.</p> <p>During this process, students also learn how to share their work with wider audiences online, creating digital portfolios that may help in landing a job.</p> <p>Employers are crying out for these skills, in part because they cannot easily be replicated by a robot and may separate humans from machines.<strong> </strong>Artificial intelligence, for example, could sound the death knell for scores of jobs, perhaps whole occupations.</p> <p>Mastering novel software in a continuous way can stand students in good stead for the seismic workplace change that\u2019s coming, says Taylor.<strong> </strong>\u201cIntellectual agility will make students robot-proof.\u201d<strong> </strong>Adaptability is also vital because \u201cmany of the jobs students will occupy 10 years from now do not even exist today\u201d, he says.</p> <p>While digital literacy can (happily) be nurtured, evaluating it is much more difficult.<strong> </strong>Taylor says it\u2019s relatively easy to measure functional IT skills \u2013 whether one can create a spreadsheet or edit a word processing document \u2013 but digital literacy involves higher-order cognitive skills,<strong> </strong>which are complex and nuanced.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s also hard to control for other variables.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tomorrows-campus-today/2020/may/21/artificial-intelligence-why-students-need-to-learn-digital-skills-to-compete\">Artificial intelligence: why students need to learn digital skills to compete</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So there are no consistent and comparable metrics for measuring digital literacy,<strong> </strong>which reflects the lack of a commonly agreed definition, says Dobrin. He adds, however, that a broader array of modalities used to create and circulate content can suggest a higher degree of digital literacy at a macro level \u2013 among an entire class, department or university.</p> <p>An individual student, meanwhile, may be digitally literate if they can explain the reason behind their choices in creating and communicating content.<strong> </strong>\u201cIf they understand why they make decisions, they can adapt and improve them,\u201d Dobrin says.</p> <p>For him, the bigger concern is the digital literacy of teachers: the older among them learned at school through chalkboards rather than computers.<strong> </strong>\u201cI have faculty members who refuse to even own a smartphone,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In a 2018 <a href=\"http://cps.adobeeducate.com/GlobalStudy\" rel=\"nofollow\">global survey</a> by Adobe,<strong> </strong>55% and 58% of educators said they don\u2019t have access to the training and tools they need, respectively, to nurture creative problem solving in students.</p> <p>The Adobe Creative Campus programme is a potential solution to these challenges, since Adobe offers skills workshops for teachers to help raise their own digital literacy and that of their students.</p> <p>Given the vast benefits of doing this, Taylor expects uptake of the programme to increase, and the focus on digital literacy to endure long after the Covid-19 crisis abates.<strong> </strong>He adds that the traditional definition of literacy \u2013 the ability to read and write \u2013 is in need of updating: \u201cSoon, we won\u2019t need to prefix digital to literacy: to be literate will mean having mastered technology.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>If you\u2019re looking for a definitive Dalai Lama documentary, this narrow-focus film about his lifelong passion for science probably won\u2019t cut it. Directed by Dawn Gifford Engle, it zips through the biographical basics: how a search party of monks arrived at his family farm when he was toddler and identified him as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama, his boyhood in a monastery and escape on horseback from Chinese-occupied Tibet in 1959. As a boy he spent hours taking things apart and putting them back together; he might have become an engineer or electrician, he says. And it\u2019s his conversations with scientists that form the bulk of the film.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNH0VYfzM8c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yNH0VYfzM8c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Since the late 1980s, he has held more or less annual audiences with distinguished scientists \u2013 his own personal Reith Lectures. The archive shows what a natural he is in these conversations, charismatic and with an extraordinary gift for establishing intimacy: all undivided attention, a penetrating question here, a wry, twinkly eyed quip there. The American psychologist Paul Ekman, a secularist who walks in sceptical and convinced that Buddhism is a new age fad, walks out a Dalai Lama convert.</p> <p>I\u2019m not certain that the film takes science as seriously as His Holiness (the gratingly inspirational narration doesn\u2019t help). The structure is divided into five sections focusing on different branches of science; each ends with an irrelevant graphic setting out the overlap between scientific thinking and Buddhist teaching. The Dalai Lama\u2019s deepest connections seem to be with psychologists and neuroscientists; he cheekily jokes to the father of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/07/therapy-wars-revenge-of-freud-cognitive-behavioural-therapy\">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>, psychiatrist Aaron Beck, that the Buddhists got there first with CBT \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s analytical meditation!\u201d Watching the documentary, I kept expecting Stephen Hawking to pop up \u2013 can it be that these two rock-star global treasures never met?</p> <ul> <li><p>The Dalai Lama: Scientist is available on digital platforms from 26 May.</p></li> </ul>",

Students often collaborate and solve problems too.</p> <p>\u201cThis has transformed learning for many of our students,\u201d says Vito. Her university has joined the Adobe Creative Campus programme,<strong> </strong>which makes their collaborative software such as Photoshop (image editing) and Audition (audio editing) available to students from every academic discipline, not just overtly creative subjects such as<strong> </strong>design, but business and medicine.</p> <p>\u201cHaving used Adobe Creative Cloud, they are more creative, approach problems from different perspectives, and can communicate more confidently in new and more powerful ways,\u201d<strong> </strong>she says.</p> <p>However, higher education could do more to provide students with these paramount skills.<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://cps.adobeeducate.com/GlobalStudy\" rel=\"nofollow\">In a poll</a> for Adobe,<strong> </strong>69% of educators said the syllabus does not focus enough on creative problem solving, for example.<strong> </strong>Respondents cited scarcity of time, training and software as being among the key barriers to greater adoption. As such, Adobe offers skills workshops for teachers, helping them deliver these vital pieces of learning.</p> <p>A myriad of higher education institutions have joined the programme,<strong> </strong>recognising that many students learn best by doing, reflecting their comfort with technology. As a result, they may be more engaged and learning outcomes can improve, while students acquire skills for the future of work and create digital portfolios to help in getting hired.</p> <p>Despite the jobs shake-up foretold by economists, a <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/AI-will-create-as-many-jobs-as-it-displaces-by-boosting-economic-growth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">study from PwC</a> argues that AI will replace any obsolete roles by boosting the economy.</p> <p>Proponents believe machines can rid us of mundane and routine tasks, freeing up time for higher-value work that we actually enjoy.

It welcomed the discussion paper, but warned the government it should reserve taxpayer support for early-stage clean technologies, not look to subsidise energy sources that are already mature or commercial.</p> <p>Sarah McNamara, the chief executive of the council, said many of the directions set out in the discussion paper were sensible, including focusing potential support for carbon capture and storage (CCS) on hydrogen and gas production rather than retrofitting coal-fired power stations, which had not been commercially successful.</p> <p>\u201cBut as a note of caution, funding should be reserved for genuine innovation and to help establish early-stage clean technologies,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cIt should not subsidise already commercial or mature technologies. The latter would simply undermine private investor confidence and inhibit market efficiencies.\u201d</p> <p>She said it was a \u201cconcern\u201d that the taxpayer-funded Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency would be used to support already mature technologies. \u201cCustomers need to be confident that taxpayer funds are being spent on technologies that require support, not those that are already self-sufficient,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Facing sustained pressure to adopt a 2050 target of net zero emissions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/angus-taylor-says-it-is-not-australian-government-policy-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2050\">pressure it is continuing to resist</a>, the Morrison government plans instead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/28/angus-taylor-to-announce-shift-in-climate-investment-away-from-wind-and-solar\">develop the roadmap</a> as the cornerstone of the Coalition\u2019s mid-century emissions reduction strategy. The discussion paper points to a role for gas, hydrogen, renewables and, potentially, nuclear power.</p> <p>Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, and the NCCC has also focused on gas as being at the centre of economic recovery plans from the pandemic. The leaked report to the NCCC does not consider cleaner alternatives to the fossil fuel, or mention climate change or the country\u2019s commitments to the Paris climate agreement, raising the ire of the renewable energy industry and climate activists.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s resources industry has welcomed the positive signals from the government on CCS and on nuclear. The Minerals Council of Australia \u2013 historically one of the major opponents of carbon pricing to drive the transition to low emissions \u2013 said it supported a \u201cgenuinely technology-neutral approach to reducing emissions which embraces global best practice and the adoption of CCS and advanced nuclear technology as well as renewables, gas, coal with CCS and pumped hydro\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/21/new-nuclear-technologies-to-be-examined-in-planning-australias-energy-mix\">New nuclear technologies to be examined in planning Australia's energy mix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors managing $2tn in assets, said it would be important for the government to set clear goals through a national climate policy that made it clear Australia was heading for net zero emissions by 2050, consistent with its international obligations. It said private investors would be reluctant to invest in the transition if it did not.</p> <p>Its director of policy, Erwin Jackson, queried whether new gas investments were consistent with that objective. \u201cPrivate investors are already making climate risk assessments in their portfolios about carbon-intensive fuels like gas as compared to zero-carbon alternatives like renewable energy and storage technologies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments will also need to assess whether further support and investment in gas projects are resilient to continued rapid cost reductions in clean energy options and an accelerated shift to truly zero-emissions energy options\u201d.</p> <p>Prof John Quiggin, an economist at the University of Queensland, said the government\u2019s thinking was \u201cfive to 10 years behind the times\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the idea of new coal-fired power stations seems finally to have been abandoned, the report focuses heavily on technology options that seemed promising in the past, but have now been abandoned everywhere in the developed world, such as nuclear power and carbon capture and sequestration,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he said the roadmap\u2019s most significant failure was that it did not recognise that gas-fired electricity generation was increasingly being supplanted by renewable energy backed by battery storage. \u201cThe policy remains fixated on extractible resources such as coal and gas, ignoring our massive endowment of solar and wind resources,\u201d he said.</p>",

Jones said a La Ni\u00f1a climate event is expected to cool waters in the Pacific, causing a sort of seesawing effect where waters in the Atlantic will warm up and strong winds will form \u2013 ideal conditions for a hurricane.</p> <p>The prospect of a disastrous hurricane making landfall is causing growing angst in coastal US states, such as Florida and Louisiana, that are already in the process of restarting economic activity during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The normal strategy of cramming displaced people into temporary shelters to escape flooding risks spurring a fresh wave of infections, forcing authorities to tear up their standard hurricane plans.</p> <p>\u201cIn our first meeting about this, we were like, \u2018Oh my God, we will have to have shelters with Covid,\u2019\u201d said Steven Davis, president of All Hands Consulting, a disaster preparation firm. \u201cThis year is different because you can\u2019t put a bunch of people in an elementary school with a disease spreading. It\u2019s going to be challenging.

Hotel rooms may be commandeered before a storm hits to house people. Bus services to escape routes may be replaced by contracts with individual ride hailing services such as Uber and Lyft.</p> <p>The pandemic has thrown up a range of potential problems in a disaster situation. Volunteers who usually help with relief efforts may be sick or unwilling to be in close contact with people potentially infected, while it may be difficult to transfer medical expertise and supplies between states.

The agency has been working with various partners on drawing up <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/blog/2020-05-08/preparing-hurricane-season-during-covid-pandemic\">guidelines</a> that include advising people to bring hand sanitizer, cleaning materials and two cloth face coverings per person if they are forced into a shelter.</p> <p>\u201cWe are now well past the question of what to do, we have to deal with it because we do not have a vaccine for this hurricane season and probably not for the next one either,\u201d said Craig Fugate, the administrator of Fema during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cPeople are the vector, so we run the risk of increasing the spread the more we move them.\u201d</p> <p>Fugate said that it will be important for people to not move unless they are within an evacuation zone, and even then only travel short distances to family. A shelter run by the Red Cross or other organization should be the last resort, he said.</p> <p>Even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, scientists have been at pains to point out that the impact of the climate crisis will be longer and deeper. A recent <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/05/12/1920849117\">study</a> found that global heating has increased the likelihood of a hurricane developing into a major storm with winds greater than 110mph since 1979, by around 8% a decade.

However, amendments to ensure that imports are of similar or higher standards were rejected by 328 to 277 votes by MPs last week.</p> <p>Sue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at Which?, said research has shown that British consumers value the UK\u2019s high food standards and believe imports produced to an inferior standard should not be allowed in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has made promises to protect food standards, but these commitments must be enshrined in legislation so consumers can have confidence that they won\u2019t be traded away,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The National Trust said they would be working with others across the environmental and farming sector to see how these changes might be made during the Lords stages of the agriculture bill.</p> <p>Patrick Begg, director of natural resources at the National Trust, said: \u201cAs we move towards a more environmentally sustainable system at home, it\u2019s essential that this long-overdue move is not undermined by food imports that don\u2019t meet UK standards.

  "<p>Rwanda is to release 50 women who were jailed for having abortions after a personal pardon was issued by the country\u2019s president, Paul Kagame.</p> <p>Human rights activists welcomed the pending release of the women, six of whom had been given life sentences \u2013 the highest penalty available to the courts \u2013 two serving 25 years and the others terms ranging from 12 months to 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a positive step,\u201d said Tom Mulisa, executive director for the Great Lakes Initiative for Human Rights and Development (GLIHD).</p> <p>Dr Agnes Odhiambo of Human Rights Watch in Kenya, said they should never have been jailed. \u201cWhile this is a good move, women and girls should never, in the first place, be imprisoned for exercising their reproductive rights. The government of Rwanda should remove punitive measures for women who undergo abortions.\u201d</p> <p>Rwanda revised its penal code in 2018, allowing abortion strictly only for cases of minors, rape, forced marriage, incest and instances where the pregnancy poses a health risk.</p> <p>Odhiambo said that sends the wrong message: that women have to undergo certain abuses for them to exercise their reproductive rights.</p> <p>Even where a termination is allowed, it must be carried out by a doctor, an issue in a country where medical professionals are in short supply. \u201cThe condition that allows only a \u2018recognised medical doctor\u2019 to perform abortions threatens to make safe abortions almost impossible for many women and girls to access, particularly those who are poor, illiterate and from rural areas,\u201d she said. \u201cStudies have shown that trained nurses and midwives are as capable as doctors in providing safe abortion care.\u201d</p> <p>Figures from 2016 by Rwanda Medical and Dental Council show the country has one doctor per 10,055 people, and one midwife for every 4,064 women aged 15 to 49.</p> <p>Dr Afrodis Kagaba, the executive director of Health Integrated Development, said the more difficult abortion was to access, the more people are pushed towards unsafe solutions. \u201cNurses and midwives can safely conduct abortion operations as they normally help more than 80% of women to give birth. Nothing can stop a woman who has decided to abort. The law is good, but as we know, around 40% of hospitals are owned by religious bodies, and they cannot offer the service due to their beliefs. Also, healthcare providers are yet to understand the law, they require evidences that are no longer necessary,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The use of law enforcement in arresting women means they are less likely to seek medical help after an unsafe abortion.</p> <p>\u201cIn some cases, girls or women can be handcuffed or arrested and this brings fear in others. Therefore, doctors lack enough evidence, it is not easy for a girl or a woman to prove that she has been raped,\u201d said Dr Frank Habineza, a member of parliament for the Democratic Green party of Rwanda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2019/mar/15/no-tomorrow-for-me-rwanda-teen-mothers-in-pictures\">'There is no tomorrow for me': Rwanda's teen mothers \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mulisa said that more than the narrow specified circumstances permitting abortion should legally be supported. \u201cThis point, when the pregnancy puts at risk the health of the pregnant person or of the foetus. As defined by the World Health Organization, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Many people do not understand what it means. There are many reasons that can affect the social wellbeing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A 2015 study, by reproductive rights group Ipas and GLIHD, found that legal barriers, and cultural and religious stigma make it nearly impossible for women to get a safe, legal abortion in Rwanda, leaving the vast majority forced to resort to unsafe procedures that break the law.

  "<p>Remember, early on in the Covid-19 pandemic, the speculation as to how apocalyptic it would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-in-africa-what-happens-next\">if this disease hit the African continent</a>? I do. There was deep anxiety about what it would mean for countries with lower income populations, dominant but harder-to-regulate informal economies and far fewer healthcare facilities than the UK or Italy.</p> <p>There have been coronavirus mistakes and misjudgments, and deaths, and each one is a tragedy. And no one knows the course the pandemic may take next \u2013 the continent, like the rest of the world, isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. But what has also happened is that many African nations, realising early on that large-scale, expensive testing and hospitalisation was not an option for the populations, had no choice but to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/15/africa-facing-a-quarter-of-a-billion-coronavirus-cases-who-predicts\">a more creative approach</a>.</p> <p>Take the two African countries I have called home \u2013 Senegal and Ghana. Senegal is developing a Covid-19 testing kit that would <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632823-700-cheap-and-easy-1-coronavirus-test-to-undergo-trials-in-senegal/\">cost</a><a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632823-700-cheap-and-easy-1-coronavirus-test-to-undergo-trials-in-senegal/\"> $1 per patient</a>, which it is hoped will, in less than 10 minutes, detect both current or previous infection via antigens in saliva, or antibodies. It\u2019s hard to know exactly how this compares with the price of Britain\u2019s tests, but many of them use polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect the virus, and cost hundreds of dollars. And I can testify that a leaflet that came through my door in London this week offered me a private testing kit for \u00a3250.</p> <p>Senegal is in a good position because its Covid-19 response planning began in earnest in January, as soon as the first international alert on the virus went out. The government closed the borders, initiated a comprehensive plan of contact tracing and, because it is a nation of multiple-occupation households, offered a bed for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/17/856016429/senegal-pledges-a-bed-for-every-coronavirus-patient-and-their-contacts-too?t=1589925674869&amp;t=1589971556429\">every single </a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/17/856016429/senegal-pledges-a-bed-for-every-coronavirus-patient-and-their-contacts-too?t=1589925674869&amp;t=1589971556429\">coronavirus patient</a> in either a hospital or a community health facility.</p> <p>As a result, this nation of 16 million people has had only 30 deaths. Each death has been acknowledged individually by the government, and condolences paid to the family. You can afford to see each death as a person when the numbers are at this level. At every single one of those stages, the UK did the opposite, and is now facing a death toll of more than 35,000.</p> <p>Ghana, with a population of 30 million, has a similar death toll to Senegal, partly because of an extensive system of contact tracing, utilising a large number of community health workers and volunteers, and other innovative techniques such as \u201cpool testing\u201d, in which multiple blood samples are tested and then followed up as individual tests only if a positive result is found. The advantages in this approach are now being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/16/when-it-comes-coronavirus-response-superpowers-may-need-study-smaller-nations/\">studied by the </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/16/when-it-comes-coronavirus-response-superpowers-may-need-study-smaller-nations/\">World Health Organization</a>.</p> <p>Across the African continent, the lack of access to expensive pharmaceutical products, not to mention a well-founded historic lack of trust, has fuelled interest in whether traditional herbal remedies have anything to offer. One plant in particular \u2013 Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, which belongs to the daisy family \u2013 is drawing particular attention after the president of Madagascar, Andry Rajoelina, <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2243669-no-evidence-madagascar-cure-for-covid-19-works-says-who/\">claimed it was a \u201ccure\u201d</a> for Covid-19.</p> <p>That may sound Trumpian, and the WHO has cautioned that further trials are needed before it can be advocated as a treatment for the disease. But I contacted the respected Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Germany, which is currently <a href=\"https://www.mpg.de/14663263/artemisia-annua-corona-virus\">conducting clinical trials</a> on a different breed of the same plant, in this case grown in Kentucky.</p> <p>This specially grown, more potent variety of sweet wormwood is being tested on cells to determine its effectiveness in fighting coronavirus infections and the results so far, the institute\u2019s director, Prof Peter Seeberger, told me, are \u201cvery interesting\u201d. Human clinical trials are likely to follow.</p> <p>More than 20 African countries have already ordered the Madagascan version, a vote of confidence for Rajoelina, who has taken to showing up at meetings and TV appearances with a bottle of a brown herbal drink made from the plant, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-malaria-cure-draws-notice-in-coronavirus-outbreak-this-time-in-africa-11589285981\">touting its benefits</a>.</p> <p>The reason you probably haven\u2019t heard about this, he says, is because of patronising attitudes towards African innovation. \u201cIf it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt?\u201d he asked on French TV. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists will have to say whether his \u201ccure\u201d actually works (among those calling for better evidence of its safety and effectiveness is Madagascar\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/unproven-herbal-remedy-against-covid-19-could-fuel-drug-resistant-malaria-scientists\">National Academy of Medicine</a>). But on Eurocentric attitudes, he has a point. The African continent has a stellar history of innovating its way out of problems \u2013 just look at how mobile money and fintech has turned it into one of the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/africas-tech-pioneers-we-have-become-an-internet-consuming-culture\">digitally savvy regions</a> in the world. </p> <p>It has been well documented how a patronising attitude towards east Asia is what allowed European countries to be caught by such surprise at the spread of this disease. Now a similar mindset seems set to ensure we don\u2019t learn the lessons Africa has to offer in overcoming it.</p> <p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>The number of frontline charities and community groups seeking help to feed the hungry from the UK\u2019s largest food redistribution organisation has tripled since the start of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\"> the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>FareShare has added a further 500 charities to its waiting list, more than 80% of which are delivering emergency food parcels to vulnerable families and individuals at risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/hunger\">hunger</a>, its annual report said, as benefit claims and unemployment soar because of the virus.</p> <p>The FareShare network is made up of 17 independent food redistribution organisations. The report said they redistributed more than 24,000 tonnes of in-date surplus food from the food industry in the last financial year, a 26% increase on the previous 12 months and the equivalent of 1m meals a week. This was used by almost 11,000 charities \u2013 including domestic violence refuges, breakfast clubs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and day centres.</p> <p>But in the month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/lockdown-living\">lockdown</a> was implement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-food-waste-charity-fareshare-donations-lockdown\">the charity distributed 3,208 tonnes of food</a> \u2013 double the usual amount \u2013 and enough to create almost 2m meals a week. In just one week in April, more people signed up to volunteer to sort, pack and deliver food for FareShare than in the whole of last year.</p> <p>To help store and manage the additional food, the charity has recently secured another nine warehouses\u2019 worth extra capacity. It is now urging the government to cover the costs to producers and growers of saving surplus food from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food-waste\">waste</a> and sending it to charities, in order to tackle an expected rise in food poverty during and after the crisis.</p> <p>Lindsay Boswell, the chief executive of FareShare, said: \u201cWhen the crisis ends, the need for our food will still be there. In April alone 856,500 more people claimed benefits and job opportunities fell by a quarter. Many more people will fall through the gaps in society and need the support of frontline charities.\u201d</p> <p>Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness\">homelessness </a>in the UK. The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food, according to data from the <a href=\"https://foodfoundation.org.uk/about/\">Food Foundation</a>.</p> <p>The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe continue to support redistribution organisations getting food to those in need through our work with the Wrap Resource Action Fund. Most recently we provided a series of grants to help redistribution organisations both large and small respond to the impact of coronavirus. We will look to evaluate an earlier <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cutting-food-waste-game-changing-fund-opens\">pilot programme</a> and any further funding decisions will be made in due course.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s the same for us.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 11 women, 24 children, in a small space where they\u2019re sharing facilities. We\u2019re trying to make sure that every day there\u2019s enough cleaning stuff.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that if someone gets it, they\u2019re all going to get it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a plan that if someone has it or suspects they have it, there\u2019s a bathroom only they and their children use. Only come out and use the kitchen when no one else is around.\u201d</p> <p>Kneer\u2019s refuge can house up to 11 vulnerable women and 24 children at a time.

First of all me and my child, we are safe. We receive a lot of emotional and practical support here.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very helpful to understand how serious the abuse was that I went through, and how important it is to always keep my address secret and leave no chance for my perpetrator to contact me.</p> <p>\u201cThe assurance that we did the right thing removing ourselves from abuse and understanding that it wasn\u2019t all just my sensitive feelings or overreaction went a long way in feeling more confident. Being manipulated for 10 years makes you doubt yourself in every thought you have and every step you make.\u201d</p> <p>She had to take a Covid-19 test while staying in the refuge after a visit to hospital for a stomach sickness and high temperature.</p> <p>While at the hospital, one of her children spent the night with one of the refuge workers \u2013 but social services recommended this was limited to the one night.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult, he didn\u2019t want me to go without him and he was crying on my way out,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI was very worried about the Covid-19 test \u2013 if it would be positive, maybe my child had it too, then the possibility to pass it on to the woman who was looking after him, also my housemate who has asthma and her kids.\u201d</p> <p>She was ultimately discharged and the test returned negative \u2013 but because she had visited a hospital she had to self-isolate for two weeks from the rest of the refuge, although her housemate offered to help.</p> <p>\u201cI was having difficult time accepting help. My ex-partner, that I spent 10 years with, he used to call me worthless and useless and ungrateful all the time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSlowly he destroyed my self-esteem and my personality, I was just there to cook food and clean and take care of his needs.</p> <p>\u201cThis left a very big impact for me to ask and accept help from anyone.

He said the United States and other countries had not done enough to \u201cforcibly isolate\u201d people exposed to the virus, but praised China, South Korea and Taiwan\u2019s efforts to curb infections.</p> \n<p>Surgical or everyday face masks can produce \u201cleakage jets\u201d that have the potential to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/21/face-mask-rules-more-political-than-scientific-says-expert\">propel virus particles several metres when the wearers exhale</a>, researchers at the University of Edinburgh have found. All face masks without a valve, including cloth masks, reduced the distance exhaled air travelled in a forward direction by more than 90% but unless tightly worn they could send jets downwards and backwards. At present the UK government recommends the public wear face coverings in crowded places where social distancing is not feasible.</p> \n<p>Scientists must be allowed to take independent decisions without fear of recriminations, the head of the Royal Society has warned after a cabinet minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-scientists-must-not-be-blamed-coronavirus-advice-says-royal-society-head\">appeared to blame \u201cwrong\u201d science</a> for mistakes in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The government has disowned the remarks by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary.</p> \n<p>Ministers responding to the pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered departments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/21/ministers-overruled-permanent-secretaries-11-times-pandemic\">override formal objections from their most senior civil servant</a>, the permanent secretary, the National Audit Office (NAO) reports. Permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were made quickly and without full \u201cvalue for money\u201d checks, the NAO said. Because of the urgency, secretaries of state forced the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable. There are thought to have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years.</p> \n<p>Stay alert to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/21/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-near-5m-as-eu-health-chief-warns-of-second-wave\">global live blog</a> as your day proceeds \u2013 here is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/coronavirus-latest-21-may-at-a-glance\">quick flick through overnight developments</a>.</p> \n<p><em>There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Chronic threat\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Preparing for a no-deal Brexit later this year would overwhelm emergency response teams already burnt out from dealing with Covid-19, a leaked Whitehall report warns.

It is a growing and much bigger slice of the national income than previously thought. In 2017-18 there were \u00a355bn of taxable capital gains recorded, with \u00a334bn of that divided between 9,000 individuals. The report questions whether capital gains should still be taxed at a much lower rate than other income, given they mainly flow to the rich, while the government faces a pressing need for raise revenue. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe must have a fairer settlement after this crisis \u2013 with those with the broadest shoulders making more of a contribution.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Cohen on furlough \u2013 </strong>Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/michael-cohen-to-be-released-from-prison-and-serve-sentence-at-home\">released from federal prison today</a> on furlough (not that kind) to serve the remainder of his sentence at home. Cohen was sent to jail last May after pleading guilty to numerous charges including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global cases near 5 million</strong></h2> <p>After the biggest single-day increase in cases worldwide so far in the pandemic, the number of confirmed infections is close to 5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and underreporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 328,120 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2>\u2018Don\u2019t count on\u2019 vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>A top US scientist has said governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/global-report-coronavirus-vaccine-us-scientist-cases-5-million\">should not count on a Covid-19 vaccine</a> being developed any time soon, urging people to wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance. William Haseltine, the groundbreaking cancer, HIV/AIDS and human genome projects researcher, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam-dunk case by any means ... because every time people have tried to make a vaccine \u2013 for Sars or Mers \u2013 it hasn\u2019t actually protected.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Migrant boat crossings to UK surge during virus lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The number of unaccompanied young migrants crossing the Channel from France to Britain has spiked during the coronavirus outbreak, as travel restrictions force them onto boats rather than trucks. Kent County Council in southeast England, which includes the major port of Dover, was dealing with \u201c230 to 250\u201d young migrants a year ago, its chief executive, Roger Gough, said.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico suffers record one-day death toll</strong></h2> <p>Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Wednesday registered 2,248 new coronavirus infections and an additional 424 fatalities, a record one-day death toll since the start of the pandemic. The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 56,594 and 6,090 deaths in total, according to the official tally. Mexico registered its biggest daily increase yet in infections on Tuesday, when it reported 2,713 new cases. Mexico\u2019s highest daily death toll was on 12 May, when health authorities reported 353 fatalities.</p> <h2><strong>World sees largest daily rise in cases</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">the most in a single day so far</a>. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>Europe should brace for second wave, says</strong> EU coronavirus chief</h2> <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p> <h2><strong>Japan to lift state of emergency in Osaka and two other prefectures</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighbouring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts at the meeting approved the plan to lift the measure in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo. The measure will be kept in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement.</p> <h2><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>More than 100 virus infections in French slaughterhouse</strong></h2> <p>More than 100 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in western France, the regional health authorities said Wednesday. The cases follow coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants not only in France but also in Germany, Spain, Australia, the United States and Brazil - where people tend to work in close proximity. A total of 109 personnel have tested positive at the slaughterhouse in Cotes d\u2019Armor following a second wave of testing, the ARS regional health authority said in a statement. Some 818 people have been tested at the plant, it added.</p>",
  "<p>One day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coffee bar, it\u2019s a pleasant place for politicians and their staff to meet, outside their cramped offices. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament.</p> <p>The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of confidence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution.</p> <p>She had two, conflicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone \u2013 maybe a constituent or the local paper \u2013 would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. \u201cI thought I might get a bit of pushback,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ve had absolutely zero.\u201d</p> <p>This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross-party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">strengthen these targets</a>, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition \u2013 in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we\u2019re all in favour of climate action, but we haven\u2019t yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve significant reductions in emissions.</p> <p>I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we\u2019re embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then flip straight back into politics-as-usual. They find it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It\u2019s easier to look away.</p> <p>In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">will be different</a>. If, as I\u2019ve described, politicians have until now been finding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away?</p> <p>Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts \u2013 and a political strategy that will allow this to happen \u2013 has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think differently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research offers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>I\u2019ve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair\u2019s administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to find ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the slogan \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law.</p> <p>Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour figure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it being one of the big issues,\u201d she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, \u201cI remember it going on in the background, but it wasn\u2019t something that had high temperature\u201d. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change \u2013 and then carried on as normal.</p> <p>That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are offered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn\u2019t understand what it was all about?</p> <p>With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We offered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs\u2019 questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians \u2013 ministers or frontbenchers \u2013 to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party.</p> <p>Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a definite point which I came to think of as a \u201cpenny-drop moment\u201d, when the participants came to realise the significance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely affected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more \u2013 and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the significance of the changes that could be upon us if we don\u2019t act.</p> <p>And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives.</p> <p>We kept talking to them. We organised more briefings, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In Sheffield, we talked about how communities could set up and own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/12/community-generated-green-electricity-to-be-offered-to-all-in-uk\" title=\"\">renewable energy projects</a>. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to floods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren\u2019t they doing more?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afcb85fa426712679510187631f7a82fbdd47560\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcb85fa426712679510187631f7a82fbdd47560/0_0_4597_3065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MPs from various parties meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg at the Houses of Parliament in April last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MPs from various parties meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg at the Houses of Parliament in April last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs \u2013 23 in all \u2013 to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless influential, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action\" title=\"\">number of known \u201cclimate sceptic\u201d MPs</a>, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.</p> <p>I offered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy confidence.</p> <p>All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate \u201cterrified\u201d him. \u201cWhere we\u2019re sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn\u2019t fancy our chances.\u201d</p> <p>I asked why, if it\u2019s so significant, it wasn\u2019t discussed much in parliament. But he didn\u2019t answer. He couldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terrified him.</p> <p>Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn\u2019t just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: first, because it didn\u2019t fit easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>It\u2019s obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: \u201cYou might not get into double figures.\u201d She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/25/british-taxpayers-bill-tax-relief-oil-gas-companies\" title=\"\">tax breaks for oil and gas exploration</a>. And yet she felt that she had to tread carefully: she has to fit in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: \u201cI think they\u2019d just think you were a bit \u2018niche\u2019, is the way I\u2019d put it \u2013 I say \u2018niche\u2019 in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.\u201d</p> <p>One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: \u201cI was known as being a freak.\u201d Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a \u201czealot\u201d. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One confident, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justified his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. \u201cI don\u2019t use climate change as the word because I think it\u2019s just toxic,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won\u2019t take people with you politically.\u201d</p> <p>This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine \u2013 and politicians are no exception.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4fd2319fcf5ac28d3ff3dd9d56b9b7dc53173b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4fd2319fcf5ac28d3ff3dd9d56b9b7dc53173b9/0_75_3754_4688/801.jpg\" alt=\"Sir David Attenborough addresses the Climate Assembly UK in January this year.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir David Attenborough addresses the Climate Assembly UK in January this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Stonehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn\u2019t freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/snow-machines-fleece-blankets-inside-ski-industry-battle-with-climate-change-alpine-resorts\" title=\"\">having to resort to artificial snow</a> \u2013 something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice fishing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives.</p> <p>Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: \u201cHow could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible \u2013 simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?\u201d She labelled this phenomenon \u201csocially organised denial\u201d. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn\u2019t happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insignificant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and \u201cwith nature\u201d. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the fiction that all could continue unchanged.</p> <p>Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels.</p> <p>As a result, it is surprisingly difficult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry \u201ccannot be shut down overnight\u201d. She\u2019s right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere \u2013 not overnight, but urgently.</p> <p>The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I\u2019ve come to think of as the \u201cfeelgood fallacy\u201d. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or offering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly finding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won\u2019t be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas \u2013 yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this.</p> <p>If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it\u2019s burned, not where it\u2019s taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions.</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, \u201cI\u2019ve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters \u2026 and I just don\u2019t have conversations about climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Many of these conversations took place before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/school-climate-strikes\" title=\"\">school climate strikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> protests began in 2018 \u2013 these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK\u2019s constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as \u201calmost like being a parent. It\u2019s got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2110a813d81f6d8e75d87510732c26beff873300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2110a813d81f6d8e75d87510732c26beff873300/210_0_1790_1127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Extinction Rebellion climate protest in the House of Commons public gallery in April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Extinction Rebellion climate protest in the House of Commons public gallery in April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Extinction Rebellion/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exactly how a politician \u201crepresents\u201d the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in effect, saying\u201d: \u201cI am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.\u201d This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate \u2013 a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end \u2013 it\u2019s more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate.</p> <p>They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social benefits of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: \u201cI\u2019m happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.\u201d Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, \u201cthere would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: \u2018Oh, here he goes again.\u2019\u201d Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option.</p> <p>There\u2019s a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don\u2019t speak out, people don\u2019t feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don\u2019t see their politicians leading the way, or offering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoff, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the first move.</p> <p>But this standoff contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the confidence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a confident climate politics look like?</p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>In this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/clean-air-in-europe-during-lockdown-leads-to-11000-fewer-deaths\" title=\"\">environmental benefits of lockdown</a>. It\u2019s certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/steep-fall-emissions-during-coronavirus-no-cause-for-celebration\" title=\"\">in no way a model</a> for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed untold misery and sacrifice. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls.</p> <p>What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company finances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why.</p> <p>Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite \u2013 handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high-carbon economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dedac528d1bc759b9c5130ba1ec29d18758dbfac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dedac528d1bc759b9c5130ba1ec29d18758dbfac/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for a Green New Deal in Washington DC in November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for a Green New Deal in Washington DC in November 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential first step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unflinching honesty about the significance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-a-green-new-deal-we-need-it-now\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a>. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">a plan</a> aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare.</p> <p>Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now offers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour\u2019s 2019 election offer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate.</p> <p>A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens\u2019 assemblies. Early this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/16/climate-assembly-uk-concludes-in-world-transformed-by-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Climate Assembly UK</a> got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its findings back to parliament.</p> <p>Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-benefit analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there\u2019s an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats \u2013 not least, those arising from climate change.</p> <p>Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can\u2019t govern in a vacuum. We can\u2019t afford to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician\u2019s point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn\u2019t normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful.</p> <p>Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not offering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around. <br><br>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">weekly email here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A 10-minute home saliva test for coronavirus is under development in a deal struck between the billionaire co-founder of online fashion brand BooHoo and a Cambridge-based firm.</p> <p>The antigen test, which would be available to buy, will look similar to a pregnancy test but will use a saliva sample rather than urine, and<a href=\"https://avacta.com/how-a-lateral-flow-rapid-test-works/\"> is designed to give a result within 10 minutes</a>.</p> <p>Current NHS home test kits rely on swabbing the tonsils and nostrils, which can be uncomfortable. The not-for-profit research group medRxiv, a preprint online platform that is backed by Yale University, posted <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067835v1\">a recent study</a>, which found that saliva was more sensitive for detection of the virus in Covid-19 patients than nasal swabs.</p> <p>The test kit is still in development and needs to be approved by regulators, but the company expects it to be available in the UK in July. Regulatory approval will also be sought in the rest of Europe as well as in the US.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Cambridge-based Avacta signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Medusa19 , a venture set up by Mahmud Kamani, a co-founder of Boohoo, and Richard Hughes, a former non-executive director of the online fashion brand, who are also shareholders in Avacta, to sell the tests to consumers online. Medusa19 will also have non-exclusive rights to supply the tests to businesses for workforce screening.</p> <p>Alistair Smith, Avacta\u2019s chief executive, said the price of the test would probably be similar to a commercial HIV test, which cost about $30 (\u00a325), but would be lower if health organisations or businesses bought it in bulk. The company said it had had inquiries from firms that wanted to test staff to ensure they are healthy before they return to work.</p> <p>Avacta is looking for more partners to make the test strip. Smith said millions of tests would be needed each month across the world as countries emerge from lockdown. \u201cThe potential size of this market, and the expected demand from businesses for workforce screening, is substantial,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Avacta test is believed to be the world\u2019s first rapid saliva-based home test kit. In the US, a saliva-based test developed by Rutgers University\u2019s RUCDR Infinite Biologics firm received emergency approval from the US regulator at the end of April, but the samples have to be sent off to a lab for processing.</p> <p>Further work by Avacta found that the Affimer reagents it uses block the interaction between the coronavirus\u2019s spike protein and a receptor on human cells to which the virus binds, and may have the potential to prevent infection. The company is looking for a partner to develop an Affimer therapy.</p> <p>Kamani and Hughes said: \u201cGiven this test will be saliva-based, it could be used in airports, offices, factories and in the home environment, providing a result within minutes and with no requirement for medical supervision.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2020. An earlier version implied that medRxiv published a study, when it is a platform for posting unpublished research. This has been clarified.</p>",

Hard-hit <a href=\"https://tia.org.nz/about-the-industry/quick-facts-and-figures/\">tourism</a> is New Zealand\u2019s largest export industry, employing 15% of New Zealanders and contributing to almost 6% of GDP, and it was in the context of rescuing this industry that on Wednesday Ardern suggested \u2013 informally, in a Facebook Live video from the tourist town of Rotorua \u2013 that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/jacinda-ardern-flags-four-day-working-week-as-way-to-rebuild-new-zealand-after-covid-19\">should the country move to a four-day working week, more leisure time may allow the domestic tourist market to expand to meet the present shortfall.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fd228700-5ebb-4859-877a-621da0e55762\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rBfLUe4BpU4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The phrasing was careful. \u201cI hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees,\u201d Ardern said.</p> \n<p>But the mere suggestion has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/jacinda-ardern-flags-four-day-working-week-as-way-to-rebuild-new-zealand-after-covid-19\">\u201cexcited New Zealanders\u201d</a>, as well as exciting a ready audience of the corona generation around the world. When Ardern explained that \u201cthere\u2019s just so much we\u2019ve learned about \u2026 [the flexibility] of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that\u201d, she was speaking to the lived, material reality of the most physically transformed workplaces in living western memory.</p> \n<p>Because across the world, social distancing has resulted not only in record numbers of people working from home. It has staggered and rearranged shifts, reorganising the deployment of labour around continually improvised new systems of production, distribution and exchange demanded in a health and economic crisis. Economists have called it <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-could-spark-a-working-from-home-revolution/12119338\">the biggest workforce change since the second world war,</a> and parallel to the ongoing horror of managing an invisible, lethal virus that underscores every rearrangement, for some workers there have been surprising benefits.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s usually in the secrecy of social media group chats you\u2019ll read the most explicit admissions from people \u2013 and a little guilt \u2013 that they\u2019re enjoying the new schedules and enforced time at home. Parents may find the juggle of home-schooling their kids with work commitments challenging, but many are appreciating more time with their children.</p> \n<p>In a workplace culture that in so many places still \u2013 still \u2013 operates around a culturally persistent <a href=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/safe-and-strong-victorian-gender-equality\">male-breadwinner model</a> that distances men from caring responsibilities in the home, many men are gaining closeness and meaning from greater daily involvement with their kids.</p> \n<p>Women are seeing practical opportunities materialise for post-Covid-19 employment with genuine flexibility for meeting care commitments. Those who seem to be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/5/15/21258855/coronavirus-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-cancer\">doing the best psychologically</a> out of these extreme times are those whose days now accommodate doing things for the community, and acts of care. In my own experience, my partner and I are happier in ourselves and our relationship for losing the stress of our commute and spending more time in our own home together.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/i-pioneered-the-4-day-week-now-it-must-be-used-to-fight-the-climate-crisis\">I pioneered the four-day week \u2013 now policymakers must adopt it to fight the climate crisis | Andrew Barnes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A universal four-day week in itself is no panacea for relationships, workplace frustration, for rescuing an economy or for meeting every household\u2019s care commitments \u2013 but it\u2019s Ardern\u2019s suggestion that it be considered within a mix of work changes by employers that\u2019s important here. There\u2019s no doubt that there are workers who would thrive in a four-day week \u2013 but there are others who\u2019d prosper through more shifts but with fewer hours, those who\u2019d be happier working full-time from home, others who\u2019d be most productive through a different combination of conditions.</p> \n<p>But what can and will provide the capital injection needed to revive economies, a boost in productivity and the potential for a real work-life balance for working people lies in the twinned scenarios a four-day week inherently proposes. The first is adjusting pay-scales to provide the equivalent of a living wage based upon four days of full-time labour, which would both allow underemployment to be liveable and to flush greater spending towards consumer markets that are suffering. The second is a new workplace paradigm that Ardern\u2019s casual menu of ideas politically suggests: one that upends four decades of neoliberal insistence that workplace \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/26/want-to-stop-adani-fight-the-labour-hire-creep\">flexibility</a>\u201d is the purview only of employers, replacing it with a truly social-democratic flexibility that serves, through working people, the households and communities that their jobs support.</p> \n<p>Among a claque of western leaders yearning for \u201csnap back\u201d to the way things were before the virus \u2013 some pursuing \u201crecovery\u201d strategies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX01vcm5pbmdNYWlsQVVTLTIwMDUyMA%3D%3D&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=MorningMailAUS&amp;CMP=morningmailau_email\">even lesser benefit</a> \u2013 it\u2019s New Zealand\u2019s, conspicuously, who repeatedly shows the courage to snap forward.

Dutton has asked the bipartisan committee to hold public hearings and produce a report by July, which will pave the way for parliamentary debate.</p> <p>Comment was sought from Dutton\u2019s office on Wednesday regarding the criticism of the bill.</p> <p>But in a speech to parliament last week, the minister said the government was moving to ensure Australia\u2019s national security agencies had the powers they need to work in an increasingly complex national security environment.

  "<p><strong>When I was pregnant with my son in 2018 I felt so worried about what his life would look like</strong><strong>. I also felt guilty and selfish. </strong><strong> What right did I have to bring new life into a dying world? My family thought I was being melodramatic and, while I do think they were right to a certain extent, I can\u2019t help but worry. Every too-hot summer, every dead bee \u2013 and then to the macro scale \u2013 bushfires, floods, this pandemic.</strong></p> <p><strong> And yet I desperately want a second child. </strong><strong> I feel it would be grossly irresponsible to have another baby. What kind of life would they have? But then, as we have one already, I feel I have already made that choice and am living with it. </strong><strong> I wonder how many other people are grappling with this?</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Eleanor says: </strong></em>I know someone who didn\u2019t want to have kids for fear of passing on their own depression. They felt like they couldn\u2019t do that to a future person; that it would be seriously wrong for them to cause anyone to exist if that existence would feel as bad as depression does.</p> <p>Over time their position on this weakened and, with one thing and another, they did wind up having kids. And the kids did wind up being depressed. They spent months at a time, for many years of their lives, feeling the way their parent had worried they might. But these kids are unflinchingly, unblinking clear that they would prefer this life to not having had one at all.</p> <p>Part of what\u2019s hard for you now is the same thing that was hard for my friend; when you most need your kid\u2019s input into what they\u2019d like, they aren\u2019t here to ask. You have no way of knowing what they\u2019d want until after they\u2019re here. What you want to ask is whether it would be cruel to bring them here. I more than understand looking around at the world right now through the eyes of a prospective parent and seeing it all with renewed horror: the fires, the warming, a familiar menu of potential suffering to which coronavirus has now been added.</p> <p>I understand how daunting it must feel to think you\u2019d have no satisfactory answer to a child who turns around and asks why you\u2019d put them through this.</p> <p>But notice that once we\u2019re here, we almost never ask this question of our own parents. Even in the depths of our worst suffering, very seldom (when we\u2019re well) does it occur to us to prefer the timeline in which we were never here to start with.</p> <p> To bring a child into the world is to risk bringing them pain. Though it might not be wholly reassuring to hear, it has almost always been true. Very few people have ever been born into a time or socioeconomic position where a guaranteed-safe future ever seemed possible. Those with even some sense of security are in the absolute stratosphere of global luck. </p> <p>For most people, most of the time, the question about whether to have children is a question that is only asked against the knowledge that life will invariably bring pain and uncertainty. It is, in the end, a question about whether life is worth living anyway.</p> <p>The mysterious and gripping question at the core of this is: how could the value of being alive be more than the accumulation of the value in our lives? How can a life lived in the thick of anxiety for yourself and for the planet be better than not living a life at all? Only your child will know their answer, just as only you know yours. But I\u2019ll tell you mine, and I hope it will help: even with all the plagues, and all the pestilence, I would still rather be here. I still want to be here.</p> <p>*************************************</p> <h2>Ask us a question</h2> <p>Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?
