My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/04/07/oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-coronavirus-comments/2966225001/\">in a Wednesday op-ed</a> that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV.</p> \n   <p>Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. </p> \n   <p>None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg.</p> \n   <p>But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T22:17:48.787Z\">at 11.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e92312a8f08db3109f20e00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T21:10:54.485Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">floated a conspiracy theory</a> which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china\">claimed on Saturday</a> that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cNot Chinese communist lies.

He was admitted on Sunday and remains in hospital. Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care, said he \u201ccan\u2019t thank them enough\u201d.</p> <h2>All US states now under disaster declarations</h2> <p>For the first time in history, all 50 US states have come under disaster declarations. Wyoming became the 50th state, following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday. The US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico are also under the declarations, which enable federal funds to be used by state and local governments.</p> <h2>British opposition parties unite to call for parliament recall</h2> <p>Opposition parties across the UK and senior Conservatives have united to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/political-parties-demand-recall-parliament-keir-starmer-labour\">demand that parliament be recalled</a>. In a letter to the leader of the Commons, newly elected Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded urgent talks with the Speaker, saying that there was no substitute for parliamentary scrutiny particularly \u201cat this time of national crisis\u201d.</p> <h2>WHO: Belarus must act</h2> <p>A World Health Organization official urged Belarus to impose measures to contain coronavirus, as the country enters \u201ca new phase\u201d of the virus. President Alexander Lukashenko has been downplaying the need for restrictive measures in recent weeks, and said that drinking vodka, driving tractors and bathing in a sauna could help fight the virus. Patrick O\u2019Connor, who led a WHO delegation to Belarus this week, warned that the virus had begun spreading through communities in the capital Minsk and parts of the country.</p> <h2>Moscow hospitals under strain, Kremlin warns</h2> <p>The Kremlin said that the \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus patients was beginning to put a strain on Moscow\u2019s hospitals. The city and other regions have been in lockdown for almost two weeks, but the hospitals in the capital are still stretched. \u201cThe situation in both Moscow and St Petersburg, but mostly in Moscow, is quite tense because the number of sick people is growing,\u201d Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p> <h2>African countries demand answers over alleged Chinese mistreatment</h2> <p>Seven countries have demanded that China address their concerns that Africans living in Guangzhou city are being mistreated and harassed. The countries claim African residents have been targeted out of fear coronavirus could spread through imported cases. In recent days Africans in the city have reported being ejected from their apartments by landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results, and being shunned and discriminated against in public.</p> <h2>Pope: Don\u2019t yield to fear</h2> <p>Pope Francis urged people to \u201cnot yield to fear\u201d and focused on a \u201cmessage of hope\u201d as he led an Easter eve mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica on Saturday.

Six birdies today, and a serene swing around Amen Corner, not a single bat of the eyelid as he traversed the most notoriously mind-bending stretch in major-championship golf. What a golfer!

But once again, the Great White Shark came so close, yet remains so far, having found yet another spectacular way to come a cropper in a major. The yearning goes on.

And then after that it was hitting clutch shots. I had the honour on 12, and that was key. The good old match-play strategy, get it on first, and I hit a very good shot there. And I hit a good 2-iron on 13, I was very pleased with that shot. Greg was still in it, and we both hit good chips on 15. And then the last three holes, we all know what happened, so there you go. I swallowed hard, breathed harder, that was the situation, now it was mine to lose. So I had to put my head down and grind. I\u2019m delighted the way I\u2019ve played the back nine today. I was able to enjoy it [walking up 18] but enjoy it in a strange way. I was trying to enjoy it, but I do feel sorry for Greg.\u201d That refrain again. Faldo often gets undue pelters for perceived coldness, but he\u2019s been magnanimous in victory today.

That leaves the stage for Norman and Faldo to embrace. And it\u2019s a true embrace, bittersweet but warm, both men fully aware of the historic importance and emotional implications of this wild final round. Norman appears genuinely happy for Faldo, offering hearty congratulations and a kind smile; Faldo a strange mixture of ecstasy and wish-I-could-have-won-it-another-way concern for his opponent. The brotherhood of golfers right there. They walk off the green arm in arm, and Norman pats Faldo softly on the tummy, each friendly slap saying well done, old boy. Such a sporting response from Greg, who exits with supreme dignity, even though his eyes betray his heartbreak. The man with the child in his eyes.

A slight sadness hangs in the air, though, which is a shame for Faldo and no reflection on the 38-year-old Englishman.

A birdie would take him to within four of the lead ... but with the sun glinting off his flat stick, he dribbles a miserable putt wide left. Like Norman up on 10, he only half-committed to the stroke, and paid the price for his timidity. That\u2019s one hell of a yip. I wonder whether he was put off by a roar of disbelief elsewhere, as news of Norman\u2019s latest bogey was posted on the leader boards?

Hey, when it\u2019s your day, it\u2019s your day, and you\u2019ve got to take your luck while the going\u2019s good. Back in blistering style, 30 strokes, for a course-record-equalling first round of 63.</p> <p><strong>Nick Price set that particular mark ten years ago. </strong>Ah, 1986, the year Norman got tight coming up the last, converting prime real estate in the centre of the fairway into an eminently avoidable bogey that cost him the chance of a play-off with Jack Nicklaus. He\u2019s come even closer since, denied a year later by Larry Mize\u2019s outrageous chip-in, then missing a 12-footer on 18 in 1989 for a play-off berth alongside unfortunate rhymer Scott Hoch and eventual winner Nick Faldo. But this year\u2019s opening-day 63 suggests that finally, this could be Greg\u2019s time.</p> <p><strong>Norman followed his scintillating 63 with a swell 69 and a solid 71, and goes into the final day with an almost insurmountable six-shot lead. </strong>Surely this is his day of destiny?! No player has ever shipped as big a 54-hole lead at any major, never mind here at Augusta National. In fact, it\u2019s only happened three times on Tour (Bobby Cruickshank in 1928, Gay Brewer in 1969 and Hal Sutton in 1983). It\u2019d take a meltdown of epic proportions for Norman to be denied this time. And even then, it\u2019d probably require something special from one of the chasing pack, too.</p> <p><strong>The only problem with that: Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson are currently in second and third positions.</strong> The 25-year-old Mickelson hits it long and is fearless around the greens, with a riverboat approach to golf that Norman, pin-seeker to the marrow, will surely admire. Augusta will be Lefty\u2019s playground, maybe today, certainly sometime soon, it just <em>has</em> to be. Meanwhile the altogether more steady and sedate Faldo - twice a winner here already, in 1989 and 1990 - is probably the last player Norman would choose to go round with him in the final group this afternoon. Norman may have snatched the 1993 Open from under Faldo\u2019s nose with a final-day 64 at Sandwich, but when the two met in the last group on Open Saturday three years earlier at St Andrews, Faldo shot a sparkling 67 while Norman slumped to a three-putt-strewn 76, overheating under the intense spotlight of the high-profile head-to-head. He\u2019d do well to park that memory for the next few hours.</p> <p><strong>But look, a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead is a six-shot lead, and by rights this should be a procession. </strong>CBS will be going live soon. It\u2019s on!

Centuries of imperial and socialist dictatorship have taught people to respect the adage \u201cThe shot hits the bird that pokes its head out\u201d. Repression combines with folk beliefs in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-china-cause.html\">medicinal power of animal carcasses</a>, a deadly quackery that the world\u2019s fastest growing middle class has the money to indulge.

Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)\">originated in the Middle East</a>, as its name suggests, and came to humans via camels. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a> began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was probably caught from gorillas and chimpanzees. Diseases have always jumped species, but the Covid-19 pandemic may be a sign of an ominous acceleration. A paper this month in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em> suggests the rate of new infections <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2736\">could be rising</a> as humans cram into every corner of the planet. The loss of habitat and the exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade increased the risk of infectious \u201cspillover\u201d, it said. Ferocious punishments for the use of \u201cexotic\u201d animals for food and medicines are required. Once again, though, that is too easy a slogan for people in the west to chant and feel virtuous as they chant it. We should be examining our own diets.</p> <p>If antibiotic resistance continues to grow, we may look back on the deaths of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, and say: \u201cReally? Was that all?\u201d Resistance could end the age of medical progress, returning humanity to a time when minor injuries and routine operations could be fatal. The over-prescription of antibiotics to humans explains in part why bacteria are evolving to resist it, and why <a href=\"researchers%20are%20predicting%2010%20million%20deaths%20a%20year%20from%20antibiotic%20resistance%20by%202050.\">researchers are predicting 10 million deaths a year from antibiotic resistance by 2050.</a> Antibiotic use in the intensive and unfathomably cruel production of meat is as pernicious. Factory farming strains animal health. Breeding sows that are not given enough time to recover before being impregnated again, and chickens in crowded cages suffering from heat stress that brings salmonella and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/e-coli\">E coli</a>, need repeated doses. In 2012, when the then chief medical officer, Sally Davies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/16/antibiotics-resistance-growing-alarming-rate\">warned</a> that antibiotics were losing their \u201ceffectiveness at a rate that is both alarming and irreversible\u201d, she compared the looming health crisis to global warming. To make her comparison complete, we can add that meat eating does indeed contribute disproportionately to the production of greenhouse gasses.</p> <p>Ban the use of antibiotics in farming, then. Treat meat, cow milk and cheese as we treat tobacco and alcohol and hit them with punitive taxes. Make the illegal trade in wild animals as great a crime as the illegal trade in weapons.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rather than change minds, the corona crisis is cementing them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However rational such stirring declarations may be, I feel I am no longer connected to myself or the world around me when I issue them.

But then, you know, I spoke to my mate yesterday who is a GP for homeless people and is in ICU [intensive care unit] now and he is describing apocalyptic scenes. And I\u2019m here thinking well, next door\u2019s magnolia is looking good.</p> <p><strong>I suppose </strong><em><strong>Lanny</strong></em><strong> emerges somewhat out of that sense of the fragility of the beautiful surface of life</strong><strong><br></strong>I suppose so. In that if you are engaged with being alive on this planet just now and especially raising children, then if you are not terrified about the future half the time, you are not paying attention. What is weird about <em>Lanny</em> is that I realised some of what it was about after I had finished it. Certainly the environmental elements of it. Lanny himself has that easy proto-environmentalism that all children are born with.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m making presents for everyone I know who works in the NHS, with collage and paint</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>The malevolent spirit in the book, </strong><strong>Dead Papa Toothwort</strong><strong>, would have lived and breathed Covid-19\u2026<br></strong>Yeah, you would be jogging through the woods and he would just cough it out.</p> <p><strong>The book seems to channel some of the atmosphere of certain rooted mythic novels. I was reminded </strong><strong>of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/16/fiction.alangarner\">Alan Garner</a>. Did you have him in mind?</strong><br>I came late to Alan Garner, in my 20s. I have a Quaker Welsh side in my family, so I was always drawn to <em>The Owl Service</em>, and the idea that those Welsh myths were bubbling under my own life. But those weren\u2019t really sort of foundational texts for me. Likewise, someone else asked me if The Piper at the Gates of Dawn chapter in <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> was a reference point. But again I\u2019d hardly thought of that at all.</p> <p><strong>But you see the connections?<br></strong>Yes, I am becoming worryingly pagan in my reading. I have been reading about contemporary animism, and if you strip out all the stuff about druids and rune tattoos, it makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s funny, I just read Bill Bryson\u2019s terrific book about the body and the fact is, bang-up-to-date science is saying the same things about our relationship with our environment that ancient indigenous people understood. There was a review of <em>Lanny</em> that said \u201cbeware: mystical thinking\u201d and I\u2019m thinking yeah, we could probably do with a bit more of that.</p> <p><strong>You studied art history and I understand that your writing always starts with drawing \u2013 at what kind of scale?<br></strong>Just now the art projects are quite grand. I\u2019m making presents for everyone I know who works in the NHS, with collage and paint. Generally, though I am hunched over my notebook with a black fine-liner pen. I might start with two diagrammatic figures or the idea of a building. And then out of that I might get a sentence or two, or at most a paragraph and then when I sit down and write they are my raw material.</p> <p><strong>Did that habit come naturally?<br></strong>Pretty much. The great truth I learned from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary\">John Berger</a>, who I had a huge reading crush on, was that to put art and writing in separate buckets was to completely misunderstand how the brain worked. Art is where I begin thinking from. I am never going to be a writer who just sits down and writes paragraphs of prose.</p> <p><strong>You want to surprise yourself?<br></strong>Yes, you want to not be in control, always. Also I am a worrier. I find that writing allows me to worry about stuff better and in more detail.</p> <p><strong>There is plenty of scope for anxiety at the moment.<br></strong>Yes but the page should be the place where you do that much better than you do on Twitter or whatever.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanny</strong></em><strong> grew out of a long poem you wrote based on an inspiring friendship between a child and an older neighbour. Was that autobiographical?<br></strong>Yes, there were a few people like that. I did art lessons with my next-door neighbour Pam, who was a lovely woman who taught at the local prison. I had a really nice grandfather who taught me how to do watercolours and stuff like how to make arrows. And mainly there was my godfather, Tony, my best mate, who makes beautiful things with his hands and just gives them away. He is a working definition of the good life for me. I wrote to him a while ago and told him I was sorry this beautiful tray he had made me was all stained now, and he wrote back to say: \u201cGreat, that\u2019s how it should be\u201d. I\u2019d like to think my books can be lived with in the same way.</p> <p><strong>You are interested in oral poetic traditions. How far back do you go?<br></strong>Quite far. I\u2019m reading this great new translation by Gwyneth Lewis and Rowan Williams of <em>The Book of Taliesin</em>. And also this incredible Ethiopian spiritual text <em>The Harp of Glory</em>, which is a kind of Chaucerian love song to the virgin.</p> <p><strong>Which book or author do you always return to?<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/13/riddley-walker-russell-hoban-bookclub\">Riddley Walker</a></em> by Russell Hoban. I first read it in my late teens \u2013 my brother gave it to me and said don\u2019t panic in the first 20 pages. And it was true, the first pages were like smoking a really bad joint, but then after that you are syntactically and emotionally and politically absolutely held in the book\u2019s spell. I have reread it three or four times since. The way it changes is unbelievable; it is a living thing.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Lanny </em>by Max Porter is published by Faber (\u00a38.99).

Other problems included seizures and conditions involving the supply of blood to the brain.</p> \n  <p>The team add that neurological problems were more common among those with more severe forms of Covid-19, while they note some patients who went on to be diagnosed with Covid-19 turned up at the hospital only with neurological problems and without typical symptoms such as a fever or cough.</p> \n  <p>The team also point to previous research which revealed that the coronavirus gets into human cells by interacting with an enzyme, called ACE2 that is present on the membranes of cells in the lungs as well as in the nervous system and skeletal muscle.</p> \n  <p>However, the study has limitations, including that it only involves a small group of patients, certain tests were not carried out due to infection concerns \u2013 meaning most problems were simply described by patients \u2013 and it is not clear to what extent the coronavirus is causing the neurological problems, or whether they were already present.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JAMANeuro/status/1248659372710006785\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p

Cambridge, said there were a number of initiatives looking into possible neurological problems linked to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p> But, she added, some of the symptoms outlined in the study may not be down to such disorders per se, noting symptoms such as dizziness and headaches are common when people are unwell, while symptoms such as loss of muscle mass can occur when people are bed-bound, and cognitive impairment can be a byproduct of being in intensive care.</p> \n  <p>But Newcombe noted that it was likely some patients were experiencing true neurological problems, noting reports of higher rates of stroke and blood clots, including in the lungs, chime with what she had seen.</p> \n  <p>Others said the results were not surprising.</p> \n  <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Many respiratory viruses appear to not only affect the respiratory system but can spread from the airways to the central nervous system,\u201d said Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool<strong tabindex=\"-1\">.</strong></p> \n  <p>Prof Ian Jones, professor of virology, at the University of Reading, added that the new findings should not distract from the focus on the respiratory problems Covid-19 causes.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAt the moment neurological complications might best be considered a consequence of Covid-19 disease severity rather than a distinct new concern,\u201d he said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T10:19:45.025Z\">at 11.19am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

Church leaders from across the UK have used social media and streaming to keep their congregations, many of whom are in their 80s and 90s, connected to the church when many are in isolation.</p> \n  <p>Rev Peter Atkinson has recreated Worcester Cathedral in a spare bedroom in his house from where he broadcasts morning services for people to stream at home.

Due to all of their Easter services going online, it \u201cprovides more opportunity to people to get involved and I don\u2019t think the church will ever be the same again!\u201d</p> \n  <p>There are members of the congregation who are in their 80s and 90s who are now using Google Meets and other social media to stay connected to the church whilst in isolation. The reverend believes because younger members of the family are now stuck at home they now have the time to show their family members how to use the internet.</p> \n  <p>Rev Jim McNeil, who has served as minister for Alva Church in Scotland for 22 years, described himself as a \u201cbit of a technophobe\u201d before using Facebook to record and upload sermons.</p> \n  <p>There have been videos every night of holy week leading up to Easter Sunday and they are all recorded from inside the church and have proven to be popular.

I\u2019m <strong>Lucy Campbell</strong>, here to take you through another day as the lockdown continues.

He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am not impugning anyone who works for the NHS and I think they do an amazing job.</p> \n   <p>But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE both to have enough and also to use it as the precious resource that it is.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he did not blame any health workers who had used more PPE than was \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d given the tough circumstances they faced. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have drawn up guidelines on what to use. It is really important that people don\u2019t overuse PPE either.</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t want to impugn blame on people who have used more PPE than the guidelines suggest because I understand the difficulties in the circumstances.</p> \n   <p>What I would say it is very important to use the right PPE and not overuse it.</p> \n   <p>Of course there have been examples but I don\u2019t want to stress that because I also understand the circumstances in which people might have used more PPE than was strictly necessary according to the guidelines.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the <strong>Royal College of Nursing</strong> (RCN) dismissed any suggestions that healthcare staff were \u201cabusing or overusing\u201d PPE.</p> \n  <p>The RCN general secretary, Dame <strong>Donna Kinnair,</strong> told the Today programme this morning that no PPE was \u201cmore precious a resource than a healthcare worker\u2019s life, a nurse\u2019s life, a doctor\u2019s life\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Speaking later on BBC Breakfast she said that every day she was hearing from nurses saying they did not have enough protective equipment, adding: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I take offence actually that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE.</p> \n   <p>I think what we know is, we don\u2019t have enough supply and not enough regular supply of PPE.</p> \n   <p>This is the number one priority nurses are bringing to my attention, that they do not have adequate supply of protective equipment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Labour leader <strong>Keir Starmer </strong>also found it \u201cinsulting\u201d to suggest healthcare workers were \u201cwasting\u201d PPE.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1248884684949524486\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It is quite frankly insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE. <br><br>There are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe. <br><br>The Government must act to ensure supplies are delivered. <a href=\"https://t.co/kQWbiO0zoh\">https://t.co/kQWbiO0zoh</a></p>\u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1248884684949524486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-uk-deadliest-day-deaths-announced\">UK recorded its deadliest daily rise on Friday</a>, which was worse than both Italy and Spain at their peaks,<strong> Hancock</strong> also reminded the public to stay at home and maintain physical distancing this Easter bank holiday weekend.</p> \n  <p>He went on to pay tribute to the <strong>19 NHS workers who have died after contracting coronavirus</strong>. He told BBC Breakfast:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My heart goes out to their families, these are people who have put themselves on the front line.</p> \n   <p>The work is going on to establish whether they caught coronavirus in the line of duty while at work or whether, like so many other people, caught it in the rest of their lives.

I\u2019ll save for another day the burgeoning celebrity-chatting-to-celebrity-over-shonky-wifi subset, and concentrate instead on the brand-new coronavirus podcasts. There are so many! Ideal for news junkies. Not so good for anxiety bunnies.</p> <p>The most interesting and direct is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08888tq\">The Coronavirus Diaries</a></strong>, a new weekly podcast from BBC Sounds and 5 Live. Several frontline healthcare workers report on their days, using their phones to record their everyday, ever-changing challenges. Vanessa, who works in a care home on the Wirral, talks about how hard it is for residents not to have visitors and what to do when supermarkets won\u2019t let you order in bulk online. Two tins of beans will not cut it. She\u2019s had to find different ways of getting food supplies, at the same time as rejigging her workers\u2019 shifts. Her deputy has been told to self-isolate for 12 weeks, living on \u00a395.85 a week.</p> <p>From an intensive care unit in south London, doctor Andrew explains how hard his job has become. It\u2019s hot in the operating theatre, wearing full PPE. He describes intubation: \u201cSo much more challenging to do when you\u2019re in a full gown\u2026 all of the virus-infested sputum was going to be aerosolised into my face.\u201d He can\u2019t see his colleagues\u2019 faces or hear them speak, so everyone is shouting at one another. His shifts are getting longer and longer as more doctors and nurses have to self-isolate in case they have the virus (still no tests for them, unbelievably). He is getting sores from his face-mask.</p> <p>And on Merseyside, Carmel, a nurse, has decided to move out of her family household, away from her parents, her sister and her son, in case she brings the virus back home with her. She cries as she does so, and so do we\u2026 Michelle Dignan presents this podcast, a little intrusively. We don\u2019t really need to be told how to react to these reports.</p> <p>For more conventional journalism, try LBC\u2019s daily corona pod, <strong><a href=\"https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/42KrPr/\">Coronavirus UK</a></strong>, in which Nick Ferrari, breakfast broadcasting terrier, gets sharp with those in charge of the UK response to the virus. Ferrari nurtures his relationships with ministers, and this show pulls in many more prominent politicians than the <em>Today</em> programme. Matt Hancock has been on quite a bit, as have Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee. They are not let off the hook: Ferrari is the master of the precise, awkward question. LBC, as a station, is infatuated with coronavirus, its new post-Brexit obsession, and is covering it well but manically, fuelled by listeners phoning in, as well as politicians. Episodes are 25-35 minutes long.</p> <p>The World Service offers the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xtv39/episodes/downloads\">Coronavirus Global Update</a></strong>. We hear about China, Spain, Italy, France, the US, from international correspondents, and this five-minute podcast gives an excellent, snappy overview. It\u2019s a headline-only news show, in ye olde BBC manner, which is reassuring in itself. The other main BBC Covid-19 offering, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/series/p05299nl\">The Coronavirus Newscast</a></strong>, is of the modern BBC manner: this is <em>Brexitcast</em>, but coronafied. Laura Kuenssberg, Adam Fleming, Fergus Walsh and Chris Mason present from their various homes, with all the banter that engenders. If you\u2019re after an upbeat, insider-y show, this is the one for you.</p> <p>There are other daily shows, from ITV, Sky and the <em>Telegraph</em>, all of which are OK. <strong><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/topic/podcasts-8135\">Sky\u2019s</a></strong> is usually hosted by Dermot Murnaghan and has a dramatic feel, with swooshy music and inserted quotes from TV programmes. There\u2019s the occasional, irritating microphone peak and scuffle, caused by incorrect mic technique and unadjusted levels (someone give Murnaghan a pop-shield!). <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-19/coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know-itv-news-podcast-with-information-advice-and-analysis-on-the-pandemic/\">ITV\u2019s</a></strong> has Mary Nightingale, also occasionally mic-popping, and is a varied programme, as they all are: sometimes we get health correspondents, sometimes politicians, sometimes TV clips. Still, I would watch the TV headlines rather than listen to the spin-off podcasts. <strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXRoZS1sYXRlc3Q%3D\">The Telegraph\u2019s</a></strong> is less theatrical than its TV counterparts, but is a far easier listen. Perfectly presented by the fabulously named, fruitily voiced Theodora Louloudis, it\u2019s only around 10 minutes long and gives you all the headlines you need.</p> <h2>Three comforting non-coronavirus listens</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker/f5eeccfe-ed4d-4fdb-aac1-fd7a181723f6\">The Bunker Daily: Nigella\u2019s Lockdown Kitchen</a></strong><strong><br></strong><em>The Bunker</em> is not, by nature, a comfort listen, being a clever, up-to-the-minute discussion show that has grown out of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/11/remainiacs-today-womans-hour-its-a-fair-cop-radio-review\">Remainiacs</a></em>, a clever, up-to-the-minute anti-Brexit discussion show. Its weekly offering brings together the very smart Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith, Dorian Lynskey and Alex Andreou to discuss big issues. But its <em>Daily</em> show is more varied and this episode, where Nigella Lawson talks to Andreou, her friend, is a truly lovely thing. Lawson speaks so beautifully about food, creativity in the kitchen and lockdown. I hate cooking and I loved this episode.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/tranquillusionist\">The Tranquillusionist </a></strong><br>Helen Zaltzman has shifted the focus of her podcast <em><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/\">The Allusionist,</a></em> to calm us down in these stressful times. In the first <em>Tranquillusionist </em>show, she reads out soothing words in alphabetical order, accompanied by gentle music. \u201cCuddle, cumulonimbus, custard, cwtch,\u201d says Zaltzman, and things feel instantly better. In the second episode she gives us Imagine by John Lennon, but with the words in reverse alphabetical order (I really love this one). And in the third, she reads out the annual winners of best in show at the Westminster dog show, starting in 1907: \u201cWarren Remedy, a smooth fox terrier\u201d. Lovely.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/nothing-much-happens-bedtime-stories-for-grown-ups/id1378040733?mt=2\">Nothing Much Happens </a><br></strong>This is a podcast designed to make you fall asleep. Yoga and meditation teacher Kathryn Nicolai writes all the stories and reads them out, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/06/sensory-videos-relaxation\">classic A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/06/sensory-videos-relaxation\">SMR fashion</a>. Her voice is close to the mic, with a neutral American accent, and she reads the story twice, a little slower the second time. Slow tales about going to a cabin in the woods, about making cups of tea, about watching winter through the window. The podcast trains your brain, over time, into falling asleep. It slightly drives me mad, but I know a lot of people for whom this show really works.</p>",

To help them review the situation, research conducted by King\u2019s College London and the Australian National University for the aid charity Oxfam found that more than half a billion more people could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-push-half-a-billion-people-into-poverty-oxfam-warns\" title=\"\">pushed into poverty</a> unless urgent action is taken to bail out the world\u2019s poorest countries.</p> <p>Oxfam said the impact of shutting down economies to prevent the virus spreading would wreck vital industries and risked setting back the fight against poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by up to 30 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5fb3ce931edf16fc7980c062f012a8e375a6125\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5fb3ce931edf16fc7980c062f012a8e375a6125/0_52_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africans living in lockdown queue for food.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africans living in lockdown queue for food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Croset/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If those governments attempt to intervene, as developed-world governments have, to support industries and communities suffering a sudden loss of income, then their public debts will soar and the world financial system will ultimately be threatened by debt defaults.</p> <p>Health systems in Africa are expected to be overwhelmed and what welfare systems that are in place will buckle under the strain. Even better-equipped systems in China, the US, UK and much of Europe have struggled to cope.</p> <p>For this reason, whichever way they turn, sub-Saharan governments are threatened by a financial collapse. Aid charities have already called for the IMF and World Bank to engineer a debt write-off to prevent such a situation arising. So far, the answer has been extra loans, albeit at low or zero interest rates, to bridge funding gaps in healthcare provision expected once the virus begins to make inroads.</p> <p>One of the reasons for resisting write-offs can be found in the way debts have built up over the past 15 years. Almost from the moment the G7 wrote off a large slice of developing-world debt at the Gleneagles conference in 2005, African nations have allowed their debt-to-GDP ratios to inch upwards. Encouraged by the World Bank, they have sought loans from major commercial banks and the bond markets.</p> <p>In the past six or seven years, the emphasis has switched to borrowing from China, in part to benefit from \u201cfree\u201d advice on infrastructure projects, built by Chinese contractors. So a debt write-off by international public bodies like the IMF merely allows developing-world countries to keep paying their exorbitant private-sector debt bills and Chinese-backed development loans.</p> <p>Another barrier is the lack, with a few exceptions, of any transformation in the governance of sub-Saharan states, despite 20 years of solid (albeit debt-fuelled) growth.</p> <p>Many of the executives in aid agencies involved in debt relief make the point that corruption remains rife and inequality has increased, aided by developed-world lawyers, accountants and bankers who help African oligarchs stash their gains overseas tax-free.</p> <p>Then there are the pre-colonial tribes and nations, which cut across today\u2019s borders and remain strong. They prevent post-colonial nations from developing strong governance and tackling corruption.</p> <p>A repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/08/g8.development1\" title=\"\">Gleneagles deal</a> is difficult when so little appears to have changed in the meantime. Fatigue among donors, and a sense that money hasn\u2019t solved much so far, add to a sense of despair and fuel inaction.</p> <p>Yet, this is not a time for considering the moral hazards. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-global-leaders-urge-g20-to-tackle-twin-health-and-economic-crises\" title=\"\">The G20 must act quickly</a>, even out of self-interest. This is an interconnected world, and debts rebound if they are not dealt with as part of a programme that maintains confidence in the financial system.</p> <p>To wait for another debt default in sub-Saharan Africa will serve no one\u2019s purpose. A rescue should be put in place now, before Oxfam\u2019s dire predictions become reality.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s economy contracted in February, sending the first signals of a downturn that is expected to quickly turn into a slump. According to last week\u2019s official figures, the UK\u2019s national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/uk-economy-already-flatlining-before-coronavirus-figures-reveal\" title=\"\">fell by 0.1%</a>.</p> <p>Even though the Covid-19 virus had yet to take hold in the UK and the government lockdown was several weeks away, the economy was hit during the month by heavy rainfall, which closed building sites and discouraged consumers from venturing out.</p> <p>For the past three years, the economy has stayed afloat thanks to buoyant consumer spending and, latterly, the recruitment of civil servants to help the government prepare for Brexit, offsetting the problems of a manufacturing industry that spent much of 2019 in recession. But GDP, which crept up during the first half of 2019, finished the year with a final quarter of zero growth.</p> <p>It will be several months before official figures begin to capture the collapse in economic activity experienced since February, which has encouraged City investment banks and thinktanks to look at detailed data to build a picture of the downturn as it progresses.</p> <h2>Jobs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-10T18:50:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Job vacancies since January\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-10T18:50:15/embed.html\">Job vacancies since January</a> </figure>  <p>Universal credit applications have rocketed since the lockdown.

This was followed by an additional 250,000 in the first week of April.</p> <p>The DWP has refused to give updates since then, but the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the increase slowed last week.</p> <p>It is not difficult to see why universal credit claims have spiralled. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that almost 30% of businesses are furloughing workers in the short term.</p> <p>Businesses in the IT and information services sector are better off: so far only 10% of workers have been laid off. But more than half of businesses in the accommodation and food services sector have shed workers.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation thinktank believes the trend for further universal credit claims \u2013 often held in a queue by the slow pace of processing at DWP call centres \u2013 will continue for some time.</p> <p>One measure to give an indication of the trend was the decline in the number of job vacancies, which only two years ago reached a record high. Another was the number of online searches for information on how to claim benefits, it said.</p> <p>\u201cThe frequency of web searches for unemployment-related terms has fallen further this week and [they] are now less than half of the levels seen in the middle of March,\u201d the foundation said. \u201cBut even though web searches have fallen, they are still around levels that were seen at the peak of the financial crisis in 2009.\u201d</p> <p>The knock-on effect to the economy is likely to be dramatic, the thinktank believes. \u201cA 30% fall in employment \u2013 consistent with a number of published surveys \u2013 suggests GDP could end up contracting by as much as 5% in the first quarter, with much worse to follow in the second quarter.

Investors feared the costs of coping with a global pandemic would continue to mount as more people died and governments kept their economies in lockdown.</p> <p>The leading index of UK company shares plunged by 25% in the three months to the end of March, a slump in share values not seen since the aftermath of Black Monday in October 1987.</p> <p>This month the index has staged a recovery, along with stock markets in all the major financial centres, in response to figures showing the worst-hit countries \u2013 Italy and Spain \u2013 are reaching the peak of new cases. On 23 March, the FTSE index slipped below 5,000 points to 4,993. Last Friday it had recovered almost 1000 points to 5,842.</p> <p>As a proxy for the nation\u2019s wealth, the FTSE is not always reliable, given its large number of overseas-based companies, but with most British workers\u2019 pensions invested in shares, the recent turmoil has come as a shock to many.

This figure is likely to have declined further as the government discourages workers from using buses and trains in major cities, which initially continued to see large numbers of people travelling in rush-hour periods.</p> <p>Transport for London has reported that it will <a href=\"https://www.transport-network.co.uk/TfL-faces-500m-loss-in-passenger-income/16524\" title=\"\">lose \u00a3500m in revenue</a> from a clampdown that it hopes will drive passenger numbers on the tube network below 5% over the Easter weekend.

The shutdown of large parts of the manufacturing sector and the vast number of offices left empty has brought down electricity consumption to 85% of normal levels. The consumption of gas has held up, due to its use for domestic heating. The recent warm weather has resulted in a seasonal drop in demand, but this drop has been offset by the millions of people staying at home to work.</p> <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight said manufacturers were quick to scale down energy consumption in February as the spread of the virus in China hit imports and restricted domestic production. The clampdown on non-essential work meant most factories closed or switched to making products needed during the pandemic.</p> <p>The almost total shutdown of restaurants, bars, pubs and leisure facilities has hugely affected energy consumption in that sector.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, wholesale energy prices have tumbled as demand has dropped. This situation was made worse by a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia over supplies that has led to international markets being flooded with oil, despite a tentative deal on Friday to limit production.</p>",
  "<p>When Debenhams filed for administration last week, it wasn\u2019t just suppliers of its stock, who are owed cash, that felt the pain. There are 22,000 jobs at risk if the retailer cannot be rescued and many of its 142 stores are unlikely to reopen, spelling more trouble for British high streets. And there is also a network of landlords who rely on quarterly rent payments from their shops.</p> <p>The outlook for these landlords was dark enough before the pandemic brought the British economy to its knees. More than 16,000 stores closed last year and the enforced shutdown of cafes, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops is expected to result in thousands more pulling down the shutters for good.</p> <p>Since pre-industrial times, landlords and tenants have adhered to a schedule of quarterly rent payments, when annual commercial or agricultural rents were payable in four equal instalments on the \u201cquarter days\u201d, linked to religious festivals.</p> <p>The most recent payday, the second-quarter payment date of 25 March, was a far from harmonious occasion, however. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/hammerson\" title=\"\">Hammerson</a>, owner of malls such as Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and Brent Cross in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/30/hammerson-shop-rent-takings-down-two-thirds-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">said it had only received 37% of the rent due</a> for the second quarter.

Some landlords are furious that certain tenants have interpreted this as permission not to pay.</p> <p>Some \u00a32.5bn in retail rents was due at the end of March, according to trade body the British Property Federation (BPF). The property industry, it says, cannot absorb vast losses, because landlords have debts to service.</p> <p>Melanie Leech, chief executive of the BPF, is calling for government and regulators to work with lenders to help commercial property businesses. \u201cAs property owners offer relief to their tenants, there is a very strong case for lenders to provide debt service deferral to owners in return, to protect the 45 million savers and pensioners across the country whose money is invested in commercial property,\u201d Leech said.</p> <p>Some investors have already been caught up in the property-sector tumult. Investment managers BlackRock and Schroders have both suspended trading in their UK real estate funds, saying it was difficult to obtain an accurate valuation of their assets.</p> <p>\u201cLandlords\u201d are treated as one group, although they vary enormously: some are private individuals, some are pension funds.

  "<h2><strong>I\u2019m confused by all these new words\u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>Seldom have we had to get to grips so quickly with a slew of new terms and abbreviations. Had you told most people last Christmas that soon they would be WFH, they might have considered it a cryptic insult. Most probably had only a vague idea what an epidemiologist did or what a ventilator was, while PPE was (if anything) a soft Oxford degree favoured by politicians, rather than the personal protective equipment now urgently needed in hospitals. Few could have told you the difference between an epidemic (the outbreak and rapid spread of an infectious disease through a population) and a pandemic (an epidemic that occurs over a very wide geographical area, perhaps the whole world).</p> \n<p>Even the terminology of the virus itself is challenging: the coronaviruses are a family of pathogens, this particular one (being related to that which caused the Sars outbreak of 2002-3) denoted Sars-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the respiratory syndrome it causes, much as Aids is to HIV. A vaccine confers immunity (probably just for a limited period) to the virus; an antiviral interferes with viral replication in the body to slow or arrest its bad effects. Antibiotics attack bacterial pathogens, not viruses, but may be needed with Covid-19 to treat secondary infections such as pneumonia that take advantage of a compromised immune system. Expect to hear lots in the coming weeks about serological tests, which look for proteins in the blood that signal past infection, even if the virus has long since been cleared from the body. Those tests are under development, and they will provide vital information on how widespread infection has been \u2013 and whether many (or few) have had Covid-19 without any symptoms at all.</p> \n<p>While comparisons with wartime and the blitz spirit are deeply misleading, one analogy holds: the second world war slogan \u201cLoose talk can cost lives\u201d is apt here too.</p> \n<h2><strong>What\u2019s an important number and what\u2019s not?</strong></h2> \n<p>What makes the coronavirus so deadly is a combination of two numbers. The reproduction number (denoted R<sub>0</sub>) is the average number of people an infected individual goes on to infect in the absence of any social distancing or quarantining; the mortality rate is the percentage of infected people who die.</p> \n<p>Both depend on the biology of the virus, but neither is fixed. R<sub>0</sub> for the coronavirus is about 2.5 to three (compared with 1.3 for common flu), but that\u2019s an average \u2013 it varies from person to person. Reducing person-to-person contacts cuts the <em>effective</em> reproduction number R \u2013 and the epidemic will decay if it drops below one. The mortality rate, meanwhile, depends on the availability of healthcare for people with the most serious symptoms: it is about 0.4% in Germany, 4.6% in the UK, and more than 10% in Iran.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

Perhaps the most useful of its tips is: \u201cIf the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>But what if experts disagree?</strong></h2> \n<p>Sorting fact from fiction has become harder in this crisis because even well informed experts aren\u2019t always united in their advice. Disagreements are normal in science, but are rarely a matter of life and death. It has been as frustrating and unsettling to science reporters as it has to everyone else to find experts at loggerheads over basic concepts such as \u201cherd immunity\u201d. It is, frankly, still a source of puzzlement why it took <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">a single modelling study</a> from Imperial College London to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">persuade expert government scientific advisers</a> of what other experts (such as those at the World Health Organization) had been saying all along: that without stringent containment measures, the UK death rate would be catastrophic.</p> \n<p>So now even the fine details of the science are being held up to us all for scrutiny. It\u2019s unprecedented for a national newspaper to publish a full, simplified version of a scientific paper, as the<em> Observer</em> did with the Imperial study. There will need to be more of this and with luck, it will spread understanding of how scientific results are carefully formulated and circumscribed with caveats, so that experts are seen as well-informed specialists doing their best with the tools and data at hand.</p> \n<p>With the stakes this high, experts exploring speculative ideas take on a responsibility they aren\u2019t used to. A study from epidemiologists at Oxford recently caused a stir when it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ff6469a-6dd8-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">reported as claiming</a> that as much as half of the UK population might have already been infected with the coronavirus, mostly without any symptoms. The work was quite reasonably exploring a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario. But the headline in the <em>Financial Times</em> made it sound like an empirical possibility. Researchers will need to be more explicit about what their findings do and do not mean.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deefdfcc0a22748ef120307e4f9a8f79b8709230\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deefdfcc0a22748ef120307e4f9a8f79b8709230/0_227_5036_3023/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A researcher works on virus replication in order to develop a vaccine against coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A researcher works on virus replication in order to develop a vaccine against coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Douglas Magno/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>What do I need to know about vaccine development?</strong></h2> \n<p>All drugs have to pass stringent tests before they are approved for use. In general they are first tested on animals, and then enter \u201cclinical trials\u201d on humans, of which there are three stages. Phase one, conducted on small numbers of healthy volunteers, checks for safety, looking for toxicity or serious side-effects. Phase two then tests whether the drug actually works in humans with the condition targeted. Finally, phase three trials are conducted on large numbers of people \u2013 typically hundreds or thousands \u2013 to see how it will work in the clinic and make sure there are no other complications or failures before making the drug generally available.</p> \n<p>Vaccines will have to go through all of these phases, and could, like most candidate drugs, fail at any one of them. While drug-regulation agencies are considering ways to streamline and fast-track the process because of the urgency of the situation, this can only go so far. A coronavirus vaccine would be given to millions of healthy people \u2013 ultimately, perhaps to most of the world\u2019s population \u2013 and so it\u2019s more essential than ever that its safety is checked thoroughly.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s more, even when a vaccine gets approved, manufacturing it at such a large scale will be a tremendous challenge \u2013 only a few pharmaceutical companies worldwide have that capacity. And distribution will present difficulties too, especially to more remote parts of developing countries, or among overcrowded, poorer neighbourhoods in large megacities. If, as is hoped, a vaccine is ready by the middle of 2021, that speed will be remarkable and unprecedented.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about drug treatments, including existing ones?</strong></h2> \n<p>It is hoped that some antivirals already developed and tested for other conditions, such as Ebola (remdesivir) or Sars, could work for Covid-19, because they attack similar targets in the virus. In that case some of the testing has essentially already been done, so we would get a head start. There is also broader interest in \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d \u2013 investigating whether the many drugs that failed for their intended use, but which passed the safety trials, could prove effective for quite different conditions.</p> \n<p>In tests on a new drug \u2013 how safe or effective it is \u2013 it matters how big the sample is. Drugs don\u2019t get approved until they have been tested on hundreds or thousands of people, so outcomes for just a dozen or so are highly preliminary and far from proving efficacy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/06/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-podcast\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine | podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Be especially cautious of reports that rely heavily on quotes from drug companies. They are very unlikely to be lying, but institutional press offices have become accustomed to putting a rosy spin on their researchers\u2019 work and drug companies are under commercial pressures that don\u2019t always encourage them to give the full picture. You needn\u2019t be cynical, just cautious.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should I keep scanning Twitter?</strong></h2> \n<p>Whether Twitter is a handy, up-to-the-minute source of information, or a hive of misinformation and conspiracy theories, is largely up to you. All the usual caveats about using Twitter \u2013 beware of strong opinions from pseudonymous tweeters with 15 followers, or of hot takes from media loudmouths with no expertise \u2013 are multiplied and compounded here. For the problem with the subject of coronavirus on Twitter is that it\u2019s not just the trolls and attention-seekers who are weighing in. Plenty of serious academics, too, have taken it upon themselves to become epidemiologists and virologists overnight, criticising or praising scientific studies or government policies with all the assurance of seasoned veterans. Often what they say is not ignorant or wild, but merely narrow and lacking context \u2013 they might be good at interpreting statistics, say, while having no knowledge of viral transmission or mass behaviour. Fear seems to be causing the usual academic caution to be replaced by hubris.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6087767440b433bf86aba675879888cfad990afc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6087767440b433bf86aba675879888cfad990afc/0_194_3572_2145/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Woman looking at a Twitter feed of Canadian PM\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twitter can be a source of vital information \u2026 if you know where to look.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>I read this great analysis on Medium\u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>As the site itself says, \u201cAnyone can publish on Medium \u2026 but we don\u2019t fact-check every story.\u201d Make that your starting point for anything you read there.</p> \n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. But the authoritative-looking stuff you might encounter is probably not coming from experts. One post that went viral, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56\">Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance</a>, which used an array of charts and statistics to argue for strong containment measures to avoid massive fatalities, was by Tomas Pueyo, a Silicon Valley consultant who works on educational online content and has no epidemiological training. His post was promoted by a content marketing firm and was shared by the likes of Margaret Atwood and Steven Pinker. Whether or not it was accurate in all its details, it sent out a needed wake-up call about the dangers. But other unqualified \u201ccorona influencers\u201d have spread dangerous messages, for example about hoaxes and bogus treatments. Medium has <a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045484653-COVID-19-Content-Policy\">now announced</a> that it will give \u201ccareful scrutiny to coronavirus-related content to help stem misinformation that could be detrimental to public safety\u201d, and will remove any that it deems harmful.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do I spot a coronavirus conspiracy theory?</strong></h2> \n<p>First ask: does this theory confirm the suspicion I\u2019ve had all along? About, for instance, 5G? Because if so, double your scepticism and then double it again. We aren\u2019t so much duped as flattered into buying these theories, and the first defence against confirmation bias is to recognise that no one has natural immunity to it.</p> \n<p>The harder ones to avoid are political, because they both speak more directly to our prejudices and are tougher to disprove. Is it \u201cobvious\u201d that, say, the government is just trying to keep its big-business donors happy at the expense of our own safety? We\u2019d do well to assume in the first instance that leaders and policymakers are not Machiavellian strategists but error-prone muddlers like the rest of us.</p> \n<p>Sorting fact from fiction is made harder by the media habits acquired during Brexit \u2013 the tendency of broadcast journalists and other media reporters to tweet unattributed and unconfirmed rumours. This grave global crisis should prompt some journalists to take a hard look at the ways they have become accustomed to working.</p>",

The large iron gates were locked, with signs in red informing the public of the closure.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in the suburban village of Compstall, just outside Stockport, Etherow Country Park, a local nature reserve, remained open. The car park was quiet, with a few dog walkers and families gathered around the lake.

Women are rarely able to fail up in the way men can; you have to be twice as good as a man in order to be taken half as seriously. You have to work twice as hard.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s decision to spend tens of millions of pounds funding private schools overseas has been called into question following a decision by the World Bank to halt its investment in the sector.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s private-sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, announced last week that it is to freeze direct investments in for-profit pre-primary, primary and secondary schools.</p> <p>\u201cThis landmark decision by the IFC illustrates the emerging understanding that for-profit commercial schools may do more harm than good,\u201d said Magdalena Sep\u00falveda, executive director at the Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. \u201cWe have seen years of damaging impacts of commercialisation on the right to education.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for International Development (DfID) has given millions of pounds to low-fee private schools (LFPS) in countries around the world, including Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana and Pakistan.

Among those that have received UK taxpayer cash are the private school chain Bridge International Academies (BIA) which has also been the recipient of money from Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg.</p> <p>The chain has been applauded for raising education levels in several of the countries in which it operates.

Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said last week when the prediction was published that the IHME figures were twice as high as they should have been.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates\">note on its website</a>, the IHME explained how it came to the earlier high figures. \u201cOur initial release of EEA country predictions included reported daily deaths through 5 April. For the United Kingdom, daily death data during the week prior to 5 April showed sharp and steadily increasing cumulative daily deaths,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cSince our last release, we have been able to include four more days of reported daily deaths for the UK (6, 7, 8, 9 April).\u201d A slower rate of increase in deaths, which will have been due to the physical distancing measures taking effect, and better data on what happened in other places in the world where epidemics had peaked, \u201chas resulted in notably lower average projections for the UK,\u201d it said.</p> <p>It had also received updated information on bed capacity and ICU capacity, it said, and had reduced its forecasts on shortages of those.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Italy is forecast to have the second highest death toll, at 20,000.

Other European countries with relatively high daily Covid-19 deaths that may have already peaked include Belgium (peak on 7 April, 403 deaths) and Germany (8 April, 254 deaths). </p> <p>\u201cSwitzerland, which is not part of the EEA, currently has a predicted peak of 124 deaths (estimate range of 9 to 454) on about 4 May. As increasingly more data becomes available \u2013 and/or as countries adjust social distancing policies \u2013 these predictions may change,\u201d said the IHME.</p>",

At the White House gates a white tent has been set up; a medical worker zaps me with a device that takes my temperature and gives me the all clear.</p> <p>After passing through security, I arrive at the West Wing briefing room, usually bustling like a railway station, but now sparsely populated by journalists, some wearing face masks.</p> <p>My temperature is taken again and I sit down, several seats apart from the other reporters. When Donald Trump and his team emerge stage right, they seem less worried than us about physical distancing (yet the US president has twice been tested, with negative results, for coronavirus).</p> <p>America has the greatest number of coronavirus cases in the world. It is a public health crisis, an economic crisis and \u2013 this is where we in Washington come in \u2013 a crisis of leadership. Trump, a property developer and reality TV star, was the first US president elected with no prior military or political experience. It was all a bit of a lark. Well, we\u2019re not laughing now. He is the man in charge of America in its biggest emergency since the second world war. And it seems that history\u2019s verdict will be unforgiving: he is not up to the job.</p> <p>I watch most of his daily coronavirus taskforce briefings, which sometimes run for more than two hours, from home (grateful for TV and steady broadband, though not always easy with two boisterous children) but get to go along about once a week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1242234983516966912?s=20\">and ask questions.</a> Up close, the president\u2019s stature (he is 6ft 3in), blond mat of hair and peachy face afford a certain perverse charisma.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the closest any of us will get to the court of George III, with its mix of awesome power and terrifying capriciousness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was there one evening when, defying medical advice, Trump talked baldly about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\">reopening the economy by Easter.</a> It was just a little scary, this realisation that the most powerful person in the world is unhinged \u2013 the closest any of us will get to the court of King George III with its mix of awesome power and terrifying capriciousness. Fortunately, on that occasion, Trump eventually bowed to the experts and kept the physical distancing guidelines in place until the end of April.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a presidential election year. Trump can no longer hold campaign rallies with big crowds. He has turned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">the daily briefings into a substitute,</a> still airing grievances, spinning untruths, bullying reporters and narcissistically promoting his favourite brand: himself. \u201cI have, you know, hundreds of millions of people,\u201d he mused on April Fools\u2019 Day. \u201cNumber one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I mean, I just found out I\u2019m number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice, for whatever it means.\u201d</p> <p>The wartime president Harry Truman kept a sign on his desk that said: <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/trivia/buck-stops-here-sign\">\u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d</a> Trump adheres to the opposite view. Having downplayed the virus for so long \u2013 \u201cWhen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said on 26 February \u2013 and failed to prepare resources, he is now, extraordinarily, trying to sell a potential death toll of 100,000 Americans as a success. Even for this master of razzle-dazzle, it would be quite a magic trick.</p> <p>Typically, in times of national crisis, there is a default expectation that leaders will speak the truth, or mostly (let\u2019s not forget George W Bush\u2019s weapons of mass destruction). But with Trump that assumption no longer holds. His briefings would come with a government health warning were it not for the fact he is the government.</p> <p>Amid this confusing torrent of bluster, there are also medical experts dispensing genuine information, showing predictive models, urging people to maintain physical distancing, advising on the wearing of face masks. It therefore becomes an intensive exercise in trying to sift fact from fiction.</p> <p>American TV networks are having a lively debate about this. Should they show the broadcasts with a 30-second delay to allow fact-checking interventions? Should they show them at all? Increasingly, some are issuing disclaimers at the start and cutting away before the end.</p> <p>At the Guardian our rolling coverage of the briefings includes real-time fact-checking from a team of reporters. It is important not to allow Trump\u2019s baseless claims, for example his pushing of an unproven drug, to hang in the air unchallenged. Our reporting is determined to hold the powerful to account. What did the president know and when did he know it? And why didn\u2019t he act?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"155dbfdd144dcccf97364d2037d043681c5299c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/155dbfdd144dcccf97364d2037d043681c5299c1/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A deserted street in Washington DC during the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A deserted street in Washington DC during the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">one article explored</a> how it could be that the first confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported in South Korea and the US on the same day \u2013 20 January \u2013 yet one country took swift action to curb the outbreak while the other is still lurching towards catastrophe. Jeremy Konyndyk, who used to lead the government\u2019s response to international disasters at USAid, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are witnessing in the United States one of the greatest failures of basic governance and basic leadership in modern times.\u201d</p> <p>For a journalist, this most peculiar presidency already felt like the story of a lifetime. Now it has collided head-on with another story of a lifetime. But day by day, I am also witnessing the unfolding of an American tragedy. For three years, Trump thought he could define events. In the end, he discovered, events will define him.</p>",
  "<p>This crisis has revealed how arbitrary the phrase \u201clow skilled\u201d is: how we value people, their rights, what they\u2019re paid and the conditions they work in is all wrong. For all its warm words about key workers, the government should be reminded of this.</p> <p>The day Dominic Raab encouraged us all to clap for the workers who are risking their lives to keep society going, the government restated that some of those same people won\u2019t be allowed in the country come January 2021. While Priti Patel is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/priti-patel-accused-of-avoiding-mps-scrutiny-during-national-crisis\">conspicuously absent</a> \u2013 notably on immigration issues \u2013 the department she oversees decided now was the time to reiterate that as part of its new immigration rules, \u201clow-skilled\u201d people <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/government-we-dont-want-low-skilled-workers-after-the-pandemic/\">would not be able to apply for a UK work visa</a>.</p> <p>Millions of key workers in the UK are migrants \u2013 approximately 23% of all <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/internationalmigrationandthehealthcareworkforce/2019-08-15\">hospital staff</a>, including 29% of doctors and 18% of nurses, 20% of agricultural workers, more than 40% of <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/migrant-workers-and-coronavirus\">food production workers</a> and 18% of <a href=\"https://www.independentage.org/policy-research/research-reports/moved-to-care-impact-of-migration-on-adult-social-care-workforce\">care</a><a href=\"https://www.independentage.org/policy-research/research-reports/moved-to-care-impact-of-migration-on-adult-social-care-workforce\"> workers</a>, rising to 59% in London. These are the human beings who, for decades, politicians have blamed for holding down wages, ruining \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/17/four-in-10-people-think-multiculturalism-undermines-british-culture-immigration\">British culture</a>\u201d and overburdening public services.</p> <p>If the government forges ahead with its plans, recognising them as key workers will be just a momentary suspension of the norm. Many of them were dismissed as low skilled before the crisis, and it seems they will be once again when it\u2019s over.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers\">post-Brexit immigration plans</a> are a mix of salary thresholds and a clear determination to stop people it deems to be low skilled coming to the UK. It seems that it plans to change the system in some ways, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/immigration-proposal-english-language\">expanding</a> an already unfair, discriminatory system for non-EU migrants to include their EU counterparts. Swept up into this category will likely be some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/07/immigration-policy-will-bar-half-a-million-care-workers-from-eu\">people </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/07/immigration-policy-will-bar-half-a-million-care-workers-from-eu\">it is praising now</a>: the migrant care workers, hospital porters, bus drivers and cleaners who are keeping us safe and keeping society functioning.</p> <p>Your value, the rights you can access, whether you can settle in this country: none of that should be decided by your job or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/04/golden-visa-immigration-deal-british-citizenship-home-office\">how much money</a> you have in your bank account. But neither should it take a crisis to make this clear; you shouldn\u2019t have to risk your life or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-crisis-nhs-not-drained-migrants-sustained-died-frontline\">die trying to help others</a> to be seen as a human being.</p> <p>The sacrifices people are making should be recognised and remembered. But their humanity should not depend on how they help \u201cus\u201d. For decades this has been exactly the kind of immigration system politicians have argued for: one where migrants who benefit \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour economy\u201d are \u201callowed\u201d to come here, and everyone else is a problem. People moving to the UK have for too long been treated as disposable commodities, their rights determined by how useful they are seen to be. This is the very essence of the points-based system.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the government sometimes chooses to apply the rules differently to particular groups of people. It can, for instance, give out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">automatic one-year visa extensions</a> to some health workers, at the same time as doubling down on the immigration system that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">dismisses other key workers</a>.</p> <p>So, if a shift is happening in society, it can\u2019t just be piecemeal. We cannot repeat the same dehumanising ideas, where people are either framed as \u201ccockroaches\u201d and \u201cillegals\u201d, or as \u201cproductive\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d workers; bad migrants v good migrants. Recognising low-skilled workers as key workers should be a starting point, not an end point, to change the immigration debate. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">Coronavirus is not some great leveller: it is exacerbating inequality right now | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s treatment of all migrants matters. As it has reissued statements on low-skilled workers, it has been remarkably quiet on certain key migrants\u2019 rights issues during this crisis. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve spoken to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/hostile-environment-covonavirus-crisis-britain-migrants\">people who are terrified</a> about becoming destitute because the conditions attached to their visa bar them from accessing financial support. There are those who are scared to access healthcare because of the hostile environment. And the charity Detention Action has found that not only are people still being put in immigration detention, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-detention-immigration-removal-centre-brook-house-home-office-a9458206.html\">some are being detained</a> when presenting with coronavirus symptoms. These people are consistently overlooked because they aren\u2019t seen to matter.</p> <p>But if recognising our common humanity is something we can do when Boris Johnson is admitted to intensive care, the same should be possible for all people, regardless of their immigration status. All migrants\u2019 rights should matter. Not just in a crisis, but all the time.</p> <p>\u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats</p>",

government\u2019s public health measures.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Players can stay at home ... but could be asked to move if they live in a virus hotspot.</em></p> \n   <p><em>They will also be asked to

  "<p>If anyone was destined to make our current situation more bearable, it\u2019s Thundercat. Not only has the bass-playing, kitten ear-wearing, genre-blurring musician just released a new album \u2013 let\u2019s call it a self-isolation soundtrack. But, having worked with the likes of Snoop Dogg, Childish Gambino, Pharrell Williams and Erykah Badu, he has enough entertaining stories to last a lockdown.</p> <p>Such as the time he met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\">Prince</a> at one of the late star\u2019s infamous house parties. \u201cI was drunk, dancing, and he walks up and he\u2019s got them platform sandals, and he\u2019s got his shirt all shiny and stuff. And he goes: \u2018That\u2019s not how you do the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/26/guardianobituaries.usa\">James Brown</a> [shuffle].\u2019 And then he promptly did the James Brown in sandals, but I think he had just had hip surgery. So I think he may have moved a little too quick.\u201d Or when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jonimitchell\">Joni Mitchell</a> mocked him when she saw his leg tattoo of his bass hero, Jaco Pastorius. \u201cThey were close friends and played together. She said to me: \u2018Man, I loved him too, but I wouldn\u2019t get him inked on me.\u2019 And everybody laughed.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in mid-March, when things have already started seeming strange. \u201cIt feels like the opening scene in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4UcGhaS42A\" title=\"\">The Big Lebowski</a>, tumbleweed blowing down the street,\u201d says the 35-year-old, real name Stephen Bruner. Just like any other pre-show interview, we are sitting in a hotel restaurant. Except this time there is no show. A theatre looms opposite, its neon sign unlit, the words \u201cpostponed\u201d glaring out front. Everything is closed. A week previously, Brad Pitt had been spotted at Bruner\u2019s LA gig \u2013 \u201cit was pretty wild,\u201d he concurs. But now: tumbleweed. As with so many musicians this spring, the rest of his tour has been cancelled.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ormQQG2UhtQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ormQQG2UhtQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And yet, Bruner seems unfazed by the global pandemic taking place outside, or the fact he is about to release a fourth album in the middle of it. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just accepted that everything is terrible,\u201d he says. This lockdown is \u201cwhat has to happen because our president\u2019s a jackass. He let the coronavirus in. He just <em>let it</em> <em>in</em>. And probably had the intention to let it in just enough so he could get to [save the day and] stay president. Backfire!\u201d</p> <p>That attitude might sound a little nonchalant, but this has become a bit of a running theme. His new album is titled It Is What It Is, as if serving as a shrug of acquiescence at how unexpected and vicious life can be, after a few unusual years. In 2017, his screwball, falsetto-funk album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4xGQDKDHBI&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k210B4ojZQpxfcgQI_6gLYcecIPKGCe8c\">Drunk</a>, a 26-track joyride through subjects as disparate as police brutality and being friend-zoned, had taken him to a much wider audience. It featured stars such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wktuQhDLYic&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k210B4ojZQpxfcgQI_6gLYcecIPKGCe8c&amp;index=22\">Pharrell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV8HYokDWeE&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k210B4ojZQpxfcgQI_6gLYcecIPKGCe8c&amp;index=10\">Kendrick Lamar</a> and Mac Miller, appeared in best album lists everywhere and made genre hilariously irrelevant as he took out big, fat, fluorescent marker pens and liberally daubed over jazz-funk fusion, cosmic soul, prog, R&amp;B and lurid comedy skits like a 21st-century <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/13/fank-zappa-hot-rats-album-music-anniversary\">Frank Zappa</a>.</p> <p>Until then, Bruner had been best known for being the oddball bass player who contributed to Lamar\u2019s seminal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJe0rcvkpRg&amp;list=PLFvR2bZRQluxdZmyfSj5mW5mvNmtvt6Un&amp;index=2\">To Pimp </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJe0rcvkpRg&amp;list=PLFvR2bZRQluxdZmyfSj5mW5mvNmtvt6Un&amp;index=2\">a Butterfly</a> \u2013 winning a Grammy for the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6Y5h_cLN4&amp;list=PLFvR2bZRQluxdZmyfSj5mW5mvNmtvt6Un&amp;index=5\">These Walls</a> \u2013 as well as nimble noodling on childhood pal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kamasi-washington\">Kamasi Washington</a>\u2019s acclaimed jazz album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQRBzSN9Vw&amp;list=OLAK5uy_kjCOsQy9suACJkg5RBls_0ZOfzpT6Tovc\">The Epic</a>, various releases by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/flying-lotus\">Flying Lotus</a> (his longtime co-producer), including their soundtrack for Donald Glover\u2019s hit TV show Atlanta, and on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/aug/02/mac-miller-swimming-review\">Mac Miller\u2019s 2018 album Swimming</a>. After Drunk\u2019s success, Bruner puts it casually, he felt \u201clike I woke up in a different place\u201d. He is now an eccentric visionary as likely to appear on the cover of experimental music magazine The Wire as he is to perform on primetime American chat show Jimmy Kimmel or have his songs covered by Ariana Grande.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7ac32e5cc82e9d260e43a2f366e8f9398733655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7ac32e5cc82e9d260e43a2f366e8f9398733655/0_417_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Thundercat performing at FYF Fest, 2017.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thundercat performing at FYF Fest, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet despite this upward trajectory, the lows have been tough to take. Bruner struck up a close friendship with Mac Miller \u2013 you can see their doe-eyed bromance in their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrR_gm6RqCo\" title=\"\">Tiny Desk concert video</a> in August 2018. But it was the last performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/mac-miller-obituary\">Miller would do</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/mac-miller-obituary\">: a month later he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/mac-miller-obituary\">died, aged 26</a>, from an accidental overdose. Bruner spoke to him the night before; in the morning, he was gone. \u201cIt scared the shit out of me,\u201d says Bruner. Did he know Mac was in trouble? \u201cI mean, <em>we</em> were in trouble,\u201d he says, twirling one of his thin, bleached dreadlocks, \u201cbut you don\u2019t realise it all the time. It\u2019s sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. It\u2019s real. You ride the line, you don\u2019t know how close you are sometimes. Do I think he meant to die? No, I don\u2019t think he did. Even though that sometimes creeps in there because you\u2019re always on the edge of a knife. Sometimes you mess up. That happens a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Miller\u2019s death made Bruner confront some hard truths about his own lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking forever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a part of me. I was always that guy who\u2019s missing one of his shoes, covered in blood.\u201d He knew something had to change. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do the same things I\u2019d done before,\u201d he says. \u201cWitnessing my best friend pass away under such dark pretenses \u2026 I\u2019ve done that already. I watched it happen to Austin Peralta,\u201d the late musician about which much of 2013\u2019s Apocalypse was written. \u201cI was posed with this moment where it was like: either it\u2019s your turn to go or you walk the other way. That\u2019s what it felt like. You\u2019re gonna stop or you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d</p> <p>He got depressed, and then he got dumped, just before he was about to propose. \u201cMy best friend died and then the person I was in love with left me within the same couple of months,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my mind, I was right on the verge of getting married. And it broke my heart.\u201d After that, Bruner brought in some radical self-care measures. He stopped drinking, took up boxing and started being smarter about food. He\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll give up alcohol for good yet but adds: \u201cI just go with how I feel, and how I feel is that that part of my life has stopped. I am a different person right now.\u201d</p> <p>Bruner is a little more designer these days, with Gucci in place of the Native American headdresses and kneepads he used to wear. He is more philosophical in person than his George Clinton-rivalling style suggests, though that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t tweet about \u201cbeating the meat\u201d. His new album reflects this duality. Building on the squelchy hot mess of Drunk, It Is What It Is combines bananas interludes with songs about heartbreak, loss and, to quote one song title, \u201cexistential dread\u201d. Fair Chance, featuring rappers Ty Dolla $ign and Lil B, is a stunning tribute to Miller, Bruner\u2019s lambent bass sounding like rippling streams underneath. Unrequited Love pulls no punches about loneliness. The lyrics are as scrapbook-specific as they are funny: on Dragonball Durag, he sings to a potential lover: \u201cI may be covered in cat hair but I still smell good.\u201d</p> <p>Bruner says that these tossed-off thoughts help him to live in the moment and face hard truths, just like the work of his comedian friends, of which he has many. (One, standup Zack Fox, appears as a pilot on his new track Overseas.) Music and comedy, says Bruner, \u201care the places where you have to be most honest. The reason we love guys like Dave Chappelle and Jim Carrey is because they bare their soul. The better you are at that, the better you are at what you do. It\u2019s the same principle with music, especially with jazz: you\u2019re putting yourself out there.\u201d</p> <p>Bruner\u2019s own forays into furiously fast frettage with his brother Ronald Jr and friends such as Kamasi Washington helped lay the groundwork for LA\u2019s recent jazz renaissance. But Bruner was unconcerned by the genre\u2019s rigid rules: he also liked Slipknot and spent his high school years playing in thrash-punk band Suicidal Tendencies with his brother; he doesn\u2019t see \u201cseparation\u201d between scenes. </p> <p>Bruner\u2019s music frequently steamrolls over notions of taste. To some, the feathery soft-rock sounds of the 1970s often dubbed \u201cyacht rock\u201d denote all kinds of uncool; yet, on Drunk, he teamed up with Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald and it made perfect sense. He\u2019s also keen to continue to respect legacy. New single Black Squalls brings together 64-year-old Steve Arrington of 70s funk band Slave and 21-year-old the Internet guitarist Steve Lacy (Childish Gambino hops on the final verse). Bruner says that many young musicians don\u2019t know where the music they\u2019re making came from, so it\u2019s \u201cimportant to show that connectivity\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9069c6cd71a2a665f575e69913b04860afee6858\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9069c6cd71a2a665f575e69913b04860afee6858/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thundercat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pika performance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos G/The1point8</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black Qualls also defines \u201cwhat it means to be a young black artist right now,\u201d says Bruner, such as feeling paranoid, even guilty, about one\u2019s success, and \u201cwanting to hide your ability, just to be OK\u201d. He started delving into deeper subject matter after working on To Pimp a Butterfly. \u201cIt became like: what else do you have to say?\u201d says Bruner. \u201cI would walk into sessions,\u201d where Lamar would be giving \u201chis take on what he just saw and what he experienced emotionally. It was breathtaking. And I\u2019d be like: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do with this. Other than that take it and realise that there is so much more that I have to keep pushing the point on.\u201d</p> <p>With its refrain of \u201cno more living in fear\u201d, the track feels eerily prescient. Bruner says the message is open to interpretation \u201cdepending on where you\u2019re coming from \u2013 but because of where <em>I</em> come from, it is damn near literal\u201d. In the lyrics he sings: \u201cWanna post this on the Gram, but don\u2019t think I should.\u201d (At the start of this year, rapper Pop Smoke was murdered in a robbery at his house after posting on Instagram, while in March 2019, Nipsey Hussle was shot dead in a parking lot.) \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate reality we live in when it comes to stuff like that,\u201d says Bruner.</p> <p>The unfortunate reality that we are also living in is that, after this interview concludes, self-isolation is on the cards. But Bruner remains unperturbed: he writes most of his music alone anyway, he says, and enjoys spending time with his cat, Tron. \u201cShe still pees on everything. It reminds me to stay feral.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not worried about what happens next. \u201cI\u2019m about as worried as I\u2019ve been since I was five,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to be infatuated with nuclear war. I remember realising then the power that man has over man in general \u2013 what we\u2019re capable of doing to each other terrified me. After that, I just accepted it. We just do arbitrary, stupid shit to each other.\u201d</p> <p>He references the cartoon meme of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11592622/this-is-fine-meme-comic\">smiling dog</a> sitting in a burning house and telling himself: \u201cThis is fine.\u201d \u201cThe moments that I thought I was gonna die, I was just like, this is fine. This makes sense. It really freaks my friends out because whenever you can see something happening, I calm down. It\u2019s just what it is.\u201d</p> <p><em>It Is</em> <em>What It Is is out</em> <em>now</em></p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-tyler\">Anne Tyler</a>\u2019s UK tour for her latest novel became an early victim of the coronavirus, and her publisher announced that the 78-year-old would be conducting all media interviews by phone from the safety of her home in Baltimore, Tyler felt some relief, but mainly she felt guilt. She is one of the world\u2019s most acclaimed modern novelists, winner of both a Pulitzer (for <em>Breathing Lessons</em>, 1988) and the National Book Critics Circle award (for <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, 1995, which was turned into an Oscar-winning film) and a finalist for the Man Booker (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/04/a-spool-of-blue-thread-anne-tyler-review\">A Spool of Blue Thread</a></em>, 2015) and the Women\u2019s prize for fiction (<em>Ladder of Years</em> from 1995, and <em>A Spool of Blue Thread</em>). But until 2012, she maintained a silence as assiduous as that of Thomas Pynchon or JD Salinger. She never liked \u2013 and still doesn\u2019t, but needs must in today\u2019s world \u2013 talking about how she does what she does, because that leads to self-consciousness, which is never good for creativity.</p> <p>So she was \u201ckind of relieved\u201d when the tour was cancelled. \u201cBut I remember I used to pray the school would burn down before a math test the next day. Yet if it had actually burned down I would have felt <em>so</em> guilty. So now I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh dear, be careful what you wish for!\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Phone interviews are generally frustrating, a mess of missed connections and awkward interruptions. But Tyler has a manner that is as open and engaging as her prose, her conversation punctuated by charming anachronisms such as \u201cbestir\u201d and \u201calas\u201d, and it soon feels as if I know her as well as I know her brilliantly drawn characters. As I, too, am now working from home I start by apologising for the background noise of children and dogs. \u201cOh I love to hear children and dogs! That sounds good to me. I love normal life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For the past half-century, Tyler has been the pre-eminent novelist of normal life. She is famously good at summing up a character in a precise line (\u201cShe had not grown fuller or softer with age. She was like certain supermarket vegetables that turn from green to withered without ever ripening\u201d \u2013 from <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em>, 1982), but twice she tells me she is \u201cno good at plot, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed\u201d. It\u2019s true that no one would mistake aTyler novel for a John Grisham, but no one can match her evocation of the moments that build up a life: the awkward family meals, the day your spouse suddenly seems like a stranger, trying to make sense of how you have become the adult you are today, the conflicted gestures we make at trying to be good. \u201cTime passing is a plot. You can\u2019t not have something happen if the years go by,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5b84ebed63786a57def3726937a1794c436444fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b84ebed63786a57def3726937a1794c436444fd/0_0_320_499/320.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Tyler Redhead by the Side of the Road\" width=\"320\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As a child, Tyler\u2019s favourite book was the American classic <em>The Little House</em> by Virginia Lee Burton, about a house watching a city sprout up around it. Her fans \u2013 who have ranged from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\">John Updike</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jacquelinewilson\">Jacqueline Wilson</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/nickhornby\">Nick Hornby</a> \u2013 will recognise her memory of hoping the school would burn down as classic Tyler: her novels are studded with adult characters evoking childhood sensations, pleating time, revealing the truth of the adult through the child they were. In 2018\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/24/clock-dance-anne-tyler-review\">Clock Dance</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/24/clock-dance-anne-tyler-review\">,</a> a widow compares recovering from grief to \u201crainy days in her childhood when she would resign herself to staying in, reading or watching daytime TV, and then in the afternoon the sun would break through unexpectedly and she would think, Oh. I guess I can go outside now. Isn\u2019t that \u2026 a good thing, I guess.\u201d In <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, Macon Leary empathetically imagines his young son Ethan\u2019s last moments before he was killed in a violent crime: \u201cmeekly moving to the kitchen with the others, placing his hands flat against the wall as he was ordered and no doubt bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more in touch with my emotions and the visceral sensory from childhood than any other part of life. I don\u2019t know if it helps with creativity, but I do know that when I talk to other writers they talk about their childhood in great detail,\u201d Tyler says. (She also still has residues of that childlike belief that one can make something happen by thinking about it. Just as she used to worry she would cause the school to burn down through wishing it, when I ask how she could bear to write the scene of Ethan\u2019s murder in <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, she says she deliberately made him younger than her two daughters were then, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t think as they came up to that age, \u2018Oh no, what have I set in motion?\u2019\u201d)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that\u2019s because I had really good men in my life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her new novel, <em>Redhead by the Side of the Road</em>, her 23rd, features many of the usual Tyler tropes. Its protagonist, Micah, is a man, as so many of Tyler\u2019s greatest characters are, which is partly why she has so many male fans. Writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/13/why-men-love-anne-tyler-novels\">in this paper</a> in 2012, Mark Lawson put her cross-gender appeal down to the way \u201cshe deals sympathetically and redemptively with male fecklessness and helplessness\u201d. Tyler grew up with three brothers and was happily married for 34 years to Taghi Mohammad Modarressi, an Iranian psychiatrist, until his death in 1997. \u201cI am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that\u2019s because I had really good men in my life. They made me feel comfortable and I thought, \u2018OK, they\u2019re not so different from me,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> <p>Like many of Tyler\u2019s male characters \u2013 Ian in <em>Saint Maybe</em>, Barnaby in <em>A Patchwork Planet</em>, Jesse in <em>Breathing Lessons</em>, Ezra in <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em> \u2013 Micah has let his life drift past him after a youthful regret. Like Macon in <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>, he tries to counter the loss of control over his life by adhering to self-coined rules about when he cleans the kitchen, how he makes the bed, how he drives. \u201cMicah\u201d even sounds like \u201cMacon\u201d, but when I ask Tyler if the echo was deliberate she says no. \u201cBut I do often have fantasies about my characters ending up in the same little part of town and running into one another, so I can picture Micah and Macon doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Like all of Tyler\u2019s characters, Micah lives in Baltimore, as Tyler herself has done for more than 50 years. She has said that she\u2019s a writer so she can live out different lives, but it seems that whatever life she imagines, she always wants to live in Baltimore. \u201cYes, that\u2019s probably true. It\u2019s a city with character, but it is also laziness on my part \u2013 by setting the book here I don\u2019t have to do much research,\u201d she says with easy self-deprecation. I cannot let that pass: her books are full of meticulous research, such as the accurate period details in her decades-spanning family sagas, <em>The Amateur Marriage</em> and <em>A Spool of Blue Thread</em>. She meticulously writes her books out in longhand multiple times, and then reads them into a recorder and listens back to make sure the dialogue suits each character and there are no clangers. The idea that Tyler defaults to anything in her books out of laziness is nonsense \u2013 she just loves her city.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, I do love it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, it was a total accident that I came to the city, it was just for my husband\u2019s job. For the first two years we were saying, \u2018We made a mistake, let\u2019s go back.\u2019 But then you sink in, little by little.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike her other novels, <em>Redhead </em><em>by the Side of the Road</em> features multiple references to current events. Micah avoids watching the news because it\u2019s too \u201cdepressing\u201d, but he can\u2019t block out the \u201cunspeakably sad\u201d bulletins from his clock radio: \u201ca mass shooting in a synagogue; whole families are dying in Yemen; immigrant children torn from their parents will never, ever be the same, even if by some unlikely chance they are reunited tomorrow.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/02/redhead-by-the-side-of-the-road-by-anne-tyler-review-quietly-profound\">Redhead by the Side of the Road by Anne Tyler review \u2013 quietly profound</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was writing the book already by the time Trump was in office and all that was going on. So I consciously felt it would be immoral to pretend life was just la la la. I don\u2019t want to be one of those people who ties their novel to current events so it\u2019s practically out of a newspaper, but at the same time I felt I should mention that it is an unhappy time,\u201d she says. Her books often end optimistically, showing human kindness. But is she having trouble maintaining that optimism about humanity in the current political climate? She hesitates for a second. \u201cNot up close, if you know what I mean. Up close you\u2019ll always see things to be optimistic about.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler grew up in Quaker communities around the south and midwest, the eldest of four children. She did not attend mainstream school until she was 11, and a common theme in her books is a character looking at the \u201cnormal\u201d world and trying to understand how it works, such as Micah feeling bewildered by the happy couples he sees on his morning jogs, or Aaron flummoxed by marriage in <em>The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye</em>: \u201cIt seemed we just never quite got the hang of being a couple the way other people did. We should have taken lessons or something; that\u2019s what I tell myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the first things that happened when I joined the school was I was surrounded by these girls and they were asking me all these questions. One said, \u2018Do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m only 11.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I know, do you have a boyfriend?\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m in another world here.\u2019 It was very tough to figure out, and I remember it very clearly,\u201d Tyler says. While at university, she started to write short stories, and then published her first novel, <em>The Tin Can Tree,</em> when she was 23. Aside from a five-year break to raise her daughters, she has written steadily ever since.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was a better writer when I was younger.

I have no hobbies. So then I feel guilty when I say to my agent, \u2018I seem to have another book ready if you want to take a look at it \u2026\u2019\u201d she says. Her ideal day would involve several hours of \u201cgood involved writing, the kind when you suddenly look up and three hours have gone by\u201d.</p> <p>While liking Tyler\u2019s books is as uncontroversial as liking chocolate, there have been some criticisms over the years, some more fair than others. Those who dismiss her as sentimental (\u201cour foremost NutraSweet novelist\u201d, one American critic wrote) overlook the biting humour in her work. \u201cRepetitive\u201d is more merited, although the familiar plots are shells for her elegant writing and characterisation, which are never boring. Yet I\u2019ve found some of her more recent novels less satisfying than her mid-career peak of <em>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant</em>, <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> and <em>Breathing Lessons</em>. The New York Times\u2019 former book critic Michiko Kakutani <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/books/the-beginners-goodbye-by-anne-tyler.html\">put it more strongly</a> in 2012 when she complained that instead of the \u201cintimate knowledge of her characters\u2019 inner lives\u201d we get in Tyler\u2019s earlier books, the characters in <em>The Beginner\u2019s Goodbye</em> are \u201cirritating stick figures\u201d.</p> <p>But Tyler is her own best critic. She recently reread <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> for the first time in many years. \u201cAnd one of the things I thought was, \u2018I think I was a better writer when I was younger.\u2019\u201d What made her think that? \u201cI was more detailed, I took more time. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in a rush now, but I trust the reader more. I don\u2019t feel like I have to say that much about the character\u2019s inner feelings. But then as I read <em>The Accidental Tourist</em> I thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s kind of nice to see all of Macon\u2019s inner feelings there.\u2019\u201d Aptly for a writer who always sees the best in her characters, Tyler\u2019s mistake was perhaps trusting some of her readers too much.</p> <p>Her daughters live in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and Tyler knows she has a tendency towards self-isolation, whether there\u2019s a global pandemic or not, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s always healthy\u201d. So \u201cto bring the world into me\u201d, she has \u2013 when life is normal \u2013 regular nights at her home with friends, including a weekly friendship group she calls \u201cWine Therapy\u201d. She is already working on her next book, \u201cand once again, it\u2019s about a family and set in Baltimore\u201d, she says in a tone of pure self-mockery. Then with the grace that comes from a lifetime of self-knowledge, sinking in little by little, she adds, \u201cAnd I love all that.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Redhead by the Side of the Road</em> is published by Chatto.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve been reading a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/nora-ephron\" title=\"\">Nora Ephron</a> recently because, well, who needs a reason? Although in this case, there is one. I miss spending time with my friends \u2013 in person, that is, as opposed to through a screen. My friends are, in the vast main, funny and smart women, and in the absence of meeting up with them in the pub or park, I get into bed every night with Ephron, the smartest, funniest and most female writer of all, who wrote just as brilliantly about feminist politics as she did about her frustration that her <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2015/07/06/a-few-words-about-breasts-from-nora-ephron/\" title=\"\">breasts weren\u2019t bigger</a>. (Honestly, Nora, the breast thing? It\u2019s overrated.)</p> <p>When Ephron died in 2012, obituarists were spoiled for choice about which of her writings to quote: a pithy line from Heartburn, her novel about her divorce, or an irresistible bit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/when-harry-met-sally\" title=\"\">When Harry Met Sally</a>, which is every single line of that film. (\u201cA Sheldon can do your taxes. If you need a root canal, Sheldon\u2019s your man. But humping and pumping is not Sheldon\u2019s strong suit.\u201d I have a condition that makes it physically impossible for me to mention WHMS without quoting it.)</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron-how-miss-her\" title=\"\">every journalist who covered her death</a> quoted from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron-miss-wont-miss\" title=\"\">the then little-known lists</a> about what she would and wouldn\u2019t miss after she died, from her final book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/nora-ephrons-final-act.html\" title=\"\">I Remember Nothing</a>, which she wrote when she and almost no one else knew she was dying. What made those lists so affecting was that they were mainly small things, both specific and entirely relatable, like all of Ephron\u2019s writing. Bras, polls and panels on Women in Film are not currently being missed by Ephron; but dinner with friends, fireworks and pie are.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about those lists, not because I\u2019m dying, but because normal life has, for now, died for all of us. I have gone through the five stages of grief: shock that I am living through a global plague; fear for those I love; sadness about all the cancelled plans; irritation with the lack of online delivery slots; delusion that I\u2019ll spend the next three months reading Proust instead of staring at my phone. (A mix of existential terror and petty flouncing sums up my feelings during All This.)</p> <p>I am lucky: no one in my family is sick (yet), but I miss normal life, when I didn\u2019t leap in terror any time someone near me coughed, like a Victorian maiden. And yet, without wishing to seek out a nonexistent silver lining, there have also been things I don\u2019t miss. They are all small things, but it\u2019s only by focusing on the details that life feels manageable right now. Once I start thinking about the macro (my parents, my kids) instead of the micro (cancelled holidays, postponed cinema dates), hello, 3am insomnia.</p> <p>Yoga classes have become much more Zen. Instead of having to schlep to a studio, internally grumping if my favourite spot in the room (front right corner) is taken and then hating the person on the next mat for being so much better, I do online lessons alone in my bedroom. I always get the best spot and I am definitely the best in the room. So much time and internalised fuming saved!</p> <p>When I was pregnant with my twins during a heatwave, I resented the impediments to my physical freedom. But then I realised the upside: no one could give me any grief for having an elective C-section \u2013 or hiring six gold-painted men to carry me around on a plinth, should I so desire. Self-isolation has, weirdly, brought a similar release. No longer do I have to feel guilty for not going to this or that play, as I chronically do, even though I hate the theatre because I can never figure out when to eat dinner (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/commentisfree/2020/jan/04/forget-cats-marriage-story-musical-highlight-of-my-holiday\" title=\"\">Sondheim musicals</a> are the exception).

In my lower moments, I have looked at the comparative freedom of my childfree friends with the same envy with which they now look at my garden. But it is lovely to eat three meals a day with my kids, and to see how much they love it, too. Self-isolating with their parents is, I have realised, a small child\u2019s fantasy come to life. (This is possibly less true of teenagers. Turns out my decision to wait to have kids until I was 102 really worked out for the best.)</p> <p>Here, then, is the official list of things I do and do not miss.</p> <p><strong>What I miss</strong> The first sip of a cool drink in a dark bar; bumping into a friend; getting a late cab home and listening to Magic FM; booking holidays, especially with friends; ice-cream in a cone.</p> <p><strong>What I don\u2019t </strong>Small talk; feeling guilty about not having people over for dinner; cold afternoons in the playground; ready-made sandwiches.</p> <p>Yes, small things. But Harry realised he loved Sally when he loved that it took her an hour and a half to order a sandwich. As Ephron understood better than anyone, when life feels overwhelming, it\u2019s the insignificant details that are the most revealing.</p>",

  "<p>Unwanted by her father and so abandoned by her mother, in 1953 a baby girl is found under a mulberry tree in wealthy north Tehran. Carrying her home to the impoverished tenements of the southern city, Behrouz \u2013 an army driver who, as a motherless boy, pretended to be a mother himself \u2013 names her Aria. It\u2019s usually a boy\u2019s name meaning \u201cthe Iranian race\u201d, but Behrouz intends the musical sense of the word: \u201clittle tales, cries in the night\u201d. This ambiguity continues, for as Aria grows, she wavers between opposed categories: rich and poor, educated and illiterate, orthodox Shia Muslim and something else. Years later Behrouz reflects on his charge: \u201cShe had somehow acquired the ability to be two things in one.\u201d<br><br>His neighbours are generally hostile to this illegitimate child. \u201cI bet with those blue eyes that girl\u2019s a Jew or a jinn\u2019s daughter,\u201d says one. And Behrouz\u2019s wife, Zahra, the first in a line of false or flawed mother figures, beats and neglects the orphan, often locking her out on the balcony. Her bad behaviour is glaring, but Zahra turns out to be a complex character. One of the many strengths of this strong debut by Iranian-Canadian novelist Nazanine Hozar is that every character is contextualised and therefore humanised by an explanatory backstory.</p> <p>And the balcony isn\u2019t so bad. Here Aria is able to communicate with Kamran, the neighbour\u2019s cleft-lipped son, who climbs a tree to deliver bracelets and sweets to her. His love for Aria will develop through the years, and his bitterness after rejection help shape his later career.</p> <p>Aria finally escapes from Zahra, and makes an upward jump in class when she is adopted by Fereshteh, childless heir of a family who are ex-Zoroastrians, and once silversmiths to the shahs. Aria calls her \u201cMana\u201d; almost but not quite her Mama. The minor characters populating Fereshteh\u2019s urban palace are distinct and memorable \u2013 the foul-mouthed old servant Massoomeh, Fereshteh\u2019s brief husband Mahmoud, and Uncle Jafar who has OCD and tunes pianos, polishes coins and washes newspapers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tehran\u2019s diversity is expertly conjured \u2013 its cinemas, processions, opium dealers, Jews, Christians, Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds and Muslims</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By now a feisty child, prone to throwing things around and asking embarrassing questions, Aria settles nonetheless into a comfortable north Tehran life of parks, ice-cream parlours and modern schooling. Of her new friends, Hamlet, son of a rich Armenian businessman, is briefly abducted by an angry mob, and Mitra is deprived of her father, arrested for his leftist activism.</p> <p>If Aria embodies Iranian complexity, this story of her young life serves as a vehicle for the national story of the quarter-century leading up to the 1979 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iranian-revolution/2010/feb/11/all\">Islamic revolution</a>. Hozar shows rather than tells the reader of the economic divisions and swelling resentments that precipitated the change. The social tension rises steadily as the novel progresses, adding to its compelling pace. And her method of describing the paranoid and increasingly febrile political environment from the perspectives of children and teenagers is surprisingly effective, communicating key historical information alongside a general sense of mounting confusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dec91e6820dbd96398b9563c265299c80615a435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dec91e6820dbd96398b9563c265299c80615a435/0_121_2349_1410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nazanine Hozar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazanine Hozar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rafal Gerszak</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Details of Aria\u2019s origin are slowly revealed, and her fate changed, by a swirl of hints, secrets, letters and a mysterious stash of money. Tehran\u2019s diversity is expertly conjured in this section \u2013 its cinemas as well as its self-flagellating Ashura processions, its opium dealers on bicycles, its Polish immigrants, and Jews, Christians and Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds as well as Muslims.</p> <p>Perhaps the strongest character in this warm-hearted book is Behrouz: gentle, long-suffering and the one steady and reliable person in the flux of Aria\u2019s life. His stories told from the steering wheel \u2013 of the mythic king Rostam, the phoenix, Mount Damavand, the valley of the assassins \u2013 evoke the symbolic riches of Iranian culture accumulated over 7,000 years.</p> <p>But, as Behrouz observes, \u201cwhen something is that old it begins to crack\u201d. By the late 1970s, people from the university to the bazaar, from north Tehranto the south city, are engaged in political meetings, in which leftists and Islamists compete and cooperate. They distribute illicit cassettes on which speeches by the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini are hidden between songs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\">the Beatles</a>. The final section takes in curfews, riots, food shortages and snipers on rooftops, and then Khomeini\u2019s triumphant return from exile, vowing that he doesn\u2019t seek power for himself.</p> <p>Aria is a hugely enjoyable book crammed with artful devices, described by Margaret Atwood as \u201ca <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> of Iran\u201d. Notwithstanding some slightly underwritten sections, its skilful blending of personal and political drama, along with its broad scope, richness of setting and vitality of character, gives it something of the quality of that epic.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Aria by Nazanine Hozar is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).

We\u2019re going to discover this.\u201d It is something we\u2019re all discovering, at speed: how a single conversation can tilt the world back to normality, even if only by five degrees.</p> <p>We know analysts prefer face-to-face contact, to an almost tyrannical degree. And we know we\u2019re not allowed to have it right now. So the question is, are there upsides to remote therapy? Some analysts have been offering Skype sessions for some time, such as Anna Blundy, who co-founded the <a href=\"https://themindfield.world/about/\" title=\"\">Mind Field</a> for aid workers in conflict zones. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive advantage in the lack of stigma attached,\u201d she says, going on to describe how much of an impact that can have \u2013 whether that means people working in a very tight-knit environment who feel under surveillance, or people who would feel professionally tarnished if they showed any strain, or people who feel so ashamed of needing help that the act of travelling to get it makes them feel vulnerable, even if they\u2019re unlikely to be seen.</p> <p>Sally Warren, who works for the Mind Field and runs a traditional practice from her home in London, says that, since \u201call the rules are out of the window because of this virus\u201d, there is more room for experimentation: a therapist would probably agree to a couple of sessions to get you over an immediate crisis, whereas in normal life it would typically be a longer commitment.</p> <p>Tarkow-Reinisch drills into the benefits of speaking from your own home: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the same room, there\u2019s something about the lack of distance between you that makes people rein their emotion in. My patients tend to cry much more freely when they\u2019re on Skype. Patients who are the victims of physical trauma feel safer online.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/25/fit-in-my-40s-im-doing-yoga-at-home-its-free-but-can-i-ignore-the-carpet-stains\">Fit in my 40s: I\u2019m doing yoga at home.

  "<p><em>Andr</em><em>\u00e0 tutto bene</em>, the Italians have taught us to think, but in truth, will everything be better the day after? It may seem premature, in the midst of what Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/26/emmanuel-macron-drafts-french-military-into-coronavirus-war-video\">has described</a> as \u201ca war against an invisible enemy\u201d, to consider the political and economic consequences of a distant peace. Few attempt a definitive review of a play after the first three scenes.</p> \n<p>Yet world leaders, diplomats and geopolitical analysts know they are living through epoch-making times and have one eye on the daily combat, the other on what this crisis will bequeath the world. Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion.</p> \n<p>Already everyone in the global village is starting to draw lessons. In France, Macron has predicted \u201cthis period will have taught us a lot. Many certainties and convictions will be swept away. Many things that we thought were impossible are happening. The day after when we have won, it will not be a return to the day before, we will be stronger morally.

In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi has called for a commission into the future. In Hong Kong, graffiti reads: \u201cThere can be no return to normal because normal was the problem in the first place.\u201d Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state under Richard Nixon, says rulers must prepare now to transition to a post-coronavirus world order.</p> \n<p>The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCHARDtalk/status/1243207828317274112?s=20\">said</a>: \u201cThe relationship between the biggest powers has never been as dysfunctional. Covid-19 is showing dramatically, either we join [together] ... or we can be defeated.\u201d</p> \n<p>The discussion in global thinktanks rages, not about cooperation, but whether the Chinese or the US will emerge as leaders of the post-coronavirus world.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the debate has been relatively insular. The outgoing Labour leadership briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/25/corbyn-uses-final-pmqs-press-johnson-coronavirus-response\">searched for vindication</a> in the evident rehabilitation of the state and its workforce. The definition of public service has been extended to include the delivery driver and the humble corner shop owner.

In The Road to 1945, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/04/paul-addison-obituary\">Paul Addison</a>\u2019s definitive account of how the second world war helped turn Britain to the left, he quotes the diary of the journalist JL Hodson in September 1944: \u201cNo excuses any more for unemployment and slums and underfeeding. We have shown in this war we British don\u2019t muddle through. Using even half the vision and energy and invention and pulling together we\u2019ve done in this war and what is there we cannot do? We\u2019ve virtually exploded the argument of old fogies and Better Notters who said we cannot afford this and mustn\u2019t do that. Our heavy taxation and rationing of food has willy nilly achieved some levelling up of the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the same vein, Boris Johnson has been forced to unleash the state, but the impact in Britain seems more noticeable on civil society than politics. The famously standoffish British are no longer bowling alone. The sense of communal effort, the volunteer health workers, the unBritish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">clapping on doorsteps</a>, all add to the sense that lost social capital is being reformed. But there is not yet much discussion of a new politics. Perhaps the nation, exhausted by Brexit, cannot cope with more introspection and upheaval.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Europe, the US and Asia the discussion has broadened out. Public life may be at a standstill, but public debate has accelerated. Everything is up for debate \u2013 the trade-offs between a trashed economy and public health, the relative virtues of centralised or regionalised health systems, the exposed fragilities of globalisation, the future of the EU, populism, the inherent advantage of authoritarianism.</p> \n<p>It is as if the pandemic has turned into a competition for global leadership, and it will be the countries that most effectively respond to the crisis that will gain traction. Diplomats, operating out of emptied embassies, are busy defending their governments\u2019 handling of the crisis, and often take deep offence to criticism. National pride, and health, are at stake.<strong> </strong>Each country looks at their neighbour to see how quickly they are \u201cflattening the curve\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Crisis Group thinktank, in assessing how the virus will permanently change international politics, suggests: \u201cFor now we can discern two competing narratives gaining currency \u2013 one in which the lesson is that countries ought to come together to better defeat Covid-19, and one in which the lesson is that countries need to stand apart in order to better protect themselves from it.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe crisis also represents a stark test of the competing claims of liberal and illiberal states to better manage extreme social distress. As the pandemic unfolds it will test not only the operational capacities of organisations like the WHO and the UN but also the basic assumptions about the values and political bargains that underpin them.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebc8c583b87d36fcabd9c92e18e046d599bfb23a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebc8c583b87d36fcabd9c92e18e046d599bfb23a/0_55_4330_2597/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A Russian plane delivers medical equipment to Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Russian plane delivers medical equipment to Spain.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Jordan/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many are already claiming that the east has won this war of competing narratives.

People are less rebellious and more obedient than in Europe. They trust the state more. Daily life is much more organised. Above all, to confront the virus Asians are strongly committed to digital surveillance. The epidemics in Asia are fought not only by virologists and epidemiologists, but also computer scientists and big data specialists.\u201d</p> \n<p>He predicts: \u201cChina will now be able to sell its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">digital police state</a> as a model of success against the pandemic. China will display the superiority of its system even more proudly.\u201d He claims western voters, attracted to safety and community, might be willing to sacrifice those liberties.

A new generation of young assertive Chinese diplomats have taken to social media to assert their country\u2019s superiority. Michel Duclos, the former French ambassador now at the Institut Montaigne, has accused China of \u201cshamelessly trying to capitalise on the country\u2019s \u2018victory against the virus\u2019 to promote its political system. The kind of undeclared cold war that had been brewing for some time shows its true face under the harsh light of Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Harvard international relations theorist Stephen Walt thinks China may succeed. Offering a first take<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/03/united-states-can-still-win-coronavirus-pandemic-power/\"> to Foreign Policy magazine</a>, he suggests: \u201cCoronavirus will accelerate the shift of power and influence from west to east. South Korea and Singapore have shown the best response and China has managed well in the aftermath of its initial mistakes. The governments\u2019 response in Europe and the US has been very sceptical and likely to weaken the power of the western brand.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many on the European left, such as the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, also fear an authoritarian contagion, predicting in the west \u201ca new barbarism with a human face \u2013 ruthless survivalist measures enforced with regret and even sympathy, but legitimised by expert opinions\u201d.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Shivshankar Menon, a visiting professor at Ashoka University in India, says: \u201cExperience so far shows that authoritarians or populists are no better at handling the pandemic. Indeed, the countries that responded early and successfully, such as Korea and Taiwan, have been democracies \u2013 not those run by populist or authoritarian leaders.\u201d</p> \n<p>Francis Fukuyama concurs: \u201cThe major dividing line in effective crisis response will not place autocracies on one side and democracies on the other. The crucial determinant in performance will not be the type of regime, but the state\u2019s capacity and, above all, trust in government.\u201d He has praised Germany and South Korea.</p> \n<p>South Korea is in fact selling itself as the democratic power, in contrast to China, that has best handled the crisis. Its national press is full of articles on how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/germanys-devolved-logic-is-helping-it-win-the-coronavirus-race\">Germany is following</a> the South Korean model of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">mass testing</a>.</p> \n<p>But South Korea, an export-oriented economy, also faces long-term difficulties if the pandemic forces the west, as Prof Joseph Stiglitz predicts, into a total reassessment of the global supply chain. He argues the pandemic has revealed the drawbacks of concentrating production of medical supplies. As a result, just-in-time imports will go down and production of domestically sourced goods will go up. South Korea may gain kudos, but lose markets.</p> \n<p>The loser at the moment, apart from those like Steve Bannon who argued for \u201cthe deconstruction of the administrative state\u201d, risks being the EU.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of Europe\u2019s most scathing critics have been the pro-Europeans. Nicole Gnesotto, the vice-president of the Jacques Delors Institute thinktank, says: \u201cThe EU\u2019s lack of preparations, its powerlessness, its timidity are staggering. Of course, health is not part of its competency, but it is not without means or responsibility.\u201d The first instinct was to close borders, hoard equipment and assemble national responses. In times of scarcity it emerged every person was for themself, and Italy felt most left to itself.</p> \n<p>But the dispute has widened into an ugly battle between north and south Europe over the isssuance of common debt, or the conditions that could be set for any credit issued by the eurozone bailout fund. The Dutch and Germans suspect Italy is using the crisis in Lombardy to rebrand the rejected concept of eurobonds in which the north finances the debts of the feckless south. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is pushing the issue, telling the bloc \u201cit has an appointment with history\u201d. If the EU fails, it could fall apart, he has warned.</p> \n<p>The Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, spoke of \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cpetty\u201d comments by the Dutch minister Wopke Hoekstra, while the Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, wondered whether the Dutch understood that \u201ca first-class cabin would not protect you when the whole ship sinks\u201d.</p> \n<p>The former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta has been scathing about Dutch resistance to helping Italy, telling the Dutch press that the Italian view of the Netherlands has been seriously damaged: \u201cIt did not help that a day after German customs officials stopped a huge amount of masks at the border, Russian trucks carrying relief supplies drove through the streets of Rome and millions of masks were sent from China. Matteo Salvini is waiting for this type of action from the Netherlands and Germany so that he can say: you see, we have no use for the European Union.\u201d</p> \n<p>The EU\u2019s position is not irretrievable. Salvini\u2019s closure agenda has not yet found its footing, since Conte\u2019s popularity does not make the prime minister an easy target. Conte has become the single most popular leader in the history of the Italian republic. Individual German politicians, such as Marian Wendt, have also undone some of the damage by organising for a group of Italians to be flown from Bergamo to Cologne for treatment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddc0540c2d3df43693a70c493fd0e48ecd6e5fc1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddc0540c2d3df43693a70c493fd0e48ecd6e5fc1/0_300_4347_2610/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A person in protective gear stands at the balcony of a Vatican building on Via della Conciliazione in Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy has often felt alone within the EU in its battle against coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But with the death toll mounting across Europe, and the crisis just starting to penetrate Africa, the EU discourse so far has been dominated by an unedifying and highly technical row about how to fund the EU\u2019s economic rescue.</p> \n<p>Europe\u2019s chief solace is to look across the Atlantic and watch the daily chaos that is Donald Trump\u2019s evening press conference \u2013 the daily reminder that rational people can plan for anything, except an irrational president. Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, wonders whether, much like the 1956 Suez crisis symbolised the ultimate decay of the UK\u2019s global power, coronavirus could mark the \u201cSuez moment\u201d for the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Borrell himself insists the EU is finding its feet after a rocky start and the case for cooperation is being won. Writing <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-priorities-covid19-response-by-josep-borrell-2020-03\">in Project Syndicate</a>, he claims: \u201cAfter a first phase of diverging national decisions, we are now entering a phase of convergence in which the EU takes centre stage. The world initially met the crisis in an uncoordinated fashion, with too many countries ignoring the warning signs and going it alone. It is now clear that the only way out of it is together.\u201d</p> \n<p>He may be proved right, but at the moment the scales are evenly balanced. There is, as yet, a world still to be won.</p>",
  "<p>There is now the terrible possibility that Britain may match or even overtake Italy and Spain as the country in Europe that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-will-be-europes-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-study-predicts\">suffers most from the coronavirus pandemic</a>. This tragedy has a political, as well as a biological, epidemiology. Those seeking to trace its path may look back on a telling moment \u2013 paradoxically the one at which the government finally changed course and fell into line with most of the rest of Europe. On 20 March, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/20/uk-coronavirus-live-confusion-over-key-workers-list-as-schools-close\">announced the closure</a> of pubs, clubs and restaurants. Even as he did so, however, he made it clear that this decision was an assault on the national character.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go the pub,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can understand how people feel about that.\u201d Lest his anguish be in any doubt, he underscored the point: \u201cTo repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people.\u201d The message was \u2013 what exactly? You must not go to the pub but your right to do so is \u201cinalienable\u201d (which is to say absolute and irrevocable). You must stay at home but, if you so do, you will be a disgrace to your freedom-loving ancestors.</p> \n<p>The Sun <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11242643/brits-beat-coronavirus-lockdown-diy-pubs/\">reported the prime minister\u2019s remarks</a> rather differently: \u201cMr Johnson said he realised it went against what he called \u2018the inalienable free-born right of people born in England to go to the pub\u2019.\u201d In this version, the freedom to go to the pub was conferred by genetics and history, not on the \u201cpeople of the United Kingdom\u201d or \u201cthe British people\u201d, but on \u201cpeople born in England\u201d. It does not apply to Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish people and certainly not to the 9.4 million people living in the UK who were born abroad. It is a particular Anglo-Saxon privilege.</p> \n<p>And since we are in the terrain of the ludicrous, the Sun\u2019s version actually made more sense. There is, of course, no ancient and absolute right to go to the pub \u2013 inns and public houses have been regulated in England at least since the 15th century. But what Johnson was really evoking was a very specific English sense of exceptionalism, a fantasy of personal freedom as a marker of ethnic and national identity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a01c98ee-1da8-4dbb-b816-af3dabe22d9b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6j_jHXV8LMs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That exceptionalism is not, alas, mere rhetorical self-indulgence. It helped to shape official policy towards the Covid-19 crisis. It lies behind both the idea that there should be a distinctive British response to this global challenge, and the assumption that there was something peculiarly unnatural in expecting Brits to obey drastic restrictions. Its legacy is the globally discredited policy of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-government-policy-herd-immunity-community-surveillance-covid-19\">herd immunity</a>\u201d and the late introduction, squandering Britain\u2019s head start, of the lockdown.</p> \n<p>The prime minister himself has long cultivated the notion that he does not just espouse this freedom-loving exceptionalism \u2013 he embodies it. In the early stages of the crisis, Johnson\u2019s admirers could see it as his Finest Hour, the moment when his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/johnson-as-churchill-history-repeat-as-farce\">Churchillian posturing</a> would become real and he would save his country. When the prime minister was hospitalised, his overwrought friend and fan Toby Young confessed in the Spectator to \u201ca kind of mystical belief in Britain\u2019s greatness and her ability to occasionally bring forth remarkable individuals \u2026 who can serve her at critical junctures. I\u2019ve always thought of Boris as one of those people \u2013 not just suspected it, but known it in my bones.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s Churchill impersonation has always been a way of claiming that his own waywardness is not mere self-indulgence but the mark of a special (and idiosyncratically English) destiny. In his book, The Churchill Factor, he wrote of his idol: \u201cThere is a sense in which [Churchill\u2019s] eccentricity and humour helped to express what Britain was fighting for \u2013 what it was all about. With his ludicrous hats and rompers and cigars and excess alcohol, he contrived physically to represent the central idea of his own political philosophy: the inalienable right of British people to live their lives in freedom, to do their own thing.\u201d Guess who this was meant to bring to mind for contemporary readers?</p> \n<p>Being drunk on freedom is one way for the chosen people to \u201cdo their own thing\u201d. Adopting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/confused-dangerous-flippant-worlds-media-pans-pms-handling-of-coronavirus-boris-johnson\">distinctive national approach</a> to a global pandemic is another. The myth of a unique and defining love of personal freedom as a badge of nationhood underpinned a profound reluctance to impose life-saving restrictions on movement and social gatherings. Other people might put up with that sort of thing, but not the English. On the altar of this exceptionalism, lives have been sacrificed.</p> \n<p>This innate, genetic resistance to conformity is a myth. This is obvious from the persistence of an equal and opposite cliche of Englishness: the queue. George Orwell could rhapsodise \u201cthe gentle-mannered, undemonstrative, law-abiding English\u201d and \u201cthe orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues\u201d. The anthropologist Kate Fox wrote: \u201cDuring the London riots in August 2011, I witnessed looters forming an orderly queue to squeeze, one at a time, through the smashed window of a shop they were looting.\u201d Orderliness is just as prominent as waywardness in the English self-image \u2013 which suggests that neither of these truisms is ancient, inalienable or worth a damn when you are making policy in a time of plague.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/1000-deaths-a-day-dominic-raab-nhs\">With 1,000 deaths a day, our leaders should be facing far tougher questions | Marina Hyde</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The exceptionalist \u201cfreedom-loving instinct\u201d has little to do with history and much more to do with current politics, specifically the politics of Brexit. Johnson described as \u201cmagnificent\u201d a 2014 book by the arch-Brexiter Daniel Hannan called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/06/daniel-hannan-linda-colley-europe\">How We Invented Freedom</a> \u2013 \u201cwe\u201d being the Anglo-Saxons. Hannan expressly reclaimed the idea of exceptionalism, the freedom-loving Anglo-Saxons being the exception especially to European slavishness. Brexit, as he argued, was one imperative of this dichotomy. Tragically, a notion that the UK could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\">ignore the World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\">zation</a> and<strong> </strong>do its own thing with the virus was another.</p> \n<p>Covid-19, as Johnson himself discovered in the most awful way, doesn\u2019t make exceptions. The threat is universal. And the shield against it \u2013 the NHS \u2013 is cosmopolitan and global. There are 200 different nationalities represented in its ranks by 150,000 doctors, nurses and ancillary staff.

  "<p>The humble milkman \u2013 a regular sight on most British streets throughout the 20th century \u2013 was almost consigned to the history books by the rise of the supermarkets.</p> <p>But now, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, these dairy deliverers on their electric floats are busier than ever as they try to keep up with newfound demand for their services.</p> <p>Dairies are reporting a boom in customer numbers, with some recruiting hundreds of milkmen and women to help deal with the extra workload as shoppers try to reduce, or forgo, their trips to supermarkets.</p> <p>Scott Hughes, owner of Jackson\u2019s Dairies in Stockport, which sources all its milk from farmers in the Peak District, said he first noticed an upsurge in orders when the virus hit China in January. Since then, the \u201cphones have not stopped ringing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just phenomenal \u2013 all of a sudden we were inundated,\u201d said Hughes. \u201cOur doorstep canvasser went out and within 40 minutes he had signed up 30 new customers \u2013 this would normally take him days.\u201d</p> <p>Since the outbreak, Hughes\u2019s firm, which has been delivering milk since the 1950s, has seen an 83% rise in business \u2013 signing up more than 800 new customers in two weeks. Another 300 customers are on a waiting list.</p> <p>\u201cOver the years, we experienced a steady decline and when we looked at it, it was always to do with price because we struggled to compete with supermarket prices,\u201d Hughes said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85ea520b0f7b55f816e3c4425410c9e1ef80b989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85ea520b0f7b55f816e3c4425410c9e1ef80b989/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Lees\u2019s farming family, delivering milk since 1958, has seen their orders double in recent weeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Lees\u2019s farming family, delivering milk since 1958, has seen orders double in recent weeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut with this virus, and also a growing concern about the environment, we are starting to see a shift in the way people shop.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cCustomers have been ringing 24/7 and it is not just elderly people, there is a complete variety \u2013 young people, people with children. We are just hoping when this is all over those customers will stay with us because they will have felt the benefits of having milk delivered to their home.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the country\u2019s largest milk and groceries doorstep delivery service, Milk &amp; More, is currently suspending new customer sign-ups, after reporting an increase of 25,000 customers. It has begun a recruitment campaign for 100 milk deliverers.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s chief executive, Patrick M\u00fcller, said: \u201cWe have been at the heart of the communities in which we serve for decades, but potentially we have never had such an important role as we do now in this current health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Henderson, from Chester-le-Street in Durham, who has been delivering milk for 40 years, said: \u201cThe milk has gone berserk.\u201d</p> <p>Henderson said 60% of his customers were pensioners, and they enjoyed having regular contact with him. He is now wearing plastic gloves when he drops his milk, shakes and juices off on the doorstep.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI have got a pile of notes from customers and my round is taking an extra hour every day now. The dairy I work with said it is just manic \u2026 I just hope that after this is finished that people stay with us.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s remaining milk delivery companies have been forced to adapt in recent years, and online orders have replaced rolled-up notes inside used bottles. Many have diversified by adding grocery items to deliveries, from bread, bacon and eggs to toilet roll and even compost.</p> <p>Trade association Dairy UK said 89% of all milk bought in Britain in 1980 was on the doorstep but many firms closed because of changing consumer habits, and cheaper competition from supermarkets.</p> <p>In the mid-1990s, just 30% of milk was still delivered, falling to 2.8% in 2015 with many of the customers mainly elderly people.</p> <p>Growing consumer concern about plastic waste has led to a gentle increase in demand in recent years for doorstep deliveries of the reusable bottles. But the slight upward curve has now become mountainous.</p> <p>Dr Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK, said many of its members had seen huge increases in demand for milk deliveries as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>\u201cMany have taken on as many new customers as they are able to, and are working round the clock to get milk to as many homes as they can,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that milkmen and women are providing vital lifelines to older or more vulnerable consumers who are not able to leave their homes due to the restrictions, providing milk and other goods to those who need it, safely.\u201d</p>",

As someone with asthma, she said the city\u2019s air, normally thick with pollution, was usually a health nightmare. But now: \u201cThe air is clear, the skies are blue. I see the evening stars with clarity and hear the chirruping of excited birds at this unexpected bonus they have received.\u201d</p> <p>While India\u2019s powerful car lobby has long disputed that cars are a major cause of Delhi\u2019s pollution, Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, said the lockdown and resulting rapid drop in pollution showed once and for all just what a polluting role vehicles had in the city.</p> <p>Narain also stressed that while she wished Delhi was like this \u201call the time\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want people to say \u2018Oh, environmentalists are celebrating this lockdown:\u2019 we are not. This is not the solution. But whatever the new normal is post-Covid-19, we have to make sure we take this breath of fresh air and think about the serious efforts we need to deal with pollution in Delhi.\u201d</p> <p>It is not just Delhi experiencing the clearest skies in years. As pollution dropped to its lowest level in three decades this week this week, residents of Jalandhar in Punjab woke up to an incredible sight in the distance: the Dhauladhar mountain range in Himachal Pradesh. The peaks, which are over 120 miles away, had not been sighted on the Punjab horizon for almost 30 years.</p> <p>It is the absence of cars on some of the world\u2019s most congested roads that seems to be making the most crucial differences. Thailand\u2019s capital, Bangkok, which only last month had closed schools because the pollution got so bad, has experienced a similar transformation in the air since partial lockdown, mainly due to the fall in road traffic. \u201cWe can see quite a big gap between the air quality standard that we have [compared with this time last year],\u201d says Tara Buakamsri, Thailand director for Greenpeace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/618734951ef3cc55e4cb31dced05f88b98f5ced3/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=fee0b52be1212a4432b331200d46ff63&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/618734951ef3cc55e4cb31dced05f88b98f5ced3/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=3c697928f32641cac1d20208315be1e5&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a67fe1b98b14faba3061a03c1e87bf90436e20/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=d5c955ef09679b2cdab7a503f5b7f061&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a67fe1b98b14faba3061a03c1e87bf90436e20/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=38474d8d992d8cf2aee541f2826b5a15&amp;label_after=Now&amp;analytics_label=India Pollution sliders&amp;type=slider&amp;\" data-alt=\"New Delhi pollution then and now 2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/618734951ef3cc55e4cb31dced05f88b98f5ced3/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=fee0b52be1212a4432b331200d46ff63&desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/618734951ef3cc55e4cb31dced05f88b98f5ced3/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=3c697928f32641cac1d20208315be1e5&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a67fe1b98b14faba3061a03c1e87bf90436e20/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=d5c955ef09679b2cdab7a503f5b7f061&desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a67fe1b98b14faba3061a03c1e87bf90436e20/11_11_2505_1680/master/2505.jpg----width=2000____quality=85____s=38474d8d992d8cf2aee541f2826b5a15&label_after=Now&analytics_label=India Pollution sliders&type=slider&\">New Delhi pollution then and now 2</a> <figcaption>An aerial view of the Connaught Place area of central New Delhi</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But residents of Bangkok lamented how the places to enjoy the fresh air were swiftly disappearing.

Globally women represent more than 70 per cent of all health care workers and in the home, women are predominantly the carers of the elderly, people with disabilities and children. With more people quarantined at home, the burden of unpaid care for women will most likely increase.</p> \n   <p>Therefore, we call on all governments in the region to assess and respond to the needs of all care workers, and to ensure that essential services for survivors of domestic violence are maintained and accessible to all women and girls.

Below are the main stories from the past few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The global death toll reached</strong><strong> 94,850, as the US overtook Spain\u2019s total casualties. </strong>The US has now overtaken Spain with 15,774 deaths. Spain has lost 15,238 lives, according to Johns Hopkins University, but the daily death toll fell to 683 after two consecutive days of rising above 740. The toll in France passed 12,000. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care.</strong> The UK prime minister has been moved out of intensive care, according to Downing Street.

  "<p>\u201cAre you a Catholic?\u201d</p> <p>The question eventually surfaces over dinner or drinks in so many conversations: about the child sex abuse royal commission, marriage equality, religious freedom, legalising abortion and euthanasia. About George Pell.</p> <p>Many of us baptised Catholic have drifted \u2013 through boredom, scepticism, disbelief or outright disgust with the Roman church \u2013 from Christmas Catholic to census Catholic to lapsed Catholic. Over the decades I\u2019ve been outside the church I\u2019ve also used ex-Catholic, non-practising Catholic and mis-Catholic.</p> <p>In his statement after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/cardinal-george-pell-conviction-quashed-australia-high-court-freed-jail-appeal-upheld\"> being acquitted of child sexual abuse charges by the high court,</a> Pell said his trial was not a referendum on the church. But when you\u2019ve come to realise you\u2019re not identifiably any sort of Catholic and that the church running the show has made itself contemptible to you, how do you cast your vote? How do you become, formally, not-a-Catholic?</p> <p>The answer isn\u2019t in the help menu of the Vatican\u2019s website.</p> <p>In fact, the church has moved to close the few openings by which the disaffected could officially register having renounced the faith. In 2006 the Vatican established rules to accommodate the growing number of defectors \u2013 as they call them there. Oddly for such a slow-moving institution, the rules were aborted just three years later. Unlike a state with its citizens or a football club with its members, the Vatican would no longer facilitate the initiated leaving its ranks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/it-is-not-possible-to-divorce-george-pells-acquittal-from-the-catholic-churchs-history-of-child-abuse\">It is not possible to divorce George Pell's acquittal from the Catholic Church's history of child abuse | Francis Sullivan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For many parents, baptising a child is a bit of cheap soul insurance or done blithely for the benefit of devout grandparents. But for the Catholic church, it\u2019s the door to membership and salvation. A one-way door. Baptism \u201cimprints on the soul an indelible spiritual sign\u201d and creates an \u201contological and permanent bond\u201d with Jesus and the church. And this contract is recorded on a parish baptismal register, forever.</p> <p>Over time and with much tumult the church has been made to accept that a marriage might end in divorce. But not a baptism. There can be no divorcing the church. And it battles the modern world to maintain the purity of this doctrine.</p> <p>Yet people do want to leave. In droves. These days the church can\u2019t burn heretics or ignore the estranged who continue to write renouncing their Catholicism. Some of these ex-Catholics have shared their experiences online.</p> <p>It seems dioceses around the world have been responding \u2013 when they respond \u2013 in accordance with the abolished 2006 rules on \u201cdefection\u201d. On written advice of defection to your diocese of baptism, the local archbishop deliberates \u2013 apparently applying the church\u2019s criteria for the extreme measure of excommunication. If satisfied, he replies that it is sad to receive your request but a note of your desire to leave will be made on the baptismal register.</p> <p>The only barely acknowledged way out of this global institution \u2013 if that\u2019s how you can characterise such a note \u2013 is by an informal, decentralised, subterranean convention.</p> <p>I wrote to the Sydney archdiocese in the week a jury would convict Pell as a choirboy rapist<strong>.</strong> Over five carefully considered A4 pages I condemned the church as cruel on abortion, euthanasia and suicide; as malign on contraception; recalcitrant on women; degenerate and prurient on gays and sex; and as criminal on child sex abuse. I wasn\u2019t a Catholic and wanted any relevant records amended to protect me from the church, and to protect its members from ever mistaking me for a Catholic.</p> <p>And then \u2026 nothing. It took two more chase-up letters over three months to rouse any response. When it came I was presented \u2013 without consultation \u2013 with that familiar vague undertaking to formally note on the baptismal register my desire to leave.</p> <p>\u201cDesire to leave\u201d is a slippery formula \u2013 a small nod to an intention that preserves the church\u2019s position: yes, you\u2019d like to leave but actually \u2026 you can\u2019t. It sidesteps the facts: you have left and you are not Catholic.</p> <p>I wanted more than \u201cdesire to leave\u201d. I demanded my own form of words on the baptismal register.</p> <p>Demands on the Sydney archdiocese are best made with the backing of secular law. Under federal privacy law Australian privacy principle 13 requires entities like the Catholic church to correct personal information that is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. An old baptismal entry ticks at least four of those five boxes.</p> <p>Faced with the threat of a civil complaint and being hauled before the office of the Australian information commissioner, the archdiocese suddenly \u2013 after 10 months and 10 letters \u2013 relented. A photocopy of my baptismal register entry arrived with a handwritten inscription of my own little prayer of disassociation: \u201cConsiders himself not a Catholic and wants not to be dealt with as one.\u201d</p> <p>Is it worth the effort to counter a symbol to which you ascribe no meaning? That\u2019s not the question, really. The questions are for the Catholic church.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/07/pope-francis-decries-unjust-sentences-after-cardinal-george-pell-acquitted\">Pope Francis decries 'unjust sentences' after cardinal George Pell acquitted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why does an archdiocese archive its sacraments and give up microfilm copies of its registers to posterity \u2013 in Sydney\u2019s case <a href=\"https://www.sydneycatholic.org/directory/listing/sydney-archdiocesan-archives\">its website says</a> to the National Library of Australia, State Library of NSW and the Society of Australian Genealogists? Why does it obscure, obstruct and resist proper correction of its records? Why doesn\u2019t it move to establish a simple, transparent process of correction? Why is it for non-believers to drift off silently? Why won\u2019t the church let go?</p> <p>The answer to each question is the same: power. The church\u2019s business model is sin and salvation. It says you\u2019re a sinner yet can be saved. But only if you\u2019re one of us; only if you do as we say.</p> <p>Renunciation forces the Catholic church to listen to what it refuses to hear: I reject your claim of authority over me. You cannot tell me what to do or think, how to live, whom I love or marry, what I do with my body. I am gone and you will do me this courtesy: stay the hell out of my life.</p> <p>To those who want to record their vote in a referendum on the Catholic church, here\u2019s my Easter advice. Write to the archbishop of the diocese of your baptism. Give your name, date of birth, parents\u2019 names, location of baptism and its estimated date \u2013 enough for the foundation document, your baptismal entry, to be identified.</p> <p>Reference Australian privacy principle 13 and demand the record be corrected. Specify the correction you want. My formulation sets a precedent for what the church will accept beyond<em> \u201c</em>desire to leave\u201d. Feel free to use it or try taking it further. Demand that evidence of the amendment be provided within 30 days. After then you might be in a position, if necessary, to <a href=\"https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-complaints/\">lodge a complaint</a> to the information commissioner.</p> <p>Still, the challenge remains for the Catholic church to do so much better. I call on the church to introduce an official mechanism to fully, formally record renunciations; a register of renunciation cross-referenced to baptismal records. The mechanism should be accessible through all archdiocesan websites.</p> <p>A Finnish <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fi&amp;u=https://eroakirkosta.fi/&amp;prev=search\">website</a> has automated more than 730,000 resignations from Finland\u2019s two state churches since new freedom of religion laws were introduced in 2003. The same can be done everywhere.</p> <p>Good luck to the many wonderful believing Catholics who insist it\u2019s their church, not the bishops\u2019, and continue to operate from within a toxic institution; fighting the good fight, doing their various good works. I love the sinner, hate the sin.</p> <p>But am I a Catholic?</p> <p>No.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sebastian Tesoriero was baptised in the Catholic church as an infant and has no religion</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act.

The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. </p> \n  <p>On Thursday, Navajo president <strong>Jonathan Nez</strong> and vice-president <strong>Myron Lizer</strong>, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThis is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure,\u201d said Nez during an online town hall meeting. </p> \n  <p>The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. </p> \n  <p>Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won\u2019t see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork.
