  "<p>The New South Wales government has approved the extension of coalmining under one of Greater Sydney\u2019s reservoirs in a move that environment groups say could affect the quality of water in the drinking catchment.</p> <p>The Department of Planning, Industry and Environment has granted approval to Peabody Energy for three new longwalls that will extract coal as part of its Metropolitan mine.</p> <p>The decision,<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/sustainability/strict-rules-for-new-coal-mining-under-sydney-reservoir-20200329-p54eyd.html\"> first reported in the Sydney Morning Herald</a>, was made earlier this month and two of the longwalls will go beneath the Woronora reservoir, which supplies parts of southern Sydney and the northern Illawarra.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/31/after-years-of-drought-water-reaches-parched-menindee\">After years of drought, water reaches parched Menindee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The approval is the first in two decades to allow for coalmining directly beneath one of Greater Sydney\u2019s reservoirs.</p> <p>Environment groups, including the National Parks Association of NSW and Greenpeace, are angry the decision was made before a petition with more than 10,000 signatures could be debated in the NSW parliament. Parliament has been suspended due to the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>Peter Turner, the mining projects science officer at the National Parks Association, said mining in the special areas caused damage to the catchment and took volumes of water that \u201ccannot be reliably quantified\u201d because of inadequate monitoring systems.</p> <p>He said that included impacts on collection of runoff, and the flow of streams, swamps and groundwater into the reservoirs.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough detailed information of the extent of impact of mining on the primary function and purpose of the special areas which is to supply drinking water into Greater Sydney and the Illawarra,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jonathan Moylan, the spokesman for Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said decision was \u201chighly contentious\u201d and \u201chas snuck through amid the Covid-19 health crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Stuart Khan, a professor in the school of civil and environmental engineering at University of NSW, said subsidence as a result of mining caused issues with water quality that resulted in water having to be treated.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a big philosophical question about whether that\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Khan said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a very poor way to protect and manage your water catchment in the long term.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a water quality perspective, I don\u2019t think any of this mining should be happening in the drinking water special areas.\u201d</p> <p>A NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment spokeswoman said the Metropolitan mine was \u201ccarefully designed to limit subsidence and surface impacts, including the depth of mining, the narrow width of the longwall panels and larger pillars between longwalls\u201d.</p> <p>She said the extension had been reviewed by independent experts and key regulatory agencies, including the independent expert panel for mining in the catchment within the office of the NSW chief scientist and engineer, the dams safety committee, WaterNSW and the Woronora reservoir impact strategy panel.</p> <p>\u201cAll the experts have advised that the proposed mining would not compromise the reservoir \u2013 but have recommended a range of precautionary adaptive measures to ensure the mining is carefully monitored,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Peabody said approval of the mine would allow the company to continue to supply steel-making coal to the Port Kembla steelworks and \u201cto provide jobs for more than 400 hundred local mining families in Helensburgh and Wollongong\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMetropolitan is proud of its proven track record of protecting the environment and our conservative mining techniques have ensured there has been no connective cracking between our underground mining operations and the surface and therefore no loss of surface water from the Sydney water catchment into the mine,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said the company\u2019s environmental performance had been \u201cconfirmed by the recent Independent Expert Panel for Mining in the Catchment (IEPMC) Report which states that the Metropolitan mine \u2018displays no evidence of a connected fracture regime to surface\u2019; and that \u2018losses of water from the Woronora Special Area due to mining impacts associated with Metropolitan Mine are negligible\u2019\u201d.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

As two surgeons became the first doctors to die from the disease in Britain, staff lobby groups attacked continuing shortages of gear such as masks and gowns and there were further calls for increased testing of workers.

magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device</h2> \n  <p>An Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus outbreak.<br></p> \n  <p>Dr Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at Melbourne\u2019s Swinburne University, was building a necklace that sounds an alarm on facial contact, when the mishap occurred on Thursday night.</p> \n  <p>The 27 year-old astrophysicist, who studies pulsars and gravitational waves, said he was trying to liven up the boredom of self-isolation with the four powerful neodymium magnets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI have some electronic equipment but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI had a part that detects magnetic fields. I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field, and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face. A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However, the academic realised the electronic part he had did the opposite \u2013 and would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAfter scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored, playing with the magnets. It\u2019s the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears \u2013 I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Reardon said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils, and two on the outside. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose, the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/astrophysicist-gets-magnets-stuck-up-nose-while-inventing-coronavirus-device\">Astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8166818f08af215f6fdc69\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T05:15:18.033Z\">6.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Senior WHO adviser appears to dodge question on Taiwan\u2019s Covid-19 response</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A senior advisor at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) appeared to hang up on a journalist who asked about Taiwan\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and then did not answer further questions because they had \u201calready talked about China\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid continued criticism of the WHO\u2019s approach towards both Taiwan and China.

What happens after that? Most medical experts are predicting it will be at least six months before society begins to return to normalcy, whatever that is in a post-coronavirus world.</p> <p>With Super Rugby already suspended, RA is banking on Ireland\u2019s tour of Australia in July and the Rugby Championship/Bledisloe Cup series in August and September to keep the cash flowing. But it is unlikely Ireland\u2019s tour will go ahead, while the Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup must also be in severe doubt, unless the two events can be postponed.</p> <p>With dwindling reserves and little or no income, like Mr Micawber in Charles Dickens\u2019 novel David Copperfield, RA seems to be waiting for something to turn up. </p> <p>Maybe there is reason for optimism, maybe not. Rugby Australia has four potential options for game-sustaining revenue \u2013 private equity, a World Rugby handout, federal government assistance and a bank loan.</p> <p>Private equity partners have been the mythical saviours of Australian rugby ever since the Super Rugby clubs were opened to private investment over a decade ago. There have been reports that a British private equity firm has offered more than $100m in credit to assist the NRL and Australian rugby may be hoping to secure similar assistance.</p> <p>But if Rugby Australia wanted to attract private investment in Super Rugby, and maybe the Wallabies, it would probably need to lessen its financial controls over the franchises.</p> <p>Rumours are swirling around that mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest, saviour of the axed Western Force, might be interested in buying all of Australia\u2019s Super Rugby franchises. </p> <p>Rugby Australia will no doubt go cap in hand to World Rugby and the federal government for financial assistance. The global governing body will be anxious to keep major unions like Australia afloat, but there will be limits to its largesse because every union around the world will be seeking help.</p> <p>The Wallabies are an iconic global brand, arguably deserving of federal government assistance. If there is no direct aid, the government\u2019s wage subsidy package may at least help RA and the Super Rugby clubs keep some skeleton staff employed. But perhaps the lender of last resort for RA will actually be a bank. </p> <p>The AFL has secured a $600m lifeline from banks after the league and its clubs stood down 80% of their staff and players agreed to take significant pay cuts. RA, and the franchises, has warned of standing down staff and will on Tuesday begin negotiations with the Rugby Union Players Association about players taking pay cuts.</p> <p>Player payments is the area where RA and the Super Rugby franchises can make significant savings. Players are rugby\u2019s greatest asset but also its biggest expense. Super Rugby player payments alone are $22.4m a year, not including Wallabies top ups.</p> <p>In an attempt to lead by example, Castle announced she was taking a 50% pay cut on her $800,000-a-year salary, but the amount she asks the players to sacrifice will determine the short-term, and maybe long-term, future of the game.</p> <p>Castle will meet with RUPA chief-executive Justin Harrison on Tuesday, some may say belatedly, after meetings scheduled for last Friday were cancelled. The RUPA has not been happy about being locked out of the process to deal with the crisis so far. Hopefully, it will not prevent talks getting off to a good start. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/30/usa-rugby-files-for-bankruptcy-as-coronavirus-takes-toll-on-game\">USA Rugby files for bankruptcy as coronavirus takes toll on game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rugby Australia has had difficult and challenging negotiations in recent years in relation to issues such as the termination of Israel Folau\u2019s multi-million contract and the breakdown in talks with long-time broadcast partner Fox Sports.</p> <p>In a sense this player payment negotiation is even more important if the game is to get through the coronavirus crisis in good shape \u2013 physically, emotionally and financially \u2013 when play eventually resumes, whenever that may be.</p> <p>Rugby Australia will need to make a persuasive argument that the pain of the crisis must be shared fairly, if not equally.

  "<p>If you keep wondering what to think about Michael Jackson\u2019s complicated legacy \u2013 is it OK to play Billie Jean at a party? Do you have to switch radio stations if Smooth Criminal comes on? \u2013 imagine how Jacques Peretti feels. He has made three films about the pop icon in the past 15 years and in this, his fourth, he aimed to build the fullest picture yet. But how many of us are brave enough to confront that picture?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gxf7\">The Real Michael Jackson</a> (BBC Two) comes just over a year after the broadcast of HBO/Channel 4\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-and-me/on-demand/63905-002\">Leaving Neverland</a>, a gruelling, four-hour documentary built around the detailed accounts of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say they were sexually abused by Jackson as children. Peretti\u2019s film was initially billed as a rival Jackson film, but in the event, it\u2019s much more like an unofficial sequel; a film that could not exist if Leaving Neverland hadn\u2019t cleared the media\u2019s hagiographic haze, but which also provides necessary context on the huge fallout from Jackson\u2019s 2009 death.</p> <p>The Real Michael Jackson has much more in common with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/02/louis-theroux-savile-review-awkward-creepy-uncomfortable-extraordinary\">Louis Theroux\u2019s 2016 Savile film</a>, in which the newly sombre documentarian confronted his own journalistic failures and berated himself for not doing more to tackle a high-profile abuser who got away with it for so long. Didn\u2019t Jackson also \u201chide in plain sight\u201d? Peretti makes a compelling case that the pop star deliberately cultivated that \u201cwacko Jacko\u201d persona of the late 80s \u2013 Bubbles the chimp, the oxygen chamber, the Elephant Man bones \u2013 to provide cover for a truth that was much darker.</p> <p>Savile\u2019s crimes were not on the same global scale. Peretti details the \u201cJackson machine\u201d, that small army of private investigators, expensive lawyers and fixers, which swung into gear during his trials, or whenever his reputation was threatened. It is an MO reminiscent of Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein. Yet none of these other men had anything like Jackson\u2019s huge international fanbase, which, until uncomfortably recently, included Peretti himself.</p> <p>\u201cIs he a paedophile? That\u2019s the question that should be asked,\u201d Peretti says ruefully as he (and we) rewatch footage of a younger Peretti interviewing Jackson\u2019s longtime manager Bob Jones (who <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/MichaelJackson/story?id=874357&amp;page=1\">testified against Jackson in 2005</a>) for one of his earlier films. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t ask the question. That is a failure \u2026 that is a regret of mine.\u201d</p> <p>In fairness, he is far from the only Jackson-adjacent journalist with regrets for not doing more to quiz Jackson on the rumours. Jackson\u2019s habit of occasionally emerging from his post-Thriller seclusion to attend an awards ceremony arm-in-arm with a 12-year-old, or grant exclusive access to a chosen interviewer, means there is a wealth of footage to scrutinise. Diane Sawyer in 1995 and Martin Bashir in 2003 made the most headlines \u2013 even <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/michael-jackson-s-legacy-was-changed-leaving-neverland-it-s-ncna980621\">asking him</a> about <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/living-michael-jackson-martin-bashirs-stomach-churning-documentary/\">the allegations</a> \u2013 yet it\u2019s the softballs, including Oprah Winfrey\u2019s live 1993 interview at the Neverland ranch, which are retrospectively most creepy (although, to be fair, she did at least ask him about his sexuality). In Peretti\u2019s selected clip, Oprah approvingly notes one of several bedrooms on the property made up for young guests: \u201cYou have to be a person who really cares about children to build that into your architecture,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Could anyone watch all this, especially after Leaving Neverland, and not have profound doubts about the professed innocence of Jackson\u2019s interest in young boys? Apparently so. J Randy Taraborrelli, the celebrity biographer and Jackson\u2019s loyal friend since childhood, continues to believe in Jackson\u2019s innocence and there were a couple of occasions in his interview where you might wish he had been pushed harder. Ultimately though, the non-confrontational strategy paid off in an exchange that is enormously revealing about the nature of denial.</p> <p>Peretti may not always ask the right question, but he has certainly been asking them of the right people. And now, at long last, the time is also right for genuine reflection. There are astute insights here from a variety of tabloid journalists (admirably candid, to a man) as well as Jackson\u2019s fellow survivor of 70s child stardom Donny Osmond, and Mathew Knowles, talent manager and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s dad. These guys weren\u2019t just there, in the distorting eye of the celebrity storm, they are all too aware of the types of games celebrities played to negotiate media scrutiny.</p> <p>Is it possible to continue to admire, even enjoy, Jackson\u2019s genius in light of all that we now know? A lot of people remain very invested, both emotionally and financially, in believing that the answer to this question is yes. But the fact that this film touched only very briefly on the evidence of his musical genius is an answer in itself.</p>",
  "<p>The first comprehensive study of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland China has revealed in stark detail the increase in risk for coronavirus patients once they reach middle age.</p> <p>The analysis found that while the overall death rate for confirmed cases was 1.38%, the rate rose sharply with age \u2013 from 0.0016% in the under 10s, to 7.8% in 80s and over.</p> <p>The study showed only 0.04% of 10 to 19-year-olds required hospital care compared with more than 18% of those in their 80s and above.</p> <p>Dramatic rises were seen among middle-aged groups too, with 4% of people in their 40s needing hospital treatment and more than 8% of patients in their 50s.</p> <p>The estimates, reported in <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30243-7/fulltext\">Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>, are based on an analysis of 70,117 laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed cases in mainland China, combined with 689 positive cases among people evacuated from Wuhan on repatriation flights.</p> <p>\u201cOur estimates can be applied to any country to inform decisions around the best containment policies for Covid-19,\u201d said Professor Azra Ghani, a co-author of the study.</p> <p>\u201cOur analysis very clearly shows that at aged 50 and over, hospitalisation is much more likely than in those under 50, and a greater proportion of cases are likely to be fatal.\u201d</p> <p>Because countries have taken radically different approaches to testing, and have sometimes changed testing strategies from one week to the next, scientists have struggled to compare death rates between countries. Another difficulty has been working out the proportion of people who die after becoming infected, because many cases are never confirmed. The latest study estimates the number of undetected cases arriving at an overall death rate of 0.66%. While the figure is lower than some recent estimates, it is markedly higher than the 2009 pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/11/swine-flu-pandemic-who-declares\">\u201cswine flu\u201d</a> virus which killed about 0.02% of those infected.</p> <p>The findings mirror the picture that has emerged around the world with the virus inflicting most harm on older people who tend to have more underlying health problems, such as medical conditions that weaken the lungs or heart.</p> <p>The authors at Imperial College London, who are advising the UK government on the outbreak, warn that since half to 80% of the global population could be infected with Covid-19, the number of people needing hospital treatment is likely to overrun even the most modern healthcare services.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">Professor Neil Ferguson</a>, a senior author on the study, said that as the UK epidemic unfolds, similar proportions from each age group in the UK are likely to be hospitalised and die as seen in China.</p> <p>Travel restrictions, social distancing and lockdowns across Britain and elsewhere are all intended to suppress transmission of coronavirus.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/COVID-19/\">further modelling</a> released on Monday by the Imperial College group, such measures will have a major impact in Europe if they are kept in place, averting an estimated 59,000 deaths in 11 European countries by the end of March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Without sufficient testing to reveal how widespread the virus is, the group\u2019s estimates vary substantially from 7 million to 43 million infected people across the 11 countries analysed as of 28 March. In the UK the infection rate is estimated at 2.7%.</p> <p>The warning came as researchers in the US shed light on a crucial biological mechanism that has helped the coronavirus spread rapidly among humans around the world.</p> <p>A detailed analysis of the virus\u2019s structure revealed that its club-like \u201cspikes\u201d enable it to latch on to human cells about four times more strongly than the related Sars coronavirus which killed hundreds of people in a 2002 pandemic. This means that coronavirus particles that are inhaled through the nose or mouth have a high chance of attaching to cells in the upper respiratory tract, and that relatively few are needed to establish an infection.</p> <p>A 3D map of the virus\u2019s binding protein will now be used by scientists to hunt for drugs that can neutralise the virus before an infection takes hold. \u201cIf a new antibody drug can bind to those sites on the virus more strongly and frequently than the receptor, it will block the virus out of cells, making it a potentially effective treatment for viral infections,\u201d said Fang Li, who led the study at the University of Minnesota.

We\u2019re worried that the death care system won\u2019t be able to cope if lots of funeral directors have to self-isolate - or worse lose their lives - due to coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMany in the funeral profession are now speculating that advice around PPE for funeral professionals was deliberately downgraded because the authorities knew that they wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the demand for equipment. If true, this would be a huge scandal.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Last week the Deceased Management Advisory Group, of which SAIF is a member, <a href=\"https://mcusercontent.com/91a20d214f6f0a4fb90c5b3ee/files/53196aad-cc92-42c5-820e-b3bb83408ddd/DMAG_Letter_to_Duncan_Selbie_27_March_2020.pdf\">wrote</a> to the chief Executive of Public Health England, Duncan Selbie, calling on the government agency to provide clear guidance about PPE for funeral directors. </p> \n  <p>PHE has been approached for a comment. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T15:43:38.650Z\">at 4.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8207b68f08af215f6fe33f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T14:53:03.736Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2c9ebadc6e79acd73dca60a93076a82acae24f7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2c9ebadc6e79acd73dca60a93076a82acae24f7/0_185_5557_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man walking along a deserted Regent Street in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man walking along a deserted Regent Street in London.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T14:55:38.166Z\">at 3.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82041e8f081e5eda239a42\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T14:45:50.952Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 9,000 people who have tested positive for Covid-19 are currently being treated in hospitals across England, NHS England\u2019s chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has said. </p> \n  <p>During a visit to the new NHS Nightingale Hospital in east London, Stevens said the number of patients was expected to increase, but services set up to provide additional capacity would be available later this week.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to the BBC, he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Today there are over 9,000 positive coronavirus patients in hospitals across England and we know that number is only going to increase.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why what you see here is a mass mobilisation, taking place right across the country, but also at these new Nightingale hospitals.</p> \n   <p>This has been an extraordinary team effort on the part of nurses and doctors and therapists and pharmacists across London, but also volunteers and paramedics and people returning to help.</p> \n   <p>And when these services are needed, they will be available beginning later this week, and because this is a global health emergency we\u2019re actually seeing similar types of hospitals being established in Berlin and Madrid and New York.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stevens added that NHS England would be able to double the number of coronavirus tests it has available for staff by the end of the week. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T14:56:55.598Z\">at 3.56pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8202ec8f08af215f6fe2cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T14:36:28.847Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Eton </strong>is offering free self-study courses to teenagers on lockdown during the UK\u2019s coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The private boarding school said its headmaster, Simon Henderson, has written to the heads of state secondary schools offering access to its online learning platform, EtonX.</p> \n  <p>Eton College, which counts prime minister Boris Johnson among its former pupils, is also offering free accommodation to essential workers whose families are self-isolating during the outbreak. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Eton_College/status/1243568640777125892\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today our Head Master has written to the Head of every state secondary school in the UK offering use of our <a href=\"https://t.co/6OqqDmkZoV\">https://t.co/6OqqDmkZoV</a> online self-study courses, free of charge.

  "<p>Care home industry leaders have alleged that orders of supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) intended to protect staff and residents in social care settings are being requisitioned by the NHS for use in hospitals.</p> <p>Chronic shortages of masks, gloves and goggles mean that care homes are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/29/care-homes-refusing-to-take-in-patients-discharged-nhs-hospitals-coronavirus-risk\">increasingly reluctant</a> to take in new residents, and that government targets to discharge older people from hospital are unlikely to be met.</p> <p>The government had set a target to move 15,000 people from hospital beds to community settings, including care homes, by the end of last week to free up space on the wards for treating new patients with Covid-19.</p> <p>But there are signs that even where care homes have empty beds, sufficient staff in place, and are able to accept new residents in theory, the lack of PPE supplies means they are reluctant to put staff and residents\u2019 health at risk.</p> <p>Although the government promised that each care home provider would receive at least 300 fluid-repellent face masks by last weekend, care homes have warned that this would represent only a few days\u2019 supply, and would not affect shortages of googles and gloves.</p> <p>Attempts to independently source PPE have, in some cases, been thwarted after care homes were told by suppliers that their orders had in effect been diverted to NHS hospitals.</p> <p>Labour MP James Murray, a member of the Commons health and social care select committee, has written to the health secretary Matt Hancock to ask him to urgently review the government\u2019s strategy for supplying PPE to care homes.</p> <p>At a <a href=\"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/bbe513cc-8366-43be-99e5-7a0b721fcdfd\">meeting of the committee </a>last Thursday, Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, which represents bigger care home chains, told MPs that wholesalers were prioritising supplying the NHS over care homes, even though ministers had asked them not to do so. </p> <p>\u201cSome of my members are having things they had ordered, sometimes before this crisis, \u2018taken at the borders\u2019 for the NHS. So we have got a situation where the normal areas of supply are not getting through,\u201d Green told MPs.</p> <p>\u201cThis morning I heard from one case where the provider got a letter from their normal supplier where they said they would not be supplying any more because it was all going to the NHS. Obviously the NHS has needs but so does social care.\u201d</p> <p>Nadra Ahmed, executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents smaller and medium-sized care homes, told the Guardian she had also been contacted by members saying they had been told by suppliers their order had been diverted to the NHS.</p> <p>Murray, the MP for Ealing North, said his local authority, Ealing, had informed him that the PPE requirements for the 50 care homes in the borough amounted to 20,000 masks a week \u2013 5,000 more than ministers had guaranteed. A fifth of those homes had already shut their doors to new admissions because of an outbreak of Covid-19.</p> <p>Murray wrote: \u201cI appreciate that there are enormous pressures on every aspect of the health and social care system, and those working in other parts of the system \u2013 not least NHS workers on the frontline in hospitals \u2013 desperately need PPE too. However, I am concerned that without the government coordinating a plan for care homes\u2019 supply of PPE, the situation will not improve.\u201d</p> <p>Reports that hospital discharges were being delayed because of a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/30/hospitals-unable-discharge-patients-care-homes-multi-million/\">dispute between care homes and ministers </a>over a deal to pay care homes flat rate fees of \u00a31,300 and \u00a31,700 per person per week were played down by Ahmed. She said fees, while important, were a \u201csecondary consideration\u201d behind health risks.</p> <p>She said: \u201cOf course money is important but I have to say that the primary message I get from members contacting me me is if we discharge people into our care we need the PPE to do the job. We need the tools to care for them.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Health and Social Care was contacted for comment.</p> <p>Hancock, who is in isolation after testing positive for coronavirus, wrote an open letter of thanks to social care workers at the weekend in which he promised the government was committed to doing \u201cwhatever is needed\u201d for social care and the NHS.</p>",

There should not be any direct clashes with Lions matches and Olympic events given the time difference between South Africa and Tokyo, so fans should not miss out on any action. We are expecting a fantastic series against the world champions.\u201d</p> <p>Last week a leading rugby administrator in South Africa claimed the Lions \u201ccould save the game\u201d in the country given the 2017 tour ensured a profit of around \u00a320m for New Zealand Rugby and contributed more than \u00a3100m to the country\u2019s GDP.</p> <p>While the host nation makes considerably more than its tourists, the Lions rely heavily on sponsorship income. Commercial revenues may take a hit - matching the \u00a36m plus Standard Life paid to be the lead partner in 2017 is likely to prove difficult - but there is confidence the drop-off will not be made worse by the clash with the Tokyo Games.</p> <p>On-sale dates for tickets and official travel packages have been postponed. They were due to go on sale in South Africa next month and in the UK in July but both dates have been pushed back. \u201cAs I am sure our supporters will understand, both unions didn\u2019t think it appropriate to make tickets and our 2021 tour packages available for purchase at these times,\u201d Calveley said. \u201cWe hope to be able to announce new sales dates in the near future but until then we would like to wish everyone the best of health in these unprecedented times.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When the new chancellor gave his first budget earlier this month, he provided a snapshot of the government\u2019s economic priorities after its resounding victory in December\u2019s general election. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/rishi-sunak-budget-2020-spending-spree-investment-productivity\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak announced</a> that there would be a doubling of investment in research and development, new grants for business innovation, and new money for life sciences research. This was a vision of startup Britain: outside the EU, the nation\u2019s wellbeing would be secured through a new focus on the knowledge economy and advanced hi-tech manufacturing.</p> <p>Only three weeks have passed since the chancellor\u2019s debut budget, delivered before packed benches in the House of Commons. But it already seems to belong to another era. Mr Sunak\u2019s ambition when it came to areas such as innovation and R&amp;D was welcome. But viewed from the grim standpoint of the present, what most stands out is not what Mr Sunak said, but what he didn\u2019t say. On the ongoing social care crisis, the subject of <a href=\"https://foundationaleconomycom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/social-innovation-in-home-care.pdf\" title=\"\">a pre-election pledge</a> by the prime minister, he was entirely silent.</p> <p>The omission is worth thinking about: not in order to condemn Mr Sunak with the benefit of hindsight, but because it reflected a mindset that paid too little attention to the vital but unglamorous types of work that knit our communities together. In his video address to the nation at the weekend, Boris Johnson made a point of asserting that, <em>pace </em>Margaret Thatcher: \u201cthere is such a thing as society\u201d. Like the rest of us, the prime minister was no doubt moved by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-52063866\" title=\"\">the national outpouring of affection</a> for carers last Thursday evening. But it should not have taken such traumatic times for the low-status and often badly rewarded occupations that enable society to function to be properly valued.</p> <p>In social care, a perilous game of catch-up is now being played. The sector faces a terrifying challenge in the days and weeks to come, as the Covid-19 epidemic peaks in Britain, but it is struggling with low staff numbers. This is partly due to illness and self-isolation, but also because of scandalously low rates of pay. This week <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/29/care-homes-have-received-300masks-protect-staff-residents-against/\" title=\"\">it emerged</a> that protective equipment for care workers promised by the end of last week does not include aprons, gloves and visors, while masks have been criticised as inadequate.</p> <p>Other unfashionable sectors of the economy are finally receiving belated recognition. The environment secretary, George Eustice, <a href=\"https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/people/george-eustice-heaps-praise-on-food-industry-worker-heroes/603417.article\" title=\"\">gave a special shout-out to workers</a> in the food industry \u2013 praising the \u201chidden heroes\u201d in the food chain who have ensured that supermarket shelves remain stacked, despite the periodic predation of panic buyers. Employees in Tesco and Waitrose have worked until the early hours to replenish stock and shown forbearance when dealing with anxious and sometimes aggressive customers. Cleaners have allowed necessary office work to continue and played a crucial role in our hospitals, deep-cleaning rooms where Covid-19 patients have been treated.

Along with teachers, utility workers, bus drivers and librarians, they provide the services and social glue which any community needs. They are the key workers of this crisis. Yet their jobs are low-paid and often chronically insecure.</p> <p>Some of that is down to the austerity-driven assault on local government finance during the past decade, which has prompted councils to shed jobs and reduce services. But the fashion for the private delivery of public goods, from refuse collection to street cleaning, long predated the 2008 crash. It was driven by an assumption that the pursuit of shareholder profit would maximise efficiency of delivery. Instead, in institutions such as care homes, it has led <a href=\"https://foundationaleconomycom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/social-innovation-in-home-care.pdf\" title=\"\">over-leveraged companies to cut corners and underpay staff</a> in order to pay down debt and satisfy shareholders. It is heartwarming and right that the jobs which have carried little social status are now being seen in a different light. But as Britain learns the myriad lessons of a crisis that has exposed our assumptions to the harshest scrutiny, the need for a new deal for workers in the everyday economy should be high on the list.</p>",
  "<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who begin their new life as non-working royals this week, have said they intend to spend the next few months concentrating on their family and privately supporting their charities.</p> <p>The couple, who have relocated to California, will cease to be working royals and can no longer officially represent the Queen from Wednesday, as they seek to become financially independent.</p> <p>Under their agreement with the monarch they will no longer post on Instagram under the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?hl=en\">@sussexroyal</a> handle, which has 11.3 million followers, or update their SussexRoyal.com website. The Instagram account and website will remain online for the foreseeable future but will be inactive.</p> <p>The couple are winding down their Sussex Royal Foundation, which was in the process of being established in the UK, and working on creating a non-profit organisation.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend the next few months on their family and continuing to do what they can safely and privately, to support and work with their pre-existing charitable commitments while developing their future non-profit organisation.\u201d</p> <p>In a message on Instagram, the couple thanked their \u201ccommunity\u201d of followers. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important right now is the health and wellbeing across the globe and finding solutions for the many issues that have presented themselves as a result of this pandemic.\u201d They were \u201cfocusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute\u201d. They added: \u201cWhile you may not see us here, the work continues.\u201d </p> <p>Although there is no mention of where they are living, reports that Harry and Meghan had relocated to California appeared to be confirmed after the US president, Donald Trump, tweeted that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/29/donald-trump-refuses-to-pay-security-bill-for-harry-and-meghan\">must pay for their own security</a>. The couple\u2019s spokesperson immediately stressed they \u201chave no plans to ask the US government for security resources\u201d, seen as confirmation the two had left Canada just ahead of the border closure with the US for all but essential travel.</p> <p>Questions over their security remain. While the couple are said to have made \u201cprivately funded security arrangements\u201d, no details are forthcoming on whether the Metropolitan police will still be providing protection for the couple, and their baby son, Archie. All three are understood to be in Los Angeles, where Meghan grew up, and where her mother, Doria Ragland, resides.</p> <p>Harry\u2019s sustainable travel initiative, Travalyst, will be established as an independent non-profit organisation. As the travel industry faces the global threat of coronavirus, Harry is said to be \u201cworking closely with each of the Travalyst partners to better understand how this non-profit organisation can aid in global recovery, especially by supporting communities, wildlife and the environment at the same time\u201d.</p> <p>The couple remain committed to their roles as patrons. There would be no additional information on their next steps made public for now, their office said. Frogmore Cottage will continue to be the Sussexes\u2019 family home in the UK. As was announced in January, they will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/18/the-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex-to-drop-hrh-titles\">repay the \u00a32.4m</a> sovereign grant expenditure on the refurbishment of their home, pay rent and meet the running costs of the property.</p> <p>They have recruited Catherine St-Laurent, who was the director at Pivotal Ventures, Melinda Gates\u2019s women and families foundation, to lead their new charity. Their PR is being handled mainly by the firm Sunshine Sachs in Hollywood, as their 15-strong team at Buckingham Palace is dismantled.</p> <p>Royal experts said the couple faced unforeseen challenges in establishing their new roles. \u201cThey must be reassessing the situation on a daily basis, given all the changes. Clearly the situation they are in is very far from that they anticipated when they first made public their proposals back in January,\u201d said Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty Magazine.</p> <p>The royal author Penny Junor said the couple were in danger of becoming \u201cpretty irrelevant\u201d as the world battled Covid-19. \u201cI think for the time being Harry and Meghan will probably become a distant memory.\u201d</p> <p>The royal family definitely had a role to play in a crisis like this, she said, but Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision was \u201cabsolutely pushed to the back of the list of priorities\u201d.</p> <p>The couple are understood to have left their rented mansion on Vancouver Island last week, with unconfirmed reports that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/us-canada-border-closed-non-essential-traffic\">border closure</a> between the US and Canada hastened their decision. \u201cIt probably has happened more quickly than they originally planned. You have to feel sorry for them in many ways, because the timing of all this is totally wrong for all the things they hoped to achieve,\u201d said Little.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to look at them very differently now. What they do next is going to be very different from what the House of Windsor has been doing.\u201d </p>",

No one was wearing a mask.</p> \n<p>The global pandemic has closed down Europe\u2019s economies and confined millions of people across the continent to their homes.

With criticism of Sweden\u2019s response to Covid-19 mounting, he has the slightly exasperated tone of a man tired of repeating the obvious when asked what he thinks of the growing concern and calls for a city-wide quarantine of Stockholm, given the very recent spike in cases there. On Monday, Sweden said it had recorded <a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa\">3,700 cases</a> and 110 deaths.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes, there has been an increase but it\u2019s not traumatic so far.

We are asked now to stay 2 metres apart when at desks but when all the teams are in this is going to prove very difficult as there will not be enough workspace to do this.</p> <p>We are still using the one lift we have altogether and still passing each other on the stairs, in the toilets and in the canteen and also queuing for food together. </p> </blockquote> <p>Another, from insurer <strong>AXA</strong>, said some staff were being made to commute to work -- including a tutorial about remote working(!) that didn\u2019t go well.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yesterday, high risk members of staff were forced to commute into the office for training on \u2018how to work from home.\u2019 The training should\u2019ve taken 45 minutes but staff were made to wait around for 3 hours until AXA realised the training couldn\u2019t be delivered and the staff were sent home without laptops.

Meaning staff are having to do this. </p> </blockquote> <p>Staff at <strong>IWG </strong>Group (who own Regus business Centres) are also being treated badly, according to the partner of one.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no flexible working or working from home, no hand sanitiser and they are being asked to continue to conduct tours of the centres, host meetings and key-holders continue to come into centres.

But we have survived everything so far.</p> <p>The pain we are feeling now is still just the normal, everyday parts of being human. Death is coming. Horrible things happen.

  "<p>The epidemiologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-uk-spread-shows-early-signs-of-slowing-key-adviser\">Prof Neil Ferguson has said</a> changes in the rate of hospital admissions suggests the spread of Covid-19 in the UK might be slowing down.</p> \n<p>But can we be sure that is the case? And are hospital admissions the best metric to look at? To unpick this we spoke to experts about what the numbers tell us about the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>Number of new cases</h2> \n<p>Every day public health bodies in the UK report on the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19. So could this tell us about how the disease is spreading?</p> \n<p>One difficulty is that, in recent weeks, only patients in hospital with suspected Covid-19 have been routinely tested for the disease, although testing is now being rolled out to frontline NHS staff.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only data we really have to go on at the minute is confirmed cases \u2013 there will be obviously a vast number of increased cases in the community that we simply don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That, he added, has a number of implications, besides not knowing the true number of cases. \u201cWe don\u2019t really quite know the dynamics [for] transmission between minor cases, and what become more serious cases that end up being hospitalised,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Current UK data shows that over the past three days the number of new confirmed cases has dropped from 2,900 on 27 March to 2,400 new cases on 29 March.</p> \n<p>While Head said that could reflect the start of a slowdown in the spread of Covid-19, he urged caution. \u201cIt is too early to really say if that is an actual trend or if it is just a natural variation,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we go through the pandemic, cases will not increase at the same rate every day, they will fluctuate a bit anyway. So a steeper incline than the day before or a more shallow incline than the day before means little unless there is a sustained change in that rate of increase.\u201d</p> \n<p>Indeed, Head said it could be a couple of weeks before the new social distancing measures are clearly seen to have an impact on new confirmed cases because of the lag in the development of symptoms.</p> \n<p>Changing the number of people tested, or who is being offered tests, will also affect the number of reported cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><br>Hospital admissions</h2> \n<p>Talking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Ferguson said that the rate of increase in admissions had slowed.</p> \n<p>While Covid-19 admissions are not among the data released each day by public health bodies in the UK, it may be expected to track the number of confirmed cases since, as mentioned above, in recent weeks testing has been confined to patients in hospital.</p> \n<p>Experts say hospitalisation data gives an idea of how many serious cases there are. But, even so, such figures may also have biases, said Prof James Wood, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, noting people may be less enthusiastic about going to hospital as the epidemic develops.</p> \n<p>Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, added the lag between changes in social distancing policies and new cases or hospitalisations means that any slight slowdown in the rate of the latter would be unlikely to reflect the impact of the lockdown yet, but more probably would reflect earlier interventions. \u201cIt takes that long to feed into the system,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>Deaths</h2> \n<p>While death figures are updated daily, there can be a delay between a death occurring and it entering official figures.</p> \n<p>And it could be several weeks before any impact of the recent lockdown measures are reflected in changes in death rates.</p> \n<p>In addition, for deaths to be attributed to Covid-19, they need to have a confirmed infection. \u201cThe figures we release are for patients who have died in hospital with a positive test result for coronavirus,\u201d a spokesperson for NHS England told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>That, experts have said, means some deaths may not be recorded. \u201cIt is quite possible that other people are dying both in the community and in hospital \u2013 if they haven\u2019t presented typically, maybe they haven\u2019t had the test,\u201d said Wood. </p> \n<p>However, Wood noted that the biases in the death rate in hospitals are more likely to be consistent over time, potentially offering a more useful way to investigate how the epidemic is playing out in the UK.</p> \n<p>From Tuesday, the Office of National Statistics will be publishing weekly data that includes deaths in the community.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"241cb373-579d-4c0c-b51e-3538d7dc1b18\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vLoUrmKv8zE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Adherence to lockdown</h2> \n<p>Since the UK\u2019s lockdown measures came into force on 23 March, a number of measures have recorded a decrease in public movement, from air pollution figures to <a href=\"https://citymapper.com/cmi/london\">statistics from apps such as Citymapper</a>.</p> \n<p>The latter reveals that, on 2 March 100% of London was moving as normal. By 23 March this figure was down to 25%, and by 28 March just 8% of normal journeys in London were being taken. \u201cWe can see where the major cities have much reduced movement, which is a measure of adherence to the social distancing measures that have been put in place,\u201d said Head, adding that air pollution data may shed light on changes in the burden of other diseases.</p> \n<p>But could such figures offer a different way to measure the spread of Covid-19? One problem is that they data is only available for certain cities, and does not cover rural areas. Another is that the data may not be fine-grained enough to give a detailed picture of how people are changing their behaviour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Edmunds said his team have begun deploying other approaches to investigating people\u2019s behaviour, by quizzing a panel of participant about their social interactions. \u201cWe are measuring people\u2019s contacts,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The idea is that by doing so, the team can track changes in how many new cases an infected person generates on average \u2013 and get an idea of how quickly coronavirus is spreading far sooner.</p> \n<p><br></p>",

For Paige\u2019s husband, a self-employed builder from Albania, it might mean he won\u2019t qualify for state support to cover any loss of income during the pandemic. So far she says it\u2019s been \u201call silence\u201d from the government on this issue. </p> <p>Jane is similarly worried. As a freelancer in the creative industry, her work vanished in a seven-day period. NRPF means she can\u2019t apply for universal credit, get support from her local council or, it seems, claim as someone who\u2019s self-employed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government understands how little of a safety net migrants, and most of society, functions on day-to-day,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is moments like these that expose the true impact of anti-immigration policies.

The virus might not care about immigration status, but government policy still can.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/coronavirus/\">Significant parts of immigration</a> enforcement have <a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/changes-to-home-office-asylum-resettlement-policy-and-practice-in-response-to-covid-19/\">been suspended</a>, such as screening interviews and evictions, but even some of those changes are riddled with gaps and confusion. Immigration barrister Colin Yeo tells me that one way the government could improve things would be to establish a firewall between the NHS and the Home Office. Under the hostile environment, doctors are required to act as immigration enforcers, so a lot of people still worry their data will be passed on. When you inject fear into the system, don\u2019t be surprised if it shows up in times of crisis.</p> <p>Keeping track of all the announcements is difficult; making sense of them is just as hard.

The logic that underpinned this thinking is the problem. People\u2019s rights, their access to healthcare, their ability to survive \u2013 none of this should be determined by how much they earn, their perceived skills or their immigration status. This is as true now as it will be when the pandemic is over.

  "<p><strong>How can I make self-isolation more glamorous?</strong></p> <p><em>Jeremy, London</em></p> <p>It is rather heartening that, even in the midst of a global catastrophe, humans can still find ways to turn the current situation into an aspirational statement. Luxury retailers now have canny \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sunspel.com/uk/mens/work-from-home-essentials.html\">working from home essentials</a>\u201d on their websites, those \u201cessentials\u201d being \u00a3195 polo shirts and \u00a3145 tracksuit bottoms. \u201cThere is a switch in influencer content online,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a51fa513-423e-4e93-9097-bef36129d0a4\">a consultant told the FT last week</a>, excitingly. Instead of travel and fashion being the focus, influencers are switching to cooking and fitness. So instead of feeling inferior for not having scored that sunset selfie in Bali, we can all feel bad for not having the right yoga mat. How about that for personal growth?</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just professional influencers who are in on this game. For those who spend too long on social media, it is now ingrained to the point of instinct to let people know you are living life better than them. This might seem illogical, when we all know that everyone \u2013 from Mick Jagger to your mum \u2013 is sitting on the sofa watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Tiger King</a> on Netflix. But this instinct is, I think, especially strong in times of stress and anxiety, when no one knows if they are doing the right thing. And you know a really great way to feel better about your situation? Make other people feel worse about theirs.</p> <p>Professional rich person David Geffen has long been my favourite person on Instagram, with his updates on which celebrity is currently his guest on his yacht, Rising Sun. But last weekend he took his Instagram game to a new level with the caption of a photo of Rising Sun: \u201cSunset last night \u2026 isolated in the Grenadines avoiding the virus. I\u2019m hoping everybody is staying safe.\u201d We seasoned Geffen watchers knew this was an unusually empathetic post from David, with its uncharacteristic concern for the little people. Alas, the Johnny-come-latelies did not get this and mocked Geffen for his less than inclusive post. He has now \u2013 tragically \u2013 deleted his account.</p> <p>And yet, Geffen is not the only one doing this. He is a billionaire, so his version of glamorous social distancing is billionaire-sized, but a quick, faintly nauseating glance through Instagram will show that he is far from alone in attempting to create Instagrammable isolation. Social media cliches already include photogenic children skipping on an empty beach in front of their parents\u2019 Cornish second home, or going for bucolic walks near their parents\u2019 second home in Dorset, or doing home schooling in front of the Aga in their parents\u2019 second home in Norfolk. \u201cMaking the most of self-isolation! #takethatcoronavirus #blitzspirit\u201d is a typical caption.

We are all confused about what to do, and I understand needing external validation for one\u2019s choices. But perhaps some people could bear in mind that not everyone has those choices, and so chill on the social media smugness, just for now. Also, if you don\u2019t want people to criticise your choices, don\u2019t post about them on social media. \u201cThat boat in which you\u2019ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was,\u201d Melandri wrote.

  "<p>The coronavirus is upending the 2020 census, disrupting an already fragile operation that faced<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/22/us-census-trump-rhetoric-distrust-undercount\"> immense challenges</a> in counting minority populations and other groups in the US before the outbreak of a global pandemic.</p> <p>Americans started receiving invitations to respond to the census online, an option never offered before, or by phone on 12 March, just as governors and mayors started shutting down businesses and telling people to stay home. While the US Census Bureau is already delaying some of its operations, the US constitution mandates a decennial census and it cannot be cancelled. <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2007-title13/pdf/USCODE-2007-title13.pdf\">Federal law </a>also sets 1 April as census day \u2013 the date at which the government must try to get as accurate a count of the US population as possible.</p> <p>There are certain populations already vulnerable to going undercounted in the census, including minorities, immigrants and the poor. The outbreak will make it even harder, especially if the government is forced to scale back critical door-to-door operations to count people later this year. There is an ongoing push to get people to respond online now while they are quarantined at home, but swaths of the American population without reliable internet can\u2019t do that. These issues build on persistent distrust among immigrants of the Trump administration, fueled by its unsuccessful attempt to add a citizenship question to the survey.</p> <p>For now, elected officials and advocacy groups will have to find a way to persuade them to respond and to ensure they get counted without face-to-face contact.</p> <p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have snowballed at a worse time,\u201d said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a consultant who works on census issues with lawmakers and advocacy groups. The further away from 1 April that the bureau counts people, she said, the more difficult it will be to collect accurate data, and <a href=\"https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates.html\">21%</a> of US households have responded to the census so far.</p> <p>An inaccurate count would have severe consequences. The data from the census is used to allocate <a href=\"https://apnews.com/b05b7206ad374e7abb03372cb4e4d6e4\">$1.5tn</a> in federal funds and determines where governments build hospitals, roads, public transportation and other infrastructure. It\u2019s also used to draw political district lines in place for the next decade and determine how many representatives in the US House each state gets by 31 December. Depending on how severe delays are because of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Census Bureau may have to ask Congress to change federal law to extend that deadline, said John Thompson, the director of the Census Bureau from 2013 to 2017.</p> <p>The Census Bureau is already <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/update-on-2020-census-field-operations.html\">pushing back</a> some of its programs, including an operation to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/modifying-2020-operations-for-counting-college-students.html\">dispatch workers</a> to heavily trafficked areas to help them fill out the census and another to count the homeless population as well as people living in nursing homes and prisons. The bureau also announced <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/census-bureau-delays-deadline-2020-count-weeks-69717100\">earlier this month</a> it was delaying the final deadline for the count from 31 July to 14 August.</p> <p>The bureau has also delayed the start date of a critical door-to-door count from mid-May to late May following up with people who don\u2019t respond on their own. The program is critical to getting traditionally hard-to-count populations to respond to the survey. It is unclear how the bureau would proceed with that operation if current social isolation practices are still in place then.</p> <p>This is \u201cuncharted territory\u201d, said Margo Anderson, a historian who has extensively studied the census. While the bureau plans extensively for emergencies, and has $2bn in contingency funds, it has never faced a pandemic during its peak operations. There is already concern that it will be increasingly difficult to count college students, who are <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/modifying-2020-operations-for-counting-college-students.html\">supposed to be counted</a> where they live and sleep most of the time, because many schools have closed their campus for the semester.</p> <p>The lack of in-person interaction will probably make it more difficult for organizers to build trust in vulnerable communities. At the Arab-American Family Support Center, which serves immigrants and refugees throughout New York City, organizers planned to host in-person workshops about filling out the census. Those workshops are no longer happening, and the center is focused on the 1,300 people who signed pledge cards to fill out the census.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a level of being able to read a person and what their comfort level is and whether your message is getting through or not,\u201d said Howard Shih, director of research and policy at the Asian American Federation. \u201cIt\u2019s that face-to-face thing.\u201d</p> <p>In New York City, where<a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/census-and-the-city/\"> 29% of households</a> lack broadband internet, officials planned more than 300 \u201cpop-up\u201d centers \u2013 libraries and other public facilities \u2013 where people could use a computer to fill out the census online. But census organizers scrapped those plans and are now focusing on reaching people through text-a-thons and phone banking. Meanwhile, officials scaled back their subway advertisements as New Yorkers were discouraged from using public transportation and shifted to digital advertising.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes it extremely difficult,\u201d said Julie Menin, who is leading the city\u2019s census efforts.</p> <p>But New York officials have also realized that Covid-19 concerns can be channeled to highlight the importance of the census, and how it is used to get funding for healthcare services and hospitals. 23.4% of households in the city <a href=\"https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates.html\">have responded</a> so far, according to the Census Bureau. Nationwide, 33.1% of households have self-responded.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges facing the census now is simply getting messaging about it out at a time when news about the coronavirus is crowding everything else out.</p> <p>So far, elected officials and advocacy groups have largely praised the Census Bureau\u2019s efforts to mitigate the effects of coronavirus on the count\u2019s operations. But the census, the largest peacetime mobilization of the federal government, is a carefully calibrated effort. The more changes there are, the greater the risk to its accuracy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little like Jenga. Every time you pull out a piece the structure becomes a little less stable,\u201d Lowenthal said.</p>",

  "<p>Australia have warned that tours to Europe in November may be sacrificed if the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic extends, a move that would have a significant impact on the four home unions who either have or are about to agree wage cuts to combat a sharp fall in revenue.</p> <p>Raelene Castle, the chief executive of Rugby Australia, said after the governing body\u2019s virtual annual meeting on Monday that the Test schedules for this year and next may need to be reorganised and the tour matches they were due to host against Ireland and Fiji were \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to go ahead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/25/premiership-players-considering-claims-for-unlawful-deduction-of-wages\">Premiership players considering claims for unlawful deduction of wages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rugby Australia announced a provisional loss of \u00a35m before a final audit and is holding talks with the players\u2019 association this week about pay cuts.

There are no reserves, well-stocked freezers, or anything saved for a rainy day.

  "<p>A voice-controlled personal assistant in a self-driving car might not seem like too much of a biggie in 2020. But in 1982 it was a thrilling vision of an unimaginably hi-tech, sci-fi future, all packaged up in a sweet black ride with a swishy red sensor on the front.</p> <p>Knight Rider was the daft US TV show about a talking Trans Am that seemed to take itself very seriously: how else to explain the moody credits sequence in an overcast desert where a growly voiceover heralded \u201ca shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist\u201d? The title also seemed extremely enigmatic until you learned that creator Glen A Larson \u2013 the prolific TV producer behind Battlestar Galactica, Magnum PI and more \u2013 had consciously set out to update the gunslinging-hero serial The Lone Ranger, swapping out faithful nag Trigger for a four-wheeled justice-mobile called the Knight Industries Two Thousand (Kitt).</p> <p>The guy in the saddle this time was David Hasselhoff, an easygoing soap actor thrilled to have finally secured a headline gig. If his Knight Rider character had a knotty backstory \u2013 a crusading cop shot in the head and left for dead, resurrected with a new face and identity by an eccentric tech billionaire \u2013 the part basically just needed someone who could look unselfconscious while constantly talking to themselves. While he never seemed to master doing up his top three shirt buttons, Hasselhoff excelled as the goofball do-gooder Knight, his brawny cheesiness a ripe counterpoint to the urbane Kitt (voiced by the St Elsewhere star William Daniels).</p> <p>This was a slick, action-orientated series where Michael and Kitt dutifully helped the downtrodden, thwarting white-collar crooks and greedy hoodlums alike with the judicious application of turbo-boosted stunt jumps. But something about the cool autonomous car, the hunky lead and \u2013 let\u2019s admit it \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNyXYPhnUIs\">kick-ass theme tune </a>cut across language barriers, turning Knight Rider into a tangible global hit that kept its foot to the floor for 90 episodes over four seasons.</p> <p>With such a deliberately formulaic approach, and baddies-of-the-week banged up by the end of each instalment, when did it demonstrably run out of gas? Was it the season three finale where Michael and Kitt joined the circus? Or the season four episode where they were targeted by ninjas? Your mileage may vary, but it felt as if the wheels fell off when Knight Rider dabbled with serialisation. The opening episode of the second season introduced Garthe Knight, the estranged son of Kitt\u2019s creator who looked suspiciously like Michael Knight with an evil moustache (likely because he was also played by Hasselhoff in full panto mode). Turns out there really is such a thing as too much Hoff: when Garthe and his supposedly indestructible truck Goliath turned up again toward the end of the season, it felt like a lazy, self-cannibalising move rather than a highly anticipated rematch. After that second clash, Kitt remarked: \u201cI\u2019d rather be turned into a toaster oven than go through that again.\u201d Not for the first time, the self-parking smartypants had a point.</p>",

Covid-19 doesn\u2019t care about our minds, our rationality, our creativity. It has no interest in us as human beings: it is a virus that is transmitted from one animal to another.

The health select committee estimated in 2002 that the direct cost of obesity to the NHS was between \u00a3990m and \u00a31,225m; the direct cost of mental illness rose from \u00a3965m in 1983-84 to \u00a35bn in 2003-04. One of the causes of the rise in mental illness, it has been found by the Institute for Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, is poor maternal nutrition before and after conception. It substantially increases the risk of low birthweight and developmental brain disorder. The incidence of low birthweight in the UK has risen from 6.6% in 1953 to 7.6% in 2003 - the highest rate of low birthweight in Europe.

When, or if, weeks later, the local authority gets around to carrying out their duty to assess their needs, they receive \u00a334.60 a week until the age of 18, after rent and council tax, on which to survive independently.

Many are receiving poverty incomes while unemployed, which are due to be sanctioned should they not seek work.

However, rights and responsibilities apply both ways. Since 1948, successive British governments have been signed up to the right to an adequate standard of living as detailed in the UN\u2019s convention on human rights, but have not honoured their side of the contract by implementing that right in adequate unemployment incomes.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/haringey-council-claire-kober-momentum-residents\" title=\"\">Haringey housing battle</a> was about the people\u2019s opposition to the powerful state and a powerful private developer joining forces to remove the land from under the homes of council tenants. Since 1979 an ideological free market approach to land has been forcing the UK back to the middle ages.</p> <p>In the history of the parish of Fingest, which I served, is the story of Henry Burgersh. He was the grandson of a baron who became bishop of Lincoln; he claimed authority over the abbot of St Albans Abbey. In March 1130 the abbot made over to the bishop the manor of Fingest (Buckinghamshire) in return for a renunciation of all episcopal rights over the monastery. The bishop promptly enclosed 300 acres of common land on which 60 families depended for survival; it is recorded that they starved. The modern version is in the unlimited, unearned, untaxed increase in the value of land grabbed for private gain to the detriment of the common good.<br><strong>Rev Paul

Journal, 22 February). Throughout the UK, truly affordable council housing was built on public land. The price of borrowing to build and maintain council estates and their communities was recovered over, say, 50 years by low earners paying low rents, which did not include the ever-increasing value of land. Councils are now using the high value of public land to finance developers to demolish council estates and build private housing, which council tenants cannot afford. Hence the <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02110\" title=\"\">79% increase</a> in homeless families in England to 86,000, including 127,000 children since 2010, some for up to and over 10 years, 1.1 million households on council waiting lists and 4,700 single adults sleeping rough each night.</p> <p>The New Economics Foundation recently reported that the government sold enough public land for developers to build 131,000 homes, but only 2.6% will be for social rent. There is an urgent need for legislation that forbids the sale of public land and requires it to be used for affordable social housing.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global infections pass 730,000</h2> <p>Covid-19 infections worldwide have risen to 732,000, according to<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> the Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>. The US had the most cases, with over 142,000; Italy was second with nearly 98,000; and Spain has passed China\u2019s 82,000 cases with 85,000. Italy still had the highest death toll, with nearly 10,800. Spain was second with 7,340. More than 2,500 people have died in the US.</p> <h2>Lockdowns increase in cities across the world</h2> <p>Europe\u2019s largest capital and Africa\u2019s most populous city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-moscow-and-lagos-in-lockdown-as-countries-tighten-restrictions\">have gone into lockdown</a> and countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/trump-says-keeping-us-covid-19-deaths-to-100000-would-be-a-very-good-job\">including the US</a> have prolonged and tightened already strict confinement orders as the coronavirus epidemic continues to spread across the globe. Moscow imposed strict isolation measures on Monday after many residents ignored official requests to stay indoors.

In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time&nbsp;to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster.

The message taken by some employers was that they were not essential. And we woke up to a whole lot of workplaces standing down or just sacking their employees. A lot of unions worked really hard to get people back to work - that was simply bad communication by governments, state and federal, that lead to that panic. </p> \n   <p>It became pretty clear by the middle of the week, it became clear by the middle of the week that the message employers had got was that they could let people go and they\u2019d be looked after by the social security system \u2013 and you saw the Centrelink lines was a product of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The ACTU\u2019s proposal is for a wage subsidy, of 80% of workers\u2019 previous wage, capped at 80% of the median wage \u2013 a subsidy of up to $1,375 a week to be paid first by government to employers and then to their workers. </p> \n  <p>McManus confirmed that people who received the payment would still be counted as employed, and called for the measure to be backdated to unwind the \u201cdevastation\u201d of recent job losses.<br></p> \n  <p>McManus noted reports the government has opted instead for a $1,500 fortnightly payment, which she labelled \u201chighly inadequate\u201d as it would amount to about 44% of the median wage and \u201cabout half of what\u2019s needed\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Stanford estimated the cost of the ACTU\u2019s proposal would be \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d \u2013 but noted that paying wage subsidies would reduce the amount that will need to be spent on jobseeker payments.

  "<p>England has hosted only a handful of senior competitive behind-closed-doors football fixtures and anyone who considers them a suitable and workable solution to the problems now facing sport could probably do with a reminder about how the previous ones went down, starting with the first. This, at least, is a chapter of British sporting history that anyone can be forgiven for forgetting, since it took place 105 years ago.</p> <p>In March 1915 Bradford City, one of two Bradford clubs in the First Division at the time, met Norwich City of the Southern League in the third round of the FA Cup. They first played in Yorkshire, drawing 1-1 after extra time, and when the match was replayed the following weekend at The Nest, then Norwich\u2019s home ground, it finished goalless. A second replay was thus required, and arranged for a neutral venue \u2013 Lincoln City volunteered \u2013 but with a caveat.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a condition, made by the FA, that is not to be overlooked in connection with the Lincoln match \u2013 namely, that the public are not to be admitted,\u201d reported the Lincolnshire Echo after the game had been arranged. \u201cThe obvious object of this is that workmen shall not be drawn away from their employment in war time, especially if engaged, as so many firms are, on government work. Wednesday\u2019s match at Sincil Bank, therefore, will be played behind closed gates.\u201d</p> <p>A match held on a weekday afternoon between teams who had produced only two goals over four hours of effort, played between 75 and 100 miles from either of their home grounds and from which supporters were officially banned would not, you would think, prove much of a draw. But when matchday came, so did people. \u201cDespite the prohibition of the public, the reserved stand was pretty well filled with spectators, though hundreds remained outside the gates and all entrances to the ground were guarded by police,\u201d said the Echo. Journalists and club officials had been allowed in, along with several hundred off-duty and wounded soldiers but many more were locked outside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/football-does-seem-a-bit-irrelevant-how-covid-19-left-portsmouth-reeling\">'Football does seem a bit irrelevant': how Covid-19 left Portsmouth reeling | David Hytner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The game started. It didn\u2019t sound much fun. \u201cThe ground churned up a good deal, and the players presented black figures before the interval was reached,\u201d reported the Echo. \u201cIt looked as though there was little prospect of a goal at either end.\u201d</p> <p>Goalless it remained as the players went in at half-time, which is when everything went wrong. \u201cThe main gates had been rocking somewhat ominously at different periods through the half,\u201d wrote the Echo, while \u201cthe crowd outside had begun to tear down the boards near the main gates, and in three or four places on the Sincil Bank side, and would soon have broken through\u201d.</p> <p>Eventually the crush of people outside the ground, and the damage they were inflicting to it, was such that the gates were opened and \u201ca human tide (including several ladies) poured in\u201d.</p> <p>The Yorkshire Evening Post reported \u201cbarriers were placed against the doors, and a few police guarded them with threatening mien, but eventually the obstacles were broken down \u2026 and the police contented themselves with taking the names of a few men who had declined to be overawed by the majesty of the law.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody was overawed by the majesty of the football, though the game was eventually brought to a scruffy conclusion. Jimmy McDonald put Bradford ahead \u201cin the middle of a scrimmage\u201d in the 78<sup>th</sup> minute, and Dickie Bond added a second from the penalty spot with the last kick of the game. Norwich were out of the Cup and behind-closed-doors matches were out of favour.</p> <p>The lesson learned in Lincoln more than a century ago and reinforced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/paris-saint-germain-borussia-dortmund-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">much more recently in Paris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/10/valencia-atalanta-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Valencia</a> and elsewhere in the days before the complete shutdown of professional football \u2013 when thousands of fans gathered outside locked grounds to give their side some sightless support \u2013 is that when a significant match is on telling people they can\u2019t come in will not keep them away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107e2dcfd507b5bdafde0a0bf590e4ca32866c58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107e2dcfd507b5bdafde0a0bf590e4ca32866c58/0_115_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valencia hosted Atalanta on 10 March behind closed doors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valencia hosted Atalanta on 10 March behind closed doors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only way to manage that is to play it in secret, which is difficult to accomplish when televising it is a key part of the business plan. Many of us are more determined now to avoid large gatherings than we were a month or even a week ago but not everyone is so acquiescent and scheduling a significant football match anywhere before restrictions completely end, even if nobody manages to force the gates, would be an incitement to congregate and a nightmare to police.</p> <p>There have only been a handful of behind-closed-doors games in England since 1915, including two FA Cup replays after the initial meeting was marred by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/28/its-horrible-halesowen-halted-with-promotion-and-wembley-in-sight\" title=\"\">non-league side</a>\u2019s goalkeeper being struck on the head by an object thrown from the crowd.</p> <p>The first of those came in 1985 when Leicester side featuring an attack of Gary Lineker and Alan Smith were drawing 1-1 with Burton Albion, then of England\u2019s seventh tier, when Paul Evans, a solicitor, was knocked unconscious by a flying piece of wood.</p> <p>They went on to win 6-1 but the FA ordered a fan-free replay, which was set for Derby on 14 January, rescheduled for Coventry two days later because of a frozen pitch, and finally played in front of an audience described in the Guardian as being composed of \u201cFA and club officials, press, radio, television, ballboys, groundstaff, police and two members of the public who managed to find a way in\u201d.</p> <p>This time the Foxes won 1-0. \u201cIt might sound unprofessional but I\u2019m glad Leicester won because none of this was their fault,\u201d said the Burton manager, a then-obscure but already eminently quotable 36-year-old chiropodist by the name of Neil Warnock, who added that in a near-silent stadium the ability to clearly hear each other had helped his players: \u201cWe have to talk to each other on the pitch because when you\u2019re part-timers you\u2019re sometimes a little bit slower upstairs.\u201d</p> <p>His opposite number, Gordon Milne, was less pleased with how the affair was handled. \u201cThe crowd is part of the game and you can\u2019t perform without them \u2013 they go together,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to ask teams to play in that environment and I wouldn\u2019t like to think any professional side will be asked to do that again.\u201d</p> <p>It is a conclusion worth bearing in mind, lest in its desperation to find a way out of its predicament football makes Milnes of us all.</p>",
  "<p>About 20 years ago I was sitting with my family in a small cafe in the village of Trefin in west Wales. Apart from a small number of family groups, there was a large table with eight elderly women sitting around it. They were chatting and I was paying no attention until my ears pricked up on hearing the term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/four-lessons-the-spanish-flu-can-teach-us-about-coronavirus\">\u201cSpanish </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/four-lessons-the-spanish-flu-can-teach-us-about-coronavirus\">flu\u201d</a>.

But one woman\u2019s account, about the death of her grandmother, really captured my attention.

I was working in public health at regional level in England at the time of the overheard conversation \u2013 and I was confident that we had a robust structure, both in public health and the NHS, that could deal efficiently with any mass infectious disease. <br><br>Now the world is faced with a virus with no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-it-be-ready\">readily available vaccine</a> or treatment. The NHS has also had 10 years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/boris-johnson-conservatives-nhs-funding\">significant underfunding</a> \u2013 and England, in particular, has an operational and management system that is fragmented and lacks an effective command and control structure. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/05/poorest-hit-hardest-by-cuts-to-public-health-spending-research\">public health function</a> in England has been removed from the NHS and incorporated into local government, where its budgets have been systematically raided to prop up local councils that have suffered catastrophic cuts in the name of austerity.</p> <p>Local authority functions closely aligned with public health, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/jun/24/environmental-health-inspectors-council-budget-cuts-disaster\">environmental health</a> and social services, have been notable casualties. Within the local government world, the once powerful directors of public health have seen their influence decline, along with their staffing and resources.<br><br>The impoverishment of the NHS and the public health system in England is not the only depletion that has occurred in civil society that makes us ill-equipped to respond effectively to the greatest global health crisis in a century.</p> <p>One of the first acts of the coalition government when it came to power in 2010 was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jul/22/government-offices-england-regions\">dismantle the regional structures</a> that had provided a coherent mechanism for integrating and carrying out government policy within the English regions. The government offices for the regions (GOR) were <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/administrativegeography/england\">established in 1994</a> by John Major\u2019s administration as outposts of central government departments. They were tasked with implementing government-funded programmes and monitoring their performance. They also had an important coordination role at times of national emergency, such as during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/nov/14/oil.julianglover\">fuel protest crisis of 2000</a>.</p> <p>As well as doing away with the GOR as part of its spending review in 2010, the coalition also stripped the NHS of its regional management tier following the wide-ranging \u201creforms\u201d of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/30/health-act-means-death-of-nhs\">2012 Health and Social Care Act</a>.<br><br>The result is the absence of any integrational, coordinating or management function at a regional level in England that could operate between Whitehall departments and the various bodies, often very local, that are charged with implementing government policy. The fact that some national bodies have adopted internal organisational boundaries that cover completely different geographical territories has also complicated the situation. This is notably and unfortunately true with respect to the key health bodies, NHS England and Public Health England.<br><br>This absence of useful civil society structures outside Whitehall, apart from elected mayors in conurbations such as Greater Manchester and London, means that the approaches adopted nationally to manage the enormous coronavirus crisis are just that \u2013 national. The daily announcements keep coming, but the mechanisms available to integrate and implement various initiatives around the country are weak to non-existent. This lack of a two-way communications and governance structure has reinforced the perception of a government that is Whitehall-centric, distant from the real world and managing things by press conference. <br><br>At the heart of a country\u2019s response to a catastrophic public health crisis should be a robust, dynamic and integrated public health system. The hollowing out of England\u2019s public health capability, and of the integrating structures outside Whitehall, has hampered our response.</p> <p>\u2022 Gabriel Scally is a former regional director of public health and honorary professor of public health at the University of Bristol</p>",

  "<p>The US agriculture giant Monsanto and the German chemical giant BASF were aware for years that their plan to introduce a new agricultural seed and chemical system would probably lead to damage on many US farms, internal documents seen by the Guardian show.</p> <p>Risks were downplayed even while they planned how to profit off farmers who would buy Monsanto\u2019s new seeds just to avoid damage, according to documents unearthed during a recent successful $265m lawsuit brought against both firms by a Missouri farmer.</p> <p>The documents, some of which date back more than a decade, also reveal how Monsanto opposed some third-party product testing in order to curtail the generation of data that might have worried regulators.</p> <p>And in some of the internal emails, employees appear to joke about sharing \u201cvoodoo science\u201d and hoping to stay \u201cout of jail\u201d.</p> <p>The new crop system developed by Monsanto and BASF was designed to address the fact that millions of acres of US farmland have become overrun with weeds resistant to Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate-based weedkillers, best known as Roundup. The collaboration between the two companies was built around a different herbicide called dicamba.</p> <p>In the Roundup system, farmers could spray glyphosate herbicides such as Roundup over the top of certain crops that Monsanto genetically engineered to survive being sprayed with the pesticide. This \u201cglyphosate-tolerant\u201d crop system has been popular with farmers around the world but has led to widespread weed resistance to glyphosate. The new system promoted by Monsanto and BASF similarly provides farmers with genetically engineered dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton that can be sprayed directly with dicamba. The weeds in the fields die but the crops do not.</p> <p>Dicamba has been in use since the 1960s but traditionally was used sparingly, and not on growing crops, because it has a track record of volatilizing \u2013 moving far from where it is sprayed \u2013 particularly in warm growing months. As it moves it can damage or kill the plants it drifts across.</p> <p>The companies announced in 2011 that they were collaborating in the development of the dicamba-tolerant cropping systems, granting each other reciprocal licenses, with BASF agreeing to supply formulated dicamba herbicide products to Monsanto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"331f6cce9a58e86c62bdacbf85295d4636493568\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331f6cce9a58e86c62bdacbf85295d4636493568/0_0_3500_2208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A chemical plant in Schwarzheide, Germany, owned by BASF, which has partnered with Monsanto on a dicamba-tolerant cropping system\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chemical plant in Schwarzheide, Germany, owned by BASF, which has partnered with Monsanto on a dicamba-tolerant cropping system.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annegret Hilse/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The companies said they would make new dicamba formulations that would stay where they were sprayed and would not volatilize as older versions of dicamba were believed to do. With good training, special nozzles, buffer zones and other \u201cstewardship\u201d practices, the companies assured regulators and farmers that the new system would bring \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-food-summit-monsanto/roundup-relied-on-too-long-by-itself-monsanto-idUSTRE72D8CT20110314\">really good farmer-friendly formulations to the marketplace</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But in private meetings dating back to 2009, records show agricultural experts warned that the plan to develop a dicamba-tolerant system could have catastrophic consequences. The experts told Monsanto<strong> </strong>that farmers were likely to spray old volatile versions of dicamba on the new dicamba-tolerant crops and even new versions were still likely to be volatile enough to move away from the special cotton and soybean fields on to crops growing on other farms.</p> <p>Importantly, under the system designed by Monsanto and BASF, only farmers buying Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybean seeds would be protected from dicamba drift damage. Other cotton and soybean farmers and farmers growing everything from wheat to watermelons would be at risk from the drifting dicamba.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/dicamba-PLTF-6.pdf\">report prepared for Monsanto in 2009</a> as part of industry consultation,<strong> </strong>such \u201coff-target movement\u201d was expected, along with \u201ccrop loss\u201d, \u201clawsuits\u201d and \u201cnegative press around pesticides\u201d.</p> <p>A 2015 document shows that Monsanto\u2019s own projections estimated that dicamba damage claims from farmers would total more than 10,000 cases, including 1,305 in 2016, 2,765 in 2017 and 3,259 in 2018.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"359ec56fe389d4a81f52805dd61f1c3a13ea57e4\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/03/26/Screen-Shot-2020-03-18-at-11.44.51.jpg\" alt=\"Extract from a 2015 document showing Monsanto\u2019s projections of dicamba claims from farmers.\" width=\"1776\" height=\"1004\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extract from a 2015 document showing Monsanto\u2019s projections of dicamba claims from farmers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randles &amp; Splittgerber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Monsanto and BASF defended their products and their different roles in bringing the new dicamba crop system to market. BASF said dicamba is safe \u201cwhen used correctly\u201d and an important tool for farmers. Monsanto said its XtendiMax dicamba herbicide, which it said was not invented until 2012, was \u201ccomprehensively evaluated\u201d by the Environmental Protection agency (EPA) \u201cand determined it does not pose any unreasonable risks of off-target movement when used according to label directions\u201d.</p> <p>Several million acres of crops have now been reported damaged by dicamba, <a href=\"https://ipm.missouri.edu/IPCM/2017/10/final_report_dicamba_injured_soybean/\">according to industry estimates</a>. And more than 100 US farmers are engaged in litigation in federal court alleging Monsanto and BASF collaboration created a \u201cdefective\u201d crop system that has damaged orchards, gardens and organic and non-organic farm fields in multiple states.</p> <p>Last month the first trial over dicamba damage ended with a $265m jury verdict against Monsanto and BASF. The documents reviewed by the Guardian were obtained through court-ordered discovery by the law firm that won that case.</p> <p>The jury found on behalf of Missouri peach farmers Bill and Denise Bader, who alleged the companies\u2019 actions led to the dicamba drift that damaged 30,000 peach trees, ruining their 34-year-old family farm. The companies\u2019 actions to encourage widespread spraying of dicamba over large areas created an \u201cecological disaster\u201d, Bader attorney Bill Randles <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bader-jury-instructions-and-closing-arguments-Feb-14-2020.pdf\">told the jury</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"086a6a8b320be3184d88f9f99b0027a2e42c8e45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/086a6a8b320be3184d88f9f99b0027a2e42c8e45/0_0_2167_1438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Bader shows a comparison between a healthy peach, right, next to one of the smaller peaches that have been a common sight in his orchard, near Campbell, Mo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Bader shows a comparison between a healthy peach, right, next to one of the smaller peaches that have been a common sight in his orchard, near Campbell, Missouri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryce Gray/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>BASF and Monsanto\u2019s German owner,<a href=\"https://media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-to-swiftly-appeal-jury-decision-in-dicamba-case?Open&amp;parent=news-overview-category-search-en&amp;ccm=020\"> Bayer AG, has denied liability</a> and has said it <a href=\"https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2020/02/p-20-131.html\">plans to appeal</a> against the verdict in the peach farmer case. Their products are safe and effective when used correctly, both say. Monsanto\u2019s owner, Bayer is also dealing with thousands of lawsuits alleging its glyphosate weedkillers cause cancer. Three juries so far have found that Roundup is carcinogenic and that Monsanto hid the risks.</p> <p>Just as Monsanto has done in the Roundup litigation, Monsanto and BASF sought to keep most of the discovery documents they turned over in the dicamba litigation designated confidential. Roughly 180 have been unsealed and were cited at the Bader trial.</p> <p>\u201cThe documents are the worst that I\u2019ve ever seen for any case that I\u2019ve worked on,\u201d said lawyer Angie Splittgerber, a former tobacco industry defense attorney who works with Randles in the firm <a href=\"https://randleslaw.com/\">Randles &amp; Splittgerber</a>. \u201cSo many of them put things in writing that were just horrifying.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Profits</strong></h2> <p>Though they worked together to gain regulatory approval for the dicamba seeds, Monsanto and BASF each developed their own distinct dicamba herbicide products to be used with those seeds. And though the seeds were released for planting in 2016, the companies were unable to garner regulatory approval to start selling their new herbicides before 2017.</p> <p>Academics were skeptical of the companies\u2019 new use plan for dicamba from the outset but became more worried when the dicamba-tolerant seeds were commercialized before the new dicamba formulations. As critics had predicted, farmers who bought the new seeds then started spraying their fields with old dicamba formulations despite stickers on the seed bags prohibiting them from doing so.</p> <blockquote> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=Extract%3A%20in%20an%20April%202015%20email%2C%20one%20of%20Monsanto\u2019s%20insect%20platform%20team%20wrote%20to%20colleagues%3A&amp;extract=%E2%80%9CPotential%20issues%20with%20Xtend%20and%20growers%20confusing%20fields%2C%20spraying%20wrong%20fields%2C%20etc.%E2%80%9D%20He%20noted%2C%20seemingly%20jokingly%2C%20that%20he%20worked%20with%20a%20%E2%80%9Cgroup%20of%20renegades%E2%80%9D%20to%20%E2%80%9Claunch%20a%20technology%20without%20a%20label%20and%20thinks%20one%20sticker%20is%20going%20to%20keep%20us%20out%20of%20jail%E2%80%9D.\" data-alt=\"extract 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/extract/index.html?document-title=Extract%3A%20in%20an%20April%202015%20email%2C%20one%20of%20Monsanto\u2019s%20insect%20platform%20team%20wrote%20to%20colleagues%3A&extract=%E2%80%9CPotential%20issues%20with%20Xtend%20and%20growers%20confusing%20fields%2C%20spraying%20wrong%20fields%2C%20etc.%E2%80%9D%20He%20noted%2C%20seemingly%20jokingly%2C%20that%20he%20worked%20with%20a%20%E2%80%9Cgroup%20of%20renegades%E2%80%9D%20to%20%E2%80%9Claunch%20a%20technology%20without%20a%20label%20and%20thinks%20one%20sticker%20is%20going%20to%20keep%20us%20out%20of%20jail%E2%80%9D.\">extract 1</a> </figure>  <p>The documents show that both companies were excited about the profit potential in the new system.

scientist had asked if Monsanto would provide \u201ca few milliliters\u201d of its Xtend-formulated dicamba herbicide for testing by academics. Montgomery said the weed scientist was told Monsanto was \u201cnot testing formulation this year because of the difficulty in producing quantities that would allow for broader testing\u201d.</p> <p>Joseph Sandbrink, a Monsanto technology development manager, responded: \u201cHahaha.

Monsanto, BASF and Corteva, which also markets a dicamba product, are hoping the registrations will be renewed.</p> <p>Because of farmer concerns that dicamba drift would contaminate fruits and vegetable plots, the internal documents show that Monsanto and BASF devised a plan to ask the EPA to allow certain amounts of dicamba residues to be considered legal in crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, grapes and other foods expected to be accidentally exposed to dicamba spray. </p> <p>The EPA said since Monsanto\u2019s new seeds were introduced the agency has received about 1,851 \u201cmajor\u201d and 2,221 \u201caggregate\u201d damage reports, but cautioned that might not be a total tally.</p> <p>\u201cEPA is taking the reports of crop damage related to the use of dicamba very seriously,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said. \u201cWe are working with the states and the registrants to better understand the issue so we can address the problem of illegal drift. Considering the incidents that have been reported, we are reviewing the current use restrictions on the label to see what changes can be made so that unwanted exposures will not occur.\u201d</p> <p>Randles, the Bader attorney, said farmers are worried about continued damage. \u201cDicamba is a problem that could have been managed,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead they allowed it to become a catastrophe. They\u2019ve mismanaged this from start to finish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d said Kansas organic farmer Jack Geiger, who said his wheat, corn and soybean farm has been hit multiple times by dicamba drift. \u201cDicamba is going to make Roundup look like a tea party.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>BASF: dicamba \u2018is safe when used correctly\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a statement, BASF said: \u201cBASF believes that dicamba is safe when used correctly following the label instructions and stewardship guidelines and is an important tool for farmers who are increasingly battling resistant weeds.</p> <p>\u201cBASF and Monsanto are different entities and any effort to impute to BASF any misconduct by Monsanto is flatly wrong. In the recent trial, the jury made punitive damages findings against Monsanto, not BASF. For all the reasons that BASF has explained in court, BASF disagrees with the trial court\u2019s judgment that BASF should be responsible for Monsanto\u2019s conduct.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was updated on Tuesday 31 March to clarify that the internal emails described in the fourth paragraph were from BASF and Monsanto. </em></p>",

Concentrating on anything for more than 43 seconds is impossible. The film\u2019s sense of emptiness made me edgy. But I\u2019ll be back, when cinemas reopen.</p> <p>Funnily enough, I watched 2001 with headphones on while my toddler napped with a fever in bed next to me. She woke up right at the end, at the bit where the freaky big baby in a bubble hovers next to the moon. She was transfixed \u2013 the moon and babies are two of her favourite things.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Monday 30 March.</p> <h2>Federal government announces wage subsidy</h2> <p>Businesses will be given wage subsidies of $1,500 a fortnight for each worker to keep staff on during the coronavirus crisis as part of an unprecedented $130bn package. Prime minister Scott Morrison said the package could help 6 million Australians. The federal government will give the allowance to businesses and not-for-profit organisations that have taken a 30% hit to turnover because of the coronavirus. Companies turning over more than $1bn will be eligible if they have taken a 50% hit. The subsidies will last for six months, with full-time, part-time and casual workers who have been with their employer for at least 12 months eligible. Sole traders have also been included in the package. Payments will flow to businesses in the first week of May, with the program to start from 30 March. Workers stood down since 1 March will be able to qualify for backdated payments.</p> <h2>States to enforce new physical distancing rules</h2> <p>Following the national cabinet\u2019s advice on Sunday that social gatherings be limited to two people \u2013 unless the people live in the same household \u2013 most states have today announced they will be enforcing the rule. Western Australia and Tasmania have said they will enforce the new limits, while Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory have gone further.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those states are also moving to enforce the new advice stipulating people should only leave the house for essential reasons \u2013 such as shopping for essentials, to receive medical care or to attend work, childcare or education that cannot be done from home. More detail on these rules and enforcement can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-two-person-rule-what-we-know-about-australias-new-social-distancing-measure\">be found here</a>. So far only the Northern Territory announced it would not be enforcing the new two-person rule, with chief minister, Michael Gunner, saying they would stick to the 10-person limit for now.</p> <h2>Australians returning home placed in hotel quarantine</h2> <p>Australians who have flown back to the country since midnight Saturday have been placed into an enforced 14-day quarantine in city hotels where some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/treated-worse-than-criminals-australian-arrivals-put-into-quarantine-lament-conditions\">say they are not permitted to leave rooms or open windows, and are being given inadequate food</a>.

ACT chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman<strong>,</strong> said a woman in her 80s died after catching the illness overseas. \u201cThis is the very sad reality of this disease, which is seeing the elderly at an increased risk of complications from Covid-19,\u201d she said. In Tasmania, a woman, also aged in her 80s, died on Monday morning at the North West Regional hospital in Burnie.</p> <h2>Northern Territory to enforce stricter border control</h2> <p>The Northern Territory is beefing-up its border controls, ordering all arrivals from interstate or overseas into 14-days of forced and supervised quarantine in response to the coronavirus pandemic. From midnight on Wednesday, all arrivals will have to comply with the new rules, while from midnight on Friday anyone who arrives will be forced to pay for their hotel stay during the quarantine period. Chief minister Michael Gunner said people wanting to come to the territory had been given enough notice that such travel was not advised. \u201cDo not come here, we do not want you here. Sorry, but not right now,\u201d he said. He said his aim with the new measures was to not just slow the flow of people across the border, but to stop it completely. So far the territory has recorded 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases, all linked to overseas travel.</p> <h2>Covid-19 modelling to be \u2018unlocked\u2019</h2> <p>The deputy chief medical officer committed to releasing the modelling the medical panel is using to guide its decisions, including the restrictions.

He spent it sleeping rough in the desert along with thousands of other Afghans, awaiting the opening of the Iran-Afghanistan border. The frigid desert air froze him to the bone and hunger disturbed his sleep.</p> <p>Yunos moved to Iran one year ago. He crossed the border illegally under the cover of night and made his way to Tehran, where he found a job as an electrician. Last week, however, he decided to return to Afghanistan. The Covid-19 pandemic in Iran has already infected more than 30,000 people, killing nearly 2,400.</p> <p>Many of the 2 million Afghan workers there have lost their jobs, falling into despair. \u201cIn Tehran all shops and companies have closed, the costs of living rocketed. If you do not work in necessary services, you can\u2019t go outside,\u201d Yunos says. \u201cAll Afghans are returning home from Iran these days due to the coronavirus. We are terrified. We don\u2019t want to die in a strange land.\u201d</p> <p>Since late February, more than 115,000 Afghans have returned home through the border crossing in Herat province in what has been the biggest inwards migration wave in Afghanistan\u2019s recent history. Herat\u2019s governor, Abdul Qayum Rahimi, estimated that close to half of the returnees \u201c<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/punishment-muted-nowruz-afghanistan-coronavirus-200320143643578.html\">might be virus carriers</a>\u201d, raising fears that the influx will place greater strain on Afghanistan\u2019s fragile health system.</p> <p>While Afghanistan has so far reported only 123 Covid-19 cases \u2013 including 80 in Herat \u2013 and four deaths, officials believe that the real number of infections could be much higher. In a few weeks, the cash-strapped Afghan healthcare system will be put through a test of resilience.

So \u2013 blow your nose, wipe your eyes, wash your hands and let\u2019s get to work!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c5f49621ace55c5a475392dc5f863b478cf9b721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5f49621ace55c5a475392dc5f863b478cf9b721/0_0_310_499/310.jpg\" alt=\"Meg Rosoff\u2019s How I live Now\" width=\"310\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The suggestions and lists that have proliferated with adult readers in mind have so far tended to fall into two broad categories. There is apocalyptic fare those for people who want to lean in to the situation (everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\">Camus\u2019s</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\"> The Plague</a></em> to Stephen King\u2019s <em>The Stand</em>, usually via a few more contemporary takes such as Ling Ma\u2019s <em>Severance </em>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel\">Emily St John Mandel\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel\">Station Eleven</a></em>), and there is escapism (generally meaning either crime fiction that brings the comfort of neat resolution, or books rooted firmly in pre-Covid-19 reality, rather than fantasy worlds).</p> <p>Children being almost like people, the resonant/escapist divide makes an equally good starting point for their lists, too. In the former category, readers old enough to be aware of the current situation but not of an age or temperament to be frightened by it have plenty of dystopian fiction to devour. Beyond the primarily action-based likes of Suzanne Collins\u2019s The Hunger Games series there are more thoughtful, nuanced portrayals of life under altered circumstances such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features2\">Meg Rosoff\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features2\">How </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features2\">I Live Now</a></em>, Polly Ho-Yen\u2019s <em>Boy in the Tower</em> or Gillian Cross\u2019s overlooked <em>After Tomorrow</em>.</p> <p>The escapist list encompasses so much else that of course you\u2019ll be able to construct it to cater as minutely to your own children\u2019s tastes as you wish \u2013 though if ever there was a time to make sure <em>The Lost Book of Adventure,</em> with its mixture of stories and survival tips, was included, it\u2019s now, and I would further note that Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s Little House on the Prairie series also functions very well as a juvenile prepper manual.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed870ab04560a4a2d224d2b2170c2ccbdea051c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed870ab04560a4a2d224d2b2170c2ccbdea051c4/0_125_1497_898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Day the Crayons Quit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Day the Crayons Quit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Jeffers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one often overlooked provision must be made \u2013 funny books. Comic material for children has historically been rare (one of the reasons the now alas withdrawn Roald Dahl Funny prize was set up) but things are improving. BJ Novak\u2019s <em>The Book With No Pictures</em> and <em>The Day the Crayons Quit</em> (plus sequel) will withstand multiple rereadings at multiple ages with no diminution of laughter, as will <em>Daddy\u2019s Sandwich</em> by Pip Jones and Laura Hughes. Elys Dolan has been a failsafe in this house from picture book age \u2013 our favourite is <em>Weasels</em>, in which certain members of the family Mustelidae are bent on world domination \u2013 up to about eight or nine, well-served by the (Wizarding/Knighthood/Royalty) <em>For Beginners</em> trio. The Dave Pigeon series by Swapna Haddow is a winner with that age group, too. Once children are into double figures I would be almost as frightened to recommend something to them collectively as \u201cfunny\u201d as I would to an adult audience, but I must note that in this house Maz Evans\u2019s Who Let the Gods Out? series can do no wrong, and that a book that has kept me laughing from the age of 10 and throughout the three and a half decades since, <em>Private \u2013 Keep Out</em> by Gwen Grant, was republished last year by Vintage Children\u2019s Classics. I\u2019m grinning as I type. A special shout out must be given, however, to Frank Cottrell Boyce\u2019s <em>The Astounding Broccoli Boy</em>, which is a funny book \u2026 about a pandemic! It may yet become the Covid generation\u2019s <em>Decameron</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb77e890873026f8c0a92361e669f7c80f0c75ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb77e890873026f8c0a92361e669f7c80f0c75ee/0_0_326_499/326.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Changes Into a Chicken\" width=\"326\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It would also be sensible, of course, to sneak in a few books that approach the subject of anxiety and how to cope with it. Standout titles for the very young include <em>Ruby\u2019s Worry</em> (part of Tom Percival\u2019s Big Bright Feelings series), <em>After the Fall</em> by Dan Santat (with the irresistible subtitle <em>How Humpty Dumpty Got Back Up Again</em>), <em>The Koala Who Could</em> by Rachel Bright and Jim Field (about Kevin, my spirit animal, who cannot cope with change and prefers to keep clinging to his tree). Those a little older have the Sam Wu Is Not Afraid of \u2026 collection by Katie and Kevin Tsang to work through (the comfort of having a series, in any genre, to immerse yourself in is a particular bonus in stressful times). <em>Charlie Changes Into a Chicken</em> by Sam Copeland and illustrated by Sarah Horne falls under the \u201cfunny as heck\u201d heading too.</p> <p>For children a little older than that there is the stunning wordless graphic novel <em>Small Things</em> by the late Mel Tregonning, about a small boy whose self is being eaten away by strange shapes. It was completed, after Tregonning died, by Shaun Tan, whose own book, <em>The Arrival</em>, about the dislocation felt by a refugee coming to a strange land, offers its own pertinent message. For the YA crowd, <em>Am I Normal Yet?</em> by Holly Bourne has a protagonist who lives her life with OCD and <em>Boys Don\u2019t Cry</em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/25/malorie-blackman-time-is-right-for-bbc-noughts-and-crosses-drama\">Malorie Blackman</a> has a valuable subplot about his brother having to grapple with anxiety. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e2f9210d1fe7ffe1f116e00d3c1ca423015caf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2f9210d1fe7ffe1f116e00d3c1ca423015caf3/0_0_2663_3506/760.jpg\" alt=\"Small Things\" width=\"760\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is also a chance to encourage children to try new things, broaden their tastes, venture out of their comfort zones. And of course, reading aloud means that you can introduce them to more sophisticated books than they would be able to handle independently, which is both a pleasure in itself and a useful way of planting seeds of interest for the future. You could read them complex, evocative narratives such as Frances Hardinge\u2019s <em>The Lie Tree</em>, or introduce them to the childhood books that shaped you, both classics and glorious oddities.</p> <p>In the midst of chaos, reading to a child can create a small oasis of calm, for both of you, so try not to think of it as just another task. It\u2019s not about powering through the book as quickly as possible. It\u2019s about exploring the highways and byways as you go. If the one thing this awful crisis has given us, it\u2019s time. Books and children respond well to that. So let\u2019s all take a breath, crack a spine and try to read through these very strangest of days together.</p> <p><em>Bookworm: a Memoir of Childhood Reading</em> by Lucy Mangan is published by Vintage paperback, \u00a38.99</p>",

There are no jars, packets, bottles or boxes, nothing that can last. No packet of biscuits or noodles or a can of beans. There is never enough money to buy these superfluous items; the money is enough only for the vegetables or dal needed for one meal, and even the quantity of that meal is carefully calibrated to appetite as there is no fridge to keep any leftovers.</p> \n<p>If they need medicines, they ask the chemist for the number of pills \u2013 paracetamol, say \u2013 they need for that day rather than buying a strip.</p> \n<p>The crucial difference is that the poor have no buffer, no reserves of anything, whether money, food or medicines.

In this time of crisis, it\u2019s important that museums think about how they can go beyond their walls and reach everyone.\u201d</p> <p>The curator and art historian said \u201cfree admission is the baseline\u201d for British cultural institutions, which all need to use the outbreak as a chance to reconsider how they interact with the public and that \u201cgenerosity needs to be the medium that museums and galleries are working in\u201d.</p> <p>Arts Council England has released plans for a \u00a3160m emergency response package that will give artists access to cash grants of up to \u00a32,500 and offers \u00a350m to organisations outside its national portfolio, with a further \u00a390m to support national portfolio organisations.</p> <p>Other leading art world figures told the Guardian they would require more government support during the crisis and that the role of museums and galleries during the lockdown needed to shift online in order to provide access to world-class artworks to as many people as possible.</p> <p>The Tate\u2019s director, Maria Balshaw, said the role of galleries and museum is to \u201ckeep people\u2019s creatives spirits up\u201d by focusing on online resources \u2013 such as virtual exhibitions and videos \u2013 as well as providing more educational resources to help parents create a learning environment for their children. \u201cTate has a role to play in that,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e3a15ca788ea5b3e95fec2ab7fe16f040993288c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3a15ca788ea5b3e95fec2ab7fe16f040993288c/107_202_2556_3195/800.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Balshaw, the role of galleries and museum is to \u201ckeep people\u2019s creatives spirits up\u201d\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Balshaw, the role of galleries and museum is to \u2018keep people\u2019s creatives spirits up\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Balshaw, who released a statement confirming all four Tate sites would close a week ago, added that the nation needs art more than ever during times of high stress and anxiety. \u201cIf David Hockney can make an artwork in response to this in the moment, we need to remember to have our own creative response,\u201d she said, referring to the artist\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/artists-social-media-hope-messages-1808727\">Do Remember They Can\u2019t Cancel the Spring</a> painting, which he posted on social media last week.</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it already with Italians singing on balconies or children singing to their mum outside houses on Mothers\u2019 Day. We need to be amplifying our human capacity to respond to adversity creatively.\u201d</p> <p>The Turner prize-winning artist Martin Creed \u2013 who performed a short gig from his home in London as part of Hauser &amp; Wirth\u2019s new online series, Dispatches \u2013 said he didn\u2019t think the outbreak would alter the way he made work. \u201cI have a tendency to stay in with my curtains closed and to basically practise self-isolation anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cOften I fight against that because that leads to me, lonely in a room.

  "<p>The squares of Europe\u2019s capitals are deserted, its bars and restaurants empty, once bustling roads now silent. With no one around to talk to, the only option is to surf the internet in search of nostalgic memories and answers to the unanswerable causes of a catastrophe that has changed the world as we knew it.</p> \n<p>When the Austrian author Thomas Glavinic came up with this post-apocalyptic scenario for his harrowing and critically acclaimed 2006 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/26/fiction5\">Night Work</a><em>, </em>translated into English by John Brownjohn in 2008, he had no idea how closely it would come to resemble the real world 14 years later.</p> \n<p>As reality has caught up with fiction, Glavinic may not be the only writer to embark on a work of fiction based on Covid-19, but his is probably the first work in progress already being published. The German newspaper Die Welt has been printing his \u201ccorona novel\u201d in daily instalments.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wanted to capture the mood of this time in history, which we will remember for a very long time,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/themen/thomas-glavinic/\">first eight parts</a> of the yet unnamed work have consisted of a description of his foray to the local pharmacy, a diatribe about the uninterrupted building works in his neighbour\u2019s apartment, and rumination on theology and global finance that reads more like blog entries.</p> \n<p>Glavinic said he planned for the work eventually to take a fictional turn. \u201cIt\u2019s a hybrid of a diary and a novel. Capturing the moment also involves inventing things if they want to be invented.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many of his previous works were written in a seemingly non-literary style only to veer off to explore more existential questions. They include <em>Der Kameram\u00f6rder </em>, or The Camera Killer, a thriller published in 2001 and written in the exacting prose of a legal protocol, and <em>Wie Man Leben Soll</em> , or How One Should Live<em>, </em>a novel published in 2004 in the form of a self-help manual.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy intention with every novel is to create a piece of literature that is written from the heart of our society, but also captures the essence of this society without necessarily being able to put a name to it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Glavinic, who was born in Graz, is approaching the current crisis from an unusual angle not only because he once wrote a book about a similar scenario, but also because he has, by his own account, already spent the last three years living in de facto self-isolation.</p> \n<p>\u201cThree and a half years ago a lot of things happened in my life at the same time. I managed to liberate myself from a long-term addiction to cocaine and alcohol, and I realised that I was a couple of hundred thousand euros in debt,\u201d he said on the phone from his apartment in Vienna.</p> \n<p>The resulting depression led him increasingly to avoid social contact and hole himself up at home, where he often stayed awake for days on end.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you are inside a clinical depression, you can\u2019t even write an email or pick up the phone. I lived off stock cubes and went for three and a half years without reading a newspaper. I didn\u2019t even know who had won the World Cup,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>His practical advice, as the rest of world becomes accustomed to the idea of self- or government-imposed quarantine, is to regularly watch episodes of the US animated sitcom Rick and Morty.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt embodies what I call \u2018optimistic nihilism\u2019, which is the philosophical attitude you need to survive a global crisis without falling into a depression. It\u2019s basically \u2018We\u2019re all going to die, but that\u2019s not a reason to kill yourself\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite having specialised in stories about loners and misfits, Glavinic said he believed human interaction was essential. \u201cIf you have the opportunity to spend the weeks of quarantine not on your own, then you should try it, because it can help you get better.\u201d</p>",

But I don\u2019t want to be held to that, because it\u2019s \u2013 excuse me \u2013 deaths,\u201d Fauci said Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cBut I \u2013 I just don\u2019t think that we really need to make a projection, when it\u2019s such a moving target, that you can so easily be wrong and mislead people.\u201d</p> <p>Host Jake Tapper also asked Fauci about Trump\u2019s discussion of quarantining New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Trump ultimately abandoned his \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d idea in favor of a strong advisory urging residents of these states not to engage in non-essential travel. </p> <p>\u201cWe had very intensive discussions last night at the White House with the president. As you know, the original proposal was to consider seriously an enforceable quarantine. After discussions with the president, we made it clear, and he agreed, that it would be much better to do what\u2019s called a strong advisory,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cAnd the reason for that is that you don\u2019t want to get to the point where you\u2019re being \u2013 enforcing things that would create a bigger difficulty, morale and otherwise, when you could probably accomplish the same goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the issues is that the infection rate in New York City, in the New York City area, is about 56% of all of the new infections in the country are coming from that area. That\u2019s terrible suffering for the people of New York, which I feel myself personally, as a New Yorker,\u201d Fauci said. </p> <p>\u201cSo what was trying to be done is to get people, unless there\u2019s necessary travel, so, all nonessential travel, to just hold off, because what you don\u2019t want is people traveling from that area to other areas of the country, and inadvertently and innocently infecting other individuals,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>\u201cWe felt the better part of \u2013 way to do this would be an advisory, as opposed to a very strict quarantine. And the president agreed. And that\u2019s why he made that determination last night. And I believe he tweeted it out last night.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus task force coordinator, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/governors-warn-shortages-will-put-their-states-dire-straits-early-n1171531\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press that Covid-19 would impact the entire US. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been raising the alert in all metro areas and in all states. No state, no metro area will be spared,\u201d she said. </p> <p> \u201cThe sooner we react, and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation, at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need,\u201d Birx continued, \u201cthen we\u2019ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans\u201d.</p> <p>Fauci and Birx\u2019s comments this morning stand in contrast with Trump\u2019s previous expressions of optimism. </p> <p>His statements suggesting that parts of the US could reopen by Easter conflict with public health officials, as well as state and local authorities, who have repeatedly emphasized that things are poised to get far worse, not better, in the near future. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T15:47:46.581Z\">at 4.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e80b91e8f081e5eda239062\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardluscombe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T15:12:15.189Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd questioned Joe Biden about the fine line between constructive criticism and \u201cback-seat driving\u201d in a time of national crisis. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe line for me is to tell the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf I see something that\u2019s not happening I think it\u2019s my obligation to step up and say, \u2018This is what we should be doing\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cLook, the coronavirus is not the president\u2019s fault but the slow response, the failure to get going right away, the need to do the things that needed to be done quickly, they are the things that can\u2019t continue.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go through another phase of this and we have to be ahead of the curve.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/pelosi-trump-coronavirus-response-inaction-delays\">Pelosi accuses Trump of costing US lives with coronavirus denials and delays</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden would not be drawn on whether there was blood on Trump\u2019s hands, as House speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-us-live-new-york-cases-quarantine-news-updates-trump?page=with:block-5e809f308f0878a2a48ac6e1#block-5e809f308f0878a2a48ac6e1\">Nancy Pelosi suggested earlier</a>.

First, Donald Trump ignored official advice against unnecessary travel and went to Norfolk, Virginia, to see off the USNS Comfort, a huge ship headed for New York harbour to provide extra hospital beds to a city health system on the verge of collapse. </p> <p>As he did so, the president floated without fanfare the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/donald-trump-virginia-usns-comfort-travel\">some sort of quarantine for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</a>. This first took New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, by surprise, then made him angry. The dubious legality of such a move aside, Cuomo said, it would lead to \u201cchaos and mayhem\u201d and amount to a \u201cfederal declaration of war\u201d on the states involved.</p> <p>Trump backed off, but the federal CDC later issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-states-touching-new-york-city-told-to-stop-non-essential-travel\">stern advisory against non-essential travel</a> in the tri-state area. In Rhode Island, all the while, national guard troops were knocking on doors, looking for New Yorkers to quarantine. Cuomo wasn\u2019t happy about that, either.</p> <p>And so on Sunday the US awoke to another day of fear and uncertainty.
