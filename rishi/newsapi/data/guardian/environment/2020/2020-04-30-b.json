The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work.

The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... we are still in this pandemic.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Autonomous moves by regions would be considered illegitimate, he added, opening the way for confrontations with regional chiefs set on defying the central government.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T14:01:54.973Z\">at 3.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaad1b78f08a459b6585143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T13:26:58.472Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It\u2019s <strong>Simon Murphy</strong> here taking over the live blog while my colleague, <strong>Alexandra Topping,</strong> takes a well-earned break.

<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the peak of the distress as a result of the lockdown. It will emerge over the coming weeks,\u201d said Sir Peter Gluckman, who was the chief science advisor to New Zealand\u2019s prime minister from 2009 until 2018.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWith that will emerge some groups of people who will do well, they will find in the change opportunity, but many people who will be very uncertain, very scared, frustrated, angry, and we know from other disasters that about 10% or more even will progress to actual depression and to suicidality.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However Gluckman also said the country possessed unique assets that could see it navigate the coronavirus crisis better than other nations would.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/emotional-fallout-of-covid-19-lockdown-yet-to-peak-says-new-zealand-scientist\">Emotional fallout of Covid-19 lockdown yet to peak, says New Zealand scientist</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa5da48f08745586318479\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martinfarrer\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T05:10:32.755Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, the cabinet will meet today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">when to start easing the lockdown</a> as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached.

Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person \u201cin need\u201d and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/sitting-at-home-seems-wrong-coronavirus-volunteers-helping-the-nhs-a-photo-essay\">'Sitting at home seems wrong': NHS coronavirus volunteers \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa57e48f0882b206dcfbe0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:55:09.300Z\">5.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings.<br></p> \n  <p>Most recently, a video of her face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant </a>into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global death toll passes 232,000</h2> <p>The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 232,817, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic.</p> <p>The US has the highest number of deaths with at least 63,763, followed by<strong> </strong>Italy with 27,967.</p> <h2>Trump claims Covid-19 originated in Chinese lab</h2> <p>Asked by a reporter whether he had seen anything that gives him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of the virus, Donald Trump responded: \u201cYes I have.\u201d</p> <p>The US president said he could not say why he believes the virus came from the lab, adding that China either could not stop the spread of the virus, or let it spread. Trump declined to say whether he holds the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, responsible for what he deems is misinformation.</p> <h2>Germany eases lockdown measures</h2> <p>Germany is to reopen museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds, and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states.</p> <p>This will take place under strict conditions. Certain states have already allowed some of these activities to restart, but measures on people keeping physical distance from each other will stay in place.</p> <p>Large-scale public gatherings will remain banned until the end of August.</p> <h2>Brazil sees record 7,218 new cases</h2> <p>Brazil reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, raising the total to 85,380. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, the health ministry said.</p> <p>There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has previously attacked what he termed the \u201chysteria\u201d over Covid-19.</p> <h2>Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus</h2> <p>The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government, in the country\u2019s highest-profile case of the disease yet.</p> <p>Mishustin disclosed that he was infected during a video call with Vladimir Putin, Russian state news agencies reported on Thursday evening.</p> <p>It was unclear how severe Mishustin\u2019s case of the disease is, although one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees.</p> <h2>New York subway to close nightly for cleaning</h2> <p>For the first time in decades, New York will no longer be \u201cthe city that never sleeps\u201d. The governor, Andrew Cuomo, along with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, announced a partnership that will halt train services every night from 1am to 5am for disinfecting and cleaning.</p> <p>New York state had more than 300,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 18,000 deaths as of midday Thursday.</p> <h2><strong>Portuguese football to return on 30 May</strong></h2> <p>Portugal\u2019s government has announced the country\u2019s football league, the Primeira Liga, can resume behind closed doors from 30 May.</p> <p>The prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, said: \u201cThe games will be played behind closed doors, with no spectators in the stands, whatever the stadium, be it a league match or the Portuguese Cup final.\u201d</p> <p>Costa earlier announced his strategy to progressively lift lockdown measures imposed six weeks ago.</p> <p>The three-phase plan, starting on Monday, will open up different sectors of the economy every 15 days starting with small neighbourhood shops, hairdressers, car dealerships and bookshops.</p> <h2>Eurozone records 3.8% slump</h2> <p>The head of the European Central Bank has warned that the eurozone could be on course for a 15% collapse in output in the second quarter as evidence of the economic toll caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>pandemic started to emerge, with France and Italy falling into recession.</p> <p>After news that the 19-nation monetary union area had contracted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/30/france-recession-covid-19-lockdown-economy-eurozone-ecb-us-job-lossess-business-live\">record 3.8% in the first three months </a>of 2020, Christine Lagarde said much worse was possible in the April-June period, when the impact of lockdown restrictions would be most severe.</p> <h2>Five Australian defence personnel test positive</h2> <p>Five Australian defence force personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 after contracting it in the Middle East.</p> <p>The five people are asymptomatic and have arrived back in Australia. They were tested after a number of local contractors became infected with the virus.</p> <h2>Another resident dies at Australian care home</h2> <p>Another resident of Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House in western Sydney has died from Covid-19.</p> <p>Anglicare said the resident died yesterday afternoon, bringing the total number of Covid-19 deaths at the care home to 13.</p> <p>There are now at least 37 residents and 22 staff members who have contracted the virus at the home.</p>",
  "<p>An \u201carmada\u201d of more than 100 fishing vessels are illegally plundering south Atlantic waters close to Argentina, environmental groups say, raising concerns that the coronavirus lockdown has weakened already fragile marine protections.</p> <p>The incursion of the ships, mostly from east Asia, appears to have been carried out by stealth. The vessels waited until nightfall, shut down satellite tracking systems in coordination and then moved into the squid-rich waters of Argentina\u2019s exclusive economic zone, Greenpeace said.</p> <p>The ships were detected in Mar del Plata on the radar of a legal vessel, which reported the incident to coastguard officials and fishing authorities. </p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.pescare.com.ar/pesca-ilegal-camaras-empresarias-piden-mayor-control-y-patrullaje/\">one estimate</a>, the ships \u2013 each capable of taking 50 tonnes per day \u2013 could in less than three weeks exceed the Argentinian fleet\u2019s quota for the entire season. </p> <p>The incident has prompted questions in parliament and underlined how commercial interests are trying to capitalise on the relaxation of environmental monitoring and enforcement during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cMost people think that the global pandemic means that nature is finally having a chance to heal. But this is not what we are seeing in the unregulated waters of the South Atlantic ocean,\u201d said Luisina Vueso, from Greenpeace\u2019s Protect the Oceans campaign. </p> <p>\u201cJust one look at this shocking<a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/etGEDoi9xnBTvpdb7\"> radar image</a> shows you that this armada \u2026 is taking advantage of the lack of governance in the high seas to empty our oceans of life.\u201d</p> <p>Similar concerns have been raised in other areas of the world. In the Amazon, deforestation is accelerating and more illegal miners are invading indigenous territories following the Brazilian government\u2019s admission that it would have fewer rangers on the ground. </p> <p>On the savannahs of east Africa, conservation groups warn of a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-poachers-kill-more-animals-as-tourism-to-africa-plummets.html\">rise</a> in wildlife poaching. And in the US, oil companies have lobbied to develop wells inside national parks and for the criminalisation of pipeline protesters.</p> <p>The oceans pose an even greater worry, environmental groups say, because even before the pandemic there was very little regulation of fishing and mining in international waters. This is the least patrolled domain in the world. Monitoring has declined further since the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>This month the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd reluctantly <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/sea-shepherd-vaquita-coronavirus-2645712469.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">suspended</a> its campaign to protect the critically endangered vaquita porpoise in Mexico\u2019s Upper Gulf of California because it was unable to secure fuel due to the pandemic.</p> <p>Industrial tuna fishing companies have persuaded maritime organisations to remove onboard monitors, reduce port inspections and loosen trans-shipment requirements. </p> <p>The Canadian government has followed several countries in <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/fisheries-oceans-canada-pulls-at-sea-observers-fishing-boats-coronavirus-covid-19/\">removing observers </a>from all fishing vessels until the end of May, which means no oversight of what is caught and discarded.</p> <p>This has alarmed ocean conservationists and some of the more responsible fishing companies. The <a href=\"https://iss-foundation.org/\">International Seafood Sustainability Foundation</a> said the lower level of surveillance would \u201copen the door to increased illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and in doing so could undermine the recovery and resilience of many important fish stocks globally.\u201d</p> <p>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Manach, the scientific director of <a href=\"http://www.bloomassociation.org/en/\">the ocean protection group Bloom Association</a>, said fishing fleets around the world were pushing for fewer restraints on their activities, which could have disastrous implications.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic is a good excuse for industrial fisheries because without observers you can do exactly what you want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be a major mistake to allow weaker regulations at a time of crisis because once you do that it is hard to go back. If anything we need stronger monitoring during this crisis. This could be the moment when we put CCTV cameras onboard every fishing ship. This would be a major step forward.\u201d</p> <p>Fishing fleets are lobbying for weaker rules so they can compete on a level playing field. The nationalist undercurrent was apparent in the UK recently when five European supertrawlers entered British waters. This is legal but it provoked accusations that they were taking advantage of the lockdown, because there were fewer such vessels this time last year.</p> <p>Vueso said the worsening free-for-all showed the need for a global ocean treaty that would create more sanctuaries and coordinate management of the high seas and punishment of violators. </p> <p>\u201cThe solution is not to just add more patrolling to Argentine waters if hundreds of vessels from different nationalities are operating illegally in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cA strong treaty would also increase international collaboration to crack down on vessels like these that even during a global lockdown will seek to take advantage of any opportunity to plunder our ocean.\u201d</p> <p>In the tuna-rich waters of the coral triangle in south-east Asia, illegal fishing has long been rife, and locals expect it to grow in the pandemic. Last month Indonesian maritime authorities <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/13/five-vessels-from-philippines-vietnam-caught-fishing-illegally-in-indonesian-waters.html\">seized</a> three Philippine and two Vietnamese illegal fishing vessels.</p> <p>\u201cWe are prepared for any increase in illegal vessels operating in [Indonesian waters] amid the spread of Covid-19. That is why we are not decreasing our operations as illegal fishing is still rampant,\u201d the government said.</p>",
  "<p>Domestic abuse victims will be able to access safe spaces at Boots pharmacies across the country from Friday under measures to improve access to support during the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Multiple support services for domestic abuse have reported a surge in calls to helplines since the lockdown was imposed, while the Metropolitan police said it was making an average of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/charges-and-cautions-for-domestic-violence-rise-by-24-in-london\">about 100 arrests a day</a> for offences linked to abuse in the home.</p> <p>Many victims who are now unable to seek help while at home trapped with their abusers will still be expected to shop for food and medicine, and there have been calls for safe space initiatives to be introduced in supermarkets and more pharmacies.</p> <p>The domestic abuse charity Hestia is overseeing a safe space model in consultation rooms at most of the 2,400 Boots pharmacies across the country to provide access to support for anyone experiencing domestic abuse.</p> <p>People who wish to use the safe space consultation room need to ask at the pharmacy counter. Once inside, they will find the 24-hour national domestic abuse helpline, the men\u2019s advice line and phone numbers for services specific to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>There will be signposting to download Hestia\u2019s mobile app Bright Sky, which provides support and information to anyone who may be in an abusive relationship.</p> <p>Lyndsey Dearlove, the head of Hestia\u2019s UK SAYS NO MORE campaign, said: \u201cWhile lockdown and social distancing measures continue, it is restricting victims of domestic abuse reaching out to their friends, family and co-workers for support.</p> <p>\u201cWe know there is an increased level of uncertainty for people looking to escape an abusive relationship. Self-isolation offers a new method of control over victims making it very difficult for them to seek support.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise that key workers in pharmacies hold a unique position within the community as a single point of contact for victims. By creating this safe space in Boots pharmacies, we hope many will be able to safely access support while following government guidelines.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope more pharmacies will follow Boots UK\u2019s lead and join the Safe Space initiative. Although we are in a period of lockdown and isolation, our message to victims is domestic abuse services are open and we can help you.\u201d</p> <p>Hestia said it had already seen a 47% increase in victims reaching out for information and support on its Bright Sky app during the lockdown period.</p> <p>The president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Sandra Gidley, said: \u201cDuring the pandemic, when options for survivors and victims are even more limited than usual, pharmacies can provide the safe environment needed to get support. The trust that the public have in pharmacies make them an ideal place to access help and take a step away from harm towards a better future.\u201d</p> <p>Duncan Rudkin, the chief executive of the General Pharmaceutical Council, which regulates pharmacies in Britain, said: \u201cWe are encouraging all pharmacies to consider becoming a Safe Space, to help people experiencing domestic abuse access vital support they may need.</p> <p>\u201cPharmacies are in the frontline in supporting the healthcare needs of patients and the public during the Covid-19 pandemic in the community, and are one of the few places that are open to people who may need help.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The 24-hour national domestic abuse helpline can be reached on 0808 2000 247</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>A new study has found that the government\u2019s $4bn Murray-Darling irrigation efficiency program, designed to make farms more efficient while returning some of the saved water to the environment has actually led to irrigators who received subsidies extracting more water than those who did not.</p> \n<p>The study by academics from University of Adelaide, University of NSW, the Australian National University and the Environmental Defenders office found up to 28% more water was extracted by those who received subsidies.</p> \n<p>It also found that the subsidies went mainly to corporate farming and that 51% of irrigators themselves were sceptical about whether the programs were working.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/17/climate-change-likely-to-blame-for-dwindling-murray-darling-inflows-report-finds\">Climate change likely to blame for dwindling Murray-Darling inflows, report finds</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Their findings, published in the international journal, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, analysed almost 2,500 on-farm Murray-Darling Basin irrigation surveys and identified a \u201crebound effect\u201d of increased water extractions, coinciding with the Australian government\u2019s investment in irrigation infrastructure upgrades.</p> \n<p>Efficiency programs \u2013 such as installing drip irrigation or lining dams \u2013 are funded under the Murray Darling Basin plan as a way of reclaiming water for the environment.

But direct buybacks are highly contentious in rural communities because of their economic impact.</p> \n<p>Prof Quentin Grafton, from the Crawford School at ANU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/14/murray-darling-buybacks-twice-as-cheap-as-efficiency-projects\">told a senate committee </a>last year that the difference is approximately $5,400 per megalitre for water infrastructure subsidies versus just over $2,000 per megalitre for the purchase of water entitlements from willing sellers.</p> \n<p>Now this report casts doubt about whether they are actually retrieving water at all.</p> \n<p>\u201cCombined with documented concerns around measurement of water and compliance, this raises serious doubts about the true extent to which environmental flows are increasing at a catchment and basin level, as a consequence of the subsidised upgrades,\u201d the authors said.</p> \n<p>Lead author and resource economist Prof Sarah Wheeler from the University of Adelaide said: \u201cOur analysis over the past decade found that irrigators who received infrastructure grants actually increased their water extraction volumes by 21 to 28%, compared to irrigators who received no subsidies.\u201d</p> \n<p>The subsidies aim to help irrigators upgrade their infrastructure technology to save water and return some savings to the environment, in a bid to increase stream flows and ultimately reinstate a sustainable level of extraction in the Murray Darling Basin.</p> \n<p>Prof Richard Kingsford, director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at UNSW Sydney, said the implementation of some government programs seemed to have the opposite effect of what they had intended.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe \u2018buyback\u2019 of irrigation water has put water back into the rivers, but our research found the subsidised infrastructure program could be \u2018robbing Peter to pay Paul\u2019 by enabling more water extractions than water recovered through the efficiency program,\u201d Kingsford said.</p> \n<p>The study also found that half of all irrigators surveyed agreed that the taxpayer-funded program for the irrigation infrastructure was \u2018wasteful and inefficient\u2019.</p> \n<p>The study found that the program favoured corporate agriculture, in terms of subsidy amount per entity more than family farms.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a8cf5c4-f228-4260-bbcc-09191d41aaff\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NzqSu7DbWgA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The increase water extraction occurred because of changes in crop types, increases in irrigated areas and greater use of surface water entitlements [water that is captured on farm rather than being allowed to flow into the river system],\u201d Grafton said.</p> \n<p>Environmental Defenders Office special counsel Emma Carmody said: \u201cThere are a range of regulatory and governance issues which could result in the increased taking of water from some rivers and aquifers in the MDB, beyond specified limits.\u201d</p> \n<p>These include illegal extractions, increased floodplain harvesting, groundwater substitution and problems with \u2018sustainable diversion limit\u2019 compliance tools in some catchments.</p> \n<p>Kingsford warned that if water consumption is not being controlled as required by the basin plan, the health of rivers and groundwater systems in the Murray-Darling Basin will continue to degrade, without even accounting for the current and future threat of climate change.</p>",
  "<p>NHS understaffing will make it difficult and potentially divisive to transfer black, Asian and minority ethnic health workers away from the coronavirus frontline, hospital bosses fear.</p> \n<p>The ongoing reassignment of those with underlying health problems and pregnant staffers will further complicate attempts to enact NHS England guidelines that BAME staff should be \u201crisk-assessed\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19\">redeployed where possible</a>.</p> \n<p>However, growing numbers of hospitals are responding to the disproportionate number of minority ethnic people dying of Covid-19 by taking steps to help BAME personnel, including ensuring they have the protective equipment they need and are a priority to get tested.</p> \n<p>Hospitals, ambulance services and providers of mental healthcare in England were told by NHS chiefs on Wednesday that they should allow BAME staff to transfer to different roles if they wish.</p> \n<p>In new guidance to trust bosses, NHS England said that \u201con a precautionary basis we recommend employers should risk-assess staff at potentially greater risk and make appropriate arrangements accordingly\u201d.</p> \n<p>NHS trusts bosses have begun discussing what they can do to help BAME staff reduce their risk. But there are major doubts about the viability of NHS England\u2019s order, especially given the huge extra pressure the health service is under from treating so many people with Covid-19.</p> \n<p>One official said: \u201cRedeployment of BAME staff is really tricky, because you have to make quite difficult decisions about certain people being on the frontline [dealing with Covid patients] and not others. It\u2019s not like trusts are awash with staff they can start redeploying [to cover BAME colleagues], especially as they have already had to redeploy people to staff Covid wards.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Asif Munaf, a specialist registrar at Lincoln county hospital, said: \u201cThe guidance is at best vague as it does not outline the exact measures that will need to be taken. Does it mean BAME healthcare professionals will be redeployed to undertake more admin tasks, as everything is \u2018high risk\u2019 at present?</p> \n<p>\u201cSecondly, it will be impossible to enact as an already skeleton service of doctors and nurses cannot afford to have BAME colleagues moved away from the frontline, especially with almost half of all UK doctors and a quarter of all nurses coming from BAME backgrounds.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also warned the guidance would lead to huge variations in practice as trusts took different interpretations and said that it showed \u201cthe disconnect between those writing up official guidance and those in charge of enacting\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trusts where as many as half their staff are from BAME backgrounds cautioned that they would find it particularly challenging to allow widespread reassignment.</p> \n<p>An official at one such trust said: \u201cHospital bosses are very worried about this very high death rate among BAME staff. But it\u2019s not obvious exactly what we can do. If you have a high proportion of BAME workers, how do you provide normal care if a substantial number of them move away from their usual roles? It\u2019s difficult.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, at the four hospitals run by Imperial Healthcare NHS trust in London, where 52% of staff are minority ethnic, \u201cPPE helpers\u201d who go round the wards ensuring that staff are using their personal protective equipment (PPE) correctly are particularly focusing on BAME workers. The trust is also ensuring that 52% of the tests for coronavirus now being offered to their staff are undertaken by minority ethnic staff.</p> \n<p>It has also urged BAME staff in a letter this week to raise any concerns about how their usual working environment is affecting their level of risk and pledged to take action.</p> \n<p>Dr Ramesh Mehta, the president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said the key was testing for comorbidities in BAME staff and making sure they had the correct PPE. The NHSE advice had been interpreted wrongly, he added. \u201cThe wording could have been better. They should have said these people should be screened and if they are fit they should be allowed to work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unions welcomed the NHS England guidance and the move to assess BAME staff.</p> \n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association council chair, said: \u201cBAME doctors and healthcare workers have done and continue to play an absolutely crucial role in our health service and in the fight against Covid-19. The NHS has a duty of care as an employer to protect its staff from harm and those that are at greater risk of serious infection.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs such, those healthcare workers at high risk can be redeployed to areas where they are less at risk or work remotely \u2013 in any case they will still be providing a vital service to the NHS which still needs to provide wider healthcare.\u201d</p>",

Below is a summary of the developments of the day. If you have any news tips or thoughts, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarah_marsh_journalist/\">please do share them with me</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson said the UK did the \u201cright thing at the right time\u201d.</strong> Johnson says people should understand that the collating of data internationally is bedevilled with difficulties. The only real comparison will be possible at the end of this, when you look at total excess deaths. He said<strong> </strong>the UK avoided an \u201cuncontrollable and catastrophic\u201d epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths and that we were now \u201cpast the peak\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Following the lead of various world cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/world-cities-turn-their-streets-over-to-walkers-and-cyclists\">including Bogot\u00e1 and Berlin</a>, Manchester has announced plans to close part of one of its main streets to cars</strong> and widen the pavements along others in order to help people walk and cycle safely while maintaining physical distancing \u2014 and move towards a car-free future.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have now been 26,771 coronavirus deaths in the whole of the UK in all settings, an increase of 674 on yesterday. </strong>These figures are just for people who tested positive for coronavirus. They do not include people who may have died from coronavirus who were not tested.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued a stern warning that GCSE and A-level grade assessments this summer</strong> should not unfairly penalise children from minority ethnic minority backgrounds, as well as disabled pupils and those with special educational needs.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 9,000 fines have been handed to people in England and Wales for allegedly flouting coronavirus lockdown laws, according to new figures.</strong> As PA Media reports, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council<strong> </strong>(NPCC) said <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/police-chiefs-welcome-positive-start-to-recruitment-drive\">8,877 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) had been recorded by forces in England between March 27 and April 27</a>, while 299 were issued in Wales over the same period. Some 397 were for repeat offenders, with one person fined six times.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eab03128f08fcc89d8bb448\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T18:01:05.979Z\">7.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson's press conference - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson warned Britons that they could face an \u201ceven bigger\u201d coronavirus outbreak if the government rushed or mishandled the relaxation of the lockdown.</strong> He made the point in an opening speech which, while not giving any firm details of the government\u2019s plans, effectively paved the way for an announcement next week that seems likely to involve the lockdown being extended yet again in most significant respects. He made the point with a slightly confused Alpine metaphor. He said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have come through the peak.</p> \n   <p>Or rather we\u2019ve come under what could have been a vast peak, as though we\u2019ve been going through some huge alpine tunnel.</p> \n   <p>And we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us.</p> \n   <p>And so it is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain.</p> \n   <p>And so to avoid that disaster our fifth and final test is that nothing as I say we do should lift the R or the reproduction rate of that disease back above one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson then showed a video explaining the R number (the reproduction number - the rate at which a virus spreads) and why it was so important to keep this below 1. It was very hard to see the video as anything other than an attempt to explain the stringent social distancing measures will have to stay in place for a considerable time to come. You can watch it here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1255893826457214979\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are five tests that must be met before social distancing measures can be adjusted.<br><br>One of these is the rate of infection, or R.<br><br>Keeping the R down will be vital to our recovery, and we can only do it with discipline and by working together. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayHomeSaveLives?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StayHomeSaveLives</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Z10K0Yp90m\">pic.twitter.com/Z10K0Yp90m</a></p>\u2014 UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1255893826457214979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the government would publish \u201ca comprehensive plan\u201d next week explaining how it would be possible to move away from the lockdown. </strong>The Scottish and Welsh governments have already published their own version, and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has repeatedly called for a UK version. Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will be setting out a comprehensive plan next week to explain how we can get our economy moving, one, how we can get our children back to school, back into childcare, second, and third how we can travel to work and how we can make life in the workplace safer.</p> \n   <p>And in short how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time re-start the economy.</p> \n   <p>A huge amount of work has been going on on that that plan and as we produce it we are being guided by the science, and we will try to build the maximum political consensus as we produce it across all parties and across the UK.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, in response to a question from a member of the public (Michelle from Cornwall), Johnson also said that that the plan would not commit the government to relaxing particular restrictions by particular dates. That would depend on the data, he said. Michelle wanted to know when holidaymakers would be able to return to Cornwall. Johnson was unable to give her any firm indication at all.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the government may find \u201cingenious ways\u201d of suppressing coronavirus.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to .. make sure we not only unlock the economy gradually, but also find ways of continuing to suppress the disease, and possibly find new, more ingenious ways of suppressing the disease. That\u2019s what we are working on now and you\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of that, I hope, next week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant, but he may have given a clue in his answer to a question on face coverings.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson backed the wearing of face coverings by members of the public in some circumstances.</strong> He said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I think Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] is saying, and what I certainly agree with, is that as part of coming out of the lockdown, I do think that face coverings will be useful both for epidemiological reasons but also for giving people confidence they can go back to work. But you\u2019ll be hearing more about that thing next week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/sturgeon-urges-scots-to-wear-coronavirus-face-masks-for-shopping-and-travel\">The Scottish government has already backed the wearing of face coverings on public transport and in certain shops. </a>Johnson\u2019s words suggest the UK government is going to issue very similar advice.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the UK has passed the peak of the epidemic.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That was less significant than it sounded, because it has been clear for some time now that the UK has passed the peak. <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/peak-covid-19-deaths-occurring-english-hospitals-passed-8-april\">This week scientists said the peak for coronavirus deaths in English hospitals was passed on 8 April </a>- 22 days ago.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that he did \u201cthe right thing at the right time\u201d when it came to imposing the lockdown.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as we possibly could with the peak of the epidemic.</p> \n   <p>That peak, as I said just now, has passed. I do think that broadly speaking, and we\u2019re learning lessons every day, but I do think that broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is is not a view shared my most members of the public; a poll today suggests two thirds of people think the lockdown was imposed too late. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaabe168f0882b206dcff8f#block-5eaabe168f0882b206dcff8f\"> 1.01pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that it would be best to wait until all-cause excess death figures are available for all countries before making a judgment as to which countries have been the best and the worst at fighting coronavirus.</strong> This is an argument also endorsed by government scientists, but Johnson sounded more defensive today than on Monday, when <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-downing-street-27-april-2020\">in his speech outside No 10</a> he was talking about the UK\u2019s \u201capparent success\u201d. As <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">this chart illustrates</a>, in terms of total coronavirus deaths, the UK now has the third most in the world, behind only the US and Italy.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that he would not resort to austerity to manage the increased debt generated by this crisis. </strong>Asked if there would be a new era of austerity, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the economy will bounce back strongly, I think that this government will want to encourage that bounce back in all kinds of ways.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve never particularly liked the term that you just used [austerity] to describe government economic policy and it\u2019ll certainly not be part of our approach.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This might turn out to be more of an aspiration, or an insight into Johnson\u2019s linguistic preferences, than a guide to his likely economic policy. As explained earlier, this crisis is set to leave a \u00a3200bn hole in the national finances this year.

The survey is the second full report after an initial pilot to quiz members of the public, and involved more than 679 Welsh residents selected at random, with results adjusted to population demographics.<br><br>Among results, the survey reveals 11% of people think they have had coronavirus \u2013 down from 13% the week before \u2013 with 9% unsure. \u201cOf those that think they have been infected, 8% have had this confirmed with a test,\u201d the survey adds. What\u2019s more, 12% of people say a family member or friend has been hospitalised or died from Covid-19, up from 8% the week before. <br><br>And while 58% of people think the government is doing a good job, 26% disagree or disagree strongly.<br><br>The virus also appears to be fuelling concerns, with 65% of those living with children worried about the children\u2019s wellbeing and almost one in five worrying a lot about their mental health. A similar proportion, 20%, said they worry a lot about losing their job or getting a new one.<br><br>Prof Karen Hughes, who coordinates the survey for Public Health Wales, added: \u201cWeek on week, we are monitoring the views and behaviours of people in Wales during the coronavirus restrictions.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman again played down the prospect of any significant change to the lockdown next week, saying it would be wrong to \u201cgamble away\u201d what has already been achieved.</strong> No 10 has been transmitting this message for some days, but this seemed to be an even stronger hint that people should not expect too much from the review of the lockdown due by Thursday next week. The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything which could lead to the virus, which the British public have done so much to suppress, being able to spread in an exponential way again, and that will guide our approach as we move forward. People have made huge sacrifices in order to bring down the rate of infection, to protect the NHS and ultimately to save lives and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to an exponential growth in the disease again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if the lockdown could continue until June, the spokesman said people would have to wait for the government decision. But he also reminded reporters of what <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has said about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47#block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47\">how the virus will be around for a significant period of time.</a> The spokesman went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the PM himself has said, the worst thing we could do is relax the social distancing measures too soon and throw away all of the progress that has been made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is still examining the impact that different relaxation measures might have on R, the reproduction number (the infection rate of the virus), and that it did not present any findings to cabinet today.</strong> This work will be crucial because the government will only implement measures relaxing the lockdown that, taken together, do not push R above 1.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Boris Johnson chaired a political meeting of cabinet before the normal cabinet today.</strong> At normal cabinet ministers received updates from Whitty and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman came close to ruling out the lockdown measures being eased region by region, instead of on a UK-wide basis. </strong>Yesterday <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister, said that although he favoured maintaining a UK-wide approach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39#block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39\">there might be a case for letting island communities do their own thing.</a> But the spokesman played down the prospect of this happening. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We did consider, when we introduced the social distancing measures, bringing them in in some parts of the country ahead of others. We decided not to do that.

It could not legally be the basis for the suspension of repossession actions which had been imposed.</p> \n  <p>But Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the high court, suggested that the practice direction had been imposed in an emergency and that it was effectively \u201ctrialling\u201d changes to the rules. \u201cThis is to see what measures can deal with [cases] in the context of a clogging up of justice\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Lady Justice Simler said the emergency rules did not prevent access to justice but merely imposed a 90-day delay on the process of house repossessions.</p> \n  <p>Lawyers for the justice secretary, Robert Buckland QC, have intervened in the case because of its significance.</p> \n  <p>The Housing Lawyers Practitioners Committee has also been permitted to intervene. In a statement issued before the hearing, the organisation\u2019s co-chairs, Marina Sergides and Simon Mullings, said: \u201cThe issues are crucial to our members and their clients.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In their legal submissions to the court, lawyers for the HLPA said: \u201cIf the appellants succeed in persuading the court that [the practice direction] is ultra vires then [this freeze] will cease to apply to all possession claims.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That would expose many vulnerable people to losing their homes during the lockdown, they argued. \u201cA significant proportion of members\u2019 clients are also vulnerable as a result of physical and/or mental health problems, as a result of which they find it difficult properly to understand information and provide their solicitors with documents and instructions even face-to-face.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The submission added: \u201cThis is a time when litigants, particularly those of limited means, are liable to find it particularly difficult to engage with the courts and with their lawyers if they have them. Practitioners and the courts are under exceptional pressure and the resources available to them are depleted. The provisions take effect for a temporary period while court procedures in response to Covid-19 are evaluated and they are subject to review.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The hearing continues.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:36:19.435Z\">at 1.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaac2608f0874558631881d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rebeccasmithers\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:20:00.270Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Consumers still panic-buying toilet roll have another option from today.

The Tory-run county councils\u2019 network was furious that its members, all of which provide social care services, had recevied a 29% cash reduction compared with the first bailout, and faced a collective financial shortfall of \u00a3600m.</p> \n  <p>Cllr David Williams, the county councils\u2019 network chair, said: \u201cUnless a solution is forthcoming to address these growing additional pressures as the crisis goes on, and, crucially, our lost income, it is inevitable that the resources in shire counties made available to life-critical social care services will be reduced, resulting in extremely difficult choices facing our member councils.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMost importantly, unless further support is provided to all councils, some may feel that they have no choice but to suspend all non-essential expenditure, hampering our national efforts to defeat the coronavirus and prepare for the economic recovery.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The big winners are smaller districts.

No 10 was very keen to play down those suggestions, and today it is expected that his tone will be much more cautious, stressing the dangers of any significant move away from the restrictions currently in place.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8271289/Blueprint-work-PM-warns-wont-risk-second-wave-coronavirus.html?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=0ee8e24982-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_30_05_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ee8e24982-189782117\">In the Daily Mail</a> <strong>Jason Groves</strong> quotes a Whitehall source using an interesting image to suggest that only modest changes are in the pipeline for next week. The source told him:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at whether we can undo the top button and make things more comfortable in one or two places for the economy.

I am told that what relaxation there will be will mostly concern outdoor activities. (Though it is worth remembering that there is more flex in the current guidelines than is generally realised. Anyone can go to work, for instance, if they can\u2019t work from home.) Schools in England are likely not to return until after half-term. Next week\u2019s review will, according to one of those involved, be about a \u2018timeline for when we can do things\u2019 rather than an opportunity to do them straight away.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s interview last night (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced#block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced\">9.53am)</a> may have constrained Johnson even further. Until now the four nations of the UK have (with minor exceptions) been adopting a joint approach to coronavirus, agreed at meetings of the emergency committee Cobra, at which the devolved administrations are represented. But Sturgeon has repeatedly said that Scotland would diverge from the UK approach if she thought that was justified. If she were to decide next week that any relaxation of the lockdown would be unacceptable (which is what she hinted last night), it would be risky for Johnson to set different rules for England. Perhaps he would get credit for opening up the economy, but if coronavirus infection rates were to start to soar again south of the border, he would be open to the charge of being reckless with people\u2019s lives.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T10:31:48.540Z\">at 11.31am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa9dc58f08b27d8fdd71be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T09:45:17.121Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 3,000 additional officers have joined police forces under the recruitment pledge that formed a centrepiece to Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-3000-extra-officers-join-police-in-recruitment-drive\">new figures have shown.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson promised to recruit 20,000 officers during the summer 2019 election campaign, which many noted would in fact replace roughly the same number that had been lost under 10 years of Conservative party austerity.</p> \n  <p>The government set out its plans to recruit 20,000 additional officers by March 2023 in September and the Home Office on Thursday published the first official set of statistics on progress towards that number.</p> \n  <p>They show 3,005 recruits joined the police specifically as part of the uplift programme.

As reported already (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa76168f0882b206dcfc93#block-5eaa76168f0882b206dcfc93\">8.06am)</a>, he conceded that the government might miss its target of getting the daily number of coronavirus tests up to 100,000 by the end of April. (Although today is the last day of April, the government has said we might have to wait until Saturday until we officially know whether or not the target has been hit, because it takes time to find out what has happened with home-testing kits.)</p> \n  <p>Here are some of the other lines from his interviews.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Buckland said that Nicola Sturgeon was right to warn that it might not be possible to lift any lockdown measures next week.</strong> The government has to review the lockdown measures by next Thursday, three weeks after the original measures were extended. In an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston programme last night Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that it might be impossible to relax any of the measures currently in place. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People talk about lifting the lockdown - that is not going to be a flick of the switch moment, we\u2019re going to have to be very careful, very slow, very gradual. I\u2019m far from convinced at this stage that when we get to the next review point on the 7 May we\u2019ll be in a position to lift any of these measures right now, because the margins of manoeuvre that we\u2019re operating in right now are very, very, very tight and narrow.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about her comment, Buckland said Sturgeon was \u201cright to be cautious\u201d.

  "<p>A title on Ben van Beurden\u2019s bookshelf in his video message to Shell investors captured the mood \u2013 Fall of Giants, by Ken Follett. A pillar of the UK stock market has tumbled. Shareholders have been sure of Shell\u2019s dividend since the second world war, but now the distribution has been cut by two-thirds. The chief executive himself called the decision \u201cmonumental\u201d.</p> <p>It looks the correct move, however, for the reasons Van Beurden gave. The collapse in global demand for oil isn\u2019t a matter of a few percentage points. It was 30% in April, which obliges a management to budget for lower oil prices for longer.</p> <p>Shell reckons it can knock $9bn (\u00a37.1bn) off operating costs and capital expenditure, but the saving is insufficient if a barrel of Brent could fetch $20 to $30 for a while yet. The aim is to protect Shell\u2019s balance sheet at a moment \u201cwhen we have no idea what could happen\u201d. Butchering the divi will save almost $10bn a year.</p> <p>Mind you, $16bn is also a tidy sum. That\u2019s how much Shell spent on share buybacks between July 2018 and January this year \u2013 all at prices above \u00a322 v the current \u00a312.86. Van Beurden, while congratulating himself for being responsible with the divi now, forgot to express remorse over the buyback. It\u2019s not as if Shell\u2019s balance sheet was unencumbered by debt at the time.</p> <p>Still, the new preference for prudence stands in contrast to BP\u2019s stance on divis earlier this week, which was to keep paying at the old rate, or try to do so. BP chief Bernard Looney, whose balance sheet looks as strained as Shell\u2019s, needs to explain how he will protect his much-trumpeted planned investments in long pay-back renewable assets. We\u2019ve heard the good intentions; let\u2019s see the arithmetic. The strong hint from Shell was that investing in energy transition is harder if you\u2019re over-distributing dividends.</p> <p>Shell remains a giant of the FTSE 100, of course, but it\u2019s no longer the biggest. With perfect timing, soaraway AstraZeneca, as it unveiled its tie-up with Oxford University to develop and produce (we hope) a Covid vaccine, edged ahead on market capitalisation on Thursday. AstraZeneca\u2019s shares are up 9% this year, while Shell\u2019s are down 40%. The pandemic is sorting stock market winners from losers at astonishing speed.</p> <h2>Transparency is commendable, yet \u2018base\u2019 assumption appears bullish</h2> <p>Visibility is as poor for banks as it is for oil companies. The 95% plunge to \u00a374m in Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s first-quarter profits was driven by an \u00a31.4bn impairment charge, the largest part of which was an estimate of the size of the bad loans that will inevitably show up soon.</p> <p>Managements have to conduct these impairment exercises even in normal times, but rarely does the process feel so much like guesswork. Doing its best to demonstrate rigour, Lloyds sketched four pictures of the UK economy over the next few years \u2013 \u201cbase\u201d, \u201cupside\u201d, \u201cdownside\u201d and \u201csevere downside\u201d \u2013 and then applied a probability weighting to arrive at its impairments. The first three were awarded 30% probability and hell was given 10%.</p> <p>It\u2019s one way to do it and the transparency is commendable. Yet a \u201cbase\u201d assumption of a 5% decline in GDP feels a little bullish \u2013 many economists expect much worse. Still, the \u00a31.4bn impairment was at the conservative end of City analysts\u2019 own guesses, so it\u2019ll do for now. Everyone knows the end-of-year figure will be bigger.</p> <h2>Now is a good time to say something</h2> <p>It is now five full weeks since Intu, the debt-laden owner of shopping centres, including Lakeside in Essex and Trafford near Manchester, said it had an \u201congoing dialogue with the UK government and may look to access their \u00a3330bn support package\u201d.</p> <p>The statement was mysterious since the Covid Corporate Finance Facility, the relevant scheme for companies the size of Intu, is only open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial shape before the crisis. With the best will in the world, nobody would put Intu in that bracket. The stock market values the equity at just \u00a380m while the borrowings are \u00a34.5bn.</p> <p>Has Intu\u2019s \u201congoing dialogue\u201d with government gone nowhere? And how goes the other dialogue with banks and bondholders? Now would be a good moment for Intu to say something, lest boardroom silence is interpreted as despair.</p>",

Belgian liberal Hilde Vautmans said his first statement had not been complete and called on Borrell to release earlier drafts of the disinformation report.</p> <p>Nathalie Loiseau, a former career diplomat and now one of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s closest allies in the European parliament, gave her backing to Borrell. She said the EEAS public report had been \u201cimpactful\u201d and did not mince words. But she wanted to know why it failed to mention Chinese diplomats\u2019 false claims about France, a key element thought to have been left out of the public report. A Chinese embassy website had claimed falsely that 80 French politicians had signed a statement using a racist slur to denigrate the head of the World Health Organization.</p> <p>Borrell replied that this case was not included because it was considered to fall into a different category, \u201cbullying by a diplomatic mission\u201d, rather than disinformation in open sources. He added that the case had been very widely reported by the media, \u201cso we were not trying to hide anything\u201d.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s chief diplomat also told MEPs he first knew of the row when he read the newspapers last Friday. He criticised MEPs for attaching more weight to an apparently disgruntled member of staff who had leaked emails to the New York Times.</p> <p>\u201cPlease be serious \u2026 why a single leak of a single member of the staff presenting their own impressions is more important than the whole work of the people there and my personal political commitment. Don\u2019t weak[en] the institution,\u201d Borrell said.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s counter-propaganda unit, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/eu-anti-propaganda-unit-gets-1m-a-year-to-counter-russian-fake-news\">East StratCom taskforce</a>, was created in 2015 to counter Kremlin-backed disinformation after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. It has since expanded to cover disinformation targeted at the western Balkans and neighbouring countries. The coronavirus pandemic has given it a global focus, with reporting on China and Iran.</p> <p>While declining to reveal the extent of EU contacts with China, Borrell did not hide Beijing\u2019s discontent, saying: \u201cThe Chinese were not happy. They were not happy at the beginning and they are still not happy now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Ibsen\u2019s 19th-century play <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Enemy_of_the_People\" title=\"\">An Enemy of the People</a> is a political drama about a physician who tries to save his town from water pollution only to wind up as a scapegoat. For the doctor the issue is health; after testing the water supply he urges a shutdown and new pipes to be laid to save lives. The town\u2019s mayor is concerned about the economic cost. Better, the politician reasons, to keep the town open and correct the problem gradually. In the moral combat that ensues it is the doctor who becomes alienated from the town he struggled to protect. The play\u2019s message is a counsel of democratic despair: that might is more powerful than right.</p> <p>This insight has not been lost on the British government. Like Ibsen\u2019s fictional politician, ministers refused to see the viral threat. Boris Johnson did not want to contemplate a draconian response. When they did act, ministers found they were behind in a global race for critical resources such as ventilators, testing capacity and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52440641\" title=\"\">personal protective equipment</a>. The failure to move decisively to suppress the pandemic lies at the root of the mess. Rather than admit responsibility for being behind the curve, ministers refuse to apologise and instead seek to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/matt-hancock-snaps-journalists-ends-21875798\" title=\"\">delegitimise</a> the media for asking questions about why Britain failed.</p> <p>Downing Street claims that \u201cmany people will be looking at our apparent success\u201d. Having lost more than 26,000 lives to the coronavirus pandemic, the UK now accounts for an eighth of the world\u2019s Covid-19 deaths with less than a hundredth of its population. If this counts as success, one shudders to think what might be considered failure. Every mistake invites a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lewis_goodall/status/1253792952528375808?s=20\" title=\"\">rebuttal</a>. The government deploys a three-pronged denial familiar to observers of the Brexit culture wars. The first prong is to doubt that there is a serious problem; the second is to question the veracity of unwelcome reporting; last is to tar dissent as treason.</p> <p>Mr Johnson wants to co-opt the population in a national effort under his command. But Britain is set to lose more people in the coronavirus outbreak than in the blitz. He claims the frontline of the NHS has held, but does not want to own the heavy losses on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-revised-up-to-26097-dominic-raab-announces-video\" title=\"\">social care flank</a>. The prime minister wants no narrative to take hold that could trigger a backlash on the home front that his administration cannot contain.</p> <p>Instead the government is attempting to use data to create the sense that the pandemic can be monitored as it happens. But daily numbers tell a distorted story. The missed target of 100,000 tests a day is a case in point. The volume of testing is not the issue; the question is whether it is extensive enough to map the virus spread so that it can be rolled back. South Korea has a population of 52 million but has recorded fewer than 250 coronavirus deaths by running <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vietnam-fight-insi-idUSKBN22B34H\" title=\"\">57 tests for every confirmed Covid-19 case</a>. The number for the UK is less than a tenth of that. Britain has been too late in increasing its testing capacity, and nor does it have a tracing system to track down people who might have been exposed to the virus.</p> <p>Despite the facts, Mr Johnson will spend the weeks ahead claiming he will <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boris-has-found-a-path-out-of-lockdown-but-it-wont-be-smooth\" title=\"\">out-Korea the Koreans</a> by halting virus transmission and will keep it in check with a \u201ctrack, trace and test\u201d approach. Performing this U-turn will open the prime minster up to the charge that he acted too late. Already the finger of blame is being pointed at the state, neglecting that it had been shrunk by a decade of Tory rule. Instead of sharing uncertainties with the public, Mr Johnson continues the self-deception. To err is human. Resolving the tension between the economy and health, as Ibsen\u2019s play ultimately reveals, cannot be solved by the god of public opinion.</p>",

  "<p>Scientists have discovered microplastics in greater quantities than ever before on the seabed, and gathered clues as to how ocean currents and deep-sea circulation have carried them there.</p> <p>Microplastics \u2013 tiny pieces of plastic less than 5mm in size \u2013 are likely to accumulate most densely on the ocean floor in areas that are also biodiversity hotspots, intensifying the damage they may do to marine ecosystems, according to the research.</p> <p>The international research team found up to 1.9m pieces in a thin layer near the seafloor covering just 1 sq metre. The discovery suggests that deep-sea currents act as conveyor belts that concentrate microplastics in hotspots, similar to the \u201cgarbage patches\u201d visible on the surface in parts of the Pacific.</p> <p>Those same hotspots are also key breeding grounds for marine life, such as filter-feeding ascidians, or \u201csea squirts\u201d, which are particularly prone to microplastic ingestion, along with sponges and cold water corals.</p> <p>Polychaetes, or \u201cbristle worms\u201d, live within the upper layers of sediment and actively mine it, and so can ingest buried microplastics that are decades old, showing that even when the pollutants fall to the seafloor they are not out of harm\u2019s way and still have an impact on key ecosystems. These biodiversity hotspots are also home to various fish species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3487f8f24bc51f897f78139759bfc1339aedf7dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3487f8f24bc51f897f78139759bfc1339aedf7dd/0_264_4960_2978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A diagram of how microplastics get into the sea and are then carried along by deep-sea currents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A diagram of how microplastics get into the sea and are then carried along by deep-sea currents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ian Kane/University of Manchester</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Ian Kane, of the University of Manchester, was lead author of the <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba5899\">study published </a><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba5899\">in the </a><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba5899\">journal Science</a>.

For instance, a recent study found hermit crabs exposed to microplastics seemed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/29/microplastics-disrupt-hermit-crabs-ability-to-choose-shell-study-suggests\">less able to select new shells to live in</a>.</p> <p>Most of the microplastic found in the study came not from the breakdown of larger pieces of plastic material, which previous thinking has suggested as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/14/scientists-call-for-better-plastics-design-to-protect-marine-life\">leading source of microplastics</a>, but from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads\">textiles and clothing</a>. That is an important finding, according to Kane, as it shows that much more can be done to prevent these tiny particles making it into the sea in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cWe can all make a difference by choosing not to buy fast fashion, which has a short shelf life in the shops and in our wardrobes, or by choosing to avoid plastic packaging and so on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The most powerful interventions, however, would need to come from the government and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/microplastics-in-water-not-harmful-to-humans-says-who-report\">waste and water treatment industries</a>, such as using filtration to prevent microplastics reaching the sea in the first place, Kane said. \u201cThese filters exist, for example graphene filters developed at the University of Manchester and new nanocellulose filter developed in Finland \u2026 But it\u2019s really at the governmental policy level that these need to be implemented.\u201d</p> <p>Jacqueline Savitz, from the conservation group Oceana, said: \u201cThis study shows why estimates of plastic pollution that have focused only on what is observed at the surface so severely underestimate the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e31b82054bfb0121d6465868d9d5778fbe939b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e31b82054bfb0121d6465868d9d5778fbe939b5f/0_262_7952_4769/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew on board a trawler during a fishing trip in the Tyrrhenian Sea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tyrrhenian Sea, where the research took place, is host to key fisheries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Medichini/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis relationship between microplastics hotspots and biodiversity hotspots compels us to act to turn off the plastic production faucet \u2013 it shows that cleanups will never suffice and that recycling has done little to address the problem.

They collected sediment samples from the seafloor of the Tyrrhenian Sea in the Mediterranean west of Italy, and examined them in conjunction with calibrated models of deep ocean currents and detailed mapping of the seafloor. In the laboratory, the microplastics were separated from sediment, counted under the microscope, and analysed using infra-red spectroscopy to determine the plastic types.</p> <p>The area of sea examined is also host to key fisheries, such as bluefin tuna, swordfish and grouper.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global coronavirus death toll approaches 230,000</h2> <p>The total number of fatalities around the world is at least 228,908, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic.</p> <p>The US has the highest number, at least 62,200, followed by Italy with 27,682. The UK\u2019s death toll is 26,097 and Spain has lost 24,543 lives.</p> <h2>Denmark says partial reopening has not accelerated virus spread</h2> <p>Authorities in Denmark said the spread of Covid-19 has not accelerated since it became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago. Daycare centres and schools began reopening two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no signs that the Covid-19 epidemic is accelerating,\u201d said Denmark\u2019s State Serum Institute, which is responsible for preparedness against infectious diseases.</p> <h2>Further 674 deaths in the UK as Johnson says country is \u2018past the peak\u2019</h2> <p>There have been a further 674 recorded deaths from coronavirus, Boris Johnson said in his first Downing Street daily briefing in more than a month. He said the figure included deaths outside of hospital, bringing the total number of deaths to 26,771.</p> <p>Johnson said the UK was \u201cpast the peak of this disease\u201d and \u201con the downward slope\u201d.</p> <h2>UK government likely to miss testing target</h2> <p>The government will probably fail to reach its target of testing 100,000 people per day for coronavirus by the end of April, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has admitted.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had previously promised to meet the goal by the end of Thursday.</p> <p>Buckland said 52,000 people were being tested per day and capacity was rising. He said of the target: \u201cEven if we don\u2019t hit it, and it\u2019s probable that we won\u2019t, we will in the next few days.\u201d</p> <p>Buckland added: \u201cIf he [Hancock] hadn\u2019t set a target, he would have been criticised for being unambitious.\u201d</p> <h2>US unemployment continues to grow</h2> <p>A further 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in six weeks 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits.</p> <p>US unemployment remains on course to reach levels not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <h2>Spain to allocate times slots for outdoor activities</h2> <p>Health authorities said time slots for specific outdoor activities would be used to help avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out to exercise from Saturday for the first time since mid-March.</p> <p>Children in Spain have been allowed out to exercise with a parent or guardian since last Sunday.</p> <p>The transport minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, said trips outside would be \u201csequenced\u201d to prevent what he called \u201can explosive exit\u201d.</p> <p>The number of fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight in Spain fell to 268, the lowest in nearly six weeks, the health ministry said.</p> <h2>Italy enters recession</h2> <p>Italy has joined France in recession after recording its worst slump in decades. Italian GDP shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, figures from ISTAT show, its worst performance since the data series began in 1995. There was a 0.3% contraction in October to December, meaning Italy has notched up two consecutive quarters of contraction and is in recession.</p> <h2>South Korea records no new domestically transmitted cases</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a> reported no new domestic coronavirus cases on Wednesday for the first time since February, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.</p> <p>It reported four new infections, all imported cases, taking the national tally to 10,765. The death toll rose by one to 247.</p>",

Because people aren\u2019t able to spend their evenings in the pub or the cinema, more than ever are sitting outside listening to this natural phenomenon.</p> \n<p>The great bird migration began with common scoter ducks flying over the UK in early April. According to the <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/news/massive-common-scoter-movement-takes-place/\">Bird Guides website</a>, the number of reports received on the night of 1 April was unlike anything seen before in UK birding history.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt least 60 sites, the vast majority in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Northumberland, logged the species, with some localities reporting that multiple flocks were passing over on a near-constant basis for extended periods of time during the night,\u201d the website reads.</p> \n<p>So many people reported hearing the birds, researchers could track <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/articles/citizen-science-reveals-nocturnal-scoter-migration-routes\">the exact route of the migration</a> as it made its way across the country. Using this data, Alexander Lees, a senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester Metropolitan University, is looking to write a paper charting migration corridors. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to map the overland migration route of these birds for the first time ever essentially \u2013 it\u2019s been incredible,\u201d he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ab377152-0c7f-4bee-ba27-7eba1027649d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Citizen science is research performed by non-scientists, usually members of the public. It has led to numerous discoveries, from new planets and animal species to insights on coral reef restoration and butterfly populations. Nasa, the Natural History Museum and even the US government are among the many organisations that ask members of the public, including children, to help collect data, interpret results and solve research problems for scientific projects.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Can citizen science help biodiversity? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Citizen science plays a vital role in monitoring plant and animal populations around the world, often through mobile phone applications. iNaturalist, a joint initiative between the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, allows users to photograph and identify plant species around the world, informing scientific research. Nearly 35m observations of 269,859 species have been uploaded to the platform in towns, cities and rural areas from every continent.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it useful even in a pandemic? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes. Whether you are documenting the organisms you see during your daily hour of exercise or just recording what you see from your window, the biodiversity you document will further scientific research. While stuck at home, you could even help scientists<a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch\">&nbsp;count penguins in Antarctica</a>, monitor<a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/cmfoley/seal-watch\">&nbsp;global seal populations</a>&nbsp;or<a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/pangorilla/wild-gabon/about/research\">&nbsp;record large mammal sightings</a>&nbsp;in Gabon.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Useful projects and applications</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/\">Zooniverse</a>&nbsp;lists several projects you can help with that are not just limited to biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/citizen-science\">The Wildlife Trusts</a>&nbsp;is asking for volunteers on citizen science projects.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>iNaturalist, eBird and Tree ID are among the hundreds of citizen science phone applications for biodiversity available.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Other birds such as quail, terns, sand martins, chiffchaffs, swallows, warblers and cuckoos, are among those doing the spring migration. Most migrate at night to avoid predators, and in the cooler air they use less energy. \u201cIf these birds arrived during daylight hours people would be just aghast at what\u2019s happened. A sky full of birds,\u201d says Lees.</p> \n<p>As well as birds, moths are also most active at night and there is no need for a moth trap to see them. Leaving a light on in a room and opening a window (close the door so they don\u2019t fly into the rest of the house) or leaving the porch light on should attract them. Moths such as the large yellow underwing, silver Y moth and hummingbird hawk moth are widespread, visible in urban as well as rural areas.</p> \n<p>There are 2,500 species of moth in the UK. July and August are peak times but they will already be out in spring. \u201cWhen the weather is warm in summer, you can bring in hundreds of moths \u2026 It\u2019s a good idea to start at this time of year and ease yourself into it. It\u2019s a bit scary when you get 200 moths in a trap at once,\u201d says Dr Emma Coulthard, a lecturer in ecology at Manchester Metropolitan University, who encourages the public to log their findings via the <a href=\"http://www.gardenmoths.org.uk/\">Garden Moth Scheme</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac73340335e3194134a3fe71ffa70a8f72a39100\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac73340335e3194134a3fe71ffa70a8f72a39100/0_0_3346_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There are 2,500 species of moth in the UK, including the tiger moth, pictured.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are 2,500 species of moth in the UK, including the tiger moth, pictured.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Tinsley-Marshall/Kent Wildlife Trust</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the lockdown in the UK continues, nature-watching in its cities and the countryside should only get better.

Often, we\u2019re too busy to stop and notice, but when we slow down, we can tune in to nature and start to notice what\u2019s been there right under our noses all along.</p> \n<p>Even if we have no space but a window ledge, growing plants, watering and nurturing them and watching as they flower and start to attract insects can lift the spirits, while bringing peace and tranquillity to your space \u2013 and of course it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to develop your wildlife photography skills and take some great pictures.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Enjoy it!<br></strong>The best wildlife photographers are people who do it for the pure joy of it \u2013 not to win awards or for social media likes. Doing something purely for yourself and not being motivated by the approval of others can be so much more enjoyable! It doesn\u2019t matter what camera kit you\u2019ve got or how rubbish your pictures are if they are just for you.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e06fb31f69ef403518997a09ab353841fed503ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e06fb31f69ef403518997a09ab353841fed503ff/0_0_6642_4433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opportunistic pictures are the hardest to take.

Become a wildlife photojournalist<br></strong>Documenting a story is a great way to bring a narrative to your pictures. You could try to photograph and identify every insect you find in your garden, or simply document the growth of the plants and flowers. Looking back at a set of pictures taken over weeks is a great way to appreciate how quickly things change at this time of year. Perhaps make a lockdown diary or go on a back garden bug safari with your children and start a garden wildlife lockdown list.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Start a species project<br></strong>Focusing on a particular species is a great way to create an exciting gallery of images. Really paying attention to just one species is the best way to learn about its habits and behaviour, and develop your wildlife photography skills. Every time you take a picture of a subject, you automatically look for new ways to do it: a new angle, better lighting or perhaps an action shot.</p> \n<p><strong>4. Champion the underdog</strong><br>Following on from the previous tip, don\u2019t get hung up on trophy-hunting the sexy species! The less glamorous the animal, often the better the photographic opportunities \u2013 likely the ones ignored by other photographers. You don\u2019t need to travel across the world to photograph elusive wildlife \u2013 I have won awards with pictures of local pigeons, gulls and foxes. Even if you can only find slugs in your garden, you can still get creative!</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd38546c2dc9b3ab88f94580d06f0bf7f817218b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd38546c2dc9b3ab88f94580d06f0bf7f817218b/0_0_10801_7201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You don\u2019t need to chase exciting species to get a great shot, such as this one of a European robin (Erithacus rubecula) spotted in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You don\u2019t need to chase exciting species to get a great shot, such as this one of a European robin (<em>Erithacus rubecula</em>) spotted in Bristol.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Hobson/NPL/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>5. Let it come to you</strong><br>Opportunistic pictures are the most difficult to take; getting the camera out in a rush and trying to get a good picture before something disappears can be frustrating \u2013 and can make us miss an exciting wildlife encounter entirely. My best pictures come from observation and planning. For example, if you know that bees keep returning to a particular flower, or birds are regularly coming to a feeder, you can lie in wait and be ready with your camera when the next one returns. Wildlife is particularly bold at the moment as there are fewer people on the streets and the reduced noise means animals can better listen out for danger. You might be able to attract something not usually found in your area like a hedgehog or fox by leaving out some treats in your garden (it\u2019s easy to research online what is responsible and appropriate if you\u2019re planning to feed something).</p> \n<p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",

So yes, the ECB will be paying banks to take money off it.</p> <p>The ECB is also making another refinancing operation more generous -- by cutting the interest rate on its TLTRO programme to minus 0.5%. This will rise (<em>or do I mean fall?</em>) to minus 1% if they pass enough money onto businesses and consumers.</p> <p>In addition, the ECB voted to leave its main interest rates unchanged. So the headline rate is still 0%, with a minus 0.5% interest rate on commercial bank deposits at the ECB (again, meant to encourage them to lend).<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eaab7b28f0882b206dcff42\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T11:38:56.152Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain will spend more than \u00a3100bn this financial year trying to repair the damage caused by the coronavirus, according to the latest estimates.</strong></p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility is tracking chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s various pledges - from the jobs retention scheme to business rate relief.

  "<h2>JOS\u00c9 IT AIN\u2019T SO</h2> \n<p>How the mighty have fallen. Fifteen years ago today, Jose Mourinho delivered Chelsea\u2019s first title in 50 years. He was the best manager in the world, adored by his players, with a roguish twinkle in his eye, a Clooneyish flash of grey in his hair and face muscles that still worked. Now he\u2019s delivering vegetables. Sure, there\u2019s a global pandemic and all that, but the Fiver is merely following the scien- sorry, stating the facts. In 2005, Mourinho was the best manager in the world. In 2020, he\u2019s a grocer\u2019s lackey, no better than David Moyes.</p> \n<p>And whether it\u2019s because of an incurable addiction to post-match interviews or a squeamishness about his own brain every time he handles a cauliflower, Mourinho is keen to get back to his day job. \u201cI miss football,\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with Vera, 72, while delivering some artichokes and tatsoi. \u201cBut I prefer to say I miss our world, like I think we all do. Football is just part of my world.

  "<p>Has the fourth estate overstepped the mark, piling undue pressure on a beleaguered British government doing its utmost to navigate through a national catastrophe that was not of its own making? That\u2019s certainly the conclusion of our political masters, who three weeks ago briefed that <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-a-lockdown-extension-is-seen-as-inevitable\">their polling</a> showed public dissatisfaction with \u201cgotcha\u201d questions from journalists.</p> <p>It is the verdict, too, of Robbie Gibb, the former BBC head of political programming who became director of communications under Theresa May. Journalists at press conferences were \u201casking questions through the prism of political culpability\u201d and were hunting for \u201cgovernment U-turns\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobbieGibb/status/1250103771977351169\">he claimed</a>, suggesting they focus on medical queries about the virus instead. Even Lord Sugar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lord_Sugar/status/1254866098136035329\">chimed in</a>, arguing that the public \u201cdo not want or need to blame\u201d, let alone require \u201cconstant criticism of our government, who are doing their very best in a very difficult and unprecedented global emergency\u201d.</p> <p>Why are government outriders so keen to delegitimise scrutiny, to portray any questioning as sabotage; to cast dissent as embittered opponents opportunistically lashing out, contemptuous of Boris Johnson\u2019s mystical connection with the British electorate? As it happens, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/risj_oxford/status/1255024825678139392\">polling</a> finds that the newspaper most consistently critical of the government\u2019s strategy \u2013 this one \u2013 has been judged to be doing the best job of covering the pandemic by the public; the most pro-government newspaper, the Sun, the worst job. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/media/articles-reports/2020/04/29/no-trust-media-has-not-collapsed-because-coronavir\">Independent polling</a> has not shown any public backlash against a supposedly excessively critical media: it is a myth.</p> <p>Far from being a victim of partisan skulduggery, the government is facing little scrutiny for the largest civilian death toll outside of conflict. In the middle of March, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, declared that keeping coronavirus deaths below 20,000 would be a \u201cgood outcome\u201d. As of today the official number of coronavirus deaths in hospitals and in the community stands at more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-revised-up-to-26097-dominic-raab-announces-video\">26,000</a>, making the UK the <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries\">third-worst-hit country in the world</a>, behind Italy and the US. We are still at least a year away from developing a vaccine.</p> <p>So when Johnson simultaneously insults and deceives the nation, saying, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/a-deflated-johnson-struggles-to-muster-his-usual-ebullience\">many will be looking at our apparent success</a>\u201d, where is the deafening outrage at a prime minister who has made Britain an international case study in what not to do in a pandemic? A fortnight after assuming the premiership, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7345031/PM-BORIS-JOHNSON-pledge-come-hard-crime.html\">Johnson declared</a> that \u201cour first duty is to protect the public in the most basic way\u201d. He has betrayed that most basic and sacred responsibility of government.</p> <p>The government\u2019s attempt to airbrush from history their embrace of herd immunity \u2013 a policy even Donald Trump denounced as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-uk-herd-immunity-coronavirus-catastrophic-boris-johnson-covid-2020-4\">\u201ccatastrophic\u201d</a> \u2013 has been aided and abetted by a largely supine media. Instead of being opposed, the strategy was facilitated by some parts of the media. While Lombardy in northern Italy appeared consumed by a biblical disaster, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston was <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/Herd-immunity--will-be-vital-to-stopping-coronavirus\">writing</a> an article headlined \u201c\u2018Herd immunity\u2019 will be vital to stopping coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>When the British government <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/u-k-abandons-effort-to-contain-virus-moves-to-delay-the-worst\">abandoned contact tracing</a> after 10 deaths and 590 confirmed cases, it made a choice. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t stopped it on 12 March, our epidemic would have been much less,\u201d as Anthony Costello, a professor of global health, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/contact-tracing-cant-be-run-by-westminster-experts-warn\">puts it.</a> \u201cThey effectively allowed it to spread.\u201d As the virus passed from person to person, the country had insufficient surgical gowns, visors, swabs or body bags, because the government had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52440641\">failed to buy personal protective equipment</a> in its pandemic stockpile. Now ministers clap and cheer the key workers they left exposed to a deadly illness. If the media cannot land a blow on the government for decisions that lead to thousands of avoidable deaths, then what is it for?</p> <p>The systematic attempt to stifle even mild attempts by the media to hold government to account is itself dangerous. A fortnight ago, a senior cabinet source <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/17/cabinet-ministers-admit-no-lockdown-exit-plan-wait-boris-johnsons/\">told the Telegraph</a>: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to go down this route in the first place \u2013 public and media pressure pushed the lockdown, we went with the science.\u201d If there had been more determination by the media to challenge the government\u2019s decision to make Britain an international outlier in the pandemic, lockdown may have happened earlier and thousands of lives could have been spared. Decisions made by our government have left us one of the most devastated nations on Earth. The cost? Personal suffering as thousands of families mourn the loss of loved ones and unnecessarily grave economic and social turmoil. If our democracy cannot hold our government to account for turning an inevitable tragedy into an avoidable national catastrophe, then it has failed altogether.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist<br></p>",
  "<p>Victoria Beckham has reversed a decision to furlough 30 staff at her fashion label and said that her team\u2019s welfare \u201cmeans everything to me\u201d after the decision to apply for public money drew heavy criticism.</p> \n<p>Following a change of heart by the designer and her board, the application to the government scheme has been withdrawn and all employees concerned restored to their roles.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will not now be drawing on the government furlough scheme,\u201d Beckham told the Guardian. \u201cAt the beginning of the lockdown the shareholders agreed with senior management to furlough a small proportion of staff.

Beckham, whose net worth is estimated at \u00a3335m and who had been sharing images on social media from the family\u2019s luxury lockdown at home in Oxfordshire when the news broke, was heavily criticised for a claim which would have cost about \u00a3150,000 in government funds.</p> \n<p>The furlough scheme has becoming a lightning rod for high emotion around how the huge economic burden of the crisis is to be shared between taxpayers and wealthy individuals and businesses.</p> \n<p>Beckham\u2019s reversal follows a pattern seen at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/liverpool-reverse-decision-to-furlough-staff-after-fierce-criticism-coronavirus\">Liverpool </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/tottenham-make-u-turn-on-decision-to-furlough-staff-after-fans-fierce-criticism\">Tottenham football clubs</a>. Both initially announced they would furlough non-playing staff, applying to the government-funded job retention scheme for financial support, but subsequently had a change of heart.</p> \n<p>In a letter to fans the Liverpool\u2019s chief executive, Peter Moore, said: \u201cWe believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, a source close to Beckham denied that the reversal had been prompted by the backlash, saying that she \u201cis well aware of the intense scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye, and doesn\u2019t complain about it\u201d.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the board said that the company \u201cnow believe that with the support of our shareholders, we can navigate through this crisis without drawing from the furlough scheme\u201d.</p> \n<p>Online sales of Victoria Beckham clothing since lockdown have exceeded the revised forecasts drawn up by the business at the onset of the crisis, and although Britain remains in lockdown crucial links in the international supply chain are now emerging from mothballing.</p> \n<p>All of the Italian factories which produce the label\u2019s garments are scheduled to be up and running by 11 May. Beckham is said to be keen to get back to designing the next collection \u2013 although the catwalk schedule is currently on pause, with fashion weeks in June and July cancelled and the major September shows in London, New York, Milan and Paris likely to be scaled down, postponed, or otherwise reimagined.</p> \n<p>The backtracking reflects signs of cautious optimism in the fashion industry, as some regions of the globe begin the process of reopening after the crisis.</p> \n<p>Predictions that quarantine would cause seismic shifts in consumer behaviour and snuff out demand for fashion and luxury in the long term are being called into question by recent reports from China.</p> \n<p>On 11 April, the first day of reopening, the Hermes boutique in Guangzhou took $2.7m, the brand\u2019s highest ever single day takings. The phenomenon is being dubbed \u201crevenge spending\u201d.</p> \n<p>The furore highlights the delicate position that Victoria Beckham and her brand occupy in British public life. As a designer she has a huge brand name, but a relatively small business. Against the global luxury giants against whom she competes for customers, her label is a minnow.</p> \n<p>Having taken \u00a330m in investment from Neo Investment Holdings three years ago, the designer and her husband own 47% of her label, with the majority owned by the board. The brand has established itself as one of the most respected and influential fashion houses on the show circuit, but has yet to turn a profit.</p> \n<p>The family star power of \u201cBrand Beckham\u201d brings her label the kind of public interest most designers can only dream of. The front row line-up of David Beckham and the couple\u2019s four children next to Anna Wintour has become an iconic fashion week image.

The continent is as engulfed by Covid as the UK, so I wouldn\u2019t bank on leaders having much time to cater to British fancy,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cRecovery comes first and last, and a trade deal with the UK is of course a necessary element, but not one that needs to be addressed urgently.\u201d</p> <p>A second EU diplomat said: \u201cIf No 10 doesn\u2019t change its negotiating approach, we will very likely be looking at a no-deal scenario. So we take this statement [on the positive chances of a deal by Michael Gove] as a welcome sign that the UK will change its negotiating stance and start talking on the basis of the joint political declaration,\u201d the document agreed between the EU and Boris Johnson last October.</p> <p>However, the UK source said: \u201cWhat is slowing us up is the EU\u2019s insistence on extra provision, notably the level playing field area, aspects of governance and, of course, there is no meeting of minds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/23/brexit-deal-fishing-cornwall-devon-trade-talks-europe\">fisheries</a>. If they continue to insist on their position on a so-called level playing field, and on continuing the common fisheries policy, for example, we are never going to accept that.</p> <p>\u201cDraw your own conclusion from that, but I hope they will move on. There are some fundamentals that we are not going to change, we are not going to move on, because not so much that they are negotiation positions as they are what an independent state does.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI am confident we will get over that \u2026 but probably a bit more noise has to happen before we get to that point.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson has been facing calls to consider asking for an extension to the transition period to avoid the UK having to trade on World Trade Organization terms with the EU from the end of the year.

We can\u2019t plan for the speedy ratification we were hoping for, for many reasons, and everyone is distracted.\u201d</p> <p>Brussels officials also perceive a lack of top-level political engagement in the negotiations.</p> <p>The EU has accused Johnson of backsliding on promises to uphold common standards on the environment, health and workers\u2019 rights \u2013 the so-called level playing field. Under pressure from coastal member states such as France, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, Barnier has also insisted there will be no trade deal without an agreement on fishing rights.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, the EU-UK specialised committee for the region met for the first time, on Thursday. The DUP MP Ian Paisley accused the group of being \u201cstuffed with civil servants\u201d and bureaucrats. He said: \u201cThey are not getting the nitty gritty of business needs.\u201d</p> <p>The committee will be critical to the future of Northern Ireland as it has the mandate to work out and recommend what checks should be in place in the Irish Sea when the transition period ends in January.</p> <p>Industry leaders in the region warned that Brexit checks would be imposed on businesses struggling for survival in the Covid crisis, and there was a need for the government to be transparent and straight with them. </p> <p>Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said there could be \u201cno hail Mary pass, no gentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d on Brexit checks and the detail needed to be \u201cnailed down\u201d soon to give businesses any chance to prepare.</p>",

  "<p>Being a relative of a care home resident today means guilt, frustration and fear. With close to 2,400 residents a week dying from the virus and predictions of a death toll higher than in hospitals, the anguish of not being able to hold loved ones is compounded by struggles to find out what is happening inside locked-down homes and concerns about exposure to the virus because of a lack of protective kit.

Last Wednesday, the message was that David was sitting up singing songs; the next day he stopped eating and drinking.</p> <p>\u201cIt was awful,\u201d June said. \u201cI wanted to go in [wearing] a black bin liner \u2013 home-made. We struggled to get feedback from staff. It\u2019s not about blame, we just wanted to be communicated with.\u201d</p> <p>What the family had not been told was that the GP had already concluded that David was suffering from Covid-19, and had written a prescription to treat him. They only found out four days later.</p> <p>\u201cWe know the care was good, but the communication has left us so disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>He died peacefully on Tuesday morning.

The 82-year-old had died 90 minutes earlier of suspected Covid-19 in a care home in Harrow. For weeks, the only contact between them had been a weekly 20-minute WhatsApp video call. That was all that the home would arrange for residents during lockdown. Now she insisted on seeing him one last time by video link.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just so weird,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are looking at him and someone else is holding the phone. I managed to take a couple of screenshots. I was in shock, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d He looked blue, which she thought meant he had lacked oxygen before he died. He suffered from dementia, but otherwise had been reasonably healthy.</p> <p>Diana was full of praise for the care staff: \u201cThey are suffering just as much if not more than NHS staff. They have no protection for themselves but have had to watch the people who they have had a strong relationship with die without any medical care.\u201d</p> <p>She has been left feeling angry at the home\u2019s management, though, because after Harvey fell ill with a temperature and chest infection, she asked for daily calls with him and they did not happen.</p> <p>\u201cI feel absolutely gutted,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel completely lost. It is like a bad dream for me. I was not told he was going into a decline. They didn\u2019t tell me they thought he wasn\u2019t going to live. I could have spoken to him. I feel so let down by it all.\u201d</p> <p>She said his death was ascribed to dementia on the death certificate, but his symptoms and the speed of his decline indicated Covid-19. The last proper conversation she had with him was on the Thursday before Easter when he told her he didn\u2019t feel well.</p> <p>\u201cI told him I loved him and he told me he loved me.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Susan and Ruby Birch</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI have been sick with anxiety,\u201d said Susan Birch, whose mother, Ruby Birch, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 22 April in her Birmingham care home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9/0_0_800_1200/667.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Birch, top, talking to her mother Ruby Birch by Skype in her care home\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Birch, top, talking to her mother on Skype.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It did not help when the call came saying she was being placed into isolation so they could not speak to her for a week. Ruby, 76, who suffers from mental health problems, relied on social contact and entertainment in the home. All that was gone.</p> <p>The family sent in a mobile phone.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I speak to her I bear in mind there may not be another chance,\u201d Susan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she is going to take a turn for the worse. I try to make the most of it and listen to everything she says. I have a keyboard and play Amazing Grace and we sing together.\u201d One day, Susan dug out a recording of her late father talking and played that back to her mother via Skype.</p> <p>The inability to find out what is happening in the home causes a lot of worry. Susan relies on \u201csnatched phone conversations with care workers\u201d. She does not understand why the manager has not contacted her.</p> <p>\u201cI saw care workers in the background in a Skype call a few weeks ago with zero PPE on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are trying to source some from my husband\u2019s employer in Brighton. He works for a company now using 3D printers to produce face shields. Hopefully these will be delivered soon.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fara and Sheila Yasamee</strong></h2> <p>Sheila Yasamee, 96, a former midwife and mother of five, has lived in a care home in Bexhill, East Sussex, since September.

This is spreading and [puts] her health and life in real danger \u2026 She may die there because of it.\u201d</p> <p>The local GP has stressed that Sheila needs 24-hour care and equipment which cannot be guaranteed beyond the care home, and the local social care officials insist the choice is Sheila\u2019s. Plus her family realise that they would have to go into isolation to look after her to avoid infecting her themselves \u2013 and that could go on for months.</p> <p>Sheila \u201cdoes not really understand the situation and can\u2019t make an informed decision about whether to stay or not\u201d, Fara said. Her mother was \u201cgetting very low and depressed being in isolation and not seeing family \u2026 She keeps asking, how much longer is this going on?\u201d</p> <p>Since visits were stopped, Fara has spoken to Sheila regularly by phone but it is becoming frustrating not knowing what care is being delivered, what personal protective equipment staff are using, whether workers are sick or how many people are looking after her mother.</p> <p>\u201cI get the feeling that the care home is not being that transparent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation. It feels like whatever decision we take is not going to be right.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Katrina and Pat Wheeler</strong></h2> <p>On 20 April, Katrina Wheeler heard that coronavirus had entered the care home where her 81-year-old mother, Pat, lives 300 miles away. It meant Pat and the other residents would be confined to their rooms indefinitely.</p> <p>\u201cShe feels that she is imprisoned,\u201d said Katrina. \u201cShe knows why, but she can\u2019t make the connection with her being on her own.\u201d Pat, who has mental health difficulties, is struggling without being able to see her closest friend in the home, with whom she used to share much of her time.</p> <p>\u201cI feel guilty that I can\u2019t take her away from the environment and make her safe,\u201d said Katrina. She also spoke of difficulty getting information about how the outbreak is being handled.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not being forthcoming,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are probably extremely busy and it\u2019s the last thing on their mind, but information is really important in terms of what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday this week they were told that Pat was being tested for Covid-19 after showing symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cShe might not test positive but she is going to be in isolation until at least the end of the year,\u201d said Katrina. \u201cHow is she going to be able to cope with that?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Cathy Gard</strong><strong>ner and Michael Gibson</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt was just awful, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Dr Cathy Gardner. A carer at her father\u2019s care home 150 miles away had called twice to say her 88-year-old father, Michael Gibson, was deteriorating with probable Covid-19 and she should come.</p> <p>After driving as fast as they could from Devon to the care home in Bicester, Gardner and her husband decided they could not go in and risk her mother catching the virus. So they looked at Michael, a former superintendent registrar of births, marriages and deaths, through the window instead.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you expect the situation to be at the end of someone\u2019s life and you can\u2019t be there and you can\u2019t hold his hand,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cHe looked peaceful, the staff were brilliant but not being with him was terrible.\u201d</p> <p>He was living at the home in Bicester because he had severe Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <p>He had a chest infection five weeks ago and the GP was worried it was coronavirus, but they did not travel to see him because of the lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cI felt guilty. I felt we should be doing the right thing and shouldn\u2019t make the journey. You don\u2019t want to break the rules. Then one of his carers phoned us to tell us to come. We waited a bit but then she phoned again and said she didn\u2019t think he would survive as she\u2019d seen this before. Her own father had died the week before in the room next to my dad.\u201d</p> <p>Gardner said four other residents had died at the home and the number might be higher. She felt her father\u2019s death could have been prevented and was critical of the lack of testing of staff and residents. \u201cIt should have been a matter of course for care homes.\u201d she said. \u201cThe most vulnerable sector of the population and you decide not to test. That\u2019s bordering on manslaughter, in my view.\u201d</p> <p>As for the urgent drive to Bicester, she said: \u201cI was glad I saw him, as he died the next evening.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Himani Weir and Octavia Jayasuriya</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himani Weir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Himani Weir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Himani Weir now wishes she had broken her mother out of the care home in south-east London where she died of a confirmed case Covid-19 on 16 April.

Then came the lockdown and her decline began.</p> <p>\u201cI felt immediately out of touch with my mother,\u201d Weir said. \u201cDuring the first week we were doing video calls and she was reassuring me that she was OK. But a week or so later I got very concerned when I saw her on a FaceTime video. She looked very unwell.\u201d</p> <p>The care home was not allowing visitors but she went with her daughters and saw her though the window.</p> <p>\u201cShe was looking terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cHer eyes were closed and none of the staff who were going in and out were in PPE. I raised my concern about that with the manager and she said that they were not wearing PPE until they saw symptoms with the residents.\u201d</p> <p>A resident had died of confirmed coronavirus in hospital and Weir was increasingly worried.

Such a finding would turn the international disaster into something akin to biological warfare, or a lab accident of catastrophic proportions.</p> <p>More than 1 million people have been infected and more than 60,000 have died in the US from the virus, adding political urgency to Trump\u2019s desire to shift blame for the crisis on to China. </p> <p>China has been resisting an international inquiry into the origins of the outbreak in Wuhan and, under pressure, says it is a matter for the WHO to investigate. The proposal is unlikely to mollify Trump, who has condemned the WHO as Chinese-centric and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\">suspended US funding</a> from the UN agency pending a review.</p> <p>Chris Patten, the former governor general of Hong Kong and a long-term critic of Chinese efforts to control democracy in the former colony, has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/chris-patten-urges-uk-investigate-coronavirus-origins-china\"> joined the calls</a> for an international inquiry, accusing China of initially covering up the outbreak.</p> <p>The calls for an inquiry have been strongest in Australia, leading to a diplomatic confrontation between the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye. The calls have also been supported by Winston Peters, New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister.</p> <p>Peters said: \u201cIt is very hard to conceive, no matter what country it is, of there not being a desire from every country around the world \u2013 including the country of origin \u2013 for an investigation to find out how this happened.\u201d</p> <p>Cheng has warned of a Chinese boycott of Australian goods and services.</p> <p>Beijing has been caught in a bind, with its diplomats sometimes saying it is not even clear whether the virus originated in China, contending that it is a legitimate matter for inquiry by scientists, but then rejecting an international inquiry into the source of the outbreak. Chinese diplomats distinguish between an international inquiry, which they say is likely to be a political blame game, and a dispassionate examination by WHO scientists.</p> <p>Critics of China counter that the WHO\u2019s record shows it has neither the will nor the investigative powers required to look deep into the entrails of the Chinese Communist party and expose any cover-up. The WHO is dependent on the cooperation of its member states for access and has no mechanism to punish countries that keep its officials in the dark.</p> <p>Proposals have been floated for the WHO to be given the power to impose sanctions on countries that are not transparent with it, but this proposal would need to pass the WHO\u2019s general assembly, and would require nation states handing over a degree of sovereignty to a multilateral body.</p> <p>The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, delivered a lengthy rebuttal to the prospect of an international inquiry last week. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about independent investigation. It\u2019s up to the WHO. We support the WHO. We believe we should play by international norms and international rules, not by some other countries\u2019 rules. Some other country even sues China at its local court. It\u2019s absurd,\u201dhe said in remarks to the Asia Society in London.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the first time that some politicians want to play world police. This is not the era of \u2018gunboat diplomacy\u2019. This is not the era when China was still in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. This is the third decade of the 21st century. Those people cannot understand it. They think they still live in the old days when they can bully China and the world. If the WHO does not act their way, they stop their support and criticise the WHO to be \u2018China-centric\u2019. That\u2019s simply not right.</p> <p>\u201cSo we are calling for international cooperation. That\u2019s the only weapon and only way out to win this battle against the virus. Not by scapegoating, not by playing games, not by politicising the virus, not by spreading a political virus.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: \u201cCoronavirus is a global challenge and it\u2019s vital that countries come together to tackle this shared threat. The Foreign Secretary has been clear that, in time, we will need to learn lessons and ask rigorous questions about why this outbreak happened, why it couldn\u2019t be stopped earlier and what can be done to prevent another outbreak in future. This is something that we will look at with all of our international partners.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In March 2013, Carole Delporte, a 37 year-old French translator, flew to Milan on a job for which she had been carefully screened, and finally selected. Only her husband and two young daughters back home in Paris were allowed to know where she had gone.</p> <p>After checking into her hotel, Delporte made her way to an imposing modernist building in an industrial sprawl on the outskirts of the city. When she arrived, she was led to the basement, where two security guards put her phone and handbag in a locker. She then entered a large room where a team of 10 people from six different countries were typing away. For the next two months, Delporte would work here in total secrecy to translate Inferno, the then-unpublished fourth Robert Langdon novel by bestselling US author Dan Brown.</p> <p>Coming out 10 years after Brown\u2019s The Da Vinci Code became one of the bestselling books of all time, Inferno followed Langdon, the Harvard professor of \u201csymbology\u201d who decodes intricate religious mysteries to stop catastrophic events \u2013 in this case a lethal pandemic.</p> <p>But it is the extraordinary experience of Brown\u2019s translators that has now inspired a film: Les Traducteurs, by French director R\u00e9gis Roinsard. In Roinsard\u2019s film, 10 pages of the novel (retitled Dedalus) are leaked and the translators are put up against the clock to find the source. In reality, the 11 translators in the Milanese bunker had just one job: translate Inferno, and guarantee the simultaneous publication of the novel worldwide.</p> <p>The secretive location that Delporte found herself in was the headquarters of Gruppo Mondadori, Italy\u2019s largest publishing house. Since 1975, the company has been housed in an iconic building designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer: a concrete structure made up of a series of sculptural arches and black tinted windows that emerges from a 20,000-sq-metre lake. \u201cIt was a bit like working in a crisis unit,\u201d says Delporte. \u201cWe were under time pressure, and we had to do a top-class job. You mustn\u2019t forget that it will be read by millions of people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a63e28f2e13f87d610030e1d2f752b3f19da935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a63e28f2e13f87d610030e1d2f752b3f19da935/0_138_1701_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We were under time pressure, and we had to do a top class job\u2019 \u2026 Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s Mondadori building in Segrate, outside Milan, where Origin was translated.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We were under time pressure, and we had to do a top class job\u2019 \u2026 Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s Mondadori building in Segrate, outside Milan, where Inferno was translated.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike in Roinsard\u2019s film, the \u201cbunker\u201d was not a luxurious doomsday shelter. Instead, it was a large conference room, equipped with a coffee machine, fridge, microwave and a printer. Despite being a basement, Delporte remembers it as comfortable, with two big windows providing some natural light and, in an Olympic Games-like gesture (that <em>does </em>feature in Roinsard\u2019s film), a little flag on each desk indicating the various languages involved: Spanish, Italian, French, German, Portuguese and Catalan.</p> <p>While some agile translators worked individually, most tackled the 3,000 manuscript pages in pairs. Delporte, who had been hired by the French publishing house JC Latt\u00e8s, worked with Dominique Defert, with whom she had already translated other bestsellers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/25/steve-jobs-biography-walter-isaacson-review\">Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of Steve Jobs</a>. \u201cYou need people who are psychologically strong,\u201d says Delporte. \u201cWorking in a bunker for a month and a half is a very unusual experience.\u201d</p> <p>The aim was to avoid a catastrophic leak. Five years before, Twilight author<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/31/leaked.book\"> Steph</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/31/leaked.book\">enie Meyer scrapped the fifth book in her</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/31/leaked.book\">bestselling vampire</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/aug/31/internetleakkillsseriesof\"> series, Midnight Sun, after an unfinished draft </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/aug/31/internetleakkillsseriesof\">found its way online</a>. Armed security personnel guarded the bunker entrance around the clock. Internet access was cut off. The translators\u2019 laptops could never leave the room. To research online (essential with Brown\u2019s books), the translators had to share four other computers that were connected to the internet and make their notes by hand<strong>.</strong> Their hard copies of the English manuscript were locked in a safe at night. Trips to the bathroom were logged by the security guards.</p> <p>The translators were under strict orders not to speak to anyone in the office canteen about their work, especially not the Mondadori employees, some of whom were journalists. \u201cWe had to guarantee that the contents of the book would not be at the disposal of anybody outside that room,\u201d says Francesco Anzelmo, Mondadori\u2019s editorial director.</p> <p>In a corner of the room was a whiteboard where they could write down questions that would be passed on to Brown. \u201cWe all asked ourselves the same questions, so it was good because we could discuss them together,\u201d says Delporte.<strong> </strong> Did a market\u2019s opening hours correspond with the time of day the action takes place? Was it possible to shoot at someone from that angle on the stairway? \u201cHe must have thought: \u2018These translators are crazy!\u201d says Delporte. \u201cBut in a way we were his first readers.\u201d</p> <p>This type of literary lockdown was not only taking place in Italy. In London, the Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Turkish translators underwent a similar experience in the basement of Transworld Publishers, a division of Penguin Random House. \u201cWe had everything we needed. The only thing we didn\u2019t have was internet,\u201d says Turkish translator Petek Demir \u0130ncek. \u201cWe had to sign an agreement saying that we would pay a big penalty fee if we told anyone what we were doing.\u201d The reason for splitting the translators into two groups provided another layer of security, says Anzelmo: \u201cThe fewer people in the same room, the fewer possibilities of anything getting out.\u201d</p> <p>International settings made Brown\u2019s novels particularly suited to the new strategy. Inferno sees Langdon travel from Florence to Venice to Istanbul, while Origin mostly takes place in Spain. \u201cInferno was particularly important for us because it was set in Italy,\u201d says Anzelmo. \u201cWe felt more involved in the book for national and cultural reasons.\u201d</p> <p>The operation conceived for Inferno was the first of its kind. Usually the translation of Brown\u2019s novels started after the English edition was already on the bestseller list, leaving European publishers to scramble to get their versions into shops. That had been the case with The Lost Symbol, the hotly anticipated sequel to The Da Vinci Code, which came out after two blockbusters starring Tom Hanks had already attracted huge global audiences. While The Lost Symbol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/17/dan-brown-lost-symbol-sets-sales-record\">broke first day sales records</a> in the US, UK and Canada, the first translations \u2013 Italian, Spanish and French \u2013 didn\u2019t arrive until a month later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ede6b13d0a97f593e5ba9ea0bf3e3f9c0c4a8a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ede6b13d0a97f593e5ba9ea0bf3e3f9c0c4a8a6e/714_71_1829_2287/800.jpg\" alt=\"Highly symbological \u2026Dan Brown at the Berlin premiere of the film version of Inferno in Berlin.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Highly symbological \u2026Dan Brown at the Berlin premiere of the film version of Inferno in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Annamaria Raffo, one of the three Italian translators in the bunker, has translated authors such as Ken Follett and Robert Harris during her more than 30-year career. Before translating Inferno, she had worked in a five-strong team to get the Italian version of The Lost Symbol finished in under two weeks. \u201cDespite working very quickly, we lost those 15 days,\u201d says Raffo. \u201cIn the meantime, some readers bought the book in English because they couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Inferno was announced<em>, </em>it was obvious European editions had to launch at the same time as the English version, especially at a time when buying the book in English had never been easier. \u201cNowadays, from the moment it\u2019s out in the US or the UK, you can order it on Amazon and have it in a couple of days. That wasn\u2019t the case 20 years ago,\u201d says Anzelmo. This is even truer in countries such as Holland, where a widespread knowledge of English poses a real challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s much more important now to publish the translation simultaneously.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, publishers decided to do it again for Origin, Brown\u2019s fifth novel in the Langdon series. This time, 26 translators gathered in Barcelona, where part of the novel is set. The event was organised by Grupo Planeta, the leading publishing group in Spain and Latin America. \u201cWith Origin, the operation was further perfected,\u201d says Raffo. This time, translators who had been in Milan and London were in the same room. Security was reinforced and no one was allowed to bring their own laptops. Instead of a basement, they were now in a windowless room on the fifth floor of Planeta\u2019s offices, and totally isolated. Raffo remembers the air conditioning constantly being on full blast. \u201cIn Milan it was called the bunker and in Barcelona we called it the igloo,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a culture shock,\u201d says Delporte, in terms of agreeing working hours. The Nordics wanted to start at 8am, while the Mediterraneans preferred waking up late and working into the evening. As a group of freelancers used to the comfort of their homes, they had to adapt to new conditions. \u201cIt brought together a bunch of hermits, each with our own habits,\u201d says Claudia Conde, one of the Spanish translators. \u201cSo working together was quite strange. It was an extraordinary situation.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, the team effort paid off. When<em> </em>Inferno was published in May 2013, it <a href=\"https://www.key4biz.it/Players-Vincitori-2013-05-eBook-Dan-Brown-Inferno-Record-Vendite-Libri-Mondadori-Amazon-Kindle/18168/\">sold </a><a href=\"https://www.key4biz.it/Players-Vincitori-2013-05-eBook-Dan-Brown-Inferno-Record-Vendite-Libri-Mondadori-Amazon-Kindle/18168/\">more than 50,000 copies in Italy</a> in its first 24 hours. In Spain, Origin <a href=\"http://www.franquicias.libreriasnobel.es/blog/origen-sigue-arrasando-en-espana-y-confirma-el-estatus-de-autor-super-ventas-de-dan-brown/\">quickly sold out</a> and, after an initial print run of 600,000 copies, both Mondadori and Planeta announced an additional 100,000 to meet demand among Italian and Spanish readers.</p> <p>In Les Traducteurs, the translators are transformed into figures akin to secret agents as they hunt for the source of the leak. The skills of Delporte and her peers have never seemed so glamorous.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to have made a film about our profession,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s good because it sparks a discussion about our job.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, it is the opposite of what the translators signed up for when they chose their solitary, behind-the-scenes line of work. A Greek translator in Roinsard\u2019s film declares: \u201cIf I had wanted to work in an open-plan office, I wouldn\u2019t have chosen this profession.\u201d </p> <p>But in reality, a certain esprit de corps grew from the experience. \u201cFew translators can claim to have all worked together on the same text,\u201d reflects Raffo. \u201cIt was nice to be able to exchange ideas,\u201d says Demir \u0130ncek. \u201cIt\u2019s usually a lonely job.\u201d Being able to solve problems together and explain the novel\u2019s many historic and cultural references to each other was an experience that many found liberating, despite being confined. \u201cThey were two months of suffering,\u201d sighs Raffo. \u201cBut I would do it again tomorrow.\u201d</p>",

The season must be completed and resolve has endured, that sense of bloody-mindedness, certainly from executives at the top of the Premier League.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/premier-leagues-project-restart-what-is-it-and-is-it-feasible\">Premier League's Project Restart: what is it and is it feasible?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was and remains a good deal of reference to the integrity of the competition, a buzz phrase that shudders at the thought of an unfinished season and its repercussions, bringing to mind a fairness and purity around the topics of relegation and promotion.</p> <p>But bubbling close to the surface has been a fear that failure to play on will lead to huge financial losses and characters who are accustomed to getting their way seeking recourse via the courts. It is easy to make out the principal drivers and they do not sit comfortably alongside each other. In one corner is medicine; in the other, money.</p> <p>\u201cThis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/premier-league-clubs-fear-becoming-scapegoats-if-game-returns-too-soon\">a very dangerous situation,\u201d Dr Michel D\u2019Hooghe</a>, the chair of Fifa\u2019s medical committee, said on Wednesday. \u201cIt is a fight between health and economic values.\u201d D\u2019Hooghe has worked as president of the Belgian Football Federation and Club Brugge. He knows both sides. Right now he is backing medicine and he says the season ought to end.</p> <p>The greatest worry for Premier League clubs is that, if it does, broadcasters whose riches drive the whole shooting match will demand refunds. The clubs are not as concerned about Sky and BT, having enjoyed a hugely fruitful partnership with the former in particular. It is the international companies that fund the overseas rights who may be more uncompromising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc1c8cd9d17e3414f03c5525c811ea744b1bd70d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc1c8cd9d17e3414f03c5525c811ea744b1bd70d/0_305_4905_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grounds such as Bournemouth\u2019s are being used to stockpile supplies for food banks while football waits to resume.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grounds such as Bournemouth\u2019s are being used to stockpile supplies for food banks while football waits to resume.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bournemouth/via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst-case scenario would be any broadcasters seeking to recoup the full value of their contracts for the season rather than a pro-rata refund based on matches unplayed. This would be based on the argument that an incomplete competition would be wholly devalued \u2013 a little like Wimbledon being halted in the quarter-finals. At the very least, there is a well understood theory in the broadcast industry that games have different values, with those at the end of a season often more significant and valuable than some at the start.</p> <p>It has been estimated clubs stand to lose around \u00a350m each, the lion\u2019s share from lost broadcast revenues, if the season is not completed. The breakdowns are different in the Football League, where gate money makes up a much greater percentage of turnover. Resuming behind closed doors would be economically crippling for each one, from the Championship leaders, Leeds, down.</p> <p>At the top end the money is the TV, which is why there is a desire to screen as many of the remaining 92 matches as possible, even behind closed doors, which would damage the spectacle for the viewer. The host stadiums that are selected \u2013 expected to be neutral ones \u2013 would have to be broadcast compliant and not only because the cameras at such grounds also support VAR. St George\u2019s Park, the national training centre, has been mentioned as a possible venue and the pitches there could be fitted with the requisite cameras, although this would be more challenging.</p> <p>The conference call will discuss Project Restart, with the use of neutral stadiums set to cause conflict. Some clubs will be unhappy at the loss of home advantage. The national lead for football policing, Mark Roberts, said on Wednesday there could be \u201cbenefits of playing at a neutral, controlled venue both from health aspects but also minimising any disruption to the police, ambulance service and other functions\u201d.</p> <p>Consensus is difficult to gauge but it appears most would prefer closed doors to no action at all. Clearly, football without fans is rubbish but imperfect or least-bad solutions are demanded.</p> <p>Hoped-for timeframes will be put forward, with clubs planning for a return to training on 11 May or 18 May before a possible restart on the weekend of 13-14 June with the domestic season to finish at the end of July \u2013 but, as with everything, this opens up other problems. What will group training look like? Moreover, how to accommodate players who are out of contract after 30 June? Could contracts be extended on a short-term basis? Would players want that, knowing how an injury could jeopardise a planned move?</p> <p>With money central to so much there have been accusations of clubs being guided by selfish agendas \u2013 for example, those above the relegation zone wanting the season to be annulled. But if it is all about the broadcast cash, surely there are solutions. Perhaps clubs could arrange loans from the TV companies secured against the solidity of future broadcast revenues. Maybe the broadcasters could be promised extra games next season.</p> <p>It would be interesting to see how many clubs would remain committed to finishing the season under difficult circumstances if a way could be found to advance the money they might lose. Nobody wants to play without crowds. Nobody wants to risk spreading the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/footballs-biggest-matches-should-be-played-at-neutral-grounds-police-say\">Football's biggest matches should be played at neutral grounds, police say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The risks and the what-ifs will frame Friday\u2019s talks, with a big one being the nightmare of a player or member of staff testing positive after the restart. This could mean quarantine for a club or clubs and the end of the competition.</p> <p>At the heart of everything is testing. Players would have to be tested regularly, as would the few hundred others who attend the sealed-off matches, but how would that be delivered and how could a sterile environment be maintained? Nobody in the game wants to be seen to be taking away tests from frontline workers and there will be those who consider it crass that football intends to return while there are so many problems regarding testing in the UK.</p> <p>In the end there is the knowledge that whatever happens on Friday, whatever common ground is found, it may count for nothing. What the government does next Thursday in terms of easing the lockdown or otherwise will shape the fate of the season. A prerequisite will surely be the relaxing of physical distancing because how could players challenge each other if the rest of the population had to remain two metres apart?</p> <p>Football is doing all it can to prepare for what would be the most sentimental of reunions. The obstacles remain oppressive.</p>",
  "<p>Tom Moore entered the world on 30 April 1920 as Britain was emerging from the worst pandemic since mortality records began: the influenza of 1918-19. Total mortality in the UK rose by 24% in a year in 1918. Tom was just nine years old when the bitterly cold winter of 1929 increased mortality by 15%, and a newly married husband aged 48 when the influenza pandemic of 1968 led to a mortality increase of 6%.</p> \n<p>We do not yet know how Covid-19, the pandemic that inspired Captain Tom to begin his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/16/capt-tom-moore-99-completes-garden-walk-nhs-fundraiser-with-guard-of-honour-video\">record-breaking walk at the age of 99</a>, will rank in this deadly league table; yet it will almost certainly be less deadly than the events of 1918, 1929 or 1968.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"340fd79b-ef79-43fa-a2ca-857f59c701fc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tm7QiCOvz3o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1937, when Tom was 17 years old, there was no National Health Service. It was a time of mass unemployment and mass poverty. One shilling in every six earned in Britain went to the best-off 1% of the population. The vast majority of Britons were poor. If they fell ill, they had to pay to see a doctor, or hope for charity.</p> \n<p>When 20-year-old Tom was conscripted to the war effort in 1940, Britain began to change faster than it ever had before; the next 17 years would be some of the most remarkable in UK history. In 1957, when Tom was 37, the best-off 1% in the UK took only 9% of all national income. A great transformation had taken place and people were told they had never had it so good. But it would get better.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Though Boris Johnson likes to talk of 'levelling up', the coronavirus pandemic has instead resulted in a levelling down</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The influenza of 1968 returned in 1970 and again in 1972. One million people died worldwide. Yet it was a time when the global population was younger because of lower life expectancy than today; and it was a time of growing optimism and equality. By the time Tom was 57 years old in 1977, the best-off took less than 6% of all income in Britain; three times less than when he was aged 12. It was the smallest share they have ever taken; housing was affordable and there was full employment.</p> \n<p>Tom could have expected the situation to get better still. But a very different UK emerged instead. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election in 1979 heralded 18 years of radical Conservative economic policy. In 1997, when he was 77, the take of Britain\u2019s 1% had doubled to 12% of all national income. When Tom turned 87, after a decade of \u201cNew\u201d Labour, the share of the best-off 1% had risen to over 15%, which meant that inequality had returned to the levels they were when Tom was a very young man. Today the very best-off 1% in Britain receive around 14%, or a seventh of all income<em>.</em></p> \n<p>At the start of this century our leading politicians believed that the rich should be rewarded and the poor should be bullied. Though not very long from now, we may look back and see that it took the Covid-19 pandemic to bring to a halt the rise in economic inequality. </p> \n<p>Though prime minister Boris Johnson likes to talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d, the coronavirus pandemic has instead resulted in a levelling down. Many Britons with no wealth will fall <a href=\"https://www.standardlifefoundation.org.uk/news/latest-news/articles/financial-impact-tracker-april\">further into debt</a> this year. Yet it\u2019s estimated that a third of FTSE-100 companies have <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/files/report_copy.pdf\">cut their chief executive\u2019s pay</a> as a result of the economic shutdown; anyone whose wealth is held in stocks and shares has seen it collapse in recent months; and house prices are falling, and are likely to fall the most where they were highest. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/captain-tom-promoted-to-colonel-on-100th-birthday-in-flood-of-cards\">Captain Tom promoted to colonel on 100th birthday in flood of cards</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Captain Tom\u2019s fundraising achievement, for which he has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/captain-tom-promoted-to-colonel-on-100th-birthday-in-flood-of-cards\">promoted to colonel</a>, is a tribute to Britain\u2019s belief that our NHS is worth preserving. But charity efforts even of this magnitude can raise only a tiny fraction of the billion a week needed if the UK it is to fund its health services to the levels of Germany. Of all large European countries, it is Germany that has dealt with the pandemic the best.</p> \n<p>At first, the economic impact of Covid-19 looks devastating. But think back to the first half-century of Tom\u2019s life. Think of how his situation changed from one in which living in poverty was very likely, through to a time when his children could expect to have well-paid jobs, enjoy full employment and start a family in their 20s if they wished.</p> \n<p>The last time economic inequality began to fall in the UK was around the time Tom was born, at some point between 1913 and just after the end of the first world war. The war debts could only be repaid by taxing the rich; no one else had enough money. The same is likely to happen again today, with the debts of lockdown and global recession.</p> \n<p>Coincidentally, a century after Captain Tom was born, the prime minister announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy\">birth of his own son</a>.

Any update on the government\u2019s social distancing measures is not expected before 7 May.</p> <p>On Wednesday league officials briefed the EFL board over a number of possible scenarios on how the season could be salvaged and all required huge numbers of tests, possibly into the hundreds of thousands. Another meeting between Football League clubs is understood to have featured interventions from a number of owners sceptical of playing on.</p> <p>The chairman of Stevenage, Phil Wallace, articulated concerns that are understood to be shared by many lower league clubs.</p> <p>\u201cThe subject of testing at League One and League Two levels and the measures that would be necessary not to expose players and their families to the virus by putting 30-40 people together in a contact sport environment are hard to overcome whilst social isolation is in play,\u201d Wallace, whose club are bottom of League Two, said.</p> <p>\u201cEven if we managed to find ways, would all players accept the risk? And if one person caught it then does the whole league have to stop?

With as many as 800 Football League players due to be out of contract at the end of June, some clubs will be able to offer only the standard severance payment of a month\u2019s wages if matches are staged after that point. Some clubs have indicated that severance payments will be beyond them in all circumstances.

  "<p>If you want to see who influences the government, you can do worse than look at Whitehall\u2019s neighbours. In a grand Victorian building opposite the House of Commons in Parliament Square stands the headquarters of the <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/uk/\">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a>. With a history dating back to 1792, the RICS is an illustrious professional body, promoting the highest international standards in the valuation and development of land and property. But it has another side.<br><br>Its royal charter states that it exists to serve the public interest, yet most of its members\u2019 fees come from landowners and developers, not the public sector. Through its <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/valuation/red-book/\">Red Book</a>, the RICS sets the standards by which land and property are valued, but it is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the development industry, representing the interests of landowners and developers at the highest levels of government. It directly advised on the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, which led to 1,300 pages of policy being reduced to 65 in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\">triumphant bonfire of red tape</a>, and it has numerous committees influencing policy on all aspects of land planning and valuation. It describes part of its mission as \u201cunlocking the inherent value held within the world\u2019s physical assets\u201d, but the question is, for whom is the value being unlocked? And who, consequently, is missing out?<br><br>In the eyes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/06/housing-trickle-strategic-choice\">Bob Colenutt</a>, the answer is clear. In his urgent new book, <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/the-property-lobby\">The Property Lobby</a>, he identifies the RICS as one of numerous actors in a complex network of landowners, housebuilders, financial backers, professional bodies and politicians who are engaged in propping up the status quo to ensure that their interests prosper \u2013 at the expense of everyone else. The housing crisis is no accident, he argues, but the calculated product of an elite group who have no reason to fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f/0_0_6924_4537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taking action ...

His career in community planning and local government regeneration has taken him from campaigning in Southwark, south London (helping to lay the foundations for the community-led <a href=\"https://coinstreet.org/\">Coin Street housing project</a> on the South Bank) to battling the development of Docklands and working for various London councils, before moving into academia. In 1975, he co-authored <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Property-Machine-Penguin-special/dp/0140523030\">The Property Machine</a>, a book whose message was nicely summed up by its cover illustration of a fat-cat developer gobbling up people\u2019s homes. Then, the big developers were office builders, backed by insurance companies and pension funds. Now, they are housebuilders, armed with an unimaginable arsenal of global capital. Many of the themes remain the same, but, in the intervening years, through successive takeovers, intensive political lobbying and close integration with the finance sector, the leading developers have swollen into an unstoppable force.<br><br>Combining the methodical precision of an academic with the persuasive passion of a radical campaigner, Colenutt identifies how we got into this situation, and provides several suggestions for a possible way out. In succinct chapters, he lays out the structure of what he calls the \u201cfinance-housebuilding complex\u201d, explaining how the housebuilding business works, how housing finance underpins the entire UK economy, how the powerful network of lobbying groups operates, how it has shaped planning policy, and how the grim cycle of low supply, high prices and poor quality homes is relentlessly perpetuated by vested interests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29/0_0_1500_2368/633.jpg\" alt=\"The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt.\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the decades, governments of all colours have announced bold new methods to solve the housing crisis, but little has changed. Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/09/more-than-1m-families-waiting-for-social-housing-in-england\">council house waiting lists</a> and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty \u2013 not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">delivered through \u201cplanning gain\u201d</a>. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the \u201cregeneration\u201d of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/14/winners-and-losers-london-social-housing-divide-barnet-camden\">break-up of communities</a>. It\u2019s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to \u201cthe ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.\u201d<br><br>Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/berkeleygroupholdings\">Berkeley Group</a>, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes \u2013 proudly described as \u201cpopular with overseas investors\u201d \u2013 was \u00a3715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company\u2019s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of \u00a348m in 2018, after a previous payout of \u00a323m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/03/berkeley-calls-affordable-housing-targets-unviable-as-chairman-earns-174m\">local authority targets were \u201cunviable\u201d</a>. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than <a href=\"https://www.building.co.uk/news/berkeley-profit-hit/5100149.article\">\u00a33bn</a>.<br><br>As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/heseltine-launches-panel-of-experts-to-kick-start-estates-regeneration\">Michael Heseltine\u2019s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel</a> in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the <a href=\"https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/news-and-insights/news/2014/berkeley-wins-queens-award-for-sustainable-development\">Queen\u2019s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014</a>. The next year, Pidgley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/apr/01/tory-100-industry-captains-party-donors-tax-avoiders\">gave a donation to the Conservative party</a> and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d/0_107_4292_2574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steering profits ...

Tony Pidgley, chairman of Berkeley Group.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good business deserves handsome rewards, the housebuilders retort. But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/01/help-to-buy-pushes-uk-housebuilder-dividends-to-23bn\">government subsidy through Help to Buy</a>, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">dodge their affordable housing obligations</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\">Chartered Institute for Housing</a> estimated that of the total \u00a353bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/07/persimmon-boss-asked-to-leave-amid-ongoing-outrage-over-bonus\">CEO Jeff Fairburn a \u00a375m bonus</a>, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process.<br><br>All of this is great news for the <a href=\"https://www.hbf.co.uk/\">Home Builders Federation</a>, the powerful volume housebuilders\u2019 lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">viability assessment</a>\u201d of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/31/britain-land-housing-crisis-developers-not-building-land-banking\">land-banking</a> and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits.<br><br>The list of powerful interests goes on. There is <a href=\"https://www.cla.org.uk/\">the CLA</a> (formerly the Country Landowners\u2019 Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that <a href=\"https://www.progressive-policy.net/press-releases/press-release-landowners-make-13bn-profit-in-one-year-as-high-land-prices-stifle-affordable-housing\">landowners in England made a \u00a313bn profit from land sales in 2016-17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/net-income\">far more than Amazon\u2019s net annual global profit in the same period, or since</a>. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop. The result is endless inflation in land values, which in turn reduces the amount of affordable housing that will ever be delivered. Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a \u201cStalinist land grab\u201d or a \u201cgarden tax\u201d.<br><br>Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/30/revolving-door-between-councils-and-lobbyists-raises-transparency-issues\">revolving doors between councils and developers</a>, to the culture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/10/tory-westminster-councillor-resigns-after-hospitality-inquiry\">hospitality and political donations</a>, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\">riddle the planning system</a> \u2013 which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers\u2019 profits.<br><br>There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas. First, he calls for a national housing drive, \u201cpart of a newly reinvigorated welfare state, where housing, like health, is available to those in need as a human right\u201d. It would be just as repugnant to the property lobby as the idea of a UK-style NHS is to the US health insurance industry \u2013 a comparison that vividly illustrates how much it is needed.<br><br>Second, there must be fundamental land reform to bring development land forward for housing at sensible prices so that new housing can be truly affordable and existing prices can stabilise. Colenutt points to the <a href=\"https://righttobuildtoolkit.org.uk/briefing-notes/different-ways-to-bring-forward-land/\">examples of Germany and the Netherlands</a>, where local authorities buy up development land at its existing use value, draw up real masterplans, then offer sites to housebuilders, who build to the plans of the local authority. In this way, housebuilders are simply builders of houses, not land speculators.<br><br>He says it is finally time to tax developers\u2019 land banks and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25396103\">implement \u201cuse or lose it\u201d measures</a>, to discourage housebuilders from hoarding plots with planning permission. And, most importantly, the Treasury and the Bank of England must be weaned off their dependence on land and house prices, and rebalance the economy away from property. All of this is eminently possible, if the powerful property lobby can be resisted, and some local authorities are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/28/meet-the-councils-quietly-building-a-housing-revolution\">beginning to take the lead</a>, in spite of central government policy.

  "<p>If the affliction of coronavirus has shamed us into anything, it is a vivid appreciation of just how cruelly topsy-turvy our world is. Low-paid healthcare workers, bin collectors, bus drivers and supermarket shelf stackers, not hedge fund managers or venture capitalists, have kept us from falling apart. It has taken actual disaster to expose the deep-seated social injustices and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/sep/09/inequality-is-it-rising-and-can-we-reverse-it\"> inequalities</a> that we knew, but seemed to have forgotten, are hardwired into our economy. So could the global convulsion caused by the pandemic put us on the path to greater equality?</p> <p>The Austrian economic historian Walter Scheidel argues that throughout history, from the stone age onwards, pandemic is one of the only four events capable of bringing about greater equality. War, state collapse and revolution are the other three.</p> <p>In his book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183251/the-great-leveler\">The Great Level</a><a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183251/the-great-leveler\">er</a> he showed how the Black Death in the 1300s led to the wipeout of a third of Europe\u2019s population and massively reduced inequality by raising the price of labour. More recently, in the 20th century, two catastrophic world wars and the Communist revolution led to a long era of reduced inequality lasting until the early 1980s and giving rise to the modern welfare state, labour unions and progressive taxation.</p> <p>So could the pandemic of our era, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060702\">already considered</a> the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/coronavirus-biggest-global-threat-since-wwii-un-chief-2020-4\">greatest global crisis</a> since the second world war, turn out to be a great societal leveller?</p> <p>Scheidel\u2019s short answer is that the longer the pandemic wreaks havoc on the global economy, the greater the potential for radical equalising change. \u201cIt depends on how severe the crisis is going to be, how long it\u2019s going to last and how much it\u2019s ultimately going to interrupt supply chains.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has already exposed the limits of the market and highlighted the importance of effective state intervention and strong public healthcare provision. In the future this may well create a tolerance for higher and more progressive taxation. Governments have had to intervene to prop up businesses and jobs in ways that only months ago would have seemed unimaginable.

In other words, it may take a disaster to usher in more equality, but not every disaster does.</p> <p>\u201cWe had very special circumstances for a generation after the second world war, when all the factors were present in the right way \u2014 strong growth, low inequality, a strong middle class, expansion of the welfare state, all these things simultaneously. That may be very difficult to replicate,\u201d says Scheidel.</p> <p>Nobody would want mass death on the scale of the bubonic plague in the 14th century to be the instrument by which we achieve social change. And fortunately mortality rates from coronavirus will be nothing equivalent to those levels. \u201cEvery year, 60 million people die of natural causes worldwide. The death toll from corona is probably going to be less, even in the worst case scenario.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus\u2019s transformative potential, Scheidel explains, consists in adding a shock to an already powerful groundswell of anger.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m very sceptical about is the idea that ideology, or rhetoric, or just political agitation by itself can change things. What you need is essentially a combination of a certain kind of ideas being out there, and then a shock to the established order that allows those ideas to become mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown culture has divided the haves from the have nots in the most tangible ways: while middle- and upper-class urbanites could flee to holiday homes, the lowest paid have been confined to cramped flats or forced to run the gauntlet of public transport to get to their key worker jobs.</p> <p>And, while white-collar workers complain about the complications of remote working, for a sizeable chunk of the world\u2019s labour force self-isolation means <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/1650216/world\">going hungry</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, as Scheidel points out, the damage done by the closure of schools has been felt unevenly. \u201cWe have a billion children around the world who are not going to school \u2026 and some are able to be schooled online because the households have proper internet connections and others don\u2019t. That\u2019s a very fundamental inequality. There are a number of these inequalities that have always existed, but we\u2019re becoming very painfully aware of them.\u201d</p> <p>Will all this awareness spill over into demands for political transformation? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take all that much,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAll we really need is a certain increase in the percentage of people who support certain policies for those policies to become mainstream. There is now a greater potential for a sufficiently large number of people to say, \u2018maybe we should be doing something about this\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s an important caveat; much of the coronavirus\u2019s levelling potential will depend on our willingness to suffer significant economic losses in the short and medium term.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the \u201cend of history\u201d in the 1980s ushered in 40 years of neoliberal deregulation, inequality has generally been seen as an acceptable or even necessary price to pay for prosperity. That changed after the 2008 financial crash ignited the Occupy movement, lifting the veil on the existence of the 1%. Suddenly, inequality went from being a subject studied by a handful of economists to one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\">defining issues</a> of the last decade.</p> <p>Still, the 2008 crash <a href=\"https://www.socialeurope.eu/eu-income-inequality-great-recession\">wasn\u2019t the leveller </a>many had hoped it would be. In fact, it <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-how-the-financial-crisis-drastically-increased-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s\">produced the largest spike in wealth inequality</a> in postwar history by devastating the one thing low-income people in most western economies depend on most for their wealth: home ownership.</p> <p>On the same day that coronavirus caused the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/27/stock-market-today-live.html\">worst point drop</a> in the history of the Dow Jones, the economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 optimistically <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brankomilan/status/1232850693926637570?lang=en\">tweeted</a>: \u201cMy friend @WalterScheidel must feel vindicated. Coronavirus has already shaved off about 1/2 a Gini point of US wealth inequality. And this seems to be only a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Milanovi\u0107 was referring to the Gini coefficient, a commonly used measure of inequality that measures income or wealth distribution among a population.</p> <p>Scheidel sees the newly collapsed assets of billionaires rebounding over the next few years as they did after the 2008 financial crash. \u201cIt took a few years, and then the top 1% were back to where they were before the financial crisis. That\u2019s likely to happen again with all the measures taken to shore up corporations and preserve the financial sector.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, mass unemployment and the loss of income or healthcare will hit the poor hardest, pushing many people into debt, further widening the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>But could the coronavirus crash do what the 2008 crash didn\u2019t? Not if there\u2019s a swift recovery but, says Scheidel: \u201cIf we\u2019re entering a more long-term depression as a result of Covid-19, I think all kinds of more radical policies will be on the table for the first time in a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>Much, he thinks, depends on the early discovery of a vaccine. \u201cThen you could say science will save the status quo, because it makes it possible for us to return to business as usual quite swiftly.</p> <p>But now assume that science fails to do that because the virus is more complicated and can\u2019t be fixed in the short term, then you\u2019ll have a more severe protracted crisis, with greater potential for transformative change.\u201d</p> <p>That may translate to stronger state intervention, better protections for workers in domestic industries, limits to outsourcing, higher taxation and more robust healthcare systems \u2014 if only because it will be impossible to justify the shortages of face masks and other essential equipment that have already cost countless lives.</p> <p>It will also be difficult to resist the temptation to go back to business as usual. \u201cThere will be a strong push to go back to growth to finance the huge deficits that governments have been racking up, so, if anything, growth will be more important than before,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAt the same time, if the effects of the pandemic polarise societies even more, there will also be stronger agitation for more progressive or distributive policies. It will be very difficult to reconcile those two motivations.\u201d</p> <p>The real clash of interests, he predicts, will be between those determined to go back to the status quo even at the price of making existing inequality worse and those who want a reset.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see enough engagement with the fact that this is going to be a real struggle between countervailing forces that push in different directions. The big question is which one will have the upper hand, in which place, and for how long.\u201d</p> <p>The most unequal democracies like the US and the UK, where inequality of income is estimated to be among the highest in Europe, could experience the biggest shifts. \u201cThe less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cSo, somewhat paradoxically, the potential for actual change is biggest in the less equal countries.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, \u201cIf you are in China, the shock will not lead to more equalising policies. It will lead to a tightening of control and more business as usual.\u201d</p> <p>Time will tell if Scheidel can feel the vindication of Milanovi\u0107\u2019s forecast. As the pandemic devastates the world economy, hitting the poor hardest of all, short-term solutions aimed at restoring \u201cnormality\u201d are likely to outweigh lofty visions for a more equal society.</p> <p>And if he is right that the recipe for equality is prolonged suffering, things may have to get a lot worse before they can get better.

  "<p>Coronaviruses have been causing problems for humanity for a long time. Several versions are known to trigger common colds and more recently two types have set off outbreaks of deadly illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).</p> \n<p>But their impact has been mild compared with the global havoc unleashed by the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/world/coronavirus-world-news-updates.html\">more than 100,000 lives.</a> And the disease continues to spread.</p> \n<p>That is an extraordinary achievement for a spiky ball of genetic material coated in fatty chemicals called lipids, and which measures 80 billionths of a metre in diameter. Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/when-will-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">Vaccines projects proliferate,</a> antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. </p> \n<p>The questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Where did it come from and how did it first infect humans?</h2> \n<p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market\">originated in bats,</a> which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats\u2019 immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/10/sars-virus-bats-china-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome\">a reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible</a> viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-statistics-what-can-we-trust-and-what-should-we-ignore\">Coronavirus statistics: what can we trust and what should we ignore?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThis virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,\u201d says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. \u201cAnd so if that wildlife animal has a virus it\u2019s picked up from a bat and we\u2019re interacting with it, there\u2019s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.\u201d</p> \n<p>As to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cd7885ddb57e8ad5a16fc8146db6dbb81b1c5ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd7885ddb57e8ad5a16fc8146db6dbb81b1c5ca/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health officials inspect bats to be confiscated in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak at a live animal market in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health officials inspect bats to be confiscated in the wake of a coronavirus outbreak at a live animal market in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>How does the virus spread and how does it affect people?</strong></h2> \n<p>Virus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors \u2013 known as Ace-2 receptors \u2013 on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) \u201cThis virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,\u201d says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p> \n<p>Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell\u2019s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads. Antibodies generated by the body\u2019s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.</p> \n<p>\u201cA Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus\u2019s success,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cMany people don\u2019t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.\u201d</p> \n<p>By contrast, Sars \u2013 which is also caused by a coronavirus \u2013 makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others \u2013 by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why does the virus sometimes cause death?</h2> \n<p>Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.</p> \n<p>Even worse, in some cases, a person\u2019s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/term/cytokine-storm/\">cytokine storm.</a> (In Greek, \u201ccyto\u201d means cell and \u201ckino\u201d means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.</p> \n<p>Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.</p> \n<h2><strong>Are we protected for life if we get infected?</strong></h2> \n<p>Doctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/heres-how-body-gains-immunity-coronavirus\">antibodies are made by the immune system</a>, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,\u201d says virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. \u201cAnd the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections \u2013 but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Instead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. \u201cThat is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cThat means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic \u2013 which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<p>The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. \u201cWe have got to consider this pandemic from the virus\u2019s position,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the end, it will be the development and roll-out of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.</p> \n<h2>When will we get a vaccine?</h2> \n<p>On 9 April, the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\">journal </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\">Nature</a></em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\"> reported that 78 vaccine projects</a> had been launched round the globe \u2013 with a further 37 in development.

However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.</p> \n<p>As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process \u2013 by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine\u2019s efficacy. \u201cThis approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,\u201d says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.</p> \n<p>Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: \u201cTheir health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.\u201d The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.</p> \n<p>But deliberately infecting people \u2013 in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial \u2013 is controversial. \u201cThis will have to be thought through very carefully,\u201d says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. \u201cYoung people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don\u2019t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2020.

  "<p>There were three great pandemics in the 20th century. The influenza pandemic of 1918 and the HIV pandemic during the 1980s and 1990s get the most attention. But the third, tuberculosis, was the deadliest by far and in many communities, it\u2019s not yet over.</p> <p>TB has much to teach us about the tools that can help to eradicate the current pandemic, and what happens when those tools aren\u2019t even tried. The disease killed more than <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-releases-strategic-plan-address-tuberculosis-research\">one billion people between 1800 and 2000</a>. Although it is caused by a bacterium rather than a virus, the disease shares some frightening similarities with this current coronavirus.</p> <p>The pathogen that causes TB is airborne, transmitted from person to person in households and social spaces. People with TB spread the bacteria to new individuals when they breathe. Only half of those with TB display symptoms, allowing the deadly disease to spread undetected. And like today, the most vulnerable people are hit the hardest \u2014 older people, those with underlying conditions and people living in poverty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-in-africa-what-happens-next\">Coronavirus in Africa: what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A century ago, TB was a terrifying reality for people all over the world. One in every nine deaths in the United States in 1906 was caused by tuberculosis (adjusted to our current population levels, this would be the equivalent of 540,000 Americans dying of TB every year). The disease killed as many people as cancer and diabetes, causing profound damage to economic and social life.</p> <p>Yet by the 1970s, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm\">rates of tuberculosis</a> had dropped markedly in the US and other wealthy countries. How was this achieved? With the help of diagnostic treatments, the US pursued a successful strategy called \u201csearch, treat and prevent\u201d. The key innovation wasn\u2019t drugs (although antibiotics helped eradicate the disease, the first antibiotic treatment for TB was demonstrated in the 1940s, by which time <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/HistoricalStatisticsoftheUnitedStates1789-1945.pdf\">cases of the disease</a> had already fallen to around a fifth of 1906 levels). What made a huge difference was a community-based approach where people joined together to stop the spread of disease.</p> <p>The first step was freeing the sick of social and financial burdens. This allowed them to come forward for testing, care and support, without having to keep working and spreading the disease in the process. To this day, some of the only free health services available to everyone in the US are those relating to tuberculosis.</p> <p>Health authorities in the US went door to door searching for those who were sick and tracing people they had contacted. They treated sick people with food, medicine and shelter, and offered preventative therapies to stop others from becoming sick. Free TB care was only made possible through stable financing and community support, and cooperation between governments, employers, unions, faith groups and communities. Government financing and a community-based strategy were the key advances that made it possible to eradicate TB.</p> <p>But in many poor countries struggling with the pernicious legacy of colonialism, concerns about the cost of treatment trumped overwhelming scientific evidence. Instead of identifying and treating cases of TB across the population, these countries treated only the sickest and most infectious people. Focusing on the most extreme cases made sense, but it did little to stop the spread of the disease among asymptomatic carriers. In poorer countries, the results have been devastating: TB is the biggest infectious killer of adults globally, and continues to kill <a href=\"https://www.who.int/tb/global-report-2019\">on average 4,000 people every day</a>, mostly outside wealthy countries.</p> <p>These different approaches to treating TB can teach us much about the right and the wrong way to stop Covid-19. One of the main things we learned from TB is that epidemics can\u2019t be beaten in hospitals alone. Eradicating a disease like this has to take place in the community. Treating Covid-19 will depend on community testing, either across a population or by using methods of cluster sampling. There are multiple ways to curb community transmission of the disease \u2013 from face masks that prevent people from spreading particles that carry germs, to physical distancing measures<strong> </strong>and self isolation. We should also be examining how existing technologies, such as <a href=\"https://news.columbia.edu/ultraviolet-technology-virus-covid-19-UV-light\">germicidal ultraviolet lighting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-020-0325-9\">vaccines that we already have at our disposal</a> could help protect against the transmission of Covid-19.</p> <p>Crucially, we shouldn\u2019t wait for a killer app or a vaccine to treat the coronavirus. Effective antibiotics weren\u2019t discovered until years after TB had receded in affluent countries. Covid-19 might be different; if it behaves like other coronaviruses, those who have been infected may become immune. But the quest for a \u201csilver bullet\u201d shouldn\u2019t detract from interventions already known to work.</p> <p>The fight against tuberculosis showed that treating a pandemic only in one part of the world isn\u2019t enough to eradicate a disease. An estimated two-thirds of tuberculosis cases in wealthy countries today originate in places where a comprehensive response to TB was never implemented. Defeating a pandemic requires a global commitment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/14/why-is-the-world-losing-fight-against-history-most-lethal-disease-tb-tuberculosis\">Why is the world losing the fight against history's most lethal disease?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the key to a successful community-based strategy isn\u2019t just case-finding or quarantine, though they will both play a role. It\u2019s trust. Why is trust so important? With TB, as with Covid-19, more than half of the people with the disease exhibit no symptoms. If people do not come forward to be treated, and don\u2019t consent to be tested, or if they are unable and therefore unwilling to remain isolated, the process of treating the disease can\u2019t even begin.</p> <p>People must be able to trust that they won\u2019t individually bear the catastrophic health expenses incurred from fighting the virus. This means providing housing and employment support for everyone who needs to isolate, and ensuring that people who are sick or isolating don\u2019t forgo their wages to do so. If the economic and social risks of Covid-19 aren\u2019t shared across the population, the next wave of the pandemic could be dramatically worse. It\u2019s only through mutual trust that we will find those infected with coronavirus, help the sick recover and halt its spread.</p> <p>Ensuring that countries across the world have the resources to pursue a strategy of testing, treating and preventing the virus will be far less costly than the effects of another outbreak on the global economy. We know from history that this is the only way to stop the virus in its tracks.</p> <p>\u2022 Salmaan Keshavjee is the director of the Harvard Medical School Centre for Global Health Delivery.

If the president wants to fire that person, then so be it.\u201d</p> <p>But Birx said no such thing.</p> <p>The cringeworthy remarks about disinfectant and ultraviolet light compounded fears that Birx, the lead advocate of social distancing, has been somewhat less successful at <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/donald-trump-deborah-birx-disinfectant-testing-coronavirus/index.html\">critical distancing from the president.</a> Like other White House officials before her, she is said to be sacrificing a hard-won professional reputation at the altar of Trump\u2019s vanity.</p> <p>Critics note that she has repeatedly failed to speak out against the president\u2019s false and potentially dangerous claims when the occasion demands. Worse still, in an apparent attempt to stay in his good graces, the 64-year-old doctor and diplomat has praised Trump and even sided with him in jabbing at the media.</p> <p>Bardella, a former spokesman and senior adviser for the House of Representatives\u2019 oversight committee, said: \u201cA doctor\u2019s responsibility first and foremost is to tell the truth and correct falsehoods that could do people harm. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic or possible to pander to Trump but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/climate/trump-coronavirus-climate-science.html\">also maintain fidelity to science.\u201d</a></p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">everything in Birx\u2019s career</a> prepared her for a global pandemic, nothing could have prepared her for a mercurial boss with a tendency to parrot bad science.</p> <p>Her professional life began in 1985 with the defence department as a clinician in immunology, specialising in research on a vaccine for HIV/Aids. Birx was promoted to director of the US military HIV research program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from 1996 to 2005. She helped lead one of the most influential HIV vaccine trials in the world and was promoted to colonel.</p> <p>Birx went on to lead President George W Bush\u2019s Pepfar programs combating HIV/ Aids around the world, managing an annual budget of more than $1.5bn. She is now one of two women on the White House coronavirus taskforce, where Vice-President Mike Pence has described her as his \u201cright arm\u201d.</p> <p>Another prominent taskforce member, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/trump-fauci-relationship-coronavirus-us\">Anthony Fauci,</a> the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is widely regarded as having walked the diplomatic tightrope more successfully. He contradicts and corrects the president\u2019s false claims at times, while holding his tongue or offering gentle praise at others. </p> <p>Birx has been a team player to a fault, careful not to aggravate Trump by tempering his wild medical ruminations and exaggerations about testing capacity. On the contrary, last month <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21197074/deborah-birx-praised-trump-scientific-literature-coronavirus\">she told the Christian Broadcasting Network:</a> \u201cHe\u2019s been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and the data. I think his ability to analyse and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues.\u201d</p> <p>Such remarks have provoked a backlash.</p> <p>Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joelockhart/status/1243563311532302336?lang=en\">tweeted:</a> \u201cI, for one, am no longer interested in hearing from Dr. Brix [sic].

When she was pressed about the issue later on two Sunday politics TV shows, she claimed this is merely the way Trump processes new information and expressed frustration that the media had not moved on. \u201cIt bothers me that this is still in the news cycle,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">she told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.</a></p> <p>Emily Nussbaum, a staff writer at the New Yorker magazine,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/1254505465087692801?s=20\"> tweeted:</a> \u201cDr Birx is going to leave a horrible legacy. It\u2019s one thing to be a cynical paid fixer. It\u2019s worse, in my eyes, to be the expert who props up the mad king. I get that it\u2019s an emergency &amp; I understand the theoretical strategy she may think she\u2019s pursuing, but it\u2019s a moral horror.\u201d</p> <p>Birx is not the first White House official to find themself walking a tightrope. Memoirs of the Trump era are replete with anecdotes about senior staff removing documents from the president\u2019s desk or accidentally-on-purpose forgetting to pass on his orders. </p> <p>Charlie Sykes, founder and editor-at-large of the Bulwark website, explored the moral quandary earlier this month in an article headlined, <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/the-faucian-bargain/\">\u201cThe Faucian Bargain\u201d, </a>and said this week: \u201cIf Dr Birx and Dr Fauci were not in the room, decisions might have been made that cost tens of thousands of lives, but the price for them is to flatter and fawn.\u201d</p> <p>Of Birx\u2019s silence over disinfectant at the crucial moment when the cameras were rolling, Sykes commented: \u201cIt\u2019s cringeworthy and embarrassing, but I\u2019m guessing she thought in Trumpland, this is what\u2019s required. It\u2019s a trade-off, and I don\u2019t envy her position. If she had said, \u2018This is terrible and the president put people in danger\u2019, she\u2019d be gone and replaced by someone even less willing to speak truth to power.\u201d</p>",

Nine is reporting that several high profile players are standing firm with the Warriors, who at this point are unsure about flying to Australia from New Zealand to play out the remainder of the season given there are no details on remuneration. </p> \n  <p>Players were slated to return to the training pitch on Tuesday next week, with Monday set aside for educational programs on the strict biosecurity measures that will need to be put into place if the season is to restart. </p> \n  <p>AAP reports:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>The development comes as talks between the league and its television networks continue on new broadcast revenues for the revised season. The NRL\u2019s plan is for the Warriors to depart New Zealand on Sunday and, while in self-isolation in Tamworth, join rival teams in preparing for a 28 May restart.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Further complicating matters is the Warriors are yet to receive an official exemption to enter the country, or train together while in quarantine. While a charter flight has been booked, the club also continues to demand certainty around a number of issues before stepping on a plane.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Chief among the concerns are how much players can expect to be paid, as well as the possible accommodation of families during their indefinite stay. The Warriors could spend up to six months in Sydney should international travel restrictions remain until the grand final in late October.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T05:15:37.104Z\">at 6.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa5a208f0882b206dcfbeb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:57:43.679Z\">5.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thank you to everyone who joined me for another week.

from May, depending on when they report their income to Centrelink each fortnight, the Covid-19 Senate committee heard. <br></p> \n  <p>These people will not receive a further payment beyond 24 September, meaning they will receive the supplement for a shorter period than six months. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat that says to me is people will not get the six months if they are still on

  "<p>The Trump administration has ratcheted up its efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic to overhaul and overturn Obama-era environmental regulations and increase industry access to public lands.</p> <p>The secretary of the interior, David Bernhardt, has sped efforts to drill, mine and cut timber on fragile western landscapes. Meanwhile, the EPA, headed by the former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, has weakened critical environmental laws and announced in March that it would cease oversight of the nation\u2019s polluters during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>The rollbacks appear to follow a playbook put forth by influential conservative thinktanks, urging the White House to use the pandemic as justification for curtailing, or eliminating, environmental rules and oversight. President Trump should have \u201cthe ability to suspend costly regulations without extensive process\u201d, according to a recent <a href=\"https://dinosaur-lily-78e9.squarespace.com/recommendations\">report</a> by the Heritage Foundation.</p> <p> Critics, such as Melyssa Watson, executive director of the Wilderness Society, accuse the administration of using the pandemic as a smokescreen to further its pro-industry agenda. \u201cFrom rolling back EPA\u2019s pollution standards, to pushing for more oil and gas drilling and stifling the public review process, the federal government is fast-tracking rollbacks that deserve public scrutiny,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While millions of acres of public lands across the country have been shuttered to visitors, they remain open to oil and gas companies. And despite plummeting oil prices, the Bureau of Land Management has announced no plans to cancel, or even scale back, upcoming auctions that would make hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands across the western US available to energy companies.</p> <p>One of the most controversial sales would offer up 150,000 acres in southern Utah to energy companies. Some of the parcels are located within a half-mile of Canyonlands national park. The bureau did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Environmentalists, however, say that the push to drill near the iconic red rock landscapes of Arches and Canyonlands is not only destructive but also unnecessary in light of an oil glut that has swamped storage capacity, driving oil prices last week into negative territory for the first time in history.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that it would be \u2018critical\u2019 work to speed up oil production on public lands while the planet drowns in oil tells you all you\u2019d ever want to know about the corruption, both intellectual and actual, of the Trump administration,\u201d said the climate activist and author Bill McKibben.</p> <p>In addition to ramping up oil and gas development on public lands, the Department of Energy announced plans last week to \u201crevitalize\u201d the US uranium mining and processing industry. Such a scheme, say environmentalists, puts uranium-rich Grand Canyon national park and Bears Ears national monument at extreme risk.</p> <p>\u201cEnriching special interests with taxpayer resources so they can plunder national treasures like Bears Ears and the Grand Canyon will harm our land, water and public health,\u201d said America Fitzpatrick, a spokeswoman for the Wilderness Society. \u201cTo do so in the face of a global pandemic is an abuse of public trust.\u201d</p> <p>The water demands of the uranium industry are significant. Depending on the method of extraction, a mine can require hundreds, even thousands, of gallons per minute. Those requirements are particularly onerous considering that the largest uranium deposits are found in some of the most water-starved parts of the country.</p> <p>Another rule change takes aim at the western forests. In March, the BLM announced a proposal that would allow the BLM and US Forest Service to destroy large parcels of pi\u00f1on and juniper forests across the western US with minimal environmental review. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"125d9168c91e8db01244819b904b172b38be15d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/125d9168c91e8db01244819b904b172b38be15d0/0_166_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Changes to EPA regulations could lead to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changes to EPA fuel efficiency standards could lead to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other recent Trump administration actions threaten air and water quality and herald a drastic increase in carbon emissions. At the end of March, the Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to roll back Obama-era automobile fuel efficiency standards that would have increased the average fuel efficiency of the American vehicle fleet by more than 6 miles per gallon. Referred to by the EPA as \u201cthe largest deregulatory initiative of this administration\u201d, the reduction in fuel efficiency standards will result in close to a billion additional tons of carbon emissions per year.</p> <p>Days earlier, the EPA announced that it would suspend enforcement of environmental regulations during the Covid-19 outbreak, allowing industrial firms \u2013 from oil refineries to small manufacturers \u2013 to self-monitor and avoid penalties for violations if they can prove that those violations somehow resulted from the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic is a nationwide phenomenon,\u201d the EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, wrote in a letter to Congress. \u201cDiverting EPA staff time to respond to individual questions about routine monitoring and reporting requirements would hinder EPA\u2019s ability to focus on continued protection of human health and the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Others see it differently: \u201cThis is an open license to pollute,\u201d said the former EPA administrator and current Natural Resources Defense Council president Gina McCarthy. \u201cThe administration \u2026 is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2020.

caused a political storm by inviting a senior Chinese diplomat to a press conference where he announced he would obtain 10m coronavirus testing kits for use by the Australian government.</p> <p>At the centre of the globe-spanning legal storm is pricing information about Fortescue, which is the world\u2019s fourth-biggest iron ore producer, that was published by a subsidiary of S&amp;P, S&amp;P Global Platts (S&amp;P Platts), in its newsletter SBB Steel Markets Daily.</p> <p>Companies selling iron ore set their prices by offering a discount relative to a benchmark, assessed by S&amp;P Platts, and the information Fortescue claimed was confidential was the percentage discounts it was offering for ore shipped in March and April this year.</p> <p>The high court of England and Wales held a hearing in S&amp;P Platts\u2019 absence last Thursday and the following day issued an injunction forbidding the reporting agency and another publisher, Argus Media, from publishing Fortescue\u2019s discount rates.</p> <p>But on Wednesday S&amp;P Platts asked the district court for the southern district of New York to issue an injunction of its own forbidding Fortescue from continuing the litigation in London, as well as a declaration that any ruling against it by the British court was unenforceable in the US because of the country\u2019s strong free speech protections.</p> <p>S&amp;P Platts also told the court the pricing information was not confidential anyway because it often appeared on Chinese social media network Weibo before S&amp;P Platts published it.</p> <p>It said that any disputes needed to be litigated in New York, rather than London, due to a clause in the contract under which Fortescue subscribes to S&amp;P Platts\u2019 publications.</p> <p>S&amp;P Platts claimed that by publishing price information obtained from buyers it was helping to promote an efficient market.</p> <p>\u201cFMG, in contrast, seeks to protect only its own narrow commercial interest by imposing opacity for its pricing alone in the hopes that an uneven playing field will allow it to charge higher prices,\u201d S&amp;P Platts said in documents filed with the court.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

amendment to the US constitution.</p> <p>\u201cIf companies were allowed to prohibit the solicitation and publication of factual information about their businesses based on asserted violation of confidentiality obligations placed on employees and customers, it would severely disrupt time-honoured journalistic practices and impede the flow of information that is vital to the public and to the

  "<p>There is a line in The Plague, the novel by Albert Camus now enjoying a revival, that still chimes. \u201cOfficialdom can never cope with something really catastrophic: what they are short of is imagination.\u201d</p> <p>As sport plots the slow route back to action, initially behind closed doors, it has the chance to chart a new way forward, not least rugby union, whose hand-to-mouth existence has been exposed.</p> <p>World Rugby has been hit this month by election fever, with Bill Beaumont <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/26/bill-beaumont-agustin-pichot-world-rugby-election-rugby-union\">being challenged for the chairmanship</a> by Agust\u00edn Pichot \u2013 but who wins will be largely irrelevant unless the way the governing body is run radically changes.</p> <p>\u201cSports bodies need to show imagination and thinking,\u201d says Darren Bailey, a sports lawyer who is a consultant to the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. \u201cRugby\u2019s model has to change. The impact of the coronavirus lockdown has been immediate and severe because it relies on income to pay bills: it lacks reserves and so has no flex. It all goes back to 1995 when the game went open without having the time to prepare for it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/european-clubs-collision-course-world-rugby-unacceptable-fixture-plans\">European clubs on collision course with World Rugby over 'unacceptable' plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bailey was World Rugby\u2019s first director of legal and legislative affairs and authored the global regulatory framework for the sport after the 1995 decision. He has also worked for the Football Association. \u201cThe model 25 years ago should have been based on the fact that the Test game was the commercial driver. That would have allowed a more robust system which, with a more effective salary system and cost control measures, would have allowed reserves to be developed.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, a market economy grew in France and England which has relied on investors prepared to absorb losses year after year rather than revenue generated. The essence of the game is mutual dependency, but it has been undermined over the years by three issues: north versus south, club versus country and the developed versus developing.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity to redress these faultlines should not be missed. It is now or never in terms of rebooting.\u201d</p> <p>The new model Bailey envisages would put international rugby first, but would not relegate the club game to obscurity. There would be a pecking order, and as the various strands make plans for resumption, there will be conflict.</p> <p>Last week the chairman of European Professional Club Rugby, Simon Halliday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/european-clubs-collision-course-world-rugby-unacceptable-fixture-plans\">said it would be unacceptable</a> if World Rugby moved the July tours, which will almost certainly be called off, to October when clubs hope to stage the final stages of this season\u2019s Champions Cup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08937d01f607aba1146a820e223d2843ce5c53f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08937d01f607aba1146a820e223d2843ce5c53f6/0_159_4047_2428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darren Bailey has suggested expanding All Black tours to feature club sides.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren Bailey has suggested expanding All Black tours to feature club sides.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behrouz Mehri/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He called for clubs to be involved in discussions, which needs World Rugby to be given direct access to them by unions. But the income from Test rugby is considerably larger than that generated by club rugby. Part of it is used to nourish the amateur game, which is bound to take a participation hit, rather than feed professional leagues. The rule on player release needs rewriting to accommodate international windows being moved.</p> <p>\u201cRugby needs to become less adversarial in the way it is run,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cIt has to work in the interests of the game nationally and internationally.</p> <p>\u201cRugby has an older demographic and I wonder about the long-term psychology over mass gatherings. I think tech will play an important part in giving people the confidence to attend matches. If people travel less, it presents an opportunity for local initiatives: when a vaccine is found, sport could drive it by saying spectators needed to have one to come in.</p> <p>\u201cRugby needs to get back to what it was all about: incredible standards of behaviour, integrity and respect for match officials and players.

Some officials have suggested more radical measures, like creating an independent or semi-autonomous international body that would deal only with global health emergencies.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/29/world-health-organization-who-battleground-trump-taiwan-china/\">Foreign Policy</a>, the US also circulated a proposal on Wednesday to initiate an early assessment of the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak but close allies are resistant, arguing that such reckoning should wait until the worse of the pandemic is over.</p> <p>The UK and German ambassadors to Washington, Karen Pierce and Emily Haber, underscored that point on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cThe British government\u2019s position is that we do need some reforms in the WHO and to look at the international health regulations,\u201d Pierce said at a virtual discussion organised by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/postlive/status/1255540301617410053?s=20\">Washington Post</a>. \u201cHowever, at the moment, the most important thing is to cooperate on tackling the pandemic and get on top of the virus.\u201d</p> <p>Haber added: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to look at what worked, what didn\u2019t work, but it can\u2019t happen in the midst of the crisis. Politicization \u2026 would probably be mutually exclusive with getting the transparency we absolutely need.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump cut off US funding to the WHO (of over $400m a year) on 14 April, and has accused it of being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and having withheld critical information in the early days of the outbreak. <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/trump-admin-asks-intel-agencies-to-find-out-whether-china-who-hid-info-on-coronavirus/ar-BB13mkuf?pfr=1\">NBC News reported</a> on Wednesday that the White House had ordered US intelligence to investigate WHO actions.</p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/caught-in-a-superpower-struggle-the-inside-story-of-the-whos-response-to-coronavirus\">no evidence</a> the WHO withheld information. There were 15 US health officials embedded in the organisation in the critical weeks in January and February. Trump only declared a national emergency six weeks after the WHO\u2019s own emergency declaration. His critics have said he is seeking to use the organisation as a scapegoat for the failings of his administration\u2019s sluggish response.</p> <p>The US reforms presented to the G7 would strengthen the independence of the WHO director general and its emergency committee of international experts, which gives advice on when or whether to take the critical step of declaring a public health emergency of international concern.</p> <p>When that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/caught-in-a-superpower-struggle-the-inside-story-of-the-whos-response-to-coronavirus\">committee met</a> to consider the coronavirus threat on 22 January, it was split on whether the outbreak merited an emergency declaration, only coming to that conclusion a week later. The US has proposed a third, halfway, option, likened by US officials to the yellow signal on traffic lights.</p> <p>The HHS document also called for increased transparency in WHO reporting on member state compliance, a clear reference to US dissatisfaction with complimentary remarks about the initial Chinese government response made by the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> <p>In another proposed reform with China in mind, the US is suggesting that member state compliance with international health regulations should be subject to regular review.</p> <p>\u201cHHS is not going to comment on alleged, leaked documents,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said. \u201cPresident Trump is holding the WHO accountable by putting a hold on United States funding. The American people deserve better from the WHO and the US is still a member state of the WHO and an active member of the WHO\u2019s executive board.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs the Trump administration continues to fight Covid-19, the US will continue to seek to refocus the WHO on fulfilling its core missions of preparedness, response, and stakeholder coordination,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>An initial 60-day review of WHO performance is being carried out by the White House office for management and budget.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Thursday 30 April.</p> \n<h2>ACT has no active cases of Covid-19 in Australian first</h2> \n<p>The Australian Capital Territory has no active cases of coronavirus for the first time in seven weeks. All 103 people to have survived the virus in the territory have now recovered. The ACT has recorded three deaths. It is the first jurisdiction in Australia to record no active cases.</p> \n<p>Nationally, just 10 new cases were recorded. Most were in Victoria, where a cluster of seven cases were detected at an aged care home. New South Wales reported two new cases and Tasmania reported one. It\u2019s not clear if the NSW total includes three new residents at Newmarch House aged care home in western Sydney, who tested positive over the past 24 hours. Some 37 residents at the home have now tested positive to the virus, and 12 have died.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/tasmania-coronavirus-outbreak-traced-to-two-ruby-princess-passengers\">Tasmania coronavirus outbreak traced to two Ruby Princess passengers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Report into Tasmanian outbreak names Ruby Princess as cause</h2> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/tasmania-coronavirus-outbreak-traced-to-two-ruby-princess-passengers\">interim report into the outbreak in north-west Tasmania</a> found that 20% of the 73 healthcare workers to test positive to the virus attended work while symptomatic, and 77% attended work during the infectious period, or 48 hours before symptoms were shown. The outbreak was traced back to two passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, who sadly died. They infected a healthcare worker, and the virus spread through work meetings and other contact. The investigation ruled out an illegal social gathering and said no one was to blame for the outbreak, which has been linked to 11 deaths.</p> \n<h2>Jobseeker recipients top 1.3 million</h2> \n<p>The $550 jobseeker coronavirus supplement, which has effectively doubled the fortnightly rate of the unemployment payment to $1,125, will cease from 24 September. It\u2019s a hard finish date in the legislation, meaning that recipients who don\u2019t receive their first payment until May will not get the full six months worth. As of 24 April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/30/australians-on-jobseeker-payment-up-450000-in-less-than-a-month\">there were 1.3 million people receiving the payment</a>, up from 815,000 on 28 February. That\u2019s forecast to reach 1.7 million by September.</p> \n<p>The Department of Social Services told the Covid-19 Senate inquiry that the supplement was not extended to disability pensioners because \u201cDSP residents weren\u2019t generally in the workforce\u201d. The committee also heard that Services Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/australia-coronavirus-live-updates-nsw-victoria-qld-northern-territory-latest-news-update?page=with:block-5eaa33a08f087455863183aa#block-5eaa33a08f087455863183aa\">never told the government services minister, Stuart Robert, that the MyGov website suffered a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Twiggy reportedly makes a play for Virgin</h2> \n<p>Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest reportedly plans to make a bid for Virgin Australia. The airline went into administration on 21 April and creditors held a meeting by video link this morning. Forrest\u2019s investment group, Minderoo, has hired investment bank Credit Suisse as advisers, according to <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/street-talk/andrew-forrest-mulls-virgin-bid-pitches-australian-credentials-20200430-p54okv\">a report in the Australian Financial Review.</a></p> \n<p>Forrest is also facing criticism for intervening in Australian-Chinese relations and inviting the Chinese consul general to a press conference with Greg Hunt without the health minister\u2019s knowledge.</p> \n<h2>The NT eases restrictions, announces a return to the pub in two weeks</h2> \n<p>The Northern Territory will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/australia-coronavirus-live-updates-nsw-victoria-qld-northern-territory-latest-news-update?page=with:block-5eaa39d28f087455863183c9#block-5eaa39d28f087455863183c9\">ease restrictions from noon on Friday</a>, allowing people to go to playgrounds, pools, water parks and skate parks, and to play non-contact outdoor sports like golf and tennis. Residents will also be allowed to visit national parks, camp and fish, so long as physical distancing is maintained. Outdoor weddings and funerals will also be permitted.</p> \n<p>The only states not to announce an easing of restrictions are Victoria and Tasmania. Victoria\u2019s stay-at-home orders are set to expire on 11 May, the day the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee will decide if Australia has met the three requirements to ease the national baseline restrictions. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says police are continuing to enforce the order, issuing 43 fines in the past 24 hours.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<p>When Joana Opoku-Darko\u2019s daughter Anna was 18 months old, she came down with malaria, a disease common in Ghana and especially deadly for children.</p> <p>She bought medication from a pharmacy in Ghana\u2019s capital, Accra; when Anna\u2019s fever didn\u2019t subside she took her to a hospital, where they ran some tests.</p> <p>\u201cI was anxious, as a first-time mother. I didn\u2019t have the experience to tell whether it\u2019s going to get any better, or am I going to lose my child?\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThey told me the medicine was no good, and we needed to start treatment all over.\u201d</p> <p>Opoku-Darko had bought fake malaria treatment drugs. Had she not gone to the hospital, Anna could have become another sorry statistic in a country flooded with substandard medicines.</p> <p>The experience has Opoku-Darko worried about the pandemic, especially as experts warn issues of falsified drugs, already very deadly in Africa, will become even greater under Covid-19.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The current focus on curbing Covid-19 spread means there is less focus on routine market surveillance</p> <footer> <cite>Delese Mimi Darko, chief executive of Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified\">World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified\">zation</a> (WHO) estimates that one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries are either substandard or fake, which is both dangerous and a waste of precious family money. Various academic studies have put the prevalence at between 11% and 48%.</p> <p>Of 1,500 reports of such products, most came from Africa (42%), with south-east Asia also a major hotspot for fake medications.</p> <p>It is impossible to know precisely how many such medicines are in the system. Delese Mimi Darko, chief executive of Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority (FDA), says this is an ongoing problem, especially as people smuggle drugs across the country\u2019s borders. She too worries that Ghana, with more than 1,500 reported Covid-19 cases, will see an increase in falsified and substandard medicines due to the pandemic. Already the FDA has seized substandard hand-sanitisers.</p> <p>\u201cThe current focus on curbing Covid-19 spread means there is less focus on routine market surveillance,\u201d says Darko. \u201cThis means there could be an influx across porous borders of substandard medical products \u2013 including those for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>Measures like social distancing and lockdowns limit the work the regulators could do, she added.</p> <p>The FDA is also keeping an eye on social media posts offering unsubstantiated cures. Ghana\u2019s police service has cautioned people to beware online offers of vaccines for Covid-19. Earlier this month, the WHO warned of falsified chloroquine products found in Cameroon, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and called for \u201cwidespread vigilance\u201d from all countries.</p> <p>Chloroquine has been used in Africa for decades as an antimalarial, but it became internationally famous after Donald Trump said it could be a \u201c<a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-says-unproven-coronavirus-drugs-could-gift-god-232555075.html\">gift from God</a>\u201d in the fight against Covid-19. Such claims have led to people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/can-chloroquine-really-help-treat-coronavirus-patients\">hoarding the medicine</a>, leading to reports of price hikes and shortages. In Nigeria, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/africa/chloroquine-trump-nigeria-intl/index.html\">three people overdosed</a> on the drug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"965e074ae797b929b18a6841012d26f6283d9c5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/965e074ae797b929b18a6841012d26f6283d9c5f/0_63_810_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"Activists for the campaign group Fight the Fakes at a Wellcome Trust-sponsored launch in Accra, Ghana\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists for the campaign group Fight the Fakes at a Wellcome Trust-sponsored launch in Accra, Ghana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fight The Fakes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kwasi Boateng, director of United States Pharmacopeia-Ghana, a public health non-profit that focuses party on combating falsified medicines, is concerned the pandemic might eventually cause a shortage of essential medicines in Ghana, allowing substandard or falsified treatments to fill the void. While he has not seen shortages of essentials yet, he says Ghana is still early in its battle with the virus and \u201ctime will tell\u201d.</p> <p>Boateng fears that if and when any official Covid-19 treatment is found, fake versions might find their way into the county.</p> <p>\u201cThe kind of medicines that people normally want faked are the ones that are in demand.

  "<p>You\u2019ve heard of preppers, right? Survivalists? If you\u2019ve watched TV shows like <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/tv/doomsday-preppers/\">Doomsday Preppers</a>, you know about their strange, apocalyptic beliefs: that a disaster could strike at any time, overwhelming first responders and the social safety net; that this crisis could disrupt supply chains, causing scarcity and panic and social breakdown; that authorities might invoke emergency powers and impose police curfews. Crazy theories like that.</p> <p>In fact, many perfectly reputable organizations \u2013 including the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/foodwater/prepare.html\">US</a> <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/f&amp;web.pdf\">federal</a> <a href=\"https://www.ready.gov/food\">government</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/survival-kit-supplies.html\">Red Cross</a> \u2013 recommend Americans maintain extra food and emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) advises keeping a two-week supply of food, as well as water, batteries, medical masks, first-aid supplies and a battery- or hand-powered radio, among other things.</p> <p>In mainstream society, however, interest in prepping usually invites ridicule about bunkers and tin-foil hats. Preppers have spent years as the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2013/02/20/stop-demonizing-preppers-2/\">objects of our collective derision</a>.</p> <p>Until now. Today, we\u2019re all preppers \u2013 or rather, wish we had been.<strong> </strong>Non-preppers have been caught in a rain shower without an umbrella. I don\u2019t know if preppers are laughing right now, but perhaps they\u2019re entitled to <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-03-15/not-exactly-gloating-stockpiling-preppers-have-a-moment\">some vindication</a>.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019m not a prepper. I am an effete quasi-intellectual with no practical skills of any kind. My current \u201cemergency supplies\u201d are some Hungry-Man Dinners and a liter of bourbon. If things get really bad I will finish the bourbon, lie down and wait to be eaten by stray cats.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve come to respect the preppers\u2019 ethos of survival and preparedness. One of my friends is one, or at least on the spectrum. When coronavirus hit, he wasn\u2019t one of the millions of people scrambling for surgical masks; he already had them in his survival kit. He kept a few and gave the rest to elderly people.</p> <p>It has become fashionable to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-socialism-and-coronavirus-epidemic/607681/\">argue</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-regulations-slow-hiring-of-doctors-and-nurses-staffing-firms-say.html\">not</a> <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/physician-assistants-want-step-fight-coronavirus-state-regulations-may-be-getting-way\">entirely</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/upshot/hospital-rules-relaxed-coronavirus-fight.html\">accurately</a> \u2013 that there are \u201cno libertarians in a pandemic\u201d. Certainly, this crisis has been a stark reminder of the importance of collective action. We\u2019re all on this ship together; Covid-19 has laid bare the pathetic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/profit-over-people-cost-over-care-americas-broken-healthcare-exposed-by-virus\">inadequacy</a> of the US social safety net, our lack of investment in the common good, and our government\u2019s short attention span for preparing for crises that don\u2019t involve terrorism or war.</p> <p>But collective action also requires some level of individual responsibility and preparedness, too, at least for those with the ability and the means. You can\u2019t aid your elderly, immunocompromised or poorer neighbors if you haven\u2019t taken the bare minimum of preparations. There\u2019s a reason that airplane safety demonstrations warn passengers to put on their own air-masks before assisting others.</p> <p>We\u2019re right to be angry at the people stripping supermarkets bare and hoarding desperately needed supplies. Those people aren\u2019t preppers, however. Preppers don\u2019t engage in panic-buying. That\u2019s the whole point. That\u2019s why it is called prepping.</p> <p>\u201cPrepping is a choice that occurs before a panic, not during,\u201d a prepper recently <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/fj07cf/time_for_a_little_gatekeeping/\">complained</a> on Reddit. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t stock up over time, you are a hoarder or, perhaps worse, an opportunist. In times like these we need to come together and support one another. That doesn\u2019t mean giving away your supplies, but it does mean living in a society.\u201d</p> <p>Another added, \u201cWe aren\u2019t the reason that elderly or immunocompromised people can\u2019t find hand sanitizer, masks or toilet paper. We bought things in small increments when it made zero impact on the supply.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, some preppers are individualistic to the point of being antisocial. Rightwing survivalists, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2012-feb-08-la-na-american-redoubt-20120209-story.html?mod=article_inline\">in particular</a>, are often motivated by paranoid, apocalyptic, and racist or conspiratorial beliefs. A massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/10/preppers-survivalists-survivalcon-expo-nuclear-bomb-republicans-mormons\">doomsday industry</a> caters to their fantasies with expensive survival supplies of questionable utility.</p> <p>The preppers we encounter in popular culture are invariably the worst examples - religious or political zealots, eccentrics, middle-aged men suffering crises of masculinity, and, in the case of shows such as Doomsday Preppers, caricatures selected for entertainment value.</p> <p>But not all are gun and gear fetishists with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/02/preppers-survivalist-summit-constitution-americas-midlife-crisis\">delusions of grandeur</a>; many are apolitical or even <a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">left</a><a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">wing</a>. Global warming, environmental degradation and anxiety about the Trump administration have <a href=\"https://qz.com/973095/the-new-doomsayers-taking-up-arms-and-preparing-for-catastrophe-american-liberals/\">spurred</a> liberals and leftists into the fold. Websites such as <a href=\"https://theprepared.com/\">ThePrepared</a> offer useful, non-alarmist advice on disaster preparedness.</p> <p>The more sophisticated practitioners have always understood that prepping is a matter of both individual and collective wellbeing. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, operates a massive network of grain silos and food depots. People undergoing hardship receive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/02/salt-lake-city-socialism-mormon-style-utah\">food and household goods</a>, for free or in exchange for volunteer service, at the church\u2019s Costco-style warehouses. The system is vertically integrated, with food supplied by <a href=\"https://www.mormonwiki.com/Bishop%27s_Storehouses\">church-owned farms</a>. All Mormons are also <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/emergency-preparedness?lang=eng\">encouraged</a> to maintain emergency stockpiles in their home \u2013 not only for their own sake, but to assist neighbors when a hurricane or flood strikes.</p> <p><em>When</em> disaster strikes, not if. The problem is that disasters always look like remote possibilities before they occur, and historical abstractions afterward. Even the coronavirus, as insurmountable as it seems, will eventually pass; we will return to normalcy, and then complacency, and maybe even go back to ridiculing preppers.</p> <p>Yet global warming probably means more and more of these kinds of crises \u2013 natural disasters, but also economic instability and possibly more pandemics, as thawing ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/climate-change-thawing-deadly-diseases-anthrax\">releases long-dormant pathogens</a>.</p> <p>I suspect the real reason many people instinctively recoil from prepping is psychological. Prepping comes across as pessimistic or even cynical. But perhaps it is better to think of it as pragmatism. We should prepare for disasters for the same reason we buy life insurance or back up computer files: hope for the best, plan for the worst.</p> <p>Recently, while doing some quarantine cleaning, I found several books I acquired during younger \u2013 less lazy, and more idealistic \u2013 days: The Boy Scout Fieldbook; The US Army Survival Manual; Living Off the Country. It seems unlikely they\u2019ll prove too relevant here in Brooklyn, New York, but I\u2019ve decided to brush up anyway. I also found a book called Home Brewing Without Failures, by the unimprovably named HE Bravery. The utility of that one should speak for itself.</p>",
  "<p>Of the antiviral, antibiotic, antiretroviral and anti-malarial medicines being studied in trials to treat and prevent Covid-19, a drug called remdesivir is among a handful which scientists and the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments\">consider most promising</a>.</p> \n<p>Hope in the drug was revived on Wednesday when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/29/fauci-clear-cut-evidence-potential-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-works-video\"> the US government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, said data from one clinical trial \u201cshows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery\u201d. But within hours of Fauci\u2019s announcement, the prestigious medical journal The Lancet published results from a study in China which found remdesivir did not speed recovery or reduce deaths from Covid-19 compared with a placebo in hospital patients.</p> \n<p>So what should the public make of the seemingly conflicting remdisivir results?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/remdesivir-coronavirus-drug-experimental\">Remdesivir: early findings on experimental coronavirus drug offer 'quite good news'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>What is remdesivir?</h2> \n<p>Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral produced by the US pharmaceutical company Gilead, initially as a potential treatment for the Ebola virus. It was rapidly pushed through clinical trials after showing promising results in the lab, and was then rolled out more widely in affected areas of Africa.</p> \n<p>However, in 2019 Congolese health officials said the drug was less effective than monoclonal antibody drugs, which are often used for cancer treatment and had a much more significant impact on lowering death rates than remdesivir.</p> \n<p>Remdesivir has been revived with the outbreak of Covid-19. This is because it showed promising results in preventing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which are also caused by coronaviruses. But those studies have only been done in animals.</p> \n<h2><strong>What do we know about how it works?</strong></h2> \n<p>The drug is administered via daily infusion for about 10 days. Currently remdesivir has not been approved by health authorities around the world, and given it was mainly being used for Ebola, supply is low. But it is being used in clinical trials, and many countries are attempting to get access to the drug for use in their own Covid-19 studies. There has been spike in applications to Gilead for the drug from countries where Covid-19 has been particularly devastating.</p> \n<p>In previous animal studies of Mers-CoV, <a href=\"https://www.jbc.org/content/early/2020/02/24/jbc.AC120.013056\">US researchers found remdesivir blocks a particular enzyme that is required for viral replication</a>. Scientists hope it will have a similar effect on Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>What did the US study show?</h2> \n<p>The study praised by Fauci relates to a clinical trial by Gilead, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US. The trial of more than 1,000 patients showed those given remdesivir improved after an average of 11 days, compared with an average of 15 days for those not given the treatment. There was no statistically significant improvement in survival rate between the two groups.</p> \n<p>Dr Elena K Schneider-Futschik, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s department of pharmacology and therapeutics, said given the absence of other treatments for Covid-19 and the promising data from the study, \u201cwe can assume that the drug may be fast-tracked\u201d. Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist with the University of Wollongong, said it was important to note the full study had not yet been published, and that although it found patients given the drug recovered faster, researchers had broadened their definition of \u201crecovery\u201d throughout the trial.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad in and of itself, but without further explanation it\u2019s hard to understand why the study made the choices that it did,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, they included people who were still in hospital in their \u201crecovered\u201d figure, according to the study registration \u2013 until we see the full published research we won\u2019t know if that\u2019s justifiable or not.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"770decd4-9257-4050-a836-d3708e070870\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MG9w7zLplFw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What did The Lancet China study show?</h2> \n<p>This study from Wuhan, China showed no statistically clinical benefit in Covid-19 patients in health improvement or mortality. However, the researchers tested a smaller number of patients \u2013 just over 200. They concluded their findings would require confirmation from larger studies. The study was stopped early by the data safety monitoring board because of difficulty recruiting patients. However, it is the first randomised controlled trial of the drug for Covid-19, which is considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.</p> \n<p>The results <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/p/dmnya\">were accidentally published by the World Health Organization on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/p/dmnya\">its website earlier in April</a>, before quickly being removed. Dr Phillip A Reece, a consultant to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, said the findings from the US study were \u201cclearly preliminary\u201d and may have been precipitated by the accidental disclosure of the Chinese trial results. \u201cThis was <a href=\"https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/company-statements/gilead-sciences-statement-on-data-from-remdesivir-study-in-patients-with-severe-covid-19-in-china\">disputed by Gilead</a>,\u201d Reece said.</p> \n<h2>What should we take from all of this?</h2> \n<p>Schneider-Futschik said<strong> </strong>comparing the results from the two studies is difficult. \u201cThere can be a lot of variables in the set-up of the study, and different stages of initiation of treatment,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlso, the Chinese study is incomplete as doctors could not access new patients during the lockdown. It might highly depend on when and at what stage of the infection patients receive the drug. We can say it is currently not clear who is benefitting from remdesivir. Is it helping patients who would have recovered anyway, recover quicker? Is remdesivir more beneficial for younger compared [with] older patients? At what stage of the infection does treatment yield the best outcomes? Hopefully, the<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments\"> global clinical study</a> will answer these questions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Professor of infectious diseases with the Australian National University Peter Collignon said what the drug had not been shown to do was stop people dying.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe death rate for this virus is terrible and we want it to come down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis drug may have some benefits, but it\u2019s clear from the data we have at this point, it\u2019s not going to be the main answer.\u201d</p> \n<p>Co-director of the Centre for Virus Research Professor Sarah Palmer said,\u201cWe cannot base our medical response on this one promising study.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThat said, this National Institute study has more than four times as many patients involved in the clinical trial, giving it greater power to determine the effectiveness of remdesivir. In the trial conducted in China it appears remdesivir was employed in combination with other therapies which may have complicated an assessment of remdesivir\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Royal Dutch Shell has slashed its shareholder dividend for the first time since the second world war and warned it is facing a \u201ccrisis of uncertainty\u201d following the collapse of global oil prices.</p> <p>The energy giant told its shareholders, including thousands of retail investors and pension funds, that it would be in their best interests for payouts to fall for the first time in almost 80 years. The payout is being cut by 66%, from $15bn last year to $5bn this year.</p> <p>Ben van Buerden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said the \u201cmonumental\u201d decision to reset the company\u2019s dividend was difficult but necessary to preserve the financial resilience of the company against a \u201ccrisis of uncertainty\u201d.</p> <p>Shell is the biggest dividend payer in the FTSE 100 and the quarterly payout will fall by two-thirds to 16 cents a share. The company described the move as a \u201cprudent\u201d step in weathering the impact of the Covid-19 on the oil markets and the global economy.</p> <p>Shell\u2019s share price fell by 11%. Its market value has fallen by 44% since the beginning of this year, the fastest rate in the company\u2019s history, and it has lost its place as the FTSE 100\u2019s most valuable company to drugs maker Astrazeneca.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not consider that maintaining the current level of the dividend is in the best interest of shareholders or the company,\u201d Van Beurden said. \u201cNo CEO wants on their track record a cut to the dividend which is iconic in the market. But the situation we are facing is totally unprecedented.\u201d</p> <p>The collapse in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">global oil prices</a> to 21 year lows following the outbreak of the pandemic earlier this year caused Shell\u2019s profits for the first quarter to tumble to $2.9bn (\u00a32.3bn), down 46% from $5.3bn in the same quarter last year.</p> <p>The impact in the second quarter will \u201cmore severe\u201d, Van Beurden said.</p> <p>Shell plans to scrap all executive bonuses for this financial year, and rein in spending and costs to save up to $9bn. The company will \u201cprobably\u201d consider voluntary redundancies.</p> <p>\u201cThat is not going to happen anytime soon, if at all this year. But if this goes on, it is inevitable that there will be consequences,\u201d Van Beurden said.</p> <p>Shell\u2019s decision to cut its dividend for the first time in almost 80 years breaks with a decades-long taboo among major oil companies against cutting shareholder returns. Shell will also stall plans to buy back the shares which it paid to shareholders in lieu of dividends during the previous oil market downturn in 2015.</p> <p>Earlier this week, BP\u2019s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, said the company\u2019s board had decided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/bp-plunges-into-first-quarter-loss-after-oil-price-collapse\">not to cut its dividend for the first quarter despite plunging to a loss</a>.</p> <p>BP has cut its dividend only twice in the last 30 years, most recently in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010, which led to 11 fatalities and a bill topping $65bn.

It will no longer be \u201c\u2018no cuts since World War Two\u2019, it is \u2018no cuts since the last pandemic\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Van Beurden said he does not expect a recovery in global oil markets or the world\u2019s demand for oil over the medium term, meaning the company would need to prepare for the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty.</p> <p>The chief executive added that the collapse of global oil markets raises the likelihood that the world will reach \u2018peak oil demand\u2019 within the next decade. This may mean that the company shows preference to clean energy projects \u201cwhich serve us better in the future\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Chad Holliday, the chairman of Shell\u2019s board, said: \u201cShareholder returns are a fundamental part of Shell\u2019s financial framework. However, given the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, weaker commodity prices, higher volatility and uncertain demand outlook, the board believes that maintaining the current level of shareholder distributions is not prudent.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>My darling mother died early this month. Her death was peaceful and painless \u2013 and it was not due to the coronavirus.<strong> </strong>Yet it was shaped by the pandemic, as is its aftermath. The register office, the undertakers, the crematorium: the usual institutions of death are now inundated. The administrative and social rituals that busy your mind have practically disappeared. The friends dropping by, the swell of a funeral, the hugs: all are statutorily absent.</p> <p>It began with a urinary tract infection, of all things: a bothersome visitor but hardly unknown to my mother. If her body could not fight it off, then ordinarily an ambulance would whisk her off to hospital for stronger drugs and a bag of fluids. Not this time. The hospitals were almost overwhelmed, I was told, and parts are rife with contagion. And already she was so weak. On my mother\u2019s last afternoon, I sat by her bedside, on the phone to the community matron, who told me that another nursing home had that day sent a resident to A&amp;E \u2013 just for the medics to call and say they were returning her to the home to die.</p> <p>As her only child, I took what I hope was the best decision. Whether it really was is still a question that wakes me up in the dark.</p> <p>Another question ought to be asked, this one in public. Amid the focus on pulling the NHS through this plague, how many people have had their lives cut short because they couldn\u2019t get hospital treatment for illnesses other than coronavirus? The leading statistician David Spiegelhalter, at Cambridge University, told me he sees a \u201clarge transfer\u201d in the number of non-Covid-19 deaths from hospitals to homes and care homes. Some have been mis-recorded, while others have died in their bed rather than under the stark lights of a strange ward. But, as he observes, \u201cmany could have had their lives extended had they gone to hospital\u201d. The Office for National Statistics says it is now examining that gulf, but there is a high chance that those people are the collateral damage of a health system that has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/giving-nhs-charity-fundraising-coronavirus-state-taxes\">starved of cash for years</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c1f373465736569ff98fb9c6468dea27053dd73e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f373465736569ff98fb9c6468dea27053dd73e/0_0_1024_1536/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Stay sharp, mischievous and free\u2019: Arati Chakrabortty and her son Aditya on his wedding day, 2017.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stay sharp, mischievous and free\u2019: Arati Chakrabortty and her son Aditya on his wedding day, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Leaman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the undertakers came to take my mother\u2019s body, three of the staff at the nursing home where she spent her last few weeks ushered me away. All were black, and on my reckoning, first-generation immigrants: from Cameroon, Ghana, and the West Indies. I would also guess that at least one earns less than the<strong> </strong>\u00a330,000 a year the government proposed as the baseline for immigrants to get work visas. But for now they are carers to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">applauded on Downing Street</a>.</p> <p>A primary school teacher in Hackney for decades, Arati Chakrabortty would today be termed a \u201ckey worker\u201d. And as I looked at the carers in their protective gear, too flimsy to deter any virus, I knew my mother would have recognised something of their world. <br><br>In the 1980s her staffroom was a whistlestop tour of the British empire: Nigeria, Trinidad, Ireland, India, Pakistan. All women, quick on their feet and with their wits, and on pay far below their qualifications. Every day Mother went in wearing a sari far too lovely for the litter-strewn streets of 80s Hackney. During my school holidays she would drag me along to help: as we trundled down the road in our rickety hatchback, van drivers would cut her up and shout that she was a \u201cpaki\u201d who should fuck off back home.</p> <p>She was more than they could ever know. In the 1940s, when she was little, her family fled the Japanese bombing of Burma on the last ship out of Rangoon. All except her father, who along with other Indian men was stripped of his ticket by the British and had to walk through the mountains to get to India. The trek broke his health and he died not long after, leaving my mother and her brother and sister to be raised by a young widow \u2013 in a place and time where jobs and money were men\u2019s business. They were plunged close to poverty, then saw their family land in East Bengal disappear after partition. Even now, as our world is turned upside down, it is worth remembering that some among us have lived through far worse.</p> <p>Yet she had a will of iron. When the then prestigious Benares Hindu University made her sit an undergraduate exam in Sanskrit, a subject she hated, she retaliated by dipping her fountain pen in the inkwell and flicking it across the paper, leaving the blots and dots to be marked by some poor soul. When she arrived in London in the late 60s to do postgraduate study, she hunted for a bedsit among signs reading \u201cNo Irish, no Blacks, no Dogs\u201d. But she hardly dwelled on bad memories, preferring to talk about how Sarat Chandra Chatterjee\u2019s novels of Bengali peasant life reminded her of Thomas Hardy, and her soft spot for Maxim Gorky, his hard upbringing and good politics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was the teacher every parent wanted for their kid, the smiling sari-clad lady who could turn around the toughest nut</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was the era of Margaret Thatcher and her \u201calien hordes\u201d. The right viewed my mother then as it now sees Polish builders and Somali carers: as outsiders here to take from Britain. The left retorted, as it still does, by counting how much they give Britain. Even today, neither side sees them as people with their own memories, dreams, worlds. Who might have something to teach Britain.</p> <p>My mother\u2019s love of Shakespeare and Hazlitt was not an attempt to fit in. She claimed them as she claimed all of world culture. Nothing was off-limits.</p> <p>That liberty was what she wanted for everybody \u00ad\u2013 especially for the generations of children who passed through her class. She was the teacher every parent wanted for their kids, the smiling sari-clad lady who could turn round the toughest nuts.</p> <p>After retirement, she volunteered to teach Turkish and Kurdish migrant families who were moving into the streets where I\u2019d been brought up \u2013 and when poor health meant she couldn\u2019t manage the bus, she got my father to drive her. When he died, she asked me to lobby the school opposite her house for a classroom in the evenings so she could carry on.</p> <p>One other episode keeps coming to mind. Towards the end, my mother\u2019s faculties were corroded by dementia. I wheeled her up to the hospital for a memory test. The questions were childishly simple \u00ad\u2013 what is the date, who is the prime minister \u00ad\u2013 but my mother\u2019s responses were faltering, which exasperated her. It was not pleasant to see. Then, right at the end, the doctor asked her to write her name. For the briefest moment, a look I knew well passed over my mother\u2019s face. Carefully she wielded the pen. The doctor looked down, then in confusion showed me the pad. <br><br>She had written her name, all right \u00ad\u2013 in Bengali, so he had no way of knowing whether she had done it right or wrong. Although silent, her message was clear: she would not fit someone else\u2019s categories.</p> <p>Now she has left me, us. She will not see our toddler grow up, or meet her second granddaughter, who arrives next month. But if both girls learn not to be defined by others, to stay instead sharp and mischievous and free, then Mrs Chakrabortty will have delivered a most valuable lesson.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",

In an Oval Office interview with Reuters, the US president said he was looking into different options for the consequences China might face for its handling of the pandemic. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said, before adding that Beijing\u2019s actions had \u201cupset very badly\u201d the much-vaunted trade deal between the countries. Trump also said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/trump-government-wont-extend-coronavirus-distancing-guidelines\">he would not extend federal social distancing guidelines</a> when they expire today, despite US deaths from Covid-19 passing 60,000. And <a href=\"\u2018It\u2019s%20going%20to%20leave.%20It\u2019s%20going%20to%20be%20gone.%20It\u2019s%20going%20to%20be%20eradicated,\u2019\">he told business leaders earlier in the day</a> that the virus would soon be \u201cgone\u201d.</p> \n<p>At home, the cabinet will meet today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">when to start easing the lockdown</a> as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached. Despite a record 52,000 tests being carried out on Wednesday, 19,000 were re-tests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/hospital-chiefs-increasingly-frustrated-with-uk-testing-failures\">hospital leaders criticised ministers</a> for \u201ca series of frequent tactical announcements\u201d about testing targets. They said it was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had distracted from wider policy failures. Just days after Matt Hancock pledged to meet the 100,000 target by the end of April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/uk-turned-down-offer-of-10000-coronavirus-tests-a-day-four-weeks-ago\">the government turned down an offer of 10,000 testing kits a day</a> from a US company. The chief coroner has issued guidelines that inquests into the death of NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/inquests-nhs-staff-deaths-ppe-shortages\">should not examine the impact of lack of personal protective equipment</a> (PPE) on wards.</p> \n<p>A study led by researchers at Liverpool university <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/29/study-finds-a-third-of-uk-covid-19-patients-taken-to-hospital-are-dying\">says one third of patients admitted to hospital in the UK with Covid-19 are dying</a>. It comes as deaths in care homes and the wider community were added to the UK total, bringing the number of fatalities to 26,097 and leaving the country\u2019s toll behind only those of the US and Italy. South Korea today recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/south-korea-records-no-new-domestic-cases-of-covid-19-for-first-time-since-february\">no new cases for the first time since February</a>. Worldwide, almost 220,000 have died and there are 3.2m cases.

A taskforce was set up to sort out the mess that saw thousands of people facing deportation to the West Indies. More than 12,000 have had their cases resolved but two years after Amber Rudd was forced to quit as home secretary over the fiasco, lawyers and campaigners have expressed concern about the large backlog.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Power play \u2013 </strong>Experts believe renewable electricity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/covid-19-crisis-demand-fossil-fuels-iea-renewable-electricity\">will be the only energy that can survive the economic shock</a> triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has remained silent about the alleged assault that Tara Reade said took place in 1993.

Along with her late husband, Per Wahloo, Sj\u00f6wall penned a 10-book series based on the dour, middle-aged Martin Beck and his team of detectives. They inspired a generation of other writers such as Henning Mankell who said the couple \u201cbroke with the previous trends in crime fiction\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>There was some evidence for Trump\u2019s optimistic forecast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/remdesivir-coronavirus-drug-experimental\">after positive early results in the US yesterday from a trial of remdesivir</a>.

  "<p>Hop into something comfy and let\u2019s get started!\u201d This is how Adriene Mishler, YouTube\u2019s biggest yoga guru, begins many of her videos. For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/01/shape-of-the-future-how-barrys-bootcamp-changed-the-way-we-work-out\" title=\"\">Barry\u2019s Bootcamp</a> on Instagram, Mishler\u2019s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction. In recent months, she has been described as \u201cthe patron saint of quarantine\u201d (Paper magazine), \u201cthe most influential yoga teacher on the planet\u201d (Refinery29), and \u201cOur saviour\u201d (a fan on Twitter).</p> <p>Mishler was already huge before the pandemic \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene\" title=\"\">her channel</a>, which has more than 7 million subscribers, is the first to pop up when you search for \u201cyoga\u201d on YouTube \u2013 but the lockdown has catapulted her to a new level of fame. Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benagain/status/1250357935601004550\" title=\"\">a digital replica</a> of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.</p> <p>Working out at home in the time of coronavirus is fraught. Most of us don\u2019t have much space to spare, let alone weights or props to replicate the gym (or a steam room or a woman arguing on her phone while jogging on a treadmill next to you). But even for those of us committed to being deeply unambitious during this period, exercise does eventually seem like a good idea, if not just to make up for all the pasta dinners and handfuls of milk chocolate \u2013 also to alleviate boredom, or sore backs from sitting cross-legged on the couch all day, or to introduce some movement beyond padding in slippers a few feet from the bedroom to a makeshift standing desk (a laptop propped up on a cupboard), or to give the illusion of some form of routine.</p> <p>Even though every form of exercise, from pilates to ecstatic dance, is being offered in online workouts, and in many cases for free, yoga seems to have risen to the top. It doesn\u2019t require any fancy accessories \u2013 you don\u2019t even need a mat \u2013 and there\u2019s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety.</p> <p>Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child\u2019s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one\u2019s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (\u201cfocus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best\u201d). Some of the classes can be done in bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282/0_0_2483_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she\u2019s not: she isn\u2019t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She\u2019s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there\u2019s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun \u2013 with her Texan \u201chowdy\u201d \u2013 or get a little spiritual and write on her website that \u201cYoga is really the art of waking up\u201d.</p> <p>Right now, while we are stuck \u2013 in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces \u2013 yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn\u2019t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she\u2019s become the woman of the hour.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail \u2013 which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypx4dy/the-inventor-of-the-chilis-baby-back-ribs-song-has-never-eaten-their-ribs\" title=\"\">\u201cbaby back ribs\u201d jingle</a> \u2013 Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call.</p> <p>On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. \u201cIt\u2019s best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cMy boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He\u2019s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden \u2026 Oh come on, buddy!\u201d \u2013 she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. \u201cYou have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you\u2019re in the Groundhog Day movie.\u201d</p> <p>Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor \u2013 among her early roles was a cameo as \u201ccute female student\u201d in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights \u2013 she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/13/fitness-retro-workouts\" title=\"\">Jane Fonda\u2019s</a> classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee\u2019s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun.</p> <p>The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos.</p> <p>\u201cI had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything \u2013 it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you\u2019re a spiritual person,\u201d Mishler told me. \u201cA daily practice that can be medicinal \u2013 you could roll out the mat if you\u2019re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There\u2019s the fear of looking as if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they\u2019re expensive and they require commitment.</p> <p>Mishler\u2019s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren\u2019t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space \u2013 Mishler did her workout in a living room \u2013 the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens.</p> <p>While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn\u2019t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn\u2019t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision \u2013 a strategy, even though she hates that word \u2013 to make her the yoga girl next door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c/0_157_816_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"yoga with adriene - posing with benji the dog - from official website\" width=\"500\" height=\"225\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yoga teacher Adriene Mishler with her dog, Benji.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoga With Adriene/Find What Feels Good</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. \u201cHe is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it\u2019s a super-produced video,\u201d she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. \u201cBenji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that\u2019s too heavy of a word. We\u2019re here together and he helps set the tone.\u201d</p> <p>As Mishler was crafting the channel\u2019s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe\u2019s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler\u2019s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love.</p> <p>The YouTube channel wasn\u2019t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler\u2019s videos aren\u2019t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone.</p> <p>For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga \u2013 Mishler\u2019s mother is Mexican \u2013 scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations.</p> <p>On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: \u201cI am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.\u201d And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting:</p> <p><em>Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise,</em><br><em>To continue, and awaken.</em><br><em>To slowly nod with forgiveness,</em><br><em>Squint the eyes \u2013</em><br><em>Just a bit,</em><br><em>And whisper,</em><br><em>I got this.</em></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it \u2013 along with all the other misfits who weren\u2019t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey \u2013 and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn\u2019t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio.</p> <p>In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn\u2019t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended.</p> <p>On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It\u2019s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler\u2019s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals\" title=\"\">my bulldog, Joan</a>, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.)</p> <p>Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I\u2019ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. \u201cGetting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it\u2019s been incredible and unexpected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt honestly feels like I\u2019ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!\u201d Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world\u2019s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust \u2013 the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/05/its-genuine-you-know-why-the-online-influencer-industry-is-going-authentic\" title=\"\">an influencer</a> in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves \u2013 Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber.</p> <p>Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, \u201ca tight race between anything that has \u2018anxiety\u2019 in the title and also the yoga for weight loss\u201d. She feels weird about that, she says. \u201cI do not teach yoga for weight loss, that\u2019s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,\u201d she said, sounding a little defensive. \u201cI know there is integrity in the content,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what\u2019s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene\u2019s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They\u2019ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who\u2019ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen.</p> <p>What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we\u2019re let out, and for Mishler, it\u2019s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: \u201cThe process is the candy.

Trump does not see the 2020 election as being a referendum on his handling of the pandemic, he said.</p> <h2><strong>China\u2019s Forbidden City will reopen on Friday</strong></h2> <p>Three months after it closed due to the coronavirus crisis, Beijing\u2019s sprawling Forbidden City will reopen, in the latest signal that the country has brought the disease under control. The imperial palace sitting across Tiananmen Square was shut down on 25 January as authorities closed tourist attractions and took other extraordinary measures to contain the virus, including locking down an entire province.</p> <h2><strong>Japan expected to extend state of emergency by a month</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s government is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency for another month, after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201csevere\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>US drug trial shows \u2018clear cut\u2019 effect, says top medic</strong></h2> <p>While a Chinese trial demonstrated no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d to administering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/remdesivir-coronavirus-drug-experimental?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">antiviral drug remdesivir</a> to Covid-19 patients, a separate trial in the US shows a \u201cclear-cut\u201d effect, according to the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci.</p> <h2><strong>Police called after New York funeral home stores bodies in trucks</strong></h2> <p>Police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said. Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official.</p> <h2><strong>More cases of rare syndrome in children</strong></h2> <p>Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/more-cases-of-rare-syndrome-in-children-reported-globally\">rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children</a> that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa\u2019s virus cases jump past 5,000 after highest daily rise</strong></h2> <p>The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa surged past the 5,000 mark on Thursday after it saw the largest single-day jump to date, health ministry figures showed. A total of 354 new cases were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 5,350, and the number of fatalities spiked by 10 to 103.</p>",

She wears a different one almost every day, tied in a variety of styles, a move that has spawned her scarves their own online fanbase.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/deborahbirxscarves/?hl=en\">@deborahbirxscarves</a> Instagram page, created by Texas resident Victoria Strout, now has more than 31,000 followers.</p> \n<p>Strout, who works at a footage and music licensing company, said she hopes the account provides a \u201cbrain break\u201d for people dealing with nonstop Covid-19 coverage, as well as a bipartisan celebration of Dr Birx, who has had a distinguished three-decade-long career focused on HIV/AIDS, vaccine research, and global health.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of people that admire Dr Birx and also like scarves,\u201d Strout said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of created its own little community, which has been really fun and something I absolutely didn\u2019t expect.\u201d</p> \n<p>One follower of the account suggested Birx was using the scarves as a face mask as soon as she left the White House podium, another implored her to teach the world her scarf-tying technique.</p> \n<p>There may also have been a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dr-birxs-scarves-are-the-surprise-hit-of-coronavirus-briefings-11587742093\">Birx scarf bump</a>,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported, with one site, Vestiaire Collective, which sells second-hand clothes, reporting a 1,148% increase in the sale of Herm\u00e8s scarves from the same period last year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_WCehJJgGo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Lady Hale, the president of the British supreme court, favours brooches. She famously wore a giant jewelled spider the day she ruled that UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/28/lady-hale-spider-brooch-launches-global-trend\">\u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court Ruth Bader-Ginsberg has her dissent collar. <br><br>Her Majesty the queen, may once have used a brooch to express one\u2019s distaste for Donald Trump, her love of Obama and her approval of Canada. She may even have worn a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jun/21/queens-hat-alludes-to-brexit\">pro-European Union hat</a>.<br><br>Strangely, Dr Birx has not had much time to comment on the meaning behind her scarves. We know that one, an Afework Tekle art silk scarf from Ethiopia, was a gift from a colleague. Another, also Herm\u00e8s, costs around US$700. Some, like one called Eagle and another called Daughters of the American Revolution, are patriotic.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the scarf featuring a cherry blossom motif, which may or may not be a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/aug/26/braindead-the-absurd-new-thriller-that-will-make-your-head-explode\">BrainDead</a>, a TV show in which aliens living in Washington\u2019s cherry trees take over the minds of politicians. It seems likelier that Dr Birx had the Northern Hemisphere spring on her mind \u2013 but who knows?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-0XWcOpZa_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Pioneering Australian scientist Robert May, whose work in biology led to the development of chaos theory, has died at age 84.</p> <p>Known as one of Australia\u2019s most accomplished scientists, he served as the chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, was president of the Royal Society, and was made a lord in 2001.</p> <p>Born in Sydney on 8 January 1936, May\u2019s work was influential in biology, zoology, epidemiology, physics and public policy. More recently, he applied scientific principles to economics and modelled the cause of the 2008 global financial crisis.</p> <p>On Wednesday, his friends and colleagues paid tribute to a man who they said was a gifted polymath and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ben_Sheldon_EGI/status/1255247538007027715\">\u201ctrue giant\u201d among scientists</a>.</p> <p>Professor Ben Sheldon, the head of Oxford\u2019s department of zoology, said May\u2019s work had \u201cchanged entire fields\u201d of science.</p> <p>The current president of the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan, said May was \u201can extraordinary man\u201d who \u201cdrove great change in every domain he committed his talents to\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBob was a natural communicator and used every available avenue to share his message that science and reason should lie at the heart of society, and he did so with a fervent pursuit that resonates with those of the society\u2019s founding members.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Joss Bland-Hawthorn, the director of the Sydney Institute for Astronomy, said May\u2019s death was a \u201ca great loss for Australian research.\u201d</p> <p>Bland-Hawthorn first met May at the University of Sydney in the early 2000s and the two frequently had dinner together as fellows at Merton College, Oxford.</p> <p>\u201cHis career, in simple terms was getting to the bottom of what makes things complicated,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t go for titles very much. He was Lord May, Baron of Oxford but he was very unpretentious. Quite a lot of my stories about him are quite rude, in fact. He used to swear a lot.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me one night at dinner that he was the first person in the history of the Royal Society to get a swear word in the minutes. He said not even Isaac Newton achieved that.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Benjamin Pope, an Australian astrophysicist and student at Oxford from 2013 to 2017, said May was a role model, and meeting him was a highlight of his university career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9402211d4e913d46559dbd530f0c0a25109f5acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9402211d4e913d46559dbd530f0c0a25109f5acd/0_0_597_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Australian astrophysicist Benjamin Pope (L) meeting Robert May in 2015 at Oxford.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian astrophysicist Benjamin Pope (L) meeting Robert May in 2015 at Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Pope</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI became aware of his achievements almost as soon as I learnt anything about physics in university,\u201d Pope told Guardian Australia. \u201cMy first contact with computer programming was at the University of Sydney, in first year physics, where the example is to recreate Robert May\u2019s experiment with the bifurcation diagram and the logistic map.</p> <p>\u201cHis bifurcation diagram is one of the iconic diagrams in physics,\u201d he said. \u201c[And] he made what was between three or four independent discoveries that lead to chaos theory. You might have heard of the butterfly effect \u2026 May\u2019s is probably the other foundational, computational model of chaos.\u201d</p> <p>May attended Sydney Boys High School and the University of Sydney, where he completed a PhD in superconductivity.</p> <p>Between 1995 and 2000 he was the chief scientific adviser to the UK government, was knighted in 1996, and was president of the Royal Society between 2000 and 2005.</p> <p>In 2007, he won the Copley Medal, the Royal Society\u2019s most prestigious prize, previously won by Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin and Dorothy Hodgkin among others.</p> <p>Pope said he had always admired May for his interest in political and environmental issues.</p> <p>\u201cHe contributed not only to theoretical physics, but also to very applied knowledge, advising governments about serious issues of public policy,\u201d he said. \u201cRobert May is a great example of how a scientist can contribute to all those different spheres in that way.\u201d</p> <p>Pope said he met May in 2015 at a student dinner he helped organise, where May was a keynote speaker.</p> <p>\u201cHe knew everything about economics, politics, philosophy and mathematics. He was garrulous, he had this deep, Australian-accented voice which was quite rare for a baron.</p> <p>\u201cHe really showed he cared about people, he had a social conscience,\u201d Pope said. \u201cIt was really a high point of my whole physics degree in England to get to meet my role model and to have dinner with him.\u201d</p> <p>May was first elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1971, and his other prizes include the Craaford prize, the Blue Planet prize, and the Balzan prize.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 April and 18 June 2020. An earlier version incorrectly said Isaac Newton won the Copley prize. This article was further amended because Robert May was born in 1936, not 1938. This has been corrected.</p>",

A draft report is due in June and the final report in October.</p> <p>Ley has not indicated what, if any, changes to laws are under consideration, but the government has emphasised a desire to reduce the amount of bureaucracy for companies applying for environmental approval for large projects.</p> <p>Australia has the highest rate of mammalian extinction in the world and a poor track record in taking steps such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/06/australia-has-1800-threatened-species-but-has-not-listed-critical-habitat-in-10-years\">registering critical habitat </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/20/fantasy-documents-recovery-plans-failing-australias-endangered-species\">recovery planning</a> to protect threatened species.</p> <p>Pitt did not specify which sections of the EPBC Act he believed needed reform. \u201cI\u2019ll leave those comments to Sussan,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general terms we have some of the highest environmental standards in the world and they\u2019ll be maintained.\u201d</p> <p>But he said businesses had consistently raised concerns about multiple layers of bureaucracy at state and federal levels and duplication of laws related to environmental assessments.</p> <p>Pitt said Ben Morton, the assistant minister to the prime minister and cabinet, was examining \u201cred and green tape\u201d and \u201chaving discussions around the potential for bilateral agreements between the commonwealth and states\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a practical, commonsense sort of guy,\u201d Pitt said. \u201cIf you have an approval for a specific element which is exactly the same between the two levels of government, one would assume that you should be able to get that approval from both levels with the one application.\u201d</p> <p>At present, there are bilateral assessment agreements that allow proponents to prepare a single set of documentation for decision-makers at a state and federal level for some parts of the environmental assessment process.</p> <p>But a recent <a href=\"https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/current/resources/draft/resources-draft.pdf\">draft productivity commission report</a> on regulation of the resources sector states that developers continue to call for bilateral approval agreements, which would see state and territory decision-makers responsible for decisions under the EPBC Act, rather than the federal environment minister.</p> <p>Pitt did not identify specific reforms he thought were necessary in this area and said he was \u201cwaiting for the outcomes of the review\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/12/keith-pitt-on-nuclear-power-self-styled-experts-and-how-canberra-crushes-free-thinking\">Keith Pitt on nuclear power, self-styled experts and how Canberra crushes free thinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cameron Holley, a professor of law at the University of New South Wales, said Australia\u2019s environmental laws were quite strong on paper when it came to protecting matters of national environmental significance. But he added: \u201cIt comes down to implementation. The <a href=\"https://soe.environment.gov.au/\">state-of-the-environment report</a> is a good place to start and the trends are not good.

The court noted that \u201cat most\u201d 39 non-citizens had registered to vote in Kansas over the last 19 years. Many of those cases, the court be explained by administrative error, and did not justify the burden placed on 30,000 voters. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1255520426798862339\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whoa!
