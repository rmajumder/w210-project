However, with 84% of today\u2019s 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister <strong>Jaime Ma\u00f1alich</strong> has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the \u201cbattle for Santiago\u201d.</p> \n  <p>According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive.</p> \n  <p>Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases.</p> \n  <p>But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its \u201cdynamic\u201d approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns.</p> \n  <p>Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest population centre \u2013 where cases are currently far lower than in the capital.</p> \n  <p>Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify \u201cimmunity\u201d. A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:49:32.198Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb3011f8f08597eeb1b7403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:42:03.149Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist <strong>Thorolfur Gudnason</strong> has said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland.

That suggests that the virus was already being transmitted extensively around the globe from early on in the epidemic. </p> \n  <p>Balloux said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected.</p> \n   <p>So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Balloux said the 198 small genetic changes, or mutations, that the study identified appeared to have independently occurred more than once. </p> \n  <p>These may hold clues to how the virus is adapting and help in efforts to develop drugs and vaccines. Ballouz explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A major challenge to defeating viruses is that a vaccine or drug might no longer be effective if the virus has mutated. </p> \n   <p>If we focus our efforts on parts of the virus that are less likely to mutate, we have a better chance of developing drugs that will be effective in the long run.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UCL team\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, confirm that the virus emerged in late 2019, Balloux said, before quickly spreading across the globe. </p> \n  <p>The study was not able to confirm the exact starting point or location. </p> \n  <p>A study by <strong>French scientists</strong> published earlier this week found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/french-hospital-discovers-covid-19-case-december-retested\">a man there was infected with Covid-19 as early as 27 December</a>, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. <br></p> \n  <p> The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said the French case was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and urged countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/who-seeks-early-coronavirus-cases-as-merkel-warns-over-german-lockdown\">investigate any other early suspicious cases</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2913a8f084fb5ab57d176\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:33:23.726Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Twitter</strong> said it would tackle the spread of damaging conspiracy theories linking mobile phone technology and coronavirus with a prompt to direct people searching for 5G to British government-verified information. </p> \n  <p>The theory, which has spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecoms masts and abuse directed at engineers in <strong>Britain</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it is completely untrue. </p> \n  <p>Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and Covid-19, and include a link to a government website with credible, factual and verified information in relation to 5G. </p> \n  <p>Katy Minshall, Twitter UK\u2019s head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur partnerships throughout this pandemic have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant and useful for them,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c/0_0_5568_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burned down mobile phone mast in London.

  "<p>People with mental health problems are ending up in crisis and at higher risk of suicide because they cannot get their usual help from the NHS during the lockdown, a leading charity has warned.</p> \n<p>Those struggling with serious conditions have found it hard to cope because their appointments have been cancelled and they have had trouble getting support from their GP, the mental health charity Mind said. The lack of care increased the danger of them self-harming, it said.</p> \n<p>One in four people who have tried to access help to deal with mental health issues in the past two weeks have not been able to do so, the Mind survey found. Some reported being turned away by mental health crisis teams that support people who may be suicidal, while others said they could not get in touch with their local community mental health team.</p> \n<p>The findings show the impact of the huge changes NHS services have made in recent weeks, especially the halting of most face-to-face contact with outpatients to reduce the risk to staff and patients of coronavirus infections.</p> \n<p>The survey comes amid growing fear that the unprecedented restrictions on people\u2019s movements, and consequent isolation from family and friends, will lead to a sharp rise in anxiety and depression, especially for those who already have a psychological condition.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76ecb2e1-d843-41f6-8e05-8151306c4429\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WM0gHwIjlUk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Paul Farmer, Mind\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cA vast number of us have seen our mental health deteriorate during the coronavirus crisis. It is therefore deeply concerning that people are struggling to get the help that they urgently need. Evidence shows that when people do not get support early enough, they end up in crisis. </p> \n<p>\u201cPeople with mental health problems have been hit hard by the current situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are particularly worried that some are being discharged too early from hospital, while others have been left languishing on mental health wards because of the current limited availability of community support. Being sent home at the wrong time can delay recovery and, at worst, puts people at high risk of suicide.\u201d </p> \n<p>People with acute mental health needs \u201cmust not be forgotten\u201d as a result of the NHS transformation to prioritise Covid-19 patients, Farmer said.</p> \n<p>The results are based on Mind\u2019s survey of 5,565 people with direct experience of mental health problems, of whom 3,895 had used mental health services.

I contacted the crisis team and they said the same.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another said: \u201cI have schizoaffective disorder and have a fantastic support team. My community psychiatric nurse, support worker and GP have all pulled out of my care. I can only access them on the phone for very short periods.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: \u201cIt is worrying that large numbers of people with mental health difficulties are not able to get help at this time. It\u2019s really important that mental health services stay open for business as much as possible, but with proper protection for both staff and patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cWarnings that the pandemic may increase the number of people who tragically die by suicide also need to be taken seriously. It is not inevitable if we put in place the right support for people who feel suicidal, or who are at high risk of losing their lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national director for mental health, said people who needed help should seek it from NHS services.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe NHS is pulling out all the stops to respond to the biggest global health threat in a century, while also ensuring people can still safely access the mental health services they need, so our message to anyone experiencing poor mental health is: the NHS is here for you, please help us help you, and come forward for the care you need.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>Leader of the opposition has always been one of the toughest jobs in politics and Keir Starmer has come to it in exceptionally tricky circumstances. His party has been out of government for a decade. Labour is united in wanting to set factional differences aside but without agreement on how to do it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is enjoying a prolonged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/happiness-increasing-boris-johnson-coronavirus\" title=\"\">honeymoon in opinion polls</a>. Partly that reflects natural gravitation of support to incumbents in a national crisis. Mr Johnson\u2019s critics might complain that his credentials as a reliable leader are unearned, but the complaint itself is unlikely to change voters\u2019 minds.</p> <p>Sir Keir\u2019s challenge is to assert the truth about government failings without appearing to undermine its pandemic response with excessive partisanship. That is the balance he struck in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/pmqs-verdict-floundering-johnson-meets-calm-and-focused-starmer\" title=\"\">first interrogation of Mr Johnson in parliament</a> on Wednesday. The questions were well calibrated to dismantle Downing Street\u2019s claim that the UK\u2019s handling of the coronavirus has been a success. It has not, as the grim death toll \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\" title=\"\">the highest in Europe</a> \u2013 seems to indicate. Sir Keir\u2019s background as a barrister equips him well to build a case and present it in a way that discomforts the other side. Mr Johnson\u2019s typically blustering responses sounded doubly vacuous in a Commons hushed by the requirements of physical distancing.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the prime minister prefers to make announcements by televised address, and the Labour leader is right to demand that future policy changes be presented to parliament first. Mr Johnson is in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/johnson-avoiding-scrutiny-cancelled-appearances-says-senior-mp\" title=\"\">habit of evading such scrutiny</a> and is unlikely to relish routine questioning from a rigorous adversary. But competence across the despatch box is only a small part of the project to persuade voters that the leader of the opposition is a potential prime minister. Most of that task is behind closed doors. It is the strategic mission to develop a clear argument about what is wrong with the country and a distinctive prescription for making it better.</p> <p>The vital ingredient is optimism. Oppositions win elections when people gamble on change. It is not sufficient to convince voters that the incumbent has flaws. By extension, sitting governments cannot expect public gratitude for their achievements when oppositions have a more compelling account of what should come next. The Tory party is haunted by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/26/guardian190-labour-victory-1945\" title=\"\">defeat in 1945</a>, when national rejoicing at victory in the second world war failed to translate into votes for Winston Churchill.</p> <p>Military analogies are overused in the current crisis, but that postwar poll is not an unrealistic model for Labour. The job of reconstruction required after the pandemic will be as vast. That task should have a clear ethical blueprint, incorporating longer-standing social and economic challenges, just as the establishment of the NHS in the 1940s spoke to legacy demands of the pre-war years. Labour has an opportunity to develop the equivalent vision for the 2020s, for example, by combining changes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\" title=\"\">demanded by the climate emergency</a> with reforms to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity.</p> <p>That is a heavy intellectual burden when the party also has an electoral mountain to climb, but the summit will not be reached with smaller-scale ambition. A trap for Sir Keir is to think he can advance by tactical increments, probing weaknesses in Mr Johnson\u2019s position, chipping away at the Tories\u2019 lead. Politics affords few second chances and the Labour leader\u2019s audition with the electorate has begun already. There are many more questions than answers about his priorities, and his vision. It is still very early in the electoral cycle. No one expects to see a fully-formed government-in-waiting yet. But there will come a time when voters demand to know what the opposition stands for, besides criticising the Tories. If Labour is to build something worth showing at that moment, the foundations need laying now.</p>",
  "<p>The idea of the NHS tracing app is to enable smartphones to track users and tell them whether they interacted with someone who had Covid-19. Yet this will work only if large proportions of the population download the app. No matter how smart a solution may appear, mass consent is required. That will not be easy. Ministers and officials have failed to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2020/05/05/uk_coronavirus_app/\" title=\"\">address</a> the trade-offs between health and privacy by being ambiguous about the app\u2019s safeguards.</p> <p>Instead of offering cast-iron guarantees about the length of time for which data would be held; who can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EinsteinsAttic/status/1257589832336969736?s=20\" title=\"\">access</a> it; and the level of <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/security-behind-nhs-contact-tracing-app\" title=\"\">anonymity</a> afforded, we have had opacity and obfuscation. It is true that we are dealing with uncertainties. But without absolute clarity about privacy the public is unlikely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\" title=\"\">take up the app</a> with the appropriate gusto.</p> <p>The NHS and the health secretary Matt Hancock are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/05/uk-racing-to-improve-contact-tracing-apps-privacy-safeguards\" title=\"\">racing to fix</a> these problems so that the app can be rolled out. Time is of the essence, as digital contact tracing will be required so that the lockdown can be eased. Mr Hancock\u2019s problem has been exacerbated because the NHS app is incompatible with a new interfacing software, or API, being developed by Google and Apple.</p> <p>The difference is a fundamental one. The NHS in England wants to pool the information it collects in a single database. The tech giants aim to decentralise the Covid-19 data across devices. The NHS app was designed when testing was rare in the UK and is built for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52532435\" title=\"\">self-diagnosis</a>. Users tell the app if they are displaying symptoms and a centralised database records which phones are being sent alerts and roughly where they are. This is a protection against pranksters aiming to deceive the system. The Google/Apple API <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/apple-and-google-to-prevent-contact-tracing-apps-from-tracking-your-location/\" title=\"\">relies on public health systems</a> and mass testing. Silicon Valley, it seems, wants only medically endorsed results as inputs \u2013 once you have good data there\u2019s no need for the discipline of a panopticon.</p> <p>Apple and Google could allow third-party developers like the NHS access to the Bluetooth signals smartphones have received in the last two weeks. The tech giants at present only permit developers to ask if a signal has been heard and respond yes or no. They do not allow them to scan a phone\u2019s collected signals. Permitting the NHS to do this, the digital behemoths fear, would lead to similar demands from totalitarian regimes interested in the company people keep beyond their Covid-19 status. <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/we-will-remember-french-minister-threatens-apple-over-privacy-stance\" title=\"\">European nations</a> have been infuriated by this reasoning.</p> <p>In England, around 60% of the population needs to download the app to make it work. As Google and Apple <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/\" title=\"\">account</a> for nine out of 10 phones, it may be easier to piggyback on their software. Without their help, apps <a href=\"https://tech.newstatesman.com/coronavirus/australia-centralised-app-will-uk-be-next\" title=\"\">strain</a> to work properly. NHS England was not wrong to chart its own course. But the venture has struggled because of a wider failure to build a \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d system. Even with the level of testing England currently has, Google and Apple\u2019s app would not be the answer now. Ministers have a few weeks to bridge the gap between an English system that might be rendered redundant in the near future and a Californian one which needs a public health system we do not yet have.</p>",

Also today, Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood her government would start to lift restrictions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after the latest data showed coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland fell for the first time, and the Welsh government said it expected a \u201ccareful and cautious approach\u201d to relaxing the lockdown from Westminster.<strong> <br></strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak is preparing to wind down the job retention scheme from July as the government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures.</strong> A decision is yet to be made, but the Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration.</li> \n   <li><strong>The official UK coronavirus death toll passed 30,000 as another 649 fatalities were recorded.</strong> The new total of 30,076 represents the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died, so the true number will be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>Heathrow airport is to begin temperature screening of passengers in an effort to minimise transmission across borders.</strong> The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes that could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports, including cameras in immigration halls.</li> \n   <li><strong>No 10 scaled down the scope of the PM\u2019s new \u201c200,000 tests per day\u201d target as the government missed its 100,000 daily tests goal for a fourth day running.</strong> The PM\u2019s spokesman said that when Johnson set the new testing target for the end of May during PMQs, he had been referring to testing capacity. Later, Robert Jenrick told the daily press briefing that 69,463 tests were carried out yesterday.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Rising levels of racism towards people of east Asian heritage have left many feeling too scared to venture out when the lockdown is eventually lifted, research suggests. </strong>The survey by Prof Binna Kandola found that just over half of respondents had experienced an increase in discrimination since the pandemic began, with Chinese people reporting being coughed at, attacked, mocked and abused. Kandola said society had an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour once the lockdown is eased.</li> \n   <li><strong>The tube will only be able to run at 20% capacity to allow for physical distancing, Sadiq Khan said.</strong> The mayor of London said the transport system could not operate at pre-crisis levels while maintaining physical distancing at all times, so capacity would have to be reduced to 13-20% and the carrying capacity of double-decker buses could be reduced from 85 to 15 passengers. He argued that everyone in London who could work from home would have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. </li> \n   <li><strong>And police decided not to take action against Prof Neil Ferguson after he breached lockdown rules.</strong> The scientist resigned last night after it emerged that he had broken lockdown restrictions by receiving visits from his lover. This morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was right that he had stepped down and backed any action the police decided to take. However, Scotland Yard said that since Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error of judgment, no further action would be taken.

Some new research from the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that the figure may be much higher than people assume.</p> \n  <p>The researchers looked at data from the coronavirus outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where eventually 80% of passengers and staff were tested. Combining this data with information with data about when people developed symptoms, and modelling showing how the virus would have spread, the team estimated that 72% of people on the ship infected with the virus remained asymptomatic.</p> \n  <p>The research has not been peer-reviewed, but there is a preliminary outline <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/asymp-transmission.html\">here</a>, and a press release <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/almost-75-people-board-diamond-princess-covid-19-may-have-been-asymptomatic\">here</a>. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The research team estimated that 72% of people infected with Covid-19 onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained asymptomatic. For each asymptomatic case, it remained uncertain how infectious they were although they were unlikely to be as infectious as a symptomatic case.</p> \n   <p>Overall, the team estimate that asymptomatic cases were responsible for 11-84% of all infections during the outbreak. Work will be extended with more data (where available) and to other outbreaks, which the team hopes will enable more accurate estimates of the impact of asymptomatic cases on all infections over the coming period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rein Houben from the CMMID, who led the research, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that a substantial number of people infected with the coronavirus are asymptomatic, and there is anecdotal evidence that this group can transmit the virus, However, there are few reliable estimates on the proportion of people with Covid-19 who don\u2019t show symptoms, and their overall contribution to the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>This information is crucial for health policymakers to develop the most effective response strategies, including exiting from lockdowns.

The cabinet will meet, as usual, tomorrow. But the spokesman also said that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that cabinet would meet at the weekend. And he indicated that Cobra, the committee that includes representatives of the devolved administrations, would also meet shortly before the announcement gets made by Boris Johnson on Sunday. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to comment on reports suggesting that the government may abandon its \u201cStay home\u201d slogan at the weekend, replacing it with another message consistent with the lockdown starting to ease.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that, when Boris Johnson set a new testing target in the Commons of 200,000 tests by the end of May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f#block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f\">12.12pm)</a>, the target applied to testing capacity</strong>.

But the spokesman said the actual target referred to by Johnson at PMQs this afternoon just covered capacity, not actual tests. In recent weeks daily capacity for testing almost always been significantly higher than the number of tests actually carried out. The spokesman said the target also covered antibody testing, which looks at whether people have had the virus, as well as the antigen testing, which looks at whether people have the virus. The current figures only cover antigen testing because a reliable antibody test for use at home is not yet available.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Prof Neil Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way.</strong> But he said that others from Imperial College contribute to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The spokesman said that the government wanted Imperial\u2019s \u201cinvaluable work\u201d to continue to be available to it. The spokesman also said that Johnson thought Ferguson had taken the right decision to resign from Sage, and that the social distancing rules were there for a purpose.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Ferguson\u2019s resignation exposed double standards over the social distancing rules.</strong> There have been claims that Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, and Johnson himself have both broken these rules, because <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/10/robert-jenrick-pressure-quit-claim-mansion-family-home-called/\">Jenrick left London with his family to stay in a home in the country</a>, and Johnson and his fiancee stayed at Chequers after Johnson come out of hospital. The spokesman said that Jenrick was just travelling to rejoin his family, and that Johnson went to Chequers on the advice of his doctors.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that when Johnson spoke at PMQs about a a \u201cpalpable improvement\u201d in care homes, he was referring to death rates falling.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jenrick, the housing secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said.</strong> Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, and Nikki Kanani, the medical director of NHS England, will also be appearing.

But, of course, there is no chance of PMQs resuming its shouting match status any time soon (one of the few benefits of this ghastly crisis) and instead Boris Johnson was left looking exposed and diminished as he faced Sir Keir Starmer for the first time.</p> \n  <p>As had been widely expected, Starmer was impressive \u2013 focused, calm, and rational. His interventions today were crisper than in his previous two outings (probably an improvement), and he always ended with a very direct question, simple yet incriminating. No doubt he could manage in a rowdy Commons, but the courtroom silence seems to suit him better, and the overall impression left by the encounter was of a rather floundering prime minister struggling to respond to a full-on grown-up channelling the questions a critical nation wants answering.</p> \n  <p>Another difficulty for the PM in Zoom PMQs is that he can\u2019t pick the brains of the specialist minister sitting alongside him. Prime ministers are normally more reliant on prompts from colleagues at PMQs than people realise, and Johnson looked particular in need of verbal assistance from Matt Hancock when asked about PPE.</p> \n  <p>In normal PMQs a struggling PM would resort to sloganising, and hope the backbench noise machine might do the rest, but with that no longer an option it did seem as if Johnson was more reliant on making points of substance. He could not answer Starmer\u2019s questions easily (they were designed to be hard to answer \u2013 at least, hard to answer without admitting gross negligence), but he did show some leg on a public inquiry, and provide a relatively revealing answer about why he is making the lockdown announcement on Sunday.</p> \n  <p>Starmer will be pleased with how the exchanges went. But if the new format militates against sloganising, then that is potentially a problem for the leader of the opposition too. At his first PMQs against Tony Blair, David Cameron came out with the memorable line about <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504993/You-were-the-future-once.html\">how Blair \u201cwas the future once\u201d</a> \u2013 a soundbite and a slogan, but a good one, that defined Cameron successfully. A week today, we will remember that Starmer looked the part at his first PMQs, but we are less likely to remember what he actually said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd/0_110_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T15:25:22.222Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a8438f0898654cef9874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:06:38.336Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936/0_0_3500_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a69e8f0898654cef9856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:00:50.043Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The proportion of all Scottish coronavirus deaths happening in care homes rose to 59% last week, up from 52% the week before, adding to the sense of crisis in the sector.</p> \n  <p><strong> National Records of Scotland</strong>, the government agency, said that deaths overall from Covid-19 had declined week on week for the first time since the outbreak began, with 523 deaths relating to the virus recorded in the week ending 3 May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad#block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad\">12.22.</a>).</p> \n  <p>That was a fall of 135 from the previous week, with the data including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, homes and other places.

She told PA that racist behaviour and comments are \u201cjust a day-to-day reality for Chinese people and the pandemic has made it a lot worse\u201d. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s escalated, it\u2019s immediately more threatening.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m a professional woman, I\u2019m 41 years old, I work in the City of London.

And double decker buses could end up carrying just 15 passengers, he says.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s an inescapable fact that no mass transport system of the scale we have in London can operate at full capacity while maintaining social distancing at all times. Even with Tube ridership standing at just five per cent at the moment, there are times when passengers struggle to keep their distance. </p> \n   <p>This means that if the social distancing requirements remain in place, the total carrying capacity of the Tube will have to be reduced to between 13 to 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels \u2013 even with close to 100 per cent of trains running. We will also need to have a fundamentally different approach to operating stations, with strict queuing systems to limit the number of people who can access the network at any one time. Certain major stations where TfL and National Rail services interchange are likely to present the biggest challenge.</p> \n   <p>Likewise, there will need to be big changes to how we run the bus network. The carrying capacity of double decker buses could be reduced from 85 passengers to just 15. During the lockdown, we have been encouraging social distance queuing at some of our 21,500 bus stops by putting markings on the pavement. But this system will not be possible to maintain when passenger numbers start to increase. We are looking at possible solutions and have already started working with London boroughs to widen pavement space in key locations to alleviate the pressure. However, it will still be impossible to maintain social distance if passenger numbers increase even modestly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One consequence of this, Khan argues, is that in London \u201ceveryone who can work from home will have to be told to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb293048f0898654cef96e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:42:27.872Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chinese in Britain 'too scared to venture out alone' amid rising levels of anti-Asian racism</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising levels of racist abuse that forced people of Chinese heritage to withdraw from UK society before the lockdown are likely to escalate when it lifts, an academic has warned.</p> \n  <p>Chinese people have been coughed at, attacked and told to \u201cgo back home\u201d, according to research led by Prof Binna Kandola. Reported experiences ranged from casual jokes to violent attacks and death threats, with people left too frightened to venture out alone and children ridiculed by their peers, 29 in-depth interviews with people of east Asian heritage revealed.</p> \n  <p>Kandola told the PA news agency that some people who have lived in the UK their whole life are questioning \u201cwhether people of Chinese heritage will ever be accepted as British\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Just over half of the 412 people surveyed said they had experienced an increase in discrimination during the Covid-19 outbreak. Three in 10 said they had witnessed or experienced discrimination at work, while 37% said they had experienced this outside the office. </p> \n  <p>One woman, an NHS doctor who works in her local hospital\u2019s respiratory unit, said she has stopped her daily morning jog because of the abuse. Another family withdrew their four-year-old boy from a football club after other parents told their children not to stand close to him. One respondent told Kandola:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nearly every British-born Chinese person I\u2019ve spoken to is genuinely very shocked about what has happened. They are British, have lived all their lives in Britain and yet they feel like outsiders now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Prof Kandola said society has an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour when the UK eases lockdown measures. Condemnation from leading politicians and the media would help those affected feel like they are being listened to, he said, while also suggesting local authorities direct victims of abuse to helplines or support groups. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s a role for all of us to keep our eyes and ears open about what is going on around us and, when we see it, to intervene.</p> \n   <p>We are actually better than this.

And he started by escalating the criticism of Prof Neil Ferguson, suggesting there could be a case for the police getting involved.</p> \n  <p>Asked by the presenter <strong>Kay Burley</strong> if Ferguson should be prosecuted for breaking the lockdown rules, Hancock replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can imagine what my views are.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a matter for the police. As a government minister, I\u2019m not allowed to get involved in the operational decisions of police matters. But I think that the social distancing rules are very important and should be followed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burley said that Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who resigned after it emerged she had visited her second home, had been issued with a warning by the police. Asked if he approved of what the police did in that situation, Hancock said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Absolutely I back the police. I back the Scottish police, I would back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right. It\u2019s always been like that.</p> \n   <p>And that\u2019s why, even though I\u2019ve got a view as to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make their decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision. But I think he took the right decision to resign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock also said he was speechless when he heard what Ferguson had done. In his statement to the Daily Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/\">which broke the story</a>, Ferguson justified his decision to meet a lover who lived in another household on the grounds that he was acting on the basis that he was immune, because he had had coronavirus. But Hancock said that he had also had coronavirus and that he has specifically asked the chief medical officer if that meant he was at lower risk. Hancock said he had been told he still had to observe the social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>Hancock could easily have dodged Burley\u2019s questions about police involvement, but he chose to answer in a way that clearly implied this was a case where the police might want to get involved.</p> \n  <p>However, in doing so, Hancock also suggested he is not fully familiar with the regulations imposing the lockdown rules on England - the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which Hancock himself introduced. These say that during the emergency period \u201cno person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But, according to the Telegraph story, Ferguson did not leave him house to see his lover. She came to visit him. There might be grounds for saying that she has broken the regulations, but not Ferguson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e/240_3_1487_892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sky news</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:24:52.239Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb27b6e8f085c470051f0da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T09:05:05.916Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday Downing Street told us that Boris Johnson has started taking a daily walk around St James\u2019s Park as part of his lockdown exercise regime.

Lost is the idea that countries do better by working together to solve common problems, even if doing so sometimes means an apparent sacrifice of short-term benefit for the greater good.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always been informed by the expert advice in this.

Yes.</p> \n   <p>The challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests (per day) in February to 120,000 at the end of April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Reminder: this is what the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser<strong> Sir Patrick Vallance</strong> told the Commons Health Select Committee yesterday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I think that probably we, in the early phases, and I\u2019ve said this before, I think if we\u2019d managed to ramp testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial.</p> \n   <p>And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn\u2019t happen.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s clear you need lots of testing for this [but] it\u2019s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s just part of the system that you need to get right. The entire system needs to work properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Brokenshire defended the decision <strong>not to close UK borders</strong> in a bid to stop the virus spreading across the country, after Vallance said most of the coronavirus strains being spread across the UK in March came from people returning from Spain and Italy. Brokenshire said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it is important to note that the scientific advice was very clear that, up to this point in time, placing restrictions at the border would not have had any significant impact on epidemic progression in the UK. </p> \n   <p>Sage looked at this on March 23 - the numbers coming from other countries were estimated to be insignificant compared with domestic cases, comprising around 0.5% of total cases at the time.</p> \n   <p>Since then, obviously, you\u2019ll be more than aware, with all of the issues in the aviation sector, how we\u2019ve seen a reduction in air passengers by around 99% since the start of the outbreak.</p> \n   <p>It is something we will continue to keep under review as we look to the next phase but, at that time, the advice was clear that placing restrictions would not have had any significant impact.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Brokenshire, the security minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Brokenshire, the security minister.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:51:05.259Z\">at 9.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb26a948f085c470051f052\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:45:22.478Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prof Ferguson right to step down, says minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Security Minister <strong>James Brokenshire</strong> has called Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation a \u201cmatter of regret\u201d but an \u201cappropriate course\u201d of action.

  "<p>Ominous warnings have been sounded by the international players\u2019 union that women\u2019s football faces an existential threat. When AFC Fylde disbanded their women\u2019s team last week it was probably the tip of an iceberg \u2013 but how gloomy is the game\u2019s future?</p> <p>Although everyone agrees there will be casualties, opinion is split about the extent of any setback. Alan Naigeon offers his assessment from a position of authority as a managing partner of the agency A&amp;V Sports, which represents players such as Chelsea\u2019s Sam Kerr and Lyon\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or winner Ada Hegerberg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/no-room-for-matildas-pregnancies-as-covid-19-disrupts-planning-says-sam-kerr\">No room for Matildas pregnancies as Covid-19 disrupts planning, says Sam Kerr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy expectation is that we\u2019re going to lose one or two years in the growth of women\u2019s football,\u201d Naigeon says. \u201cThe investment that is going to be made is going to look closer to what it was right before the World Cup, maybe just after, and if that\u2019s the case then we\u2019re lucky.</p> <p>\u201cMy fear is that we go back two, three, four, five years from now, closer to the previous World Cup in 2015, because the clubs are going to be financially struggling and like in every business you usually tend to cut what is not earning you any money.\u201d</p> <p>In England a twin track may emerge. Nine of the 12 Women\u2019s Super League clubs are attached to men\u2019s Premier League sides and one senior club source says: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had that much to start with and we\u2019ve created an environment now where there\u2019s high reputational risk on big men\u2019s clubs over reducing the budget lines of women\u2019s teams. Whatever happens, there will be players that want to play. Women\u2019s football is resilient, women in football are resilient.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fff17956bf6fc586f1714bbcc053dd6df3b73b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fff17956bf6fc586f1714bbcc053dd6df3b73b0/0_42_3045_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City and Chelsea are among the Women\u2019s Super League teams attached to Premier League clubs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City and Chelsea are among the Women\u2019s Super League teams attached to Premier League clubs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clubs that stand to lose most are those without a men\u2019s team alongside them such as the Championship trio Lewes, Coventry United and London City Lionesses. Those attached to a men\u2019s club not ideologically committed to its women\u2019s team and unbothered by reputational damage are also in peril. For every club that falls out, though, another is waiting to take its place.</p> <p>\u201cSome might struggle financially, some might suffer from delayed promotions [because leagues are voided] but, ultimately, if you want to take professional women\u2019s football as a whole \u2013 and not focus on the individual entities that suffer \u2013 then I think it\u2019s still in a very positive space,\u201d says another agent. \u201cIf someone falls out of the WSL, who\u2019s going to replace them? Aston Villa. If someone falls out of the Championship, who\u2019s going to replace them? Southampton.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the longer the uncertainty goes on the more it will start to weigh on the sport. You can lose one or two teams and survive, but you can\u2019t lose half of women\u2019s football.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58cee482d71b21fbd8b50348c67bb24617437af2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58cee482d71b21fbd8b50348c67bb24617437af2/0_214_2837_3399/835.jpg\" alt=\"Dame Heather Rabbatts is upbeat.\" width=\"835\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dame Heather Rabbatts is upbeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such a bleak outcome is unlikely. Dame Heather Rabbatts, a former Football Association director and the founder of the Women\u2019s Sports Group, is convinced the \u201cmomentum behind women\u2019s football will not cease\u201d. She emphasises no sport will be unaffected in the coming weeks and months but wants to ensure the conversation does not \u201ccreate an almost self-fulfilling prophecy about women\u2019s football in a way that we\u2019re not doing about men\u2019s football\u201d.</p> <p>Yet even if the game remains \u201creasonably healthy\u201d at the top, progress appears certain to stall. \u201cIn the longer term that\u2019s not really helping women\u2019s football to stand alone and be it\u2019s own sustainable revenue-generating product,\u201d a club source says.</p> <p>When matches resume may be crucial. On the one hand a lengthy period without competition could prompt players to step away, on the other too swift a return could be detrimental. \u201cThe crunch comes when players are told they can come back to work and teams can\u2019t furlough any more,\u201d the source said. \u201cClubs just won\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p> <p>Naigeon believes many players out of contract this summer will suffer. \u201cStruggling clubs are not going to take any risks so those players are probably not in as high demand and they\u2019re going to struggle for offers on the same level to what they were on, at best.\u201d With contracts at the top likely unaffected, he adds that the differences between leading teams and the rest \u201cwill be accentuated and that\u2019s only going to make the league less interesting\u201d.</p> <p>Opportunities, though, could arise \u2013 at least for some. \u201cOn the men\u2019s side, sponsorship was becoming much more difficult even before this,\u201d a representative of a top WSL club says. \u201cCommercially people will be looking for cheaper options and this is a cheaper option. Companies aren\u2019t going to want to spend hundreds of millions of pounds, but the women\u2019s game is at the start of a journey.\u201d</p> <p>Such optimism is tempered by a source further down the pyramid, however. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they would go for Reading or Bristol City [women\u2019s sides]. Big clubs are in a position of privilege because they have a recognisable brand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reece Land of the Women\u2019s Sports Alliance adds that some lower-league clubs have \u201csponsors asking for money back \u2013 they either want a rebate or a reduction on next season, which will impact budgets\u201d.</p> <p>A game-changer may be the sale of WSL broadcast rights for the 2021-22 season onwards, which the Women\u2019s Sports Group and Rabbatts are working on with the FA. \u201cThat would be a brand-new income stream for women\u2019s football,\u201d another club source says. \u201cWe don\u2019t get any TV money.\u201d</p> <p>Rabbatts says that, for broadcasters, the key is that \u201cthe level of interest in women\u2019s football is still really highly engaged\u201d and she argues that values such as collaboration and passion amplified during the pandemic play to its strengths. \u201cThose are exactly the values in the game, and all of those will strike a very particular resonance, and the attractiveness of women\u2019s football is going to be enhanced. The prediction that women\u2019s football is about to keel over, I fundamentally disagree with it.\u201d</p>",

It served as a hub for festivals and provided a home to leading arts companies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9f7f48f7c02e58f605c65e64aa440ffd0ff5a915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f7f48f7c02e58f605c65e64aa440ffd0ff5a915/0_0_4827_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closure sign is seen on the door of Carriageworks on May 05, 2020 in Sydney, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closure sign on the door of Carriageworks on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The organisation had its income projections for the current financial year trashed as the coronavirus crisis unfurled, with big-ticket events cancelled or suspended. The decision to enter into administration was sealed when the New South Wales government \u2013 which currently does not have an arts minister after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/10/nsw-minister-don-harwin-fined-1000-for-breaching-coronavirus-public-health-order\">the recent resignation of Don Harwin</a> \u2013 declined to guarantee future funding.

The Covid-19 shutdown has come hard on the heels of cuts to Australia Council funding and a summer of bushfires that had an impact on gallery attendance and operations, most notably in Canberra.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/05/carriageworks-administrators-tightlipped-but-expected-to-ask-for-bailout\">Sydney Opera House may take over Carriageworks as calls for state bailout grow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All galleries Australia-wide are closed until further notice.

All I can say is that they were truly horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Government funding accounts for about 25% of the MCA\u2019s budget, says Macgregor. The rest comes from venue hire (including weddings and corporate events), the museum\u2019s retail and caf\u00e9 operations, and philanthropy. Apart from special exhibits, the MCA does not charge an entrance fee.</p> <p>\u201cThat was our much-lauded funding mix,\u201d Macgregor says with an exasperated laugh. \u201cAnd before this crisis, everyone thought that was a great thing. Even the GFC didn\u2019t impact us very much. But this time, 40% of our income vanished overnight. It throws into question the whole orthodoxy of that kind of funding. Those of us who developed really good business models are particularly suffering, much more so than the institutions who get 60, 70, 80% of their funding from government.\u201d</p> <p>The MCA\u2019s philanthropic community has been supportive. \u201cActually, they\u2019ve been fantastic, telling us that they understand we can\u2019t use the money in the way we wanted to but to please spend it to keep the museum going,\u201d Macgregor says, adding that she has ruled out bringing back an admission fee for the MCA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64133c5c13f8006dc9abe8b9e1d401938f4c5d3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64133c5c13f8006dc9abe8b9e1d401938f4c5d3e/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Virtual Vibration\u2019 is is projected onto the facade of the MCA during a media preview for Vivid Sydney in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Virtual Vibration\u2019 is is projected onto the facade of the MCA during a media preview for Vivid Sydney in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it stands, access to the jobkeeper scheme is not an option for Australia\u2019s local council, university or state-owned institutions.</p> <p>\u201cOur permanent full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public,\u201d says Michael Brand, director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. \u201cDuring this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery.\u201d</p> <p>Adelaide\u2019s Art Gallery of South Australia is in a similar position.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can to look after our small number of casuals, some of whom are assisting us to deliver our online programs,\u201d says Rhana Devenport, AGSA\u2019s director, adding that permanent and contract staff had been asked to exhaust all leave entitlements.</p> <p>Like all arts and entertainment enterprises, Australia\u2019s art galleries are keenly awaiting updated advice on social distancing.

[State] borders are going to open again and all those people who normally go overseas and spend money \u2013 something like $6bn \u2013 are going to be here and we want to grab some of that, but the museums are going to have to work together,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cCultural tourists spend three times as much as other tourists, so for the sake of the economy, we need a stimulus package that will allow organisations like ours to reopen.\u201d</p>",

But we will now for the first time have an independent body that will take final and binding decisions on what content stays up and what content is removed.\u201d</p> <p>Rusbridger, who was editor-in-chief of the Guardian from 1995 until 2015, said. \u201cThe oversight board seems to be the first imaginative and bold step by one of the biggest players to find a way of reconciling the need to start imposing some kind of judgment and standards on what is published, while still maintaining the things that are wonderful about social media, and necessary for free speech. I\u2019m impressed by the group of people that has been chosen and the processes that have been put in place.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes, when asked if the independence of the board could stretch to it taking on oversight for other social networks if they requested it, confirmed that it could. \u201cBut I think all the co-chairs would agree with me that in the short term there is an enormous challenge in just dealing with the requests from Facebook and Instagram alone,\u201d he said.</p>",

Might it be that our curve was peaking earlier? We have more people dying in hospital than elsewhere: are there questions about the district general hospital?\u201d</p> \n<p>Chris McEleny, an SNP councillor, has been raising his own concerns. There\u2019s an \u201cangry mood\u201d among local people, he says. \u201cOver the past few decades Inverclyde has always come top of the wrong league tables.\u201d</p> \n<p>He is insistent about the need for localised testing, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">\u2018R\u2019 number</a> compares to other areas, as community transmission information isn\u2019t available at a health board or local authority level.

It also noted that people from the most deprived areas were twice as likely to contact community hubs set up by NHS Scotland to deal with suspected cases.</p> \n<p>The impact on the community has been tangible, says the Rev Fraser Donaldson, of Hope community church in Greenock. \u201cYou can see the stress and worry in people\u2019s faces.

  "<p>Heathrow will start using thermal cameras to carry out temperature checks on passengers within the next fortnight, as it called for common health screening standards around the world for air travellers.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s busiest airport <a href=\"https://mediacentre.heathrow.com/pressrelease/details/81/Brand-News-22/12286\">said</a> it would trial thermal cameras capable of monitoring the temperature of people in the immigration halls, initially in Terminal 2. </p> <p>If successful, it will install the equipment in the departures, connections and staff search areas. Similar technology is in place at many Asian airports, for example at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-screenings-global-travelling-airport\">Singapore Changi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-screenings-global-travelling-airport\">.</a></p> <p>The airport is also trialling ultraviolet lighting to sanitise security trays and contact-free security screening equipment to reduce person-to-person contact.</p> <p>John Holland-Kaye, the Heathrow chief executive, told MPs on the transport select committee that a common international standard for health screening in aviation was crucial to restoring confidence and encouraging people to return to flying.</p> <p>He said: \u201cAviation is the cornerstone of the UK economy, and to restart the economy, the government needs to help restart aviation. The UK has the world\u2019s third-largest aviation sector, offering the platform for the government to take a lead in agreeing a common international standard for aviation health with our main trading partners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"903cc508bda4270c92fa3800f19a63e80b60be05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/903cc508bda4270c92fa3800f19a63e80b60be05/0_15_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's CEO\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, says aviation is key to restarting the UK economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PRU/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis standard is key to minimising transmission of Covid-19 across borders, and the technology we are trialling at Heathrow could be part of the solution.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf we are told that the only solution until we can get a vaccine in 12-18 months\u2019 time is to socially distance in an airport, then tens of thousands of jobs will be cut. We cannot afford to wait that long to get flying again.\u201d</p> <p>Heathrow already carries out temperature checks at departure gates on passengers who are going to countries that require them. It said travellers would experience minimal impact to their journeys and noted that many airlines had been taking passengers\u2019 temperature during the outbreak.</p> <p>Before the Covid-19 crisis, 8o million passengers passed through Heathrow each year. The airport will release numbers for April on Monday that will show a 90% decline from 2019.</p> <p>Patrick Ikhena, the head of travel at comparethemarket.com, said: \u201cIt is likely that, once restrictions are eased, international travel will look quite different for passengers \u2013 at least for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>\u201cThere are likely to be more checks at airports and other major transportation hubs, which could include temperature checks and the requirement to provide evidence that you do not have Covid-19 before embarking on a flight.\u201d</p> <p>He said passengers would need to allow considerably more time to arrive at the airport than before the crisis, and this could lead to a surge in the number of Brits holidaying in the UK.</p> <p>Customer research by comparethemarket has found that only 6% of Britons are considering a long-haul holiday this winter and just 9% are looking at booking a European beach holiday for this summer or autumn, \u201cmost likely due to a combination of strained household budgets and a wariness over travelling overseas\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Sir Frederick Barclay\u2019s nephews sold the Ritz for \u201chalf the market price\u201d after secretly recording conversations between the hotel\u2019s billionaire co-owner and a Saudi investor offering \u00a31.3bn for the London landmark, the high court has heard.</p> <p>Barclay, 85, and his daughter Amanda are suing three of his twin brother Sir David Barclay\u2019s sons - Alistair, Aidan and Howard - and Aidan\u2019s son Andrew over 1,000 conversations secretly recorded over several months.</p> <p>The high court has previously heard that the \u201celaborate system of covert recording\u201d came to light in January when Alistair was filmed on CCTV \u201chandling the bug placed in the conservatory at the Ritz\u201d, where Frederick was known to \u201csmoke a cigar\u201d and hold meetings. </p> <p>At a further preliminary hearing, conducted remotely on Wednesday, Mr Justice Warby heard that the recording of the conversations was \u201ccommercial espionage on a vast scale\u201d.</p> <p>The legal action alleges misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws.</p> <p>The claimants state in documents that there was a second recording device, a wifi bug, supplied by the <a href=\"https://www.quest.co.uk/people/\">private investigations firm Quest Global</a>, which invoiced for 405 hours of time to listen to and transcribe the recordings. </p> <p>The firm is chaired by the former Metropolitan police commissioner John Stevens, who has conducted inquiries into security breaches in Northern Ireland and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.</p> <p>The claimants state that among 94 hours of recordings were discussions about an offer for the Ritz hotel for potentially as much as \u00a31.3bn from the Saudi Arabian-based Sidra Capital.</p> <p>The 114-year-old hotel was sold by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4229896f-3dc7-4e7d-b839-c9b62260cd30\">David\u2019s side of the family in March</a> for significantly less, to Abdulhadi Mana al-Hajri, a Qatari businessman who is the brother-in-law of the Gulf state\u2019s rulers, despite a threat from Frederick and Amanda Barclay of <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/sir-frederick-barclay-threatens-sue-twin-ritz-london-hotel\">legal action if it was sold for less than \u00a31bn</a>.</p> <p>Hefin Rees QC, representing Frederick and Amanda, said in a written submission that the defendants heard \u201cSir Frederick\u2019s conversations with Sidra Capital, which at the time had made an initial offer of some \u00a31.3bn for the acquisition of the Ritz hotel\u201d. He added: \u201cDespite this, the defendants sold the Ritz hotel to another buyer from Qatar at a price that appears to be half the market price. One is left to speculate why.\u201d</p> <p>He said material previously disclosed to his clients \u201creveals beyond doubt that the defendants derived significant financial and commercial advantage from the unlawful use of the recordings\u201d. </p> <p>Rees also argued that the recordings allowed the defendants \u201cto anticipate the claimants\u2019 every move in advance, plan their business strategy around that, including knowing what legal advice the claimants were seeking and getting at this crucial time when their business and personal relationships had broken down, and the respective interests of the claimants and the defendants were in conflict\u201d.</p> <p>Financial pressure on the Barclay brothers\u2019 businesses has prompted the sale of the Ritz and potentially other assets including the Telegraph, the delivery business Yodel and the online retailer Very Group (previously known as Shop Direct and before that Littlewoods).</p> <p>In February, private business and family affairs of David and Frederick Barclay were made public in the most dramatic fashion in a high court action following several years of disagreement over the future of their empire.</p> <p>In December David strengthened his family\u2019s grip on the businesses, appointing Aidan and Howard as \u201cpersons with significant control\u201d of Ellerman Holdings, the holding company for the Barclays\u2019 UK assets. Each was given \u201cmore than 25% but not more than 50% of the share ownership and voting rights\u201d.</p> <p>Frederick and David are no longer beneficiaries of the family trust, and Amanda has been left with a 25% share and no power to block David\u2019s side of the family in any big decisions.</p> <p>At the hearing in February, Heather Rogers QC, representing all five defendants, argued there was \u201ca lot of information that would have been in the possession of my clients \u2026 which they have got completely free of the recordings\u201d.</p> <p>She added that her clients had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to \u201cspread it about before an injunction\u201d was granted, but there was \u201cno evidence of dissemination\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>The Home Office has been accused of interfering with the independence of the judiciary after it emerged that judges were asked to provide written explanations for a rise in the number of detainees released from immigration centres during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>In a letter to the president of the Tribunal, Immigration and Asylum Chamber dated 29 April 2020, the Home Office\u2019s head of appeals, James Stevens, wrote: \u201cThe numbers of those in detention have reduced very significantly since the start of this emergency.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cThe Home Office is somewhat surprised at the level of grants of bail in recent weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Official figures record 1,225 people in detention centres on 1 January and 368 at the latest count \u2013 a reduction of almost three-quarters.</p> <p>Stevens outlined the ways in which the Home Office had responded to the risks coronavirus posed to detainees, before adding: \u201cWhere bail is granted I would ask you to consider whether immigration judges could provide written reasons for this.\u201d Judges are not required by law to do this.</p> <p>Stevens wrote: \u201cWhile I realise this is not a requirement under the procedure rules, it would assist the Home Office to fully understand the reasons why bail has been granted.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office is supposed to detain only those it can deport imminently, and its ability to do this has been drastically reduced due to flights being grounded. </p> <p>There have been three confirmed cases of Covid-19 among immigration detainees, and the risk of catching the virus remains high among those who are locked up for extended periods.\ufeff</p> <p>In a response dated 1 May, Michael Clements, the chamber\u2019s president, issued a robust rejection of the Home Office\u2019s request. \u201cAs independent judiciary we decide bail applications in accordance with the law, which includes the guidance which has been issued. There has been no change in either the law or the guidance,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThe primary function of detention is accordingly to facilitate removal, and unless there are very powerful reasons to the contrary bail should be granted if there is no removal of the bail applicant within the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <p>He said that during the pandemic he had instituted a \u201cminded to grant\u201d bail process, giving the Home Office an early indication before a bail hearing took place that a judge was likely to grant bail unless the Home Office could provide specific reasons why this should not happen.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, the feedback that I am receiving is not only that the Home Office rarely consent to the grant of bail having seen the \u2018minded to grant\u2019 but that bail is still opposed at the hearing without any meaningful additional representations being given.\u201d</p> <p>Pierre Makhlouf, an assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, accused the Home Office of interfering with the judicial approach to bail applications because the rate of successful bail applications had shot up from its usual level of about 30%. He said 55 out of 58 cases where the charity provided representation since lockdown began had been granted bail.</p> <p>Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association, said: \u201cIt is not appropriate for government to use its position outside of the courtroom to seek to influence decisions. The separation of powers between the government and judiciary is a core constitutional principle.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which launched a legal challenge calling for the mass release of detainees during the pandemic, said: \u201cThis letter is a constitutional disgrace, entirely in keeping with a government that thinks it is above the law and not answerable to our sovereign parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThat the Home Office has sought to pressure the immigration tribunal over its bail decisions during a global pandemic shows alarming disrespect for the right to liberty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.\u201d</p> <p>Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who brought the Detention Action case, said: \u201cSeparation of powers is a basic principle of any democratic society to safeguard liberties and guard against tyranny.\u201d</p> <p>\ufeffA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis is completely untrue, and the Guardian knows full well that this letter is explaining transparently to the judiciary how we are responding to this pandemic, including carefully reviewing the cases of those in detention.

I thought it was a serious book. A comic book, but it was still a book about addiction and recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Following Rachel as she slowly acknowledges she might have a little more than a \u201cstrictly recreational\u201d drug habit, the novel is utterly hilarious, deeply romantic (Luke Costello, ah my fluttering heart) and desperately moving.</p> <p>News of a sequel set 20 years later, about \u201chow her life has been with Luke and all the things that have happened\u201d, does make me slightly nervous. Last time I read one about a much-loved character, it was Jilly Cooper\u2019s Mount!, which once again starred Rupert Campbell-Black, these days married to the delightful Taggie. But Rupert\u2019s reappearance did not live up to the joys of Riders, Rivals and Polo \u2013 he is tempted off the straight and narrow by the \u201cgrieving but ravishing Zimbabwean widow\u201d Gala, and honestly, I could hardly bear it. Scales fallen, indeed.</p> <p>I mean, of course I\u2019ll read whatever Keyes writes: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/booksblog/2009/apr/07/blogpost\">sequels are one of my things</a>. And Keyes herself is wary of pitfalls, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8292037/Marian-Keyes-reveals-shes-writing-sequel-Rachels-Holiday-22-years-original-release.html\">telling Good Morning Britain</a>: \u201cIf I do a bad job of this, I feel like I\u2019d be destroying not only the book I\u2019m writing, but also the previous book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever read the sequel of a book you\u2019ve loved, and very often the sequel just doesn\u2019t give you the same happy feels of the first book,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen that happens to me, I not only dislike the sequel, I then start to side-eye the original book and think, was it really that good in the first place? You know there\u2019s a lot to be damaged here, but I\u2019m going into it and I\u2019m enjoying it, and it\u2019s really lovely to connect to all the Walsh family.\u201d</p> <p>I have faith she\u2019ll get it right, and frankly, if there was one book I might have secretly wished to read a sequel to, it would have been Rachel\u2019s Holiday. While I\u2019m waiting, I\u2019ll put in a few requests to the universe for other sequels the world needs. Good Omens, of course, but <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-02-19/will-there-be-another-series-of-good-omens/\">who knows if that will ever happen</a>. It looks like Robin Hobb wrapped up her Fitz and the Fool stories pretty definitively in <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/books/a9655606/robin-hobb-interview/\">Assassin\u2019s Fate</a>, but I\u2019d read more about FitzChivalry Farseer from now until eternity. And of course we\u2019re all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/18/i-feel-fine-george-rr-martin-reassures-fans-from-self-isolation\">silently urging George RR Martin on in Santa Fe \u2026</a></p>",
  "<p>No one has died from not going to an art gallery. Or from missing a night at the theatre, or not seeing a great band. So when people are actually dying it may seem a little churlish to complain that culture feels a little dead. </p> <p>Yet it is flat. The arts establishment seems to me as lumbering, London-centric and out of touch as ever. Just as they had nothing to say about Brexit \u2013 beyond that it was a very bad thing \u2013 what are they telling us about Covid-19?</p> <p>There are various pushes to make sure that, post-pandemic, the big institutions, from the Tate to the V&amp;A, get back to normal. But I don\u2019t want things to get back to normal if that just means rich art collectors jetting round the world to buy paintings as interior design. Is normal when Hollywood figures out how to make crappily scripted films again by checking the temperatures of its actors? Does normal mean stadium tours by big bands with ticket prices in three figures?</p> <p>Already, it is clear that successful artists and institutions are not the ones we need to prioritise. Rather, it is the upcoming generation of culture-makers. We already know what happens when we don\u2019t make it viable for people from every background to enter the arts: art schools have become finishing schools, often for well-heeled international students. The TV industry and theatre are dominated by the connected and wealthy. If social mobility has stalled generally in society, in the arts it has actually gone backwards. A working-class artist is still something to be.</p> <p>This is hardly new, but post-Covid-19 it is our chance to revitalise this monstrously monotone class landscape. Otherwise, we could be left simply with a wasteland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd54dd55dc30dc1e123866589484f2fe0f560fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd54dd55dc30dc1e123866589484f2fe0f560fb4/0_609_2520_2272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Rothko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"902\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Rothko ... a beneficiary of Roosevelt\u2019s Public Works of Art scheme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We can take lessons from the past. A lot of now-famous artists, from Tracey Emin to Jarvis Cocker, talk of the dole and small enterprise allowance that allowed them to become what they are. In 2009, following the financial crash, some of us were involved in an effort to kickstart our young creatives. Martin Bright had written an inspirational <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/martin-bright/2009/01/deal-work-government-fdr\">article in the New Statesman</a> citing Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programmes following the Great Depression, when parks, buildings and libraries were built. Roosevelt\u2019s Works Progress Administration created 3,500 libraries and put on 4,400 music performances every month. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jackson-pollock\">Jackson Pollock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/nov/21/willem-dekooning-mylifeinart-art\">Willem de Kooning</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/rothko\">Mark Rothko</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/saulbellow\">Saul Bellow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cheever\">John Cheever</a> were some of the beneficiaries of his Public Works of Art scheme.</p> <p>What Bright suggested was a New Deal of the Mind to equip creatives. With the help of Maggie Darling (wife of Alistair), we had a meeting at Downing Street with many key cultural figures of the time. The mistake, I think, was that this was presumed by some to be another begging bowl for arts funding. It was the opposite. We were arguing that a key way out of recession was through cultural projects.</p> <p>In terms of recovery, this should be a no-brainer. Before the crisis struck in February this year, our creative industries contributed almost <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-creative-industries-contributes-almost-13-million-to-the-uk-economy-every-hour\">\u00a313m</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-creative-industries-contributes-almost-13-million-to-the-uk-economy-every-hour\"> to the UK economy every hour</a>. That sector was growing five times faster than the national economy. This is playing to our strengths. We are good at it! As a country, this is our strength, and there are jobs to be created. We were talking about hooking up engineers with arts grads, designers with scientists, tech kids with care homes. Innovation happens in this cross-fertilisation and, post-Covid-19, this is where we need to be.</p> <p>What we also didn\u2019t realise perhaps in 2009 was how fast the digital world was moving and how the gig economy was becoming normalised. Artists need a safety net in this freelance, self-employed world. They also need space no longer possible in city centres. Back then, we asked for commercial empty spaces to be used. Post-Covid, the high street will surely be full of such spaces?</p> <p>Other countries can help show us paths forward. Germany has a federal aid package of \u20ac50bn (\u00a343.6bn), and is distributing it in small chunks \u2013 \u20ac5,000 to freelancers in places like Berlin. Small lump sums to individuals, rather than massive grants to institutions. Initiatives should be local. Textile workshops in Italy are teaching people how to make masks.</p> <p>A thriving culture is not about the next artist to be exhibited at Frieze or the next McQueen. Nor is it about fame or glory. It\u2019s about creating the conditions in which an ecosystem of artistic collaboration may grow. As we hit a global recession, I would argue that culture, far from being a luxury, becomes a necessity. How do we make that culture sustainable? We invest. As Eleanor Roosevelt said: \u201cThe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.\u201d</p> <p>Now is not the time to lockdown the dreams of our creative young people. Instead, we should make sure they can unlock them.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>Small investors poured into the stock market in April in the hope of picking up bargains, with record inflows into funds, according to data provider Calastone.</p> <p>A net of \u00a32.6bn was invested in equity funds in the UK in April, the highest monthly figure on record and six times more than a typical month, it said.</p> <p>Most of the buying took place in the middle of the month as evidence began to emerge that rates of coronavirus infections were beginning to slow in some of the worst-hit European countries. However, by the end of the month, inflows slowed to a trickle, said Calastone.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 began its sharp falls on 24 February, crashing from above 7,400 points to bottom at 4,993 on 23 March. It currently stands at around 5,870.</p> <p>Trading in and out of funds has also been at record levels, with new peaks reached every month in 2020. The most popular destination for investors\u2019 money has been global funds, followed by funds invested in UK equities.</p> <p>Investors have also turned to active rather than passive funds.</p> <p>Edward Glyn, the head of global markets at Calastone, said: \u201cFear receded in April and capital flooded back into funds in its wake. As markets began to rise sharply, investors scrambled to add to their fund holdings, eager not to miss the best month for markets in 40 years.</p> <p>\u201cGreater caution set in later in month, perhaps because investors began to question how solid the foundations of the rally could be given the mounting evidence of severe economic damage around the world, as well as White House sabre-rattling over new tariffs on China.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Covid affairs.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> A couple of months.

Who can manage a clandestine affair when your neighbours are watching from their windows to make sure you don\u2019t go jogging twice?</strong> Soon it could get even harder.</p> <p><strong>How so?</strong> Contact tracing. In Belgium, for example, there are plans for <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/well-keep-your-love-affair-secret-say-coronavirus-contact-tracers-2fj7xrxd8\">2,000 investigators</a> to trace all the past contacts of those testing positive for coronavirus. That would include any extramarital assignations.</p> <p><strong>I guess that could lead to an awkward home quarantine. </strong>That\u2019s why the Belgian authorities have promised to keep such information confidential. \u201cIf, after talking to the patient, we call all contacts to inform them that there has been an infection in their environment, we will never tell them who the infected person is or where they met that person,\u201d Dirk Wildemeersch, the head of the contact tracers team, told the Het Laatste Nieuws.</p> <p><strong>How very sporting.</strong> Meanwhile, in France, where affairs are normally tolerated but lockdown rules are strict, people are increasingly resorting to <em>t\u00e9l\u00e9sexualit\u00e9.</em></p> <p><strong>What does that mean? </strong>It means they are carrying on carrying on, online. There has been a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-frisky-french-aroused-by-tips-to-sex-up-lockdown-c62q08pr9\">big rise</a> in the use of dating apps specialising in illicit encounters and sites hosting virtual orgies.</p> <p><strong>What kind of disgusting sites are those, and where can I find them? </strong>You could probably just use Zoom although this is against its user policies. Don\u2019t tell them I sent you.</p> <p><strong>Anyway, these sound like </strong><strong>very innovative solutions to some very continental problems. </strong>Covid affairs are not confined to the continent. British epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson has just stepped down from his post on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) over what he called an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">error of judgment</a>\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What did he do? </strong>He twice allowed his lover to cross London to visit him at home, contravening the physical distancing rules he was instrumental in developing.</p> <p><strong>Did he offer any excuse for taking such a risk, besides really, really wanting to? </strong>He said he had already had coronavirus and considered himself immune.</p> <p><strong>Isn\u2019t it weird that it\u2019s suddenly considered completely immoral to sneak out of your house to have sex with a person who isn\u2019t your partner?</strong> To be honest, I think that was always sort of frowned upon.</p> <p><strong>And yet it\u2019s OK to drive to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/05/diy-lockdown-tunnel-homebase-screwfix-pass-notes\">B&amp;Q</a> for some weedkiller.</strong> That has always been OK.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair?

  "<p>While countries in east Asia and Europe are gradually taking steps towards reopening their economies, many in the global south are wondering whether the worst of the pandemic is yet to come. As economists who work on poverty alleviation in developing countries, we are often asked what the effects of coronavirus will be in south Asia and Africa. The truth is, we don\u2019t know. Without extensive testing to map the number of cases, it\u2019s impossible to tell how far the virus has already spread. We don\u2019t yet have enough information about how Covid-19 behaves under different conditions such as sunlight, heat and humidity. Developing countries\u2019 more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/18/sub-saharan-africa-youth-population-potential\">youthful populations</a> may spare them the worst of the pandemic, but health systems in the global south are poorly equipped to deal with an outbreak, and poverty is linked to co-morbidities that put people at a higher risk of serious illness.</p> \n<p>Without the information widespread testing provides, many poorer countries have taken an extremely cautious approach. India imposed a total <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/indias-13bn-population-locked-down-to-beat-coronavirus\">lockdown on 24 March</a>, by which time the country had about 500 confirmed cases. Countries such as Rwanda, South Africa and Nigeria enforced lockdowns in late March, long before the virus was expected to peak. But these lockdown measures can\u2019t last forever. Poorer countries could have used the quarantine to buy time, gather information about how the disease behaves and develop a testing and tracing strategy. Unfortunately, not much of this has happened. And, far from coming to their aid, rich countries have outrun poorer nations in the race for PPE, oxygen and ventilators.</p> \n<p>In many places, the human toll of the lockdown is already becoming obvious. Children <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52503313\">go without vaccinations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/covid-19-lockdown-sparks-harvest-crises-in-pakistan-india/1799536\">crops are not harvested</a>. As construction projects stall and markets are shuttered, jobs and incomes evaporate. The effects of prolonged quarantine on developing nations could be as harmful as the virus itself. Before Covid-19 rippled across the world, 15,000 children under five <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/despite-remarkable-progress-15000-children-and-800-women-still-die-every-day-mostly\">died every day</a> in the global south, mostly of preventable diseases associated with poverty. It\u2019s likely that many more will die if their families are plunged further into poverty.</p> \n<p>What can poor countries do in the face of this pandemic \u2013 and how can rich countries help them? First, the systematic testing strategies that have been crucial to containing the epidemic and easing lockdown measures in Europe are equally critical in poor countries. In places where public health authorities don\u2019t have information about the spread of the virus and resources are limited, the response to coronavirus needs to be targeted at active hotspots. In this way, rather than imposing a universal lockdown, health authorities can identify the clusters where quarantine measures are required.</p> \n<p>Second, developing countries must be able to improve the ability of their health systems to cope with a potential sudden influx of sick people.</p> \n<p>And third, it\u2019s crucial that poor countries are able to guarantee people a secure livelihood in the months to come. In the absence of such a guarantee, people will grow tired of quarantine measures and lockdowns will be increasingly difficult to enforce.<strong> </strong>To protect their economies from a collapse in demand, governments must reassure people that financial support will be available for as long as it\u2019s needed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"429927ae-d5f6-4294-9345-b635df4091ac\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OEONouL5aU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In our recent book, written before coronavirus struck but with a title that is now eerily appropriate \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/11/good-economics-for-hard-times-abhijit-banerjee-esther-duflo-review\">Good Economics for Hard Times</a> \u2013 we recommend that poor countries implement what we call a universal ultra basic income (UUBI), a regular cash transfer that amounts to enough for basic survival. The virtues of a UUBI are its simplicity, transparency, and its assurance that nobody will starve. It avoids the problems of many welfare systems that are designed to exclude the \u201cnon-deserving\u201d, even at a cost to the needy. During a pandemic, when governments need to help as many people as quickly as possible, the simplicity of a UUBI could be lifesaving. Reassuring people that nobody will be excluded from subsistence aid also limits the feeling of existential foreboding that so many individuals in poor (and not so poor) countries are currently experiencing.</p> \n<p>These ideas aren\u2019t mere fantasy. The small west African country of Togo, with its eight million inhabitants and its <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/country/togo\">GDP (</a><a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/country/togo\">purchasing power parity) per capita of $1,538,</a> is working on all these fronts. In addition to testing <a href=\"https://visalist.io/emergency/coronavirus/togo-country\">7,900 suspected cases</a>, the country is deploying 5,000 test on a random basis to assess prevalence. Health authorities will use the results to determine when<strong> </strong>and where to restrict peoples\u2019 mobility. The government has also launched a<a href=\"https://www.togofirst.com/en/public-management/0405-5464-covid-19-novissi-cash-transfer-scheme-extended-to-tchauodjo-in-the-central-region\"> cash transfer scheme</a> linking an electronic wallet to peoples\u2019 cellphones; it already has 1.3 million people registered and has sent money to 500,000<strong> </strong>in the region of Greater Lom\u00e9 (the capital) alone.</p> \n<p>The good news is that many countries, particularly those in Africa, already have the infrastructure to rapidly transfer money across a population using cellphones. Many people already use these systems in private exchanges, so government schemes based on this infrastructure can be up and running in a matter of days. If phone data indicates that some regions are experiencing greater economic distress, the transfer could be more generous in those places.</p> \n<p>In fact, the greatest constraint we face isn\u2019t the feasibility of these measures \u2013 it\u2019s the willpower to finance them. Developing countries will need a substantial amount of help from richer nations if they are to pay for a UUBI. Some fear that their currencies will depreciate if they act aggressively, potentially spurring a debt crisis. Richer nations will need to work with global financial institutions to offer debt relief and additional resources to developing nations. Many developing countries will need to buy food and medical supplies with hard currency, which will become increasingly difficult because of faltering export earnings and collapsing remittances.</p> \n<p>Given the unprecedented collapse in earnings that many people face, conventional fiscal prudence is perhaps less important now than it was in the recent past. Now is the time for governments to help citizens and economies by spending more, rather than less. The governments of developing countries may need to accept large budget deficits in order to finance a UUBI, at least in the short term. When countries begin to loosen their lockdowns and resume production, they will face extremely weak demand. Pledging that cash transfers will continue for some time in the future will allow people to go out and spend money when it becomes safe to do so. In turn, this will drive the revival of the economy.</p> \n<p>None of this means that governments should simply ignore concerns about macro-economic stability. But a clear spending plan that responds to the immediate shock of coronavirus, in conjunction with a longer term strategy for how the lockdown will end, offers the best hope for preventing the present crisis developing into a future catastrophe.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee won the 2019 Nobel prize in economics for their work on poverty alleviation.

  "<p>The novel virus first emerged in east Asia. By spring, a pandemic suffuses the globe. In America, businesses shut down, airports empty, misinformation abounds. The president, a divisive figure with a tanning bed in the White House, offers baseless reassurances, and appoints the dubiously pious vice-president to lead the pandemic response. This would be a decent summary of the past two months, if it wasn\u2019t the plot to The End of October, a new novel by Lawrence Wright, which flies thrillingly, eerily close to reality \u2013 a global outbreak of a deadly pathogen with no known cure in the kinetic, flammable information torrent of the late 2010s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/21/lawrence-wright-god-save-texas-journey-future-america-interview-looming-tower-911\">Lawrence Wright: \u2018It\u2019s difficult to escape the Texas stereotype\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unnerving\u201d Wright, a New Yorker staff writer and Pulitzer-winning journalist, told the Guardian on the surreal fortune of releasing a global pandemic novel during a global pandemic. \u201cIt was meant to be a warning cry, when we weren\u2019t buffeted by all this dire news. Whenever I open the paper it feels like I\u2019m reading my own book. It\u2019s weird.\u201d The End of October, which Lawrence began writing in 2017 (his final draft was submitted in summer 2019), is a deeply researched scenario-play of a novel \u2013 the world faced with a 1918 Spanish flu-type pathogen \u2013 told in brisk, unsparing prose. Competence and expertise serve as its compass; Wright\u2019s American protagonist, Dr Henry Parsons, is a cunning, emotionally clamped virologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outrunning a shady past at a secret lab in Maryland\u2019s Fort Detrick.</p> <p>Alarmed by a mass die-off in an Indonesian political concentration camp for young gay men, Henry travels to Jakarta, where he discovers \u201cKongoli virus\u201d, named after the camp, a gruesome new form of hemorrhagic influenza. Wright\u2019s writing is clinical and unblinking \u2013 you stare into chest cavities, at lungs subsumed in fluid, at bodies turned blue by cyanosis, or lack of oxygen. The Kongoli camp is quarantined and swarmed by various health agencies that are, like Henry, veterans of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa. But when an inadvertently exposed taxi driver makes the hajj \u2013 the Islamic holy pilgrimage to Mecca \u2013 along with 3 million other people, all bets for containing the spread are off. Within days, people die en masse around the world.</p> <p>The idea for a modern pandemic story originated in 2010, when film-maker Ridley Scott approached Wright to write a screenplay about the end of civilization. \u201cIn my mind, the more likely way civilization would be threatened like that would be a pandemic,\u201d said Wright, who long admired the \u201creally creative, intelligent\u201d epidemiologists, microbiologists and virologists he encountered as a journalist. Though they never made the movie, \u201cI was always interested and I thought it was a really good story,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided that if I was going to do it, I would have to do the research I had failed to do when I was working on it as a script.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e624aa909af4c04fc5f3d3e02785d95cf84b245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e624aa909af4c04fc5f3d3e02785d95cf84b245/0_0_3000_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"758\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wright, known for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/books/scientology-fascinates-the-author-lawrence-wright.html\">incredibly thorough</a> research in his non-fiction work, took a journalistic approach to researching the novel \u2013 reading as much as possible, contacting experts (the acknowledgments cite leading experts from the NIH, Columbia and Pfizer, among others). His sources were \u201cthe same guys who are developing a vaccine \u2013 they\u2019re the best minds around\u201d and helped Wright contort his way out of a medical puzzle he\u2019d written into the novel\u2019s second half, when pandemic-stranded Henry is trying to get home to his family in Atlanta. They also color the novel with rich and accessible scientific detail on viruses, bioweapons and past pandemics.</p> <p>Wright primarily based the Kongoli virus on the 1918 Spanish flu, which also arrived in the US in the spring, lulled in the summer, and returned with a deadlier second wave in the fall. The title The End of October pays tribute to arguably the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/spanish-flu-deaths-october-1918\">most mortal month in American history</a>, in which 195,000 people died. \u201cThe question I was asking my experts was: what would happen if something like the 1918 flu appeared in our civilization?\u201d Wright said. \u201cWould we be any better prepared than our ancestors? It\u2019s not clear what the answer is.\u201d</p> <p>The fictional Kongoli virus is, however, far more lethal than Covid-19, with a mortality rate closer to previous coronaviruses <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2003/05/estimates-sars-death-rates-revised-upward\">ars (15%) </a>and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/\">ers (about 35%)</a>. The End of October plunges beyond the relative chaos of the current moment into full societal breakdown \u2013 the government in bunkers, schools looted, ATMs empty of cash. Millions die in the US, including celebrities like Taylor Swift. Blood drips from the president\u2019s eye on national television; one character searches the radio and finds only conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</p> <p>In writing Kongoli\u2019s geopolitical fallout \u2013 Russia escalates cyberwarfare and tensions boil over in the Gulf \u2013 Wright worked in expertise honed in his previous non-fiction books on conflict in the Middle East (Thirteen Days in September), religious fanaticism (Going Clear, an expos\u00e9 on Scientology turned into a 2015 HBO documentary) and the War on Terror (The Looming Tower, on al-Qaida\u2019s road to 9/11, which earned him a Pulitzer prize in 2007). \u201cI looked at the antagonisms, the rivalries, and I just imagined if you add stress \u2013 a pandemic \u2013 then what would happen?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dismaying to watch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">blame game</a> going on right now and seeing that governments are behaving pretty much as expected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f294c5732f2eac6c9f33e245356e76523d3d9223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f294c5732f2eac6c9f33e245356e76523d3d9223/0_0_4287_2854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Daniels and Tahar Rahim in The Looming Tower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Daniels and Tahar Rahim in The Looming Tower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JoJo Whilden/BBC/Hulu/JoJo Whilden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though (as of now) much more apocalyptic than the present, Wright\u2019s book anticipates several elements of the Covid pandemic: <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-anti-asian-attacks-say-about-american-culture-during-crisis\">hate crimes against the minority group</a> blamed for the virus (in the novel\u2019s case, Muslims). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/us-healthcare-workers-make-gut-wrenching-decisions-coronavirus\">Ventilator shortages</a>. Empty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">flailing attempts at reassurance</a> from the administration. But he, like many public health experts, did not anticipate a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-will-coronavirus-end/608719/\">breakdown in testing</a>. \u201cI was horrified,\u201d said Wright of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">testing debacle</a>. \u201cAnd saddened, because the CDC in my experience had always been one of the glittering prizes of American government, something you could always rely upon \u2013 their expertise, their competence, their authority. And to see them stumble so badly, it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d</p> <p>He also didn\u2019t anticipate one hopeful development of this pandemic: \u201cthe solidarity of individual citizens to isolate themselves at enormous personal costs, social costs, spiritual costs, financial costs\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a compulsive thrill to reading a book which grazes, and then runs off with, our increasingly ungraspable reality, but Wright is careful not to tout his writing as prescient. \u201cI made some lucky guesses, but for the most part, what people are reading as prophecy is just what experts told me would happen,\u201d he said. Expertise, briefing books, scenario exercises \u2013 \u201call of that stuff was on the table. It was there for anybody who was interested, and I was interested.\u201d</p> <p>As for how he imagines a new normal, \u201cI think we\u2019re at a crossroads,\u201d he said. \u201cWar or depression or pandemic gives you a kind of X-ray vision about the society you live in, and you see it for what it is \u2013 its shortcomings, its strengths. And I think the shortcomings are plainly apparent: the partisanship, the needless international antagonisms, the lack of preparation, the disrespect for science, all of those things are creating havoc that we shouldn\u2019t have to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>And while Wright understands people might have pandemic reading fatigue \u2013 \u201cThere are going to be a lot of people who aren\u2019t emotionally ready to read this book,\u201d he conceded \u2013 he hopes people leave the End of October with a \u201cclearer understanding of disease and contagion and the dangers of pandemics, and also be impressed, as I am, by the courage and ingenuity of the people who are fighting disease. That\u2019s why the book is dedicated to them.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The End of October is out now</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In the topsy-turvy world of lockdown, the message from the UK\u2019s holiday hotspots this bank holiday weekend is the same as it was at Easter four weeks ago: stay away.</p> <p>However, behind the scenes tourism officials and hospitality bosses are busy working out how destinations will start to welcome back visitors this summer. Without knowing exactly what changes will be announced when Boris Johnson produces his roadmap on Sunday, tourist boards across the UK are setting out plans for a phased reopening of attractions and businesses as they endeavour to salvage some of the 2020 season. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait until lockdown\u2019s over and find we\u2019ve not got the plans in place,\u201d said Gill Haigh, chief executive of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cThe question is how we reset.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a big question. Discussions around what to open and when are taking place against a backdrop of huge public anxiety about coming out of lockdown. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fearful-britons-oppose-lifting-lockdown-schools-pubs-restaurants-opinium-poll\">Observer poll</a> at the weekend found that the majority of people believe it\u2019s too soon to ease restrictions, and local people are understandably furious<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\"> </a>with those do flout the current rules, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\">as happened this week in the Lake District</a>.</p> <p>The challenge for destinations is giving tourism the shot in the arm that it desperately needs while reassuring visitors, employees and residents that they will be safe. As a result of that delicate balancing act, holidaying in the UK this summer may well feel like we\u2019ve time-travelled back to the 1950s, before the advent of affordable foreign travel: there will be day trips to beaches, parks and gardens; we\u2019ll be able to buy an ice-cream but won\u2019t be dining in a crowded restaurant; if it rains we won\u2019t be sheltering in the nearest museum or indoor activity centre.</p> <p>Outdoor spaces in rural and coastal areas and attractions with large grounds will be the first to welcome visitors, not just because those are places where social distancing can be maintained but because, post-lockdown, people will be drawn to nature for its calming effects. \u201cConsumer research shows that people want to get back to simple pleasures,\u201d said Kate Mavor, chief executive of English Heritage, which manages 400 historic sites in England. \u201cPeople can come with a picnic and just enjoy being close to nature. There\u2019s also great comfort in being in places that have stood the sense of time \u2013 that have survived war and pestilence. We will be a tonic for people when they come.\u201d</p> <p>But even simple pleasures will be different post-lockdown. Pre-booking visits to heritage sites will become the new norm. One-way systems, extra signage, hand sanitiser stations and staff in PPE will be familiar sights as attractions strive to minimise risk to visitors and staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge even with open spaces will be around security and making sure people are being sensible,\u201d said Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Hertfordshire. \u201cWhat people were used to beforehand will not happen now: just turning up at a National Trust place may not be possible.\u201d</p> <p>This first phase of openings will be closely watched by tourist boards aware that recovery is dependent on the confidence of local communities. \u201cIf local people see that these attractions are acting responsibly, you\u2019re warming them up to the idea of more visitors coming back by late summer and autumn,\u201d said Jo Dilley of Marketing Peak District.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d/0_8_4272_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cosy wooden cottage by a stream in Snowdonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-catering cottages like this one in Snowdonia, may be able to open before hotels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riddell Graham of Visit Scotland added: \u201cWe had a not particularly helpful situation early on when people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/scottish-government-furious-at-travellers-to-highlands-and-islands\">trying to get to islands to self-isolate</a>. So no matter what we do, we have to take on board the community interest, particularly for more remote rural areas.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time as reassuring communities that their safety is a priority, tourism officials will be pushing the value of visitors to the local economy. The impact of coronavirus on the 241,000 tourism businesses in the UK has been catastrophic. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate how important the visitor economy is for an area like ours,\u201d said Haigh of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cIf tourism isn\u2019t allowed to return \u2013 and if the value of that tourism isn\u2019t created, a lot of businesses won\u2019t be here this time next year.\u201d</p> <p>Of course the economic impact hasn\u2019t just been on businesses. Financial pressures on individuals will affect the recovery. Greg Stevenson, founder of cottage company <a href=\"https://www.underthethatch.co.uk/\">Under the Thatch</a>, said the company is receiving daily bookings for July and August \u2013 but mainly for more expensive properties. \u201cIt\u2019s wealthier people who are booking five-star cottages.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson, who lives in Ireland, believes Johnson\u2019s roadmap announcement will boost public confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in Ireland, where there\u2019s a massive difference in public feeling [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/ireland-extends-covid-19-lockdown-to-18-may-before-phased-exit\">since a five-stage exit from lockdown was announced on 2 May</a>]. I think people in the UK will be much less panicky about the situation after Sunday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People come for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of people in the bar. If that doesn\u2019t exist it will be strange</p> <footer> <cite>Robin Hutson, hotelier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes self-catering properties will be in the second tranche of openings. New procedures will be put in place, such as sterilising hard surfaces and providing antiseptic sprays, but he is sure there\u2019s an appetite for holidays this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt at all that there is demand for people to get away tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The owner of campground <a href=\"https://thequietsite.co.uk/\">The Quiet Site</a> in Ullswater agrees that an appetite for travel will return relatively swiftly. \u201cIn Denmark, which was the first European country to ease lockdown, demand is at 90% compared with last year. There won\u2019t be a rush to travel but it will come back,\u201d said Daniel Holder. He is anticipating welcoming campers and caravanners back to his site this summer although the onsite bar, shop and check-in will come later. But part-opening will take its toll. \u201cIt will be hard to reach a break-even point this season.\u201d</p> <p> Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/20/the-pig-at-combe-honiton-devon-hotel-review\">Pig hotels</a> and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: \u201cThe worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed \u2026 This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, supported by many of the biggest names in the food and hotel trades, including Rick Stein, Mitch Tonks, Michael Caines and Gordon Campbell-Gray, called for a flexible, part-time furlough scheme until the end of the first quarter of 2021 and an extension of the business rates holiday until the second quarter. He is optimistic that hospitality will be considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">when the Treasury announces details of the scaled-back scheme.</a></p> <p>Like hoteliers across the country, Hutson and his team are drawing up plans for post-lockdown operating. Measures being discussed include meeting guests at their car instead of at reception, express checkouts, two-hour slots for room cleaning, and even decorative screening between tables. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent hours talking about what we\u2019re going to do but without knowing the ground rules,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly difficult to formulate a plan.\u201d</p> <p>Such measures will reassure potential visitors, especially when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/uk-tourism-sector-to-flag-attractions-with-physical-distancing-measures\">nationwide kite mark showing that businesses are complying with new guidelines</a> comes into place, but Hutson fears they\u2019ll also make the atmosphere strained: \u201cPeople come to us for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of other people in the bar. That\u2019s part of what we sell and if it doesn\u2019t exist it\u2019s going to be strange. The little bit of hope for our industry is that we will probably be among the last to be \u2018released\u2019. By then the population may have gained some confidence in moving around - that could help the mindset.\u201d </p> <p>Despite Hutson\u2019s fears for rural Britain, recovery will start sooner than in cities. Galleries, museums and other indoor attractions will be in the final tranche of openings in late summer or early autumn, although tourism officials hope to see some life return to cities if planning restrictions are relaxed to allow restaurants and bars to expand on to the streets. \u201cIn Sweden they have closed down streets and made them into dining and drinking areas in the evenings to increase floor space and bring food outside,\u201d said Kurt Janson, director of Tourism Alliance, a consortium of 55 trade bodies in tourism and hospitality. \u201cThis summer we might look more continental.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, as the nation prepares to spend another bank holiday at home, destinations are sticking to the same message: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ndevoncouncil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1257959404256866305&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmay%2F06%2Fuk-tourism-sector-to-flag-attractions-with-physical-distancing-measures\">stay away this VE day and come back later. </a><br></p>",

  "<p>The newspaper frenzy over Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s love life is just the latest example of a scientist who has been targeted for confronting parts of Britain\u2019s political-media complex with evidence that it finds too difficult to accept.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Ferguson, who sat on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) before his resignation, was wrong to ignore the government\u2019s social distancing rules. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">has admitted</a> as much, even if he did believe that he was at low risk of spreading the Sars-Cov-2 virus because he had already recovered from Covid-19.</p> <p>But today\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1257789476358799360/photo/1\">lurid front-page headlines</a> follow a campaign to discredit him by those ideologically opposed to government interventions, and who have used such tactics against scientists in other fields, particularly climate change.</p> <p>It is a further sign that some media commentators and politicians favour a version of Britain in which politicians and newspaper editors dictate the public\u2019s understanding of biology and physics.</p> <p>Ferguson has been under attack ever since his research team\u2019s modelling <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">suggested in mid-March</a> that hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK from Covid-19 were possible if stronger efforts were not made to curb the growing epidemic.</p> <p>Within a week, the prime minister announced the current lockdown measures. The move was perceived as a U-turn because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser</a> had days earlier suggested that allowing widespread infection might be an option to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d across the country.</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s contribution was initially praised, but it was not long before his reputation was under assault from parts of the media traditionally sceptical of a so-called \u201cnanny state\u201d.</p> <p>On 28 March, the Daily Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/neil-ferguson-scientist-convinced-boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-criticised/\">published an article</a> alleging that \u201cthe scientist whose calculations about the potentially devastating impact of the coronavirus directly led to the countrywide lockdown has been criticised in the past for flawed research\u201d.</p> <p>The story relied on the views of a handful of critics of how Ferguson\u2019s models were used by the then Labour government to tackle the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The article failed to mention that Ferguson received an OBE in recognition for his important role in the crisis, or that he was afterwards elected a fellow of the prestigious Academy of Medical Sciences.</p> <p>The next day, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8163587/PETER-HITCHENS-Great-Panic-foolish-freedom-broken-economy-crippled.html\">Peter Hitchens, in the Mail on Sunday</a>, described the lockdown as \u201cmass house arrest\u201d and identified Ferguson as being \u201cone of those largely responsible for the original panic\u201d.</p> <p>A few days later the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-lessons-from-the-asteroid-that-didnt-hit-earth-11585780465\">published an article</a> by two British commentators that argued \u201cthe coronavirus pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the limits of scientific modelling to predict the future\u201d. It singled out Ferguson\u2019s work and complained that \u201creasonable people might wonder whether something made with 13-year-old, undocumented computer code should be used to justify shutting down the economy\u201d.</p> <p>Bizarrely, this article was written by Benny Peiser and Andrew Montford, the director and deputy director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/02/nigel-lawson-climate-sceptic-organisation-funders\">set up by Nigel Lawson</a> in 2009 to lobby against climate change policies. The foundation has a track record of attempting to discredit climate models that show rising greenhouse gas levels risk warming the world to dangerous levels.</p> <p>The promoters of climate change denial, which include some newspapers, are well used to attacking scientists whose work they do not like. Lawson\u2019s foundation was launched just a few days after the publication in late November 2009 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/20/climate-sceptics-hackers-leaked-emails\">emails that had been hacked</a> from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. He and other so-called \u201csceptics\u201d falsely suggested that the emails revealed misconduct by climate scientists.</p> <p>Within a few hours of his work being misrepresented around the world, the head of the unit, Prof Phil Jones, started to receive threats against his life and the lives of his family. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8502823.stm\">He later admitted</a> that he had even contemplated suicide before numerous inquiries cleared him of any scientific wrongdoing.</p> <p>It is fortunate that Jones did not succumb after such a concerted assault on his reputation. A similar ordeal apparently caused Dr David Kelly to take his own life after the biological weapons expert was hounded for revealing that the threat posed by Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction had been exaggerated by Tony Blair\u2019s government.</p> <p>Many other scientists in the UK working on issues that have implications for government policy know what it is like to be vilified, both publicly and privately, for their findings. They are regularly attacked by many of the British media commentators who are currently joining the pile-on to Ferguson.</p> <p>It is time to put a stop to these media lynch mobs that risk driving Britain back into the Dark Ages. We must continue to base our decisions on the advice of experts such as Ferguson, and reject the irrational arguments of those who want political dogma to trump evidence.</p> <p>\u2022 Bob Ward is policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics</p>",

  "<p>A month ago, I was worried about the places in this big wide world I might now never get to see, even if Covid-19 doesn\u2019t take me. Then the focus narrowed to all the places, lovely and unlovely, in this country I might not visit. And now, logically enough in this great narrowing of all our worlds, my concerns are closer to home.</p> <p>I have lived in London, on and off, since coming to college in October 1987. My first visit was around a decade before that, with my mum and dad, when I was about 10. Only two things stick in my mind from that day. One was the awesomely terrible old taxi rank below Euston station. I had rarely seen a black cab before, let alone hundreds in one place spewing out stuff that, even then, I suspected couldn\u2019t be good for you. The other memories I have are of the tube: the distant rumble, rumbling louder and louder, and the gentle breeze slowly stiffening into a wind as this strange-looking train exploded out of the tunnel. It was the Piccadilly line. I know this, because I remember vividly that the train was bound for somewhere called Cockfosters. Four decades on, it pains me that I have yet to get to Cockfosters.</p> <p>For a while now it has been on my bucket list to have got on or off a train at every single London Underground station. The valuable lesson I have learned of late is that when you get these ideas you need to hurry up and do them, because you never know if a global pandemic is going to come along.</p> <p>I have just spent a deeply soulful hour going through the list of all 270 London Underground stations. It gives me solace that I have visited the first and last on that list: Acton Town is very close to me and Woodside Park is where my brilliant CBT practitioner plies her trade. I tell a lie, she\u2019s actually nearer Totteridge and Whetstone, but I used Woodside Park once just so I could, you know, cross it off my list. She might want a word with me about this nonsense, come to think of it. But if I had never been to Woodside Park, I would never have come across the astoundingly photogenic little shack, Caf\u00e9 Cairo, that sits outside. That would have been a real shame.</p> <p>I have 85 stations left to tick off my list. This will plainly have to wait until restrictions on unnecessary travel are lifted. What on earth would I say to someone in uniform asking me what my business was in Arnos Grove, Fairlop or Sudbury Hill?</p> <p>Naturally, it is stations towards the end of my line that I need to get to. I am rather kicking myself that the one time I went to Upminster, I didn\u2019t stop off at Upminster Bridge while I was in the area. Soon. There are a few stations I will be able to knock off quickly. I will be down to 82 after a morning in Northwood (Northwood and Northwood Hills); 80 come late afternoon, by which time I\u2019ll have done Ruislip (Ruislip, Ruislip Gardens and West Ruislip), and the number will reduce to 77 during an evening in Hounslow (Central, East and West). Bring it on.</p> <p>Unnecessary? Strictly speaking, even in ordinary times, yes. But to me, no travel is ever unnecessary. It is with a shudder that I now recall what I used to say to anyone who asked me why I had been somewhere random: \u201cTo go, to see, to feel, to breathe the same air as different people.\u201d Breathe the same air? Please God, may this nightmare end soon.</p> <p>\u2022 Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The UK cinema industry is understood to be lobbying the government to approve a proposed reopening scheme that would see venues welcome customers by the end of June.</p> <p>Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made representations to government on the safeguards which UK cinemas would look to have in place for audiences and staff alike upon re-opening, and have asked that consideration be given \u2013 with these in mind \u2013 to allow cinemas to open by the end of June.\u201d</p> <p>Clapp\u2019s plan is in line with the optimism of Vue Cinemas\u2019 chief executive Tim Richards, who yesterday <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52542693\">told the BBC</a> he was hopeful that his chain would be up and running before the 17 July release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Tenet, one of the remaining tentpole blockbusters whose release has not been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are trying to do is work with the government to demonstrate that we are not like sporting fixtures or music concerts,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52542693\">said Richards</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe can actually control how many people go into our cinema at any given time.

The film, which has a budget of over $200m, was expressly designed for the big screen and shot in Imax, 35mm and 70mm.</p> <p>Nolan has long been a champion of the theatrical experience and sources suggest the film-maker himself may be behind the risky move to make Tenet a canary down the mine in the new cinema landscape.</p> <p>The CEO of Imax, Richard Gelfond, told <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/imax-earnings-coronavirus-tenet-1234594049/\">Variety</a>, \u201cChris really would like to be coming out with a film that opens in theatres. I don\u2019t know anyone in America who is pushing harder to get the theatres reopened and to get his movie released than Chris Nolan.\u201d</p> <p>If the studio succeeds in turning a profit from the strategy, it will need public confidence to be high enough for them to venture out, and competitors to remain sufficiently nervous that Tenet is the sole major title playing in most cinemas \u2013 which will be operating at far short of full capacity \u2013 for many weeks.</p> <p>At the present time, only Disney have another major title on the books for July: the long-delayed live-action remake of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK8FHdFluOQ\">Mulan</a>, scheduled for release a week after Tenet.</p> <p>Last week, plans were unveiled for cinemas in the Czech Republic and Norway to reopen later in May.

Since then, distributors, exhibitors and studios have been rapidly recalibrating release strategies as the duration of lockdown \u2013 and subsequent public concerns over going out \u2013 extended.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c3f0dca89996905398a86079b05fc7bf029f4d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3f0dca89996905398a86079b05fc7bf029f4d48/0_0_5000_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trolls World Tour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"415\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Setting digital records \u2026 Trolls: World Tour</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DreamWorks Animation LLC./AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most major releases were moved back to later this year or to 2021, but those which chose to retain their original date and instead launch digitally have been capitalisingon a captive audience hungry for new entertainment.</p> <p>Universal\u2019s family musical Trolls: World Tour took over $100m (\u00a380m) in its first three weeks of release on platforms such as Amazon Prime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/06/is-trolls-world-tour-the-most-important-film-of-2020\">easily breaking records for digital release</a> and prompting Universal\u2019s parent company to suggest that it would seek to collapse the release window once cinemas reopen.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as theatres reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats,\u201d said Jeff Shell, the chief executive of NBCUniversal. His comments were badly received by the world\u2019s two biggest cinema operators \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cc70161-e157-4ff1-bfbd-a886dd6d9af5\">Cineworld </a>and AMC, which owns the Odeon chain in the UK as well as the US\u2019s largest chain of multiplexes.

It is thought to be unlikely a simultaneous online release for such a title would be pursued, as the profit margins for such a release \u2013 as well as its substantial sponsorship campaigns \u2013 would require the maximum possible theatrical footfall.</p> <p>Some sources suggest that Universal may consider a fresh postponement of the release to next year, further suggesting the studio remains committed to cinema releasing.</p> <p>That film\u2019s current release date in the US falls over the Thanksgiving weekend, a traditionally lucrative spot in the calendar, which other studios will be eyeing should No Time to Die move. Earlier this week, Paramount Pictures announced a Christmas release for Top Gun: Maverick, which sees a belated return for Tom Cruise\u2019s flying ace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bd997a7dbe64d086c77b1dd8ca5bb4328ca7922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bd997a7dbe64d086c77b1dd8ca5bb4328ca7922/26_0_817_490/500.jpg\" alt=\"Maximum footfall needed \u2026 No Time to Die\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maximum footfall needed \u2026 No Time to Die</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The studio also announced an early September spot for A Quiet Place 2, which was pulled from the schedules just before its mid-March debut. This echoes the eagerness of exhibitors for an early end to cinema closures, while also allowing for the option of a digitally led campaign.</p> <p>The film, which stars Emily Blunt as the head of a family self-isolating to try and protect themselves against a global threat, would likely follow in the footsteps of Bird Box, Netflix\u2019s similarly themed hit starring Sandra Bullock, which was seen by 45m accounts in its first seven days of release in late 2018.</p> <p>A Quiet Place 2 \u2013 which relies on long periods of near silence punctuated by abrupt and loud moments of shock \u2013 is also a film ideally suited to the drive-in, which has seen a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/may/05/social-distance-cinema-drive-in-theatres-boom-coronavirus-in-pictures\">upturn in popularity</a> since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>While studios have been relatively swift to announce plans for tentpole titles, release strategies for smaller-scale dramas \u2013 thrown off course by both the closure of cinemas and uncertainty over the future of the film festivals where many of them would have begun their journey \u2013 mostly remain murky.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/14/cannes-film-festival-says-2020-edition-cannot-go-ahead-in-original-form\">Cannes </a>and Venice film festivals have still to officially declare whether this year\u2019s editions will be cancelled; that news will likely determine the fates of films vying for next year\u2019s awards.</p> <p>Yet the announcement last week by the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences that the 2021 Oscars would, for one year only, extend its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/academy-awards-oscars-streaming-films-coronavirus\">eligibility criteria</a> to films that had not debuted in cinemas is likely to serve as a considerable reassurance to companies sitting on prestige cinema.</p> <p>It may also be an incentive: if some studios still choose to hold titles back in the hope of maximum theatrical profit, smaller outfits could reap the benefits both in terms of digital revenue and awards acclaim.</p>",
  "<p>As the coronavirus pandemic eats its way into the Amazon, raising fears of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/eve-of-genocide-brazil-urged-save-amazon-tribes-covid-19-sebastiao-salgado\">genocide</a> of its vulnerable indigenous tribes, the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and its supporters are dismantling rules shielding protected reserves. Key environment officials have been sacked, and environmentalists and indigenous leaders fear the pandemic is being used as a smokescreen for a new assault on the rainforest.</p> <p>They say a presidential <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2019/Mpv/mpv910.htm\">decree</a> awaiting congressional approval and new <a href=\"http://www.in.gov.br/web/dou/-/instrucao-normativa-n-9-de-16-de-abril-de-2020-253343033\">rules</a> at the indigenous agency Funai effectively legalise land grabbing in protected forests and indigenous reserves.</p> <p>\u201cThe indigenous peoples are alone and we have to fight against the virus, the loggers and the wildcat miners. We don\u2019t know which is worse,\u201d said Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous leader from Par\u00e1 state.</p> <p>Bolsonaro, notorious for <a href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3540-Bolsonaro\">racist remarks about indigenous people</a> and a nationalist argument in favour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-amazon-rainforest-deforestation\">developing the Amazon</a>, is popular among farmers, wildcat miners, loggers and land grabbers. He said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/like-a-bomb-going-off-why-brazils-largest-reserve-is-facing-destruction-aoe\">Yanomami</a> indigenous reserve \u2013 Brazil\u2019s largest \u2013 was too big and attacked environment agencies for fining people for environmental crimes.</p> <p>In December 2019 he issued a decree known as MP910, allowing farmers squatting up to 2,500 hectares within government-controlled reserves to legalise it. A <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2017/07/temer-signs-law-that-could-see-millions-of-acres-lost-in-the-amazon/\">previous law</a> in 2017 allowed this for land squatted until 2011; Bolsonaro\u2019s decree extended it until 2018.</p> <p>Critics called it the \u201cland grabbers decree\u201d. Grabbing land on federal reserves by deforesting it, burning the dead trees and putting cattle on it to consolidate possession is common practice in the Amazon.</p> <p>\u201cThe measure permits titling public areas which were illegally deforested with the objective of obtaining the land,\u201d <a href=\"https://k6f2r3a6.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nota_Tecnica_MP910_2019_Imazon.pdf\">said</a> Imazon, a non-profit environmentalist group. Federal prosecutors said it would further facilitate land grabbing, <a href=\"http://www.mpf.mp.br/pfdc/manifestacoes-pfdc/notas-tecnicas/nota-tecnica-8-2020-pfdc-mpf\">in a detailed analysis</a>.</p> <p>The decree has until 19 May to be approved by Congress. Lawmakers from the agricultural lobby are pushing for a vote before then, in the midst of the pandemic, after proposing <a href=\"https://www.congressonacional.leg.br/materias/medidas-provisorias/-/mpv/140116\">changes</a> that will effectively make it even easier and cheaper to legalise squatted land \u2013 even if the landowner seeking title has already received a land title under \u201cagrarian reform\u201d schemes and sold it on.</p> <p>On 22 April, Funai published a new rule to allow land grabbers on indigenous reserves to regularise their land, provided the reserve has not completed the lengthy demarcation process. That process can take decades to complete and requires presidential approval \u2013 and Bolsonaro has vowed not to demarcate \u201cone centimetre\u201d more of indigenous land.</p> <p>The Funai employees\u2019 association <a href=\"https://indigenistasassociados.org.br/2020/04/27/nota-tecnica-a-instrucao-normativa-da-funai-no-09-2020-e-a-gestao-de-interesses-em-torno-da-posse-de-terras-publicas/\">said</a> the new rule \u201cturns Funai into a real-estate notary for squatters, land grabbers and land developers in indigenous lands\u201d.</p> <p>The National Council of Human Rights, an independent federal body, called for the rule be revoked, noting that 237 indigenous reserves had yet to complete the demarcation process and another six were \u201crestricted use\u201d areas with reports of isolated groups who have no immunity to common diseases such as the flu, never mind Covid-19. Landgrabbers could now claim title in all of these.</p> <p>In a rare move, 49 federal prosecutors across Brazil <a href=\"http://www.mpf.mp.br/mt/sala-de-imprensa/Documentos%20para%20link/RECMT.pdf\">called</a> for the Funai rule to be annulled for its \u201cunconstitutionality, unconventionality and illegality\u201d.</p> <p>Daniel Azevedo, one of the prosecutors involved, said it encouraged land grabbers who would expect similar decrees to follow.</p> <p>\u201cThe Amazon works like a stock market. What those in power in the country say really influences people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cThis passes on a message that if you deforest now in 2020 or 2021, you will soon become owner of this area,\u201d he added. \u201cThe tendency is the forest will be heavily devastated in the next few years.\u201d</p> <p>Those defending titles for land grabbers argue they will help regularise the Amazon\u2019s chaotic land ownership situation. Allowing farmers <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-tries-novel-fix-for-amazon-deforestation-legalize-squatters-11580486956\">to title land they squatted in the past</a> lets them access credit and improve productivity, reducing their need to expand further into the forest, farmers argue.</p> <p>Senator Iraj\u00e1 Abreu, who is guiding MP910 through Congress, <a href=\"https://congressoemfoco.uol.com.br/meio-ambiente/ministerio-publico-tcu-e-oposicao-alertam-para-os-riscos-da-mp-910/\">told</a> the Congress in Focus site that the land grabbers decree was a \u201cgood law for 99% of Brazilian families, for Brazilian producers, for people who create jobs\u201d. </p> <p>Funai said its new rule would \u201ccorrect unconstitutionalities detected in studies carried out\u201d.</p> <p>Environmentalists challenged that argument. \u201cThe government has a project and it is advancing over the forest, over indigenous peoples, to benefit those who want the forest cut down,\u201d said Mariana Mota, a public policy specialist at Greenpeace Brazil.</p> <p>Deforestation in Brazil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/15/amazon-deforestation-increased-one-third\">began rising in 2013</a>, after a decade of decline and a year after an overhaul of Brazil\u2019s forest code by the leftist president Dilma Rousseff included an amnesty for people who deforested before 2008.

  "<p>Millie Small, the Jamaican singer known for her global 1964 hit My Boy Lollipop, has died aged 73.</p> <p>Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, who originally produced that song, told the Jamaican Observer that she died from a stroke.</p> <p>Recorded under the name Millie, My Boy Lollipop reached No 2 in the UK and US, with Blackwell remembering: \u201cIt became a hit pretty much everywhere in the world \u2026 and it was just incredible how she handled it. She was such a sweet person. Very funny, great sense of humour. She was really special.\u201d In a separate statement, Island Records heralded her as \u201ca true original, a wonderful human being\u201d.</p> <p>Small was born in 1946 in Jamaica\u2019s Clarendon parish, and began her recording career in her mid-teens, cutting singles for the island\u2019s legendary Studio One label. Blackwell discovered her after her duet with Roy Panton, We\u2019ll Meet, topped Jamaican charts and, with her parents\u2019 permission, became her manager and moved her to the UK. \u201cIt felt like I was coming home, that this was where I was meant to be,\u201d she remembered in 2016, having never returned to Jamaica.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwrHCa9t0dM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dwrHCa9t0dM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>She recorded My Boy Lollipop shortly after moving to London, a song originally recorded by New York singer Barbie Gaye in 1956. The \u201cshuffle\u201d style of US R&amp;B used by Gaye had become popular in the Caribbean and mutated into ska; Small\u2019s sweet, charming and high-pitched vocal, combined with the novelty of the unfamiliar new style, made My Boy Lollipop a huge hit. As well as its transatlantic success, it also topped the Australian charts.</p> <p>In a 2016 interview she claimed that Rod Stewart played harmonica on the song \u2013 \u201cI can see him now at the studio, leaning against the wall. Cute little boy. A very nice-mannered guy\u201d \u2013 though Stewart has said session player Pete Hogman played it. Small also claimed in 2016 that she had not received any royalties for My Boy Lollipop.</p> <p>Small had another UK chart placing in 1964 with Sweet William, which reached No 30, though that would be her only other Top 40 hit.</p> <p>Her recording career ended in 1970, and she moved to Singapore. She reappeared on a London news report in 1987, poor and living in a youth hostel with a young daughter. Speaking in 2016, she said: \u201cI focused on being a mother from 1984, when my daughter was born, and since then I\u2019ve been happy living a quiet life, sleeping and dreaming and meditating.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Fake news laws and political interference along with growing financial pressures has left many independent media groups in developing countries fighting to survive during the pandemic.</p> <p>News outlets around the world have faced measures to muzzle critical reporting in an environment that has already seen dozens of journalists harassed, arrested and censored by governments, according to editors and press freedom groups.</p> <p>Press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, which has launched a <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/news/rsf-launches-tracker-19-track-covid-19s-impact-press-freedom\">dedicated tracker</a> to record the impact of coronavirus on journalism, has reported abuses in more than a dozen countries, including Iran, Egypt and Brazil.</p> <p>In the group\u2019s annual <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/2020-world-press-freedom-index-entering-decisive-decade-journalism-exacerbated-coronavirus\">global report</a> on press freedom last week, secretary general Christophe Deloire said the pandemic had given countries the chance \u201cto take advantage of the fact that politics are on hold, the public is stunned and protests are out of the question, in order to impose measures that would be impossible in normal times\u201d.</p> <p>Khadija Patel, editor-in-chief of South Africa\u2019s <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/\">Mail &amp; Guardian</a>, said even though the country\u2019s newspapers have been delivering important public interest reporting, they have been left in financial peril.</p> <p>She warned that unless there was a dramatic culture shift towards news media, the integrity of independent journalism could be at risk.</p> <p>\u201cThe news media needs to be reclaimed as a public good, it should not be seen as the playground of a few billionaires. The saddest sign would be for us to emerge from this pandemic with a handful of billionaires controlling all of our news,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Mainstream Indian media have offered little critical reporting, according to executive editor of the<a href=\"https://caravanmagazine.in/\"> Caravan</a> journal, Vinod Jose, who pointed to a meeting prime minister Narendra Modi reportedly held with more than 20 media chiefs in March.</p> <p>He said the media\u2019s financial and political independence is linked in India because as revenues fall companies may be forced to turn towards tax rebates and government advertising to survive.</p> <p>\u201cGoing forward, the challenges for Indian media will only increase, because an authoritarian government who is interested in killing journalism is in power, and a media who doesn\u2019t have the guts to speak truth to power or the financial independence to stay afloat without taking government advertisements constitutes the mainstream press in India,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Many outlets are reliant on print advertising and have suffered major losses as circulation has almost ground to a halt amid lockdowns and curfews around the world.</p> <p>Patel said the cancellation of major advertising campaigns meant the Mail &amp; Guardian was suddenly struggling even while its website recorded its best audience numbers.</p> <p>\u201cWithin days of the first [Covid-19] case our CEO had to address staff and say the way things are looking, in April we may not be able to pay salaries,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Financial problems would have a severe impact on how journalists work, and some smaller publications may not survive, Patel added.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, the <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/DNR_2019_FINAL.pdf\">Reuters Institute for Journalism</a>\u2019s 2019 report into digital media described the future for South Africa\u2019s media as \u201cgrim\u201d because of low online revenue and plummeting advertising.</p> <p>Philanthropic organisation Luminate has argued that with print circulations grinding to a halt for many newspapers and their business models destroyed, the pandemic could become a \u201c<a href=\"https://luminategroup.com/storage/894/IFPIM-Feasibility-Study.pdf\">media extinction event</a>\u201d.</p> <p>As a solution, it has renewed its call for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/05/a-free-press-is-the-lifeblood-of-democracy-journalists-must-not-be-silenced\">global fund</a> to help public interest media maintain their independence.</p> <p>The editor of the <a href=\"https://www.dhakatribune.com/\">Dhaka Tribune</a>, Zafar Sobhan, said the crisis should be a wake-up call for Bangladesh\u2019s media, as it accelerates the downfall of print news and potentially puts those who are unable to adapt out of business.</p> <p>\u201cPrint circulation was already in freefall. This could be the knockout blow. Monetising online has proved difficult in Bangladesh. Now we have no choice but to get up to speed and figure out online revenue models that will pay,\u201d said Sobhan.</p>",

The Victorian opposition has blasted the state government\u2019s handling of the matter, including refusing to name Cedar Meats as the location of the outbreak, despite other outbreaks at schools and nursing homes being named.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/cedar-meats-coronavirus-cluster-victorian-business-says-it-was-not-told-until-three-days-after-diagnosis\">Cedar Meats coronavirus cluster: Victorian business says it was not told until three days after diagnosis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The business <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/cedar-meats-coronavirus-cluster-victorian-business-says-it-was-not-told-until-three-days-after-diagnosis\">has said</a> it was not informed for three weeks after a staff member tested positive. There have now been 49 cases of the virus at the plant.</p> \n<p>Seven of the other new cases relate to returned travellers in quarantine hotels, while another six are still being investigated.</p> \n<p>It comes amid higher testing rates in Victoria, far ahead of any other state, with 100,000 tests being conducted in a two-week period.</p> \n<h2>South Australia marks two weeks with no cases</h2> \n<p>South Australia recorded no new confirmed cases of coronavirus for two weeks. Western Australia has recorded no new confirmed cases in a week, and the ACT also reported no new confirmed cases.</p> \n<h2>Government admits issues with Covidsafe app on iPhones</h2> \n<p>The Digital Transformation Agency told a Senate committee hearing that the Covid-19 contact tracing app, Covidsafe, is less effective on iPhones when the phone is locked, or the app is running in the background.</p> \n<p>The operation also differs on older iPhones.</p> \n<p>The government is working on a fix for this with Apple but it will be at least two weeks before the iPhone version works as well as the Android version of the app.</p> \n<p>More than 5.1 million Australians have downloaded and registered on the app.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Andrew Constance withdraws from Eden-Monaro race</h2> \n<p>Less than 24 hours after announcing his candidacy for the federal seat of Eden-Monaro, the New South Wales transport minister, Andrew Constance, has withdrawn from the race, citing the need to focus on bushfire recovery efforts in the area, and work on public transport and roads in NSW.</p> \n<p>He later blamed being \u201csidelined\u201d by the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro, who was also going to run in the seat but pulled out, and had some colourful descriptors of the minister splashed in one of the state\u2019s tabloid newspapers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I said politics is stuffed in this country, and some of the people in it need to have a long hard look, I meant it,\u201d Constance said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Telegraph.

  "<p>The harbour master on duty when the Ruby Princess docked in Sydney on 19 March offered to \u201cturn it around\u201d when he was called by the Australian Border Force expressing concerns about the ship, a special commission of inquiry has heard.</p> \n<p>The inquiry into the cruise ship, which has been linked to 21 deaths and almost 700 cases of Covid-19, also heard that the ship was \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney because coronavirus swabs on board needed urgent testing, and that a sick passenger was taken by ambulance<strong> </strong>\u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d of Royal Prince Alfred hospital.</p> \n<p>Here are the main development\u2019s from Wednesday\u2019s evidence.</p> \n<h2>Harbour master called by Border Force</h2> \n<p>Cameron Butchart, the port services manager and duty harbour master for the NSW Port Authority, told the inquiry he had \u201ca concern for the occupational health and safety\u201d of sending a pilot on board to help the ship dock, because of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>He said on the night of 18 March and again on 19 March he was called by representatives of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis particular person certainly had concerns with the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI used the phrase on the night \u2018turn it around\u2019 [which] was probably the simplest way to explain it to someone on shoreside.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we more than likely could have held the ship in a certain position. We could have dropped an anchor ... to allow us to gather some more facts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Commissioner Bret Walker SC asked Butchart: \u201cHad you ever experienced anything like that before?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d Butchart said.</p> \n<p>The inquiry heard on Tuesday that the Ruby Princess was allowed to dock after a second call from the same Border Force officer.</p> \n<p>Butchart rejected the idea that Home Affairs and Border Force were \u201cnot decision makers\u201d and said they \u201cwould have been working very closely with biosecurity in making this decision\u201d to let the ship dock.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday the Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, told a separate Senate inquiry the officer \u201cdidn\u2019t tell the harbour master what he or she should or shouldn\u2019t do. They\u2019ve got no legislated authority to do that\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Wednesday the port agent for Carnival Australia, the operator of the Ruby Princess, told the inquiry ABF officers were \u201caware\u201d that 11 passengers were in isolation on board with influenza-like illnesses.</p> \n<p>Dobrila Tokovic said she met three ABF officers and one from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment at 6am on 19 March and \u201c[the ABF] asked me about the people in isolation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were aware of them already,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me about where they were, were they isolated. I was advised that they didn\u2019t want to see them.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said it was \u201cnot unusual for ABF officers to not want to see passengers who may be unwell\u201d, and they could collect cards and details without coming face-to-face.</p> \n<h2>Paramedic taken to \u2018Covid-designated\u2019 area</h2> \n<p>The inquiry also heard testimony from two parademics who attended the ship on 19 March to take two passengers directly to hospital.</p> \n<p>Trainee paramedic Simeon Pridmore said he wrote in his case description that \u201con board testing showed negative for influenza and [the patient was] suspected Covid\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pridmore said the ambulance he was in was taken<strong> </strong>\u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when it arrived at Royal Prince Alfred hospital.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Tokovic<strong> </strong>said the ship\u2019s doctor, Ilse von Watzdorf, told her the ambulances were for patients with \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves, rather than Covid-19.</p> \n<p>She was questioned on why the patients were taken to RPA rather than St Vincent\u2019s, which was the usual hospital used for cruise ship passengers.</p> \n<p>Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, said a transcript of her call showed she told paramedics: \u201cWe\u2019ve been requested by New South Wales [sic] to take them to the Royal Prince Alfred.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tokovic told the inquiry: \u201cWe always select St Vincent\u2019s, as just a common, \u2018please send them to St Vincent\u2019s\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<p>Beasley told the inquiry Royal Prince Alfred was \u201callocated as a \u2018Covid response hospital\u2019\u201d and asked if Tokovic if she recalled discussing that fact.</p> \n<p>Tokovic said she did not recall.</p> \n<h2>Passenger was on oxygen support</h2> \n<p>Another paramedic, Mathew Symonds, told the inquiry that when he boarded the ship and went to its medical centre on 19 March, one of the passengers was receiving oxygen treatment using \u201cnasal prongs\u201d, also known as an \u201coxygen nasal cannula\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tokovic had earlier told the inquiry that when paramedics boarded the ship, she heard the on-board doctor discuss one patient\u2019s \u201coxygen saturation\u201d with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe said that was what had changed throughout the night,\u201d Tokovic said</p> \n<p>Symonds said he then provided the patient with oxygen while transporting her, and the woman had had an oxygen saturation of 94%, which \u201cwith a comorbidity of emphysema\u201d would \u201cnot strike me as odd\u201d.</p> \n<p>The woman later tested positive for Covid-19 and died in hospital.</p> \n<p>In a written statement, Symonds said that when he boarded, the ship\u2019s doctor or nurse said other passengers had already left the ship and gone to hospital to get tested for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Walker asked Symonds if he could have been confused and been told that \u201cswabs\u201d rather than passengers \u201chad been disembarked for testing\u201d. Symonds said that was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d the case.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>\u2018Not a Covid ship\u2019</h2> \n<p>The inquiry also heard from Robert Rybanic, the senior manager of cruise and terminal operations at NSW Port Authority, who said that Paul Mifsud, a manager of Carnival Australia, told him the ship was \u201cnot a Covid ship\u201d and \u201cit was basically business as usual\u201d.</p> \n<p>Rybanic told the inquiry he spoke to Mifsud on the phone and Mifsud \u201ccould not explain at all why the ship docked\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe [Mifsud] said that NSW Health had deemed the ship low risk,\u201d Rybanic said. \u201cHe said it was not a Covid ship, that the booking of ambulances were not related to Covid.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Ship \u2018hurried\u2019 back for tests \u2013 which were delayed by 16 hours</h2> \n<p>The inquiry heard the Ruby Princess \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney because it had Covid-19 swabs that needed urgent testing, and as a result Border Force officers were not present when it docked.</p> \n<p>Tokovic told the inquiry the ship was scheduled to dock at 6am, but came in at 3am.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The ABF] are present on the basis of the scheduled disembarkation time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would not have been on site until 6am.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, she said she called an ABF manager to \u201cnotify them the vessel is coming in earlier\u201d and told them that two passengers needed immediate ambulance transfers to hospital.</p> \n<p>But the inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/ruby-princess-was-initially-refused-permission-to-dock-over-coronavirus-fears-inquiry-told\">heard the previous day</a> that the Covid-19 test results from the swabs were delayed by 16 hours because the laboratory did not prioritise them.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday Beasley told the inquiry that after the delay, the swabs were put through testing and the results came back at 8am on 20 March.</p> \n<p>The inquiry, overseen by Bret Walker SC, continues on Friday.</p>",

  "<p>The government\u2019s announcement of a Covid-19 <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882884/Government_support_package_for_higher_education_providers_and_students.pdf\">support package</a> for universities on 4 May comes with the promise that it will \u201chelp stabilise most providers\u2019 finances\u201d. The killer word is \u201cmost\u201d. Read between the lines and the conclusion is obvious: some universities won\u2019t make it. On the same day, Roehampton University announced a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoehamptonUCU/status/1257418143888261120?s=20\">plan to cut 15% of posts</a>. Even the institutions best equipped to survive are facing considerable pain. But the problems didn\u2019t start with coronavirus: it\u2019s just making an already bad situation worse.</p> <p>The immediate problem for universities is the prospect of a collapse in international student recruitment. Along with the loss of income from accommodation rentals and summer conferences, the resulting <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/10871/LE_report_on_covid19_and_university_finances/pdf/LEreportoncovid19anduniversityfinances\">financial black hole</a> is estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-uk-universities-face-25bn-tuition-fee-loss-next-year\">at least \u00a32.5bn</a>. Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk as applicants consider whether attending university this autumn \u2013 when it\u2019s likely social distancing will still be in place \u2013 is their best option.</p> <p>The government\u2019s response addresses universities\u2019 immediate cashflow problem by bringing forward payments of research funding and tuition fees (which are not paid directly by students but come from government). It promises to fund up to 10,000 extra student places, half of them in health and social care. But that in no way fills the financial gap. In an effort to prevent poaching, universities have agreed not to increase their intake of home students by <a href=\"universities%20have%20agreed%20not%20to%20increase%20their%20intake%20of%20home%20students%20by%20more%20than%205%\">more than 5%</a>. This sounds a reasonable compromise, but a 5% increase to a cohort of 300 students at a large university could ripple through other institutions leaving the last in the chain with a devastating drop in numbers. Similar trends in recruitment following the removal of student number controls in 2015 have already left <a href=\"https://medium.com/ussbriefs/stockpiling-students-undergraduate-history-and-english-edition-ca65972ed823\">some departments</a> in crisis. It is not at all clear that the promised new rules to \u201cprevent destabilising behaviours\u201d will change the longer-term trend.</p> <p>On top of that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/08/tuition-fees-cut-could-be-devastating-for-universities-say-peers\">research funding</a> has fallen by 12.8% in real terms since 2010. The gap has been filled, in part, by international students, who pay much higher fees than home undergraduates. The number of Chinese students in the UK <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7976/\">increased by 62%</a> between 2011-12 and 2018-19. There were already concerns that the impact of Brexit and the hostile environment on international recruitment left some universities dangerously exposed \u2013 now thousands of those prospective international students may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/uk-universities-fear-huge-budget-holes-as-chinese-students-stay-home\">stay</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/uk-universities-fear-huge-budget-holes-as-chinese-students-stay-home\"> at home this year</a>. With <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10342/Value-of-university-staff-pay-has-plummeted-in-last-decade-employers-own-research-reveals\">staff pay</a> squeezed in real terms since 2009, university managers have little room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>It is clear, moreover, that the government is unlikely to intervene if things go wrong. In November 2018 the head of the Office for Students, Michael Barber, warned that \u201cfailing institutions\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/nov/06/failing-universities-bailouts-michael-barber-office-for-students\">could not expect a bailout</a>. The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/805127/Review_of_post_18_education_and_funding.pdf\">Augar </a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/805127/Review_of_post_18_education_and_funding.pdf\">review</a> of higher education, which reported in May 2019, got limited attention amid the preoccupation with Brexit, and its headline proposal for a cut in tuition fees from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/08/tuition-fees-cut-could-be-devastating-for-universities-say-peers\">\u00a39,250 to \u00a37,500 a year</a> was said to have been \u201cquietly shelved\u201d a few months later.</p> <p>The broader proposals, however, are still well worth a look. Augar was concerned about the amount of money universities were spending on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/02/universities-spending-millions-on-marketing-to-attract-students\">marketing</a>: up to \u00a3500 per student. Marketing spend and investment in attractive campuses that appeal to open day visitors are predictable consequences of a highly competitive market, but they take vital cash away from education.</p> <p>Also prominent in the Augar review was a plan to clamp down on courses perceived to offer poor employment prospects and long-term earnings (with a note that nursing and teaching should be exceptions). But this failed to take account of the structural problems in access to high-earning jobs. It\u2019s well documented that working-class students face <a href=\"https://createlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panic-Social-Class-Taste-and-Inequalities-in-the-Creative-Industries1.pdf\">particular barriers</a> to entry to the arts sector, for example. Even if a performing arts student never makes a full-time career of it, he might well make a big contribution to society by running a theatre group in his spare time, something that employment and earnings measure simply don\u2019t capture. Access to arts and culture online has kept many of us going through the lockdown. Let\u2019s not write these subjects off as low value.</p> <p>There is a good case for maintaining a strong university sector. The demographic dip in the number of 18-year-olds that has exacerbated admissions problems for the past few years is about to end. More young people typically go to university during recessions. But without further support, their prospects are grim.</p> <p>Redundancies now mean there will be fewer experienced staff to teach and support students in future. There is a real risk that between the mergers of institutions in financial trouble (a likely prospect following the <a href=\"https://wonkhe.com/blogs/even-in-the-covid-crisis-universities-are-not-too-big-to-fail/\">precedent</a> of the further education sector) and the attacks on \u201clow value\u201d courses, student choice will suffer. That choice should not be just about who gets into the \u201cprestigious\u201d institutions, but about offering people across the country a good selection of local courses that suit their lives and learning style. Higher education is a public good: it would be a deep shame to approach this crisis with a focus on its price, rather than understanding its value.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Fletcher is professor of history at Manchester Metropolitan University<br></p>",

  "<p>Russia stepped decisively off a path of western-led global integration on the morning of 25 October 2003. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/26/mikhail-khodorkovsky-life-after-prison-russia-after-putin\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a>, the country\u2019s richest man and the chief shareholder in its largest energy company, Yukos, had touched down to refuel his private jet in Novosibirsk when Russian Federal Security Service commandos forced their way on to the aircraft and arrested him on trumped up charges of fraud and tax evasion. Khodorkovsky was swiftly remanded in Moscow\u2019s notorious Matrosskaya Tishina jail while the Kremlin put the finishing touches on a show trial that would see the oligarch sentenced to nine years in a Siberian prison.</p> <p>Khodorkovsky was no saint: he had amassed a vast fortune during the chaotic and corrupt privatisations of the Yeltsin years while most of the country was reduced to poverty, and few mourned his downfall. But the unceremonious seizure and dismemberment of his business empire by a shadowy clique of men surrounding the president Vladimir Putin ushered in a disturbing new era in Russian politics. The Kremlin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/28/russia-order-pay-50bn-yukos-shareholders-khodorkovsky-court\">destruction of Yukos </a>forms the central chapter in Catherine Belton\u2019s fearless and fascinating account of the emergence of the Putin regime from the ashes of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>A renowned business journalist who spent years covering Russia for the Financial Times, Belton follows the money. She has an unrivalled command of the labyrinthine history of share schemes, refinancing packages, mergers, shell companies, and offshore accounts that lay bare the stealthy capture of the post-Soviet economy and state institutions by a coterie of former KGB officers, or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/west-putin-russia-spymaster-spies-ukraine-us\">siloviki</a></em>. Belton combines this financial history with testimony from a dazzling array of Kremlin insiders, diplomats, intelligence officers, prosecutors, mobsters and oligarchs. The result reads at times like a John le Carr\u00e9 novel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a785f73bba14fcdd76f819e9df89c20ba3f44c1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a785f73bba14fcdd76f819e9df89c20ba3f44c1d/0_0_1436_2200/653.jpg\" alt=\"Putin with Angela Merkel at the Dostoyevsky Monument in Dresden, 2006.\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Putin with Angela Merkel at the Dostoyevsky Monument in Dresden, 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Sinyakov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hazy invocations of Putin\u2019s KGB past have become something of a journalistic cliche. Belton, however, gives a granular account of Putin\u2019s early years as an agent in Dresden not simply as an ominous feature of his biography but as the seedbed of the regime over which he would preside. Like Putin, the <em>siloviki</em> who came to form his inner circle cut their teeth in the KGB\u2019s clandestine operations in the final years of the cold war. They learned sophisticated techniques for washing money through fake companies abroad in order to finance Kremlin-friendly political movements and developed illicit networks for smuggling sanctioned western technology back into the Soviet Union. They sowed disinformation to discredit western leaders, perfected the use of <em>kompromat</em> to blackmail businessmen and officials and forged alliances with terrorist groups and organised crime. Updated for an era of globalisation and the internet, this toolkit now supports the Kremlin\u2019s grip on power at home and its long political reach abroad.</p> <p>Yet Putin does not emerge from these pages as an evil, cat-stroking mastermind plotting his moves years in advance. Rather he appears an unscrupulous and resourceful operator, ready to deploy any weapon, break any rule and subvert any system to consolidate his power, wealth and international prestige. The <em>siloviki</em> worked things out as they went along. As the Soviet Union began to unravel, they siphoned off vast sums from the dwindling economy to ensure the survival of their networks at home and abroad. The 1990s saw them shut out of power as pro-western oligarchs such as Khodorkovsky held sway in the Kremlin. But they bided their time, and they plotted.</p> <p>Although he is often portrayed as the \u201caccidental president\u201d, Putin\u2019s rise to the presidency did not have \u201cmuch to do with chance\u201d. In 1999, the <em>siloviki</em> launched a coordinated attack on Yeltsin\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d of relatives, advisers and oligarchs, leaking damaging evidence of corruption to prosecutors at home and abroad. Mired in scandal and fearful of an old guard restoration led by former communists, the family cast around for a biddable figure to replace the ailing and erratic president and protect their interests. The Kremlin\u2019s fixer-in-chief Sergei Pugachev pushed his protege Putin, who had proved himself an effective bureaucrat and whose principal charm lay in the fact that \u201che was as obedient as a dog\u201d. Turning a blind eye to Putin\u2019s own background in the security services, the family anointed him prime minister in August 1999 and then, when Yeltsin abruptly resigned on the eve of the new millennium, president of the Russian Federation. Fearing a \u201ccoup by forces from the communist past, what the Yeltsin family had in fact succumbed to,\u201d Belton writes, \u201cwas a creeping coup by the security men.\u201d The fox was in the hen house.</p> <p>With their man now installed in the Kremlin, the <em>siloviki</em> began \u201cto carve up the country\u2019s strategic assets for themselves\u201d. They targeted one company after another, probing weaknesses and exploiting the chequered past of every businessman who had made a fortune in the chaos of the preceding decade. They saw the role of state institutions \u2013 the tax office, law enforcement, the judiciary \u2013 not as upholding certain rules by which all economic actors had to operate, but rather as a \u201cpredatory machine\u201d that could be used to destroy rivals and seize their assets.</p> <p>Under Putin, the <em>siloviki</em> have amassed a vast slush fund that serves both personal avarice and geopolitical strategy. The soaring fortunes of Putin\u2019s inner circle, glimpsed in the revelations of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\">Panama Papers,</a> are indistinguishable from the vast off-the-books war chest that the Kremlin draws on to finance its subterfuge and interventions abroad. And if there is an ideological glue that binds the <em>siloviki</em> together, it is their dream of a restoration of Moscow\u2019s imperial might and the conviction that the west is out to get Russia. The revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine of 2004-5 fed Putin\u2019s \u201cdark paranoia\u201d that the Kremlin was threatened by a western plot to topple his regime. The Kremlin has subsequently revelled in escalating conflicts with the western powers as a marker of Russia\u2019s newly regained stature on the world stage. At home, a slavish media celebrates Russian military exploits in Ukraine and Syria, while abroad, the Kremlin\u2019s media networks spew a stream of innuendo and obfuscation that creates mistrust in western governments and institutions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Western banks have laundered the Kremlin\u2019s money and allowed it to penetrate into the economies of Europe and the US</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, Putin\u2019s regime has held up an unflattering mirror to the west. Belton shows how western governments that preach the rule of the law, free markets and respect for private property have turned a blind eye to the plunder of Russian businesses by the Kremlin and its allies. Western companies have rushed to sign new deals that legitimised the proceeds of these corporate raids; western banks have laundered the Kremlin\u2019s money and allowed it to penetrate into the economies of Europe and the US; western political parties and institutions have shown themselves ready to accept donations of dirty Russian money. \u201cIt looks like the whole of US politics is for sale,\u201d one former senior Russian banker tells Belton. \u201cWe believed in western values \u2026 But it turned out everything depended on money, and all these values were pure hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>A groundbreaking and meticulously researched anatomy of the Putin regime, Belton\u2019s book shines a light on the pernicious threats Russian money and influence now pose to the west. Deepening social inequality and the rise of populist movements in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis have \u201cleft the west wide open to Russia\u2019s aggressive new tactics of fuelling the far right and the far left\u201d. Kremlin largesse has funded political parties across the continent, from the National Front in France to Jobbik in Hungary and the Five Star movement in Italy, which are united in their hostility to both the EU and Nato.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global confirmed cases exceed 3.65 million</strong></h2> <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 3,656,644 people have been infected since the outbreak began, while at least 256,736 are known to have died. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale</a> of the outbreak.</p> <h2><strong>White House wants to wind down Covid-19 task force</strong></h2> <p>Mike Pence has confirmed that the Trump administration is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/trump-coronavirus-taskforce-pence-us-death-toll\">looking to wind down the coronavirus task force</a> in the coming weeks, even as the rate of new infections continues to rise across most of the US. Meanwhile at least 70,847 people are now known to have died in the USA, <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University</a>. That represents more than a quarter of all pandemic-linked deaths reported across the world.</p> <h2><strong>Donald Trump says it\u2019s time to reopen businesses</strong></h2> <p>Speaking in Arizona at a factory manufacturing medical masks, Trump said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-arizona-coronavirus-reopening\">time to reopen businesses</a>. \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>Asia Pacific nations push to end lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Several Asia Pacific countries are aiming to ease their lockdowns and kickstart their economies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/global-report-several-asia-pacific-nations-pass-covid-19-peak-and-plot-return-to-work\">including South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong</a>. Vietnam is also easing its restrictions but the country\u2019s economy, in which tourism plays a major role, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/06/vietnam-crushed-the-coronavirus-outbreak-but-now-faces-severe-economic-test\">faces a severe test</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Record daily deaths in Brazil</strong></h2> <p>According to the nation\u2019s health ministry, there have been 6,935 new cases of the novel coronavirus in Brazil since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April. Meanwhile the capital of tropical Maranh\u00e3o state ground largely to a halt Tuesday, becoming the first major Brazilian city to enter a lockdown in the hopes of preventing the coronavirus pandemic from overwhelming the health care system of one of the country\u2019s poorest states.</p> <h2><strong>UK youth unemployment may reach 1 million</strong></h2> <p>Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year, a thinktank has warned, saying that Britain faces the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">risk of a \u201cdole queue\u201d future for young people</a> unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education.</p> <h2><strong>Covid-19 lockdown risks 1.4 million extra TB deaths by 2025: study</strong></h2> <p>The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a \u201cdevastating\u201d surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths from the world\u2019s biggest infectious killer by 2025, new research showed on Wednesday. New disease models showed that social distancing could lead to a disastrous rebound in TB infections \u2013 the effects of which are set to persist for years. This is because social distancing will make it impossible for health care workers to test vulnerable populations and for patients to access ongoing treatments.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand reports one new case after two days with no cases</strong></h2> <p>After two consecutive days of zero new corona cases reported, New Zealand reported one new case of the virus on Wednesday, and one new death. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said New Zealand wasn\u2019t out of the woods yet and needed to stay the course: \u201cWe need everyone to stick to the plan and follow the rules\u2026 not doing so risks undoing all of the good work we\u2019ve done so far. Do not give it an inch.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The pandemic has cost Walt Disney US$1.4bn in the last three months</strong></h2> <p>Walt Disney will kick off its strategy next week to begin restoring its lucrative parks business that has suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/05/disney-earnings-losses-coronavirus-parks-disney-plus\">$1bn in lost profits from the coronavirus-led shutdown</a>. Disney said on Tuesday it will reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on May 11 but severely limit the number of guests and enforce strict social distancing measures on rides and in restaurants.</p>",
  "<p> \u2018I wanted it to be relatable to any woman who\u2019s ever worked in an office,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/the-assistant-kitty-green-metoo-weinstein-inspired-thriller\">Kitty Green</a> of her new film The Assistant. \u201cEverything in the film has been in the press already. But I wanted to take viewers on an emotional journey, so they could empathise with the character.\u201d</p> <p>The #MeToo saga has been examined to near exhaustion, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/23/the-assistant-review-metoo-drama-offers-unsettling-study-of-day-to-day-abuse\">The Assistant</a> manages to add something new. Rather than perpetrators or victims, it focuses on a relative bystander: a young office worker at a New York film production company. We follow this character, played by Julia Garner, through her demeaning routine: commuting in before daybreak, photocopying, printing, taking her male co-workers\u2019 lunch orders, clearing up leftover pizza from the meeting room (as the men come in for the next meeting, she is humiliatingly caught with a crust in her mouth).</p> <p>All this is interspersed with moments of everyday sexism and bullying communications from the Weinstein-like boss next door, who is not named or depicted. The Assistant doesn\u2019t amp up the drama or trowel on the message: instead, it shines a cold, clear light on a culture of complicity, silence and misogyny, not to mention the general dehumanising nature of office life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b26c3ba95cdba2ec798bfd8f28c1472efc64a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b26c3ba95cdba2ec798bfd8f28c1472efc64a0c/0_0_3508_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Micro-aggressions \u2026 Julia Garner in Kitty Green\u2019s The Assistant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micro-aggressions \u2026 Julia Garner in Kitty Green\u2019s The Assistant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Forensic Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Green\u2019s previous films were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/24/casting-jonbenet-review-documentary-kitty-green-sundance\">documentaries</a>, often centred on women, often stylistically adventurous. But for The Assistant, she opts for an unfussy approach. \u201cIn fiction film-making,\u201d she says, \u201cyou can use the closeup to amplify micro-aggressions, tiny moments that often get overlooked.\u201d Green still researched her story like a documentary, though, interviewing hundreds of working women worldwide. \u201cThe more real you make it, the more people are forced to interrogate their own role in all this.\u201d</p> <p>As well as its relevance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> moment, The Assistant is a type of film we\u2019ve been seeing a lot in US cinema lately: one concerned with everyday experience, particularly of those on the lower rungs if not the margins \u2013 yet reflective of modern America as a whole. Authentic settings and scenarios are prioritised over exaggerated dramatics or showy technique (if you want an example of the latter in terms of #MeToo, go see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/09/bombshell-review-margot-robbie-charlize-theron-nicole-kidman\">Bombshell</a>).</p> <p>Strikingly, many of these films are being made by and/or about women. We\u2019ve had the likes of Debra Granik\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/19/best-films-2018-uk-leave-no-trace\">Leave No Trace</a>, about a disturbed survivalist father and his teenage daughter living in the woods; Sean Baker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/the-florida-project-review-sean-baker-walt-disney-world\">The Florida Project</a>, which follows a single mother living hand to mouth in an Orlando motel; Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/20/rider-review-bronco-rider-chloe-zhao-south-dakota-drama-documentary\">The Rider</a>, about a Dakota rodeo star suffering ahead injury.

But in the US, the idea of realism has never quite taken root. In commercial Hollywood especially, sociopolitical issues must always be refracted through the prism of genre: horror and sci-fi are the popular choices. Escapist cinema will always have its appeal. But perhaps, given America\u2019s current \u2013 and worsening \u2013 predicament, audiences are now starting to crave films that strive to make sense of the here and now, rather than distract from it.</p> <p>A further sign comes in the form of Eliza Hittman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/never-rarely-sometimes-always-review-powerful-abortion-drama\">Never Rarely Sometimes Always</a>, about to have a streaming release in the UK. It concerns a Pennsylvanian teenager who travels to New York with her cousin to get a termination. As with The Assistant, the drama is low-key, almost documentary-like. There is no speechifying and no sentimentality: the characters don\u2019t learn a redeeming lesson, offer a political insight or bond in a heartwarming way. Instead, we\u2019re faced with the bare, brutal reality of the situation, which is compounded by the fact that these young women have no money, nowhere to stay, and little experience of the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hjw_QTKr2rc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc\">Watch a trailer for Never Rarely Sometimes Always</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2007, the drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/11/worldcinema.drama\">4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</a>, told a similar story about a woman seeking an illegal termination in Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s Romania. Modern-day America looks just as grim in Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which won an award at Sundance this year in the category of <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/projects/award-winner-tba-20\">neorealism</a>. Tellingly, this was a new category at the festival.</p> <p>Could the prevalence of female film-makers have something to do with this wave? Opportunities have improved in recent years, it could be said, resulting in fresh perspectives on both the plight of women and the fragilities of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/men\">male identity</a> in modern America. It would be wrong, however, to assume that female film-makers naturally lean towards more personal, real-life subjects. A more likely factor, suggests Green, is the industry\u2019s lingering apprehension over women.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll fund us,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen it\u2019s an area they think we have authority on. If I came to them with a dystopian sci-fi movie, they might not believe I could pull it off. But if I say it\u2019s about a 25-year-old assistant, they might think: \u2018Oh, OK, that\u2019s something she might know something about.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hardship and poverty often go hand in hand with realism, and not just in front of the camera. One reason Italian neorealism caught on worldwide was because it was cheap to make. Perhaps this is why it never really took root in the US. \u201cThe idea of a socially conscious, class-conscious cinema has always been deeply suspect in America,\u201d says Paul Malcolm, film programmer at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.</p> <p>Perhaps, he adds, the US establishment was reluctant to admit to a foreign influence, especially when its focus on societal ills and the plight of the working class came with connotations of socialism and communism. A very slender realist thread does run through US film history, however, says Malcolm, who recently co-curated a film season entitled <a href=\"https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2020/american-neorealism\">American Neorealism, Part One (1948 to 1984)</a>. This showcased the likes of John Cassavetes\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/shadows-cassavetes-arthouse\">Shadows</a> (a rough, jazzy race drama shot on the streets of 1950s New York), Jerry Schatzberg\u2019s The Panic in Needle Park (with the young Al Pacino as a 1970s junkie) and Barbara Loden\u2019s Wanda (in which she plays a runaway wife drifting through grimy 1970s Pennsylvania).</p> <p>To these we should add landmark African-American films such as Shirley Clarke\u2019s The Cool World and Charles Burnett\u2019s Killer of Sheep. The neorealist strand also runs through black and minority film-making, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/boyz-n-the-hood-review-blistering-humanitarian-classic-john-singleton\">Boyz N t</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/27/boyz-n-the-hood-review-blistering-humanitarian-classic-john-singleton\">he Hood</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/fruitvale-station-review-oscar-grant\">Fruitvale Station</a>. Part two of UCLA\u2019s film season is on hiatus due to the pandemic, but the list of potential candidates is getting longer by the month.</p> <p>Ironically, economic adversity could actually be a factor in the scarcity of US realism. It often becomes a calling card. Film-makers who have paid their dues and garnered critical acclaim through realist dramas are often tempted to bigger (but not always better) things. It happened to such great Italian neorealists as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/08/vittorio-de-sica-tragic-film-makers\">Vittoria de Sica</a>, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd5934a8ca8f99e2845ea337b42e904adbe67ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd5934a8ca8f99e2845ea337b42e904adbe67ed8/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasin McKenzie in Debra Granik\u2019s Leave No Trace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotional impact \u2026 Thomasin McKenzie in Debra Granik\u2019s Leave No Trace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also happening to their current US successors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/01/kelly-reichardt-certain-women-director-michelle-williams-kristen-stewart-slow-cinema-maile-meloy\">Kelly Reichardt</a> successfully transposed her realist sensibility to such period pieces as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/14/meeks-cutoff-review\">Meek\u2019s Cutoff</a>. Her latest, First Cow, may be set in the 1820s, but is no less a tale of graft and survival. On the other hand, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao is currently working on the Marvel movie Eternals, which is unlikely to ever be confused with The Rider. Still, while it marks a defection from the realist camp, the move also signals a big-budget vote of confidence in a rising film-maker. Kitty Green has plans but is not willing to discuss them just yet.</p> <p>Realism always seems to be born out of crisis. In Italy, it grew from the ruins of the second world war. Before that, a realist movement in art developed in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s, in the wake of the Great Depression. In fact, one of the most enduring fruits of social realism in the US was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/24/a-vision-shared-book-review-great-depression-photographers\">Farm Security Administration</a>, set up as part of Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal in the mid-30s. Its remit was to document the impact of the Depression on rural communities, through photography as well as film. But its images went beyond the merely factual, often achieving the emotional impact of a drama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4161c18de02bdee2ee0372afa21b648bc58ddf03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4161c18de02bdee2ee0372afa21b648bc58ddf03/0_0_3504_2628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Florida Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hardship and poverty \u2026 The Florida Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Freestyle Picture Company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prime example is Dorothea Lange\u2019s famous <a href=\"http://100photos.time.com/photos/dorothea-lange-migrant-mother\">Migrant Mother</a> photograph, which the Library of Congress captioned: \u201cDestitute pea pickers in California.

  "<h2><strong>Ander Zabala, recycling manager for Hackney council, London</strong></h2> <p>Through my work, I have seen the huge amount of waste and recycling that we produce. Watching an incinerator for half an hour shocked me and made me want to take action. I was standing on a balcony wearing a full body suit and goggles watching gigantic grabbers emptying waste from trucks. The scale is so shocking and you realise how tiny we are compared to the amount of waste we create. I don\u2019t want to contribute to that wastefulness and it has made me want to take action.</p> <p>In 2018, I did the <a href=\"https://www.zerowasteweek.co.uk/\">Zero Waste Week</a> challenge and then kept going. I set myself a goal for 2019 of not having any waste collected. I made that commitment on social media, so I felt invested. Instead of using a bin, I put my waste in a jar each month so that I could see what I was throwing away. I also reduced the amount I was recycling.</p> <p>I look at waste from a data perspective. At the end of 2019, I opened <a href=\"https://goxuboys.wixsite.com/goxuboys/post/2019-waste-data-exposed\">all the jars of non-recyclable waste</a> I was keeping. They weighed a total of 5.72kg for the year. The average London house produces 10kg of waste a week, compared with my household\u2019s weekly average of 0.11kg. So our waste was 99% less than the average.</p> <p>My husband and I get a veg box delivery from Riverford every week. I buy most other things loose from my local corner shop and other bits from a nearby Bulk Market and Turkish supermarket. I bring my own containers and bags to fill with cereals, flour, pasta, rice, tofu, sugar, coffee beans, lentils, spices and more. I also refill my shampoo, washing-up liquid, laundry liquid and toilet cleaner bottles. I also get bottle refills of wine from a local shop.</p> <p>At first I felt a bit weird taking my own containers, but it forces you to explain what you are doing to people around you. Generally, people are really positive and say: \u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d I take tubs back to my Indian takeaway to be refilled and now they expect it. Of course, at the moment I wouldn\u2019t ask them to refill my containers because everyone is taking hygiene precautions due to the coronavirus, but I still use the tubs for my regular grocery shopping. My recycling has increased during lockdown because I cannot reuse things as much as I normally would.</p> <p>One of the biggest lifestyle benefits has been using my local shops more. I used to go to the supermarket and self-checkout, but I have gained so much by talking to local shop owners and cashiers.</p> <p>We have also done a lot more cooking, especially making things that we can\u2019t buy without packaging. My husband learned to make chapatis and naan bread, and they taste better than the ones we bought in the shops \u2013 and he can make them in minutes. We<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/jan/31/how-to-make-your-own-milk-simple-sustainable-guide-oat-nuts-seeds\"> make our own oat milk</a>, which is so cheap and easy. I will buy a packet of biscuits occasionally because I don\u2019t have the time to make everything.</p> <p>Sometimes, I would get a bit militant. I would ask friends at parties: \u201cWhy did you buy that when it can\u2019t be recycled?\u201d Or I would find some plastic packaging in the house and text my husband saying: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I have been called the zero-waste police. But now I am going a bit easier on myself and others.</p> <p>Overall, these changes have saved us a lot of money, mainly by reducing our consumption. We stopped buying stuff that we don\u2019t really need, but spend a little more on the things that we do buy. We have also eaten more healthily because we have bought less processed food.</p> <p>I am still putting my waste in a jar to keep it visible. I know that if there is a large bin in the room, people will use it.</p> <h2><strong>Cate Cody, jazz singer and Green councillor, Tewkesbury</strong></h2> <p>We haven\u2019t put our waste bin out for collection for more than three years, not since January 2017. My partner and I have one small metal bin in the kitchen and that\u2019s the only bin in the house. There\u2019s hardly anything in it, just occasional bits of non-recyclable plastic packaging, usually from gifts from well-meaning people.</p> <p>We try to bring in as little as possible, only buying what we need and secondhand wherever feasible, which tends to avoid packaging. We reuse, repurpose, recycle and compost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc35a376351ef00d458f6e7a848ac8b3edab41eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc35a376351ef00d458f6e7a848ac8b3edab41eb/0_250_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"None gone to waste ...

I forage too, for things such as nettles and wild garlic. We grow our own salad, which is very easy and quick to grow. Our rocket sprouts up between paving slabs.<br><br>We buy other food, such as pasta, rice and pulses, in bulk from an ethical cooperative wholesaler called <a href=\"https://www.suma.coop/\">Suma</a>. We get a delivery every couple of months that we share with five other friends. Our oats come in a 10kg paper sack. The toilet paper comes in biodegradable packaging that goes into the compost, and there\u2019s biodegradable dental floss too.<br><br>We use loofahs instead of regular sponges for washing up because they are made from a natural material and can be composted afterwards. They are more expensive, but we find they last longer, so the costs are not so different.</p> <p>Once you start to reduce your waste, you notice the outstanding things still going into the bin and then <a href=\"http://www.ecocody.com/2018/07/thirty-seven-things-you-can-do-to-be.html\">seek alternatives to them</a>. When you put your mind to it, you can find a solution for nearly everything. One challenge was what to do with an old bike inner tube. I considered a few possibilities and eventually made it into a tool belt.</p> <p>I hated toothpaste tubes going to landfill, so I started <a href=\"http://www.ecocody.com/2017/09/how-to-keep-it-clean-but-green-in-your.html\">making my own toothpaste</a> by mixing bicarbonate of soda with coconut and peppermint oil. It is very different, but it works. That said, we have now made Tewkesbury town hall into a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TewkTownCouncil/status/1184821106403876865?s=20\">collection point</a> for recycling toothpaste tubes so that others needn\u2019t end up in the bin.</p> <p>I never buy wrapping paper. For close friends and family I will use a scarf or a table cloth and they usually give it back afterwards. Recently, I wrapped a friend\u2019s present using recipes from a newspaper tied up with string and explained that the recipes (chosen especially) were part of the present. They loved it.</p> <p>I happily use a bar of soap instead of shower gel and wouldn\u2019t look back. The gel often slid straight down the plughole anyway. A decent soap lasts much longer.</p> <p>Instead of kitchen roll, I use old cloth, and rather than makeup wipes, I use a small hankie or a piece of cloth. These can all be washed.</p> <p>I don\u2019t miss the things that I have given up. It is not about loss, it is about what you gain. I derive real satisfaction from not throwing things away and I have gained skills by learning to make things myself. It is also about owning fewer things; if I want to read a book, I will order it from the library. I might have to wait longer for it, so there is less instant gratification, but it can feel like being a child waiting for Christmas and it is all the more rewarding when it arrives.</p> <p>As a <a href=\"http://www.jazzcats.co.uk/index.html\">jazz singer</a> I recycle songs, and in the rest of my life I try to recycle everything else.</p> <h2><strong>Claudi Williams, workshop manager for <a href=\"https://www.beeswaxwraps.co.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2-Hw4KaS6QIVhbTtCh3W7AXxEAAYASAAEgLaWfD_BwE\">the Beeswax Wrap Co</a></strong><strong>, </strong><strong> Stroud</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6d9fcec523e67b7f26edbbfe537f3808546fb66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6d9fcec523e67b7f26edbbfe537f3808546fb66/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"G2 - Claudi Williams at home near Stroud.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">G2 - Claudi Williams at home near Stroud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was frustrated by the amount of plastic in my life, so in 2016 I decided to <a href=\"http://www.pfree.co.uk/about/\">try not buying any for a year</a>. It was a steep learning curve for me, my husband and our two sons but, after a few months, our waste went down to almost nothing. It has become our new normal.</p> <p>It was hard at first because we were used to the convenience of buying stuff at the last minute and we couldn\u2019t do that any more. Now we have a routine, cooking every day and making our own packed lunches.</p> <p>The first thing we ask ourselves is: \u201cDo we need this?\u201d The second is: \u201cHow can I get this unpackaged?\u201d Can we make it ourselves? Can we get it secondhand? Can we borrow it?</p> <p>Buying unpackaged food tends to make you buy more local, seasonal food, which also reduces your food miles, thereby creating a virtuous circle.

We are led to believe that we need a different product for every single thing we clean, but actually you can clean nearly everything effectively with bicarbonate of soda, vinegar, lemons and a simple soap. Now I just use soap and a brush and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/jan/13/bicarb-vinegar-lemon-juice-how-to-clean-your-house-even-the-oven-the-old-fashioned-way\">make my own spray</a><sup> </sup>with vinegar for things such as tiles, mirrors and sinks. The whole journey has been one of simplifying further and further. Bicarb is a great thing to have around \u2013 for example, you can sprinkle it into tea-stained cups to remove the stains.</p> <p>You can make so many things from basic ingredients, and finding new solutions is hugely empowering. For instance, when we needed windscreen wiper liquid for the car, I found a really easy recipe on the internet that cost only a few pence to make. I make my own toothpaste and deodorant, which only takes five minutes. For shampoo, I buy <a href=\"https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvr2plqSS6QIVVODtCh3PAAn6EAAYASAAEgJRgvD_BwE\">Faith in Nature</a> refills or a bar from <a href=\"https://mindthetrash.com/\">Mind the Trash</a>. I use a metal safety razor for shaving. I get toilet paper from a subscription service called <a href=\"https://greencane.com/\">Greencane</a> that sends out 48 unpackaged rolls in a cardboard box.</p> <p>I love herbal teas and was scrambling around for loose tea and then I realised that there were plants in my garden that I could pick fresh and use. You have to switch your brain away from consumption and realise what is in your environment. I dry herbs such as chamomile and peppermint to use in the winter months by tying bunches in a posy and hanging them upside down in a cupboard.</p> <p>Living like this has really changed me. Ultimately, we simply live with less stuff. I used to pop things into my supermarket trolley on impulse, but now I have a totally different relationship with what I want and need. I feel much more self-reliant and smarter about how I shop. I consider every purchase a vote.</p> <h2><strong>10 easy ways to start reducing your waste</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c45f3a78fafa5707c0e4f42d71207cfb61a4048\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c45f3a78fafa5707c0e4f42d71207cfb61a4048/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waste illustration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br><strong>1. </strong>Buy less stuff. If you have to buy furniture, clothes or tools and whatever else, try to get it secondhand, or borrow rather than buy.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>For groceries, choose loose and unpackaged fruit and vegetables. Take your own reusable containers and bags to markets or deli counters to get things such as olives, cheese and bread package-free. Buy milk in returnable glass bottles or <a href=\"theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/jan/31/how-to-make-your-own-milk-simple-sustainable-guide-oat-nuts-seeds\">make your own plant-based milk</a>.<br><br><strong>3. </strong>Try making things that you find difficult to source unpackaged, such as biscuits, granola, hummus, bread and pizza.

You can make your own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/23/make-your-own-toothpaste-lotion-ingredients-environment\">toothpaste</a> and deodorant or source low-impact alternatives.</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Reduce your sanitary waste with reusable washable cloth nappies rather than disposables.

They are natural, biodegradable and can be composted after use. Get refills of washing-up liquid and make your own simple cleaning spray for surfaces.</p> <p><strong>8. </strong>Ditch tissues, kitchen towel and makeup wipes and use hankies and washable cloth options instead.</p> <p><strong>9. </strong>Compost and recycle whatever you can and seek out extra local recycling points for items such as crisp packets, toothbrushes, textiles and batteries. Some supermarkets collect types of plastic that can\u2019t be put in household recycling.</p> <p><strong>10. </strong>Repair items before buying new ones. With things that are beyond repair, consider how you might be able to repurpose or reinvent them. For example, you could cut up old clothes to make beeswax wraps for food or fabric bags for collecting loose groceries.</p>",
  "<p><strong>David McWilliams:</strong> I think it is fair to say that capitalism \u2013 in the course of this unprecedented crisis \u2013 has been suspended. We are not going back to where we were, to business as usual. The state has come back, and this episode will not be forgotten by the electorate. I don\u2019t know where we are going, but one thing seems clear: we are not going back.</p> <p><strong>Yanis Varoufakis</strong>: I like this phrase: capitalism has been suspended. The last time capitalism was suspended in the west was during the second world war, with the advent of the war economy: a command economy that fixed prices. The war economy marked the transcendence of the standard capitalist model.</p> <p>But what we see now is not so much the suspension of capitalism. The rules of capitalism may have been suspended \u2013 all those sacrosanct policies are gone, the neat separation of fiscal and monetary policy is gone, the idea that public debt is a bad thing is gone.</p> <p>But the institutions that are necessary to build \u201cthe war economy without war\u201d so to speak \u2013 to suspend and transcend capitalism \u2013 those have not been put in place. There is a profound difference between saying: \u201cIt\u2019s all going to shit, so we don\u2019t expect you to stick to the rules,\u201d and saying: \u201cThe rules themselves have changed, and we must make new ones to prevent an economic collapse.\u201d All this talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\">quantitative easing</a> by the European Central Bank suggests that we remain very far from a war economy mindset.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>This is a familiar category error in Europe. If you are basing your economic policy on the willingness of people who are too traumatised and sick to borrow \u2013 which is the core logic of quantitative easing \u2013 then you have a very serious problem. A common image of quantitative easing is the hose: a huge monetary hose, with water gushing out to stop the fire of crisis. But the hose of monetary policy is limited by this little valve called the banks, a little valve called the credit committee, a little valve called the \u201cwillingness of business to borrow money\u201d. And ultimately, that hose of money becomes a trickle \u2013 and even that trickle stands to benefit the wealthy much more than the poor.</p> <p>So I take your point that despite the suspension of the rules, the infrastructure remains in place. But people across Europe are now saying: \u201cHey, there is an alternative.\u201d This second phase will be about how we move ahead in rethinking capitalism, in rethinking finance, rethinking how economies work and for whom \u2013 potentially toward a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/14/bretton-woods-1944-keynes-imf\">Bretton Woods-style settlement</a> for the entire global economy.</p> <p>So that\u2019s where we are: in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. Looking out at the next decade, armed with history as well as economics, what do you think the global and European economy will look like?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1bf8f9edd6a1189e6e803fbd027f4071f177064b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bf8f9edd6a1189e6e803fbd027f4071f177064b/0_0_3266_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yanis Varoufakis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yanis Varoufakis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>YV:</strong> We are sitting on a saddle point, prepared to tip in either direction. It is utterly indeterminate which of the two directions we travel.</p> <p>Let us start with the positive scenario.

Back then, when Ireland and Greece went belly up, there were remarkable dissimilarities between what our countries were experiencing and what Germany was experiencing, what Holland was experiencing. Today, Germany\u2019s industrial machine is broken \u2013 and was broken long before coronavirus hit. Two main industries \u2013 automobiles and machine tooling \u2013 were already in serious trouble. So the fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope that they might say: what should we do?

What\u2019s the other option?</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> Well, we humans \u2013 and we Europeans, in particular \u2013 love to miss fantastic opportunities and end up with dystopian outcomes instead. It\u2019s very likely that we will encounter the same recalcitrance by the same set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/06/eurozone-germany-ordoliberalism\">European ordoliberals</a>, who will keep putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\">roadblocks</a> in the way of moves toward a genuine, democratic federalism.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Obviously, such a roadblock will have a disproportionate impact on the southern member states of the European Union. What do you think the impact of this particular trauma will have on, say, Italy \u2013 a founding member of the European Union, and a crucial part of Europe\u2019s emotional hinterland?</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> Every time there is a crisis in Europe, Italian growth rates fall. Every time there is a problem, Italy sinks deeper into stagnation \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/matteo-salvini-italy-league-party-master-campaigner-counts-cost-of-strategic-errors\">Salvini waiting</a> in the wings. If Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels fail again to move toward the positive scenario, Italy \u2013 not just Italy, but all of Europe\u2019s most devastated regions \u2013 will move again toward the neo-fascist right. In that case, all bets are off.</p> <p>This is the endpoint of the negative scenario: a giant domino effect, leading to the disintegration of the European Union. Not that the EU will cease to exist. Only that it will become irrelevant, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States\">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Oh, I remember the Commonwealth of Independent States very well \u2026</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> It still exists! It still has an office in Moscow. So the negative scenario is that the European Union will become like the CIS. And that will be music to the ears of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/26/politics-of-nostalgia-score-settling-populism-dominated-2010s-john-harris\">Trumps, Bolsonaros, and Modis</a> of this world.

And then it became quite wealthy, on the back of the European project, on the back of Europe\u2019s position in the global supply chain, and with a tax policy that attracted lots and lots of capital. My sense is this model might be gone, and this style of globalisation along with it. I fear that the period when you could travel, engage, move \u2013 we might have reached the end of that open period. People will say: \u201cThis virus came from the cosmopolitan world, from the world of international movement.\u201d Whether it\u2019s right or not, we might begin to blame people. We know that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/walter-scheidel-a-shock-to-the-established-order-can-deliver-change\">Black Death</a> resulted in ferocious antisemitism in Europe. People asked: \u201cWho can we blame for this?\u201d And so they blamed the one community that was already in isolation in the ghetto.</p> <p>This is what terrifies me most, sitting here in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. What we saw before may come again, and we turn back to Yeats: \u201cTurning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.\u201d I fear now, unless we move quickly and in a new direction, the world that my kids will inherit is going to turn very nasty, indeed. So it\u2019s a clarion call.</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> The loudest call in a generation. I share all of your concern for the future, although I must challenge the analysis on which it is based. The openness that you describe has always gone hand in hand with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/drones-replace-patrol-ships-mediterranean-fears-more-migrant-deaths-eu\">severe restriction</a>: Nafta and the US-Mexico border; freedom of movement in Europe and <a href=\"https://frontex.europa.eu/\">Frontex</a> along the Mediterranean.

Surfing on the hose of liquidity unleashed by the policies like quantitative easing, the financial sector will increase its grip on the global economy; bankers are very good at getting rich from such volatility. So now is the time for us, here in Europe as around the world, to mobilise behind this shared vision of a global new deal.

We could end poverty for many, but prime minister Scott Morrison insists we will \u201csnap back\u201d to the unliveable rates after the pandemic.</p> <p>At first glance, the government response appears to protect renters, but landlords win at every step. State governments opted for a trickle-down approach, with New South Wales <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/nsw-announces-440-million-coronavirus-rent-relief-package\">gifting landlords $440m</a> in further tax breaks.

Wealthy households have never been more prosperous, while millions remain impoverished. The solutions are simple. If someone is homeless, give them a home. If they are hungry, then provide them with food.</p> <p>The discussion we should have is not whether we should do this, but how? We should increase welfare payments, ban no-cause evictions, invest in social housing and legislate stronger rights for renters. We could also establish rent controls, nationalise housing and push for a <a href=\"https://overland.org.au/2020/04/housing-is-a-right-homelessness-is-a-weapon/\">national housing guarantee</a>.</p> <p>Returning to \u201cnormal life\u201d means turning our backs on the crises which we ignored before the pandemic: housing costs, stagnant wages and starvation payments weigh poor people down.

  "<p>National Basketball League commissioner Jeremy Loeliger had an early indication that not all was well in the world. With Australia\u2019s domestic basketball teams due to contest off-season matches in China in June, he had been in close contact with his Chinese counterparts at the end of last year. As the spread of Covid-19 escalated beyond Wuhan, it became clear those games would not take place.</p> <p>From his Melbourne office, Loeliger watched on as the coronavirus derailed global basketball: first in China, then across Asia and Europe, before eventually impacting Australia. The NBL was one of the first Australian sports to be hit, with the finals ended mid-series on 17 March. It would be another week before the AFL was suspended, and even longer for the NRL to grind to a halt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/australian-sport-prepares-to-restart-how-and-when-major-competitions-will-resume\">Australian sport prepares to restart: how and when major competitions will resume</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were very lucky to get through as much of our season as we did,\u201d Loeliger tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was a very stressful period during that grand final series \u2013 we had to make some tough decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Covid-19\u2019s interruption to the domestic and international sporting landscape comes at an interesting time for the NBL. Since businessman Larry Kestelman acquired the league in 2015, elite basketball in Australia has boomed. In the five subsequent seasons, attendances have increased by 54% to almost one million people in 2019-20. Domestic viewing figures, on SBS Viceland and ESPN, are up nearly half.</p> <p>Australian basketball icon Andrew Gaze played during the NBL\u2019s glory years in the 1990s. \u201cI think it is arguable we are ahead of those so-called halcyon days,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now we are seeing a real peak in the sport.\u201d</p> <p>The on-court product has improved dramatically, with Australian players returning home from overseas leagues and young Americans using the NBL as a pathway to the NBA. Boomers veteran Andrew Bogut joined the Sydney Kings, while LaMelo Ball \u2013 expected to be in the No 1 pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft \u2013 spent the past season with the Illawarra Hawks.</p> <p>\u201cThe last few years have been very promising,\u201d says Loeliger. Mitch Creek, a marquee signing in 2019 for newly-established team South East Melbourne Phoenix, is more emphatic. \u201cThis is the second best league in the world \u2013 second only to the NBA,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The pandemic threatens to dash that momentum. The 2020-21 season is not scheduled to begin until October, but the league has pre-empted the expected financial pain by agreeing a major pay cut with the Australian Basketball Players\u2019 Association. Some players have seen their salaries slashed by 50%. In response, some of the league\u2019s stars \u2013 including Perth\u2019s Bryce Cotton and Sydney Kings pair Casper Ware and Xavier Cooks \u2013 opted out of their contracts.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to play with the cards we are dealt, and we don\u2019t yet know what they will be,\u201d says Loeliger. While the players who exited their NBL contracts can return to the league and opt back in, much will depend on when the league commences relative to overseas competitions. \u201cThere is every chance we will need to delay the start of the season,\u201d the NBL commissioner says.</p> <p>Even if professional sports are able to resume in the months ahead, a behind-closed-doors return would be costly for the NBL \u2013 more so than other domestic codes. \u201cWe\u2019re not showered in cash by our broadcast deals,\u201d Loeliger says. \u201cOur clubs and the league are very reliant on playing games in front of full stadiums.\u201d</p> <p>One player staying put is national team regular Creek, who committed to the second year of his Phoenix contract. \u201cWe have to repay the time, effort and money that the fans have invested in us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have been phenomenal.\u201d While the small forward\u2019s decision will see him lose half his pay, he remains philosophical: \u201c50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Creek has seen the pandemic\u2019s impact first-hand. \u201cMy sister and my mother lost their jobs pretty quick \u2013 it\u2019s a hard time for everyone,\u201d he says. As a result, he is focused on staying positive. \u201cThis is a great time to reflect on what we get out of the sport, not what we lose from Covid-19,\u201d he continues. \u201cThis is basketball \u2013 it\u2019s not rocket science. We get paid to play the game. How lucky are we?\u201d</p> <p>If that attitude is representative of NBL players across the league, the sport will be well-placed to prosper in the post-pandemic era. While other domestic competitions have found themselves riven by in-fighting and power struggles, basketball\u2019s unity could be its greatest asset.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt the sport will ride this out,\u201d says Gaze, who coached the Sydney Kings until last year. \u201cI am incredibly optimistic. The NBL, the club owners, the players\u2019 association, the state associations, Basketball Australia \u2013 from the outside looking in, it appears there is good communication, cooperation and understanding. That gives us a great chance to help the NBL grow.\u201d</p>"
