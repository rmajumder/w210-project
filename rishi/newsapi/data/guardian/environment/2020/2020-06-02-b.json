At the end of March, the National Statistics Institute (INE), which calculates figures in a different way, gave Spain\u2019s jobless figure as 3.31 million. </p> \n  <p>These figures do not count those who have been furloughed. Between mid-March and the end of May, a total of 3.7 million people were furloughed under a plan rolled out by the labour ministry. But when the furlough scheme draws to a close as planned at the end of June, unemployment figures could rise again.</p> \n  <p>The government has urged employers not to cut jobs in the six months following the furlough period but layoffs are expected.</p> \n  <p>In May, as the lockdown was eased, the number of new jobseekers in the construction sector fell by almost 7% compared with April. In industry and agriculture, the figure remained stable but it grew by 1.5% in the service sector which has borne the brunt of the crisis, particularly due to the loss of significant numbers of temporary jobs in tourism.</p> \n  <p>In the first quarter, Spain\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to 14.4%, INE figures showed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates unemployment in Spain could soar to 20.8% in 2020, while the government expects a figure of 19%.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed620748f084df971c8e11c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:51:50.518Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Concerts have been allowed to restart in <strong>Portugal</strong>, with the country\u2019s prime minister, Antonio Costa, attending a show performed by Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo in Lisbon last night: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2792c9abee454b49850e79e941da3a2c687fbb83/0_124_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira performs during his show Deixem o Pimba em Paz at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c035f3b1055a602ea5f3571de64a4bb67138067/0_320_4804_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, center, and his wife Fernanda Tadeu applaud as the lights dim for the start of a concert by Portuguese artists Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo at the Campo Pequeno bullring in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armando Franca/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fce9a63ca35328c39b8a4bc0a91eed408cf96a7/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wearing face masks attend a concert in Lisbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks attend the performing show Deixem o Pimba em Paz by Portuguese entertainer Bruno Nogueira at Campo Pequeno Arena in Lisbon on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patr\u00edcia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T09:46:02.315Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Statistics watchdog criticises government's testing data</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In a strongly-worded letter, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the Government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d.

He is the sixth doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital to have died from the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city late last year.</p> \n  <p>Cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control. The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634, well below the number of fatalities in less populous nations.</p> \n  <p>Wuhan Central Hospital has yet to give a formal statement on Hu\u2019s death. In early February it said some 68 staff members had contracted coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Hu\u2019s condition became a national concern after Chinese media showed images of him with his skin turned black due to liver damage. Fellow doctor Yi Fan showed similar symptoms, but recovered and has since been discharged from hospital.</p> \n  <p>The death of their colleague Li Wenliang in February triggered a national outpouring of grief and rage against the government as he documented his final days on social media. The 34-year-old ophthalmologist was reprimanded by authorities after he warned colleagues about the virus in late December. Beijing has since named him a national martyr, but suppressed much of the dissent and criticism sparked by his death.</p> \n  <p>Other medical whistleblowers at Wuhan Central Hospital - including emergency unit director Ai Fen - have told Chinese media they were punished by authorities for speaking out.</p> \n  <p>China has not released a complete figure of the number of medical worker deaths from Covid-19, but at least 34 medics have been awarded posthumous honours by health authorities.

after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines.</p> \n  <p>AP reports that strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame. The news agency says its report is based on internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews. </p> \n  <p>The AP report reads: </p> \n  <p><em>Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on 11 January. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Although the World Health Organization continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time. </em></p> \n  <p><em>\u201cWe\u2019re currently at the stage where yes, they\u2019re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,\u201d said WHOs top official in China, Dr Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world in a most timely fashion.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers.

  "<p>Scott Morrison\u2019s decision to take a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/21/scott-morrison-hawaii-horror-show-pr-disaster-unfolded\">holiday in Hawaii</a> as fires engulfed the east coast of Australia will go down as among the most unfortunate political missteps in recent history. The trip became emblematic of a federal government caught flat-footed for last summer\u2019s unfolding bushfire catastrophe.</p> \n<p>New documents, some released under freedom of information provisions, have shed more light on the government\u2019s preparations for the bushfire season and response to it. The documents show that while some parts of the bureaucracy were aware by August that the country was facing a horror season, that urgency did not reach their political masters.</p> \n<p>One of the most important questions for the royal commission into the bushfire crisis will be whether state and federal authorities effectively coordinated their response. </p> \n<p>Disaster management is primarily a state responsibility, but the commonwealth also has a role, particularly when fires cross state lines and states need additional resources. Surprisingly, there is no clear power in the constitution to declare a national emergency.</p> \n<p>Some important functions \u2013 notably aerial firefighting, telecommunications infrastructure, emergency broadcasts on the ABC, electricity grids and assistance from the military \u2013 are in the hands of the commonwealth, or funded by it.</p> \n<p>But despite a scientific assessment in August warning of a dire outlook, many of the follow-up actions, such as more funding for aerial firefighting equipment, were slow to flow. There appears to have been little appreciation at the executive level of just how horrific the bushfire season was predicted to be.</p> \n<h2>Aerial firefighting funding slides</h2> \n<p>Most notable was the commonwealth\u2019s ad hoc response on aerial firefighting, which was well documented during the fires.</p> \n<p>A funding agreement between the states and the commonwealth for the National Aerial Firefighting Agency was reached in 2003 after a particularly fierce bushfire season. The Howard government agreed the commonwealth would provide 50% of the funds each year.</p> \n<p>But by 2017, the federal share of funding had fallen to 23%.</p> \n<p>Despite a formal request <strong> </strong>in 2017 from the national agency to permanently increase its budget, the federal Coalition chose to offer an $11m \u201cone-off\u201d top-up to the centre\u2019s $14.8m funding in 2018. That was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/12/bushfires-coalition-responds-to-calls-for-more-water-bombers-with-11m-aerial-firefighting-boost\">renewed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/12/bushfires-coalition-responds-to-calls-for-more-water-bombers-with-11m-aerial-firefighting-boost\"> on 12 December 2019</a>.

Agencies such as the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have important roles in predicting the likely impact of a bushfire.</p> \n<p>Arguably there are more agencies \u2013 notably the environment department, which has responsibility for threatened species and climate change \u2013 that should also be involved in bushfire response planning.</p> \n<h2>Heightened fire risks predicted</h2> \n<p>In the federal sphere, the main responsibility for assessing the outlook for the bushfire season fell to Emergency Management Australia (EMA) \u2013 once a separate agency, now a branch within the sprawling home affairs portfolio.</p> \n<p>The branch told the Guardian it hosted 11 disaster preparedness briefings across all states, beginning in August 2019 when the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre released its seasonal outlook.</p> \n<p>The outlook warned, quite accurately though in somewhat muted language, where the risk lay.</p> \n<p>\u201cAustralia faces the likelihood of an active fire season with above-normal fire potential forecast for significant parts of Australia, particularly the south-east,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has been the fifth-driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. This is especially the case over the southern half of the country, which has experienced the driest January to July on record (January to July 1902 is the second driest).\u201d </p> \n<p>The outlook pinpointed the areas that faced the higher risk. In NSW, it said, there was \u201csignificant concern for the potential of an above-normal fire season in forested areas on and east of the Great Dividing Range\u201d.</p> \n<p>The risk for the ACT was said to be \u201cabove normal\u201d, while in Victoria \u201cabove-normal bushfire activity continues across the coastal and foothill forests of East Gippsland, extending into West Gippsland and the Great Dividing Range\u201d.</p> \n<p>It also highlighted the risks on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, which had \u201ca combination of drier than average and wetter than average conditions across the island which may result in above average fuel loads in parts\u201d.</p> \n<p>These were the areas that were ravaged by fires over Christmas and New year.</p> \n<p>EMA said it held a further nine briefings with defence department and other agencies that needed to be involved in the co-ordination between August and November.</p> \n<p>But for some reason the impending risk does not seem to have permeated into the executive or to cabinet.</p> \n<p>EMA\u2019s first briefings with ministers on preparedness for the bushfire season took place in November, and by then bushfires had already raged through parts of Queensland and northern NSW. It did not say who attended.</p> \n<p>The minister for emergency management, David Littleproud, issued <a href=\"https://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/davidlittleproud/Pages/emergency-workers-busy-summer.aspx\">three press releases</a> between August and November describing the coming bushfire season as \u201cchallenging\u201d, \u201ctough\u201d, \u201ctesting\u201d and \u201cabove average\u201d. But the gist of the releases was that communities needed to start getting organised, not what the federal government was doing.</p> \n<h2>Warnings \u2018fobbed off\u2019</h2> \n<p>Some who sought to warn the federal government early, such as the former NSW fire chief Greg Mullins, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/former-fire-chief-calls-out-pm-over-refusal-of-meeting/11705330\">felt they were fobbed off</a> by the federal government.</p> \n<p>As reported last year, Mullins \u2013 in his capacity as head of the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action \u2013 contacted the prime minister\u2019s office in April, seeking a meeting to outline the potential calamity he believed was looming.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of the fires, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7848239/Scott-Morrison-defends-decision-not-meet-former-fire-chiefs-saying-talks-current-ones.html\">Morrison has said</a> he didn\u2019t need to hear from former chiefs as the government could hear from the current ones. But Mullins has said it was precisely their \u201cex\u201d status that allowed them to speak freely both about bushfire preparedness and its link to climate change.</p> \n<p>Mullins\u2019s request was referred to the minister for energy and emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, in July.</p> \n<p>Taylor responded on 10 September, offering a date in October for a meeting in Sydney.</p> \n<p>Mullins immediately wrote back, saying it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d it had taken several months to receive an invitation and that the catastrophic conditions he and his fellow fire experts had predicted had now manifested.</p> \n<p>\u201cConsidering the gravity of the situation, a national response from the highest levels of the Australian government is required,\u201d Mullins wrote. He requested an urgent meeting with Morrison, Taylor, Littleproud, finance minister Matthias Cormann and any other ministers involved.</p> \n<p>Taylor replied that he had copied in Littleproud, and perhaps Mullins should seek a meeting with him.</p> \n<p>By then Mullins could see what was unfolding. In November he told the ABC how worried he was. He said he been \u201cfobbed off\u201d by the prime minister, and that Taylor was \u201cnot the right person to meet with\u201d.</p> \n<p>Finally a meeting took place with Littleproud and Taylor on 3 December.</p> \n<p>Mullins told the Guardian: \u201cIt was clear that there was never any intention by the PM to listen to us. We were treated with open contempt by the PM, who said he would deal with the current chiefs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe deputy prime minister [Michael McCormack] said we were time-wasters and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/nov/11/morrison-coalition-labor-bushfires-monday-politics-live?page=with:block-5dc87bde8f0867dcebfd254d#block-5dc87bde8f0867dcebfd254d\">those who talked about climate change and bushfires were latte-sipping greenies</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked in November why he did not meet Mullins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/21/scott-morrison-says-no-evidence-links-australias-carbon-emissions-to-bushfires\">Morrison said</a> the government already had advice from \u201cexisting fire chiefs doing the existing job\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/we-saw-it-coming-former-fire-commissioner-says-government-was-warned-on-bushfires-20191114-p53agj.html\">his office said</a> the Mullins group had been offered meetings with senior cabinet ministers \u201cseveral times this year\u201d.</p> \n<p>Documents released under freedom of information also show that Taylor did not ask his department for a briefing before the meeting with Mullins \u2013 the usual step for a minister.</p> \n<h2>Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday cited</h2> \n<p>A similar request to the then-Department of Environment and Energy reveals how little thought had been devoted in that portfolio to the potential impact of the bushfire season on the environment, threatened species and its relationship to climate change.</p> \n<p>One cabinet document was withheld, its subject unknown. The only other document produced was an assessment of what bushfires could do to the national electricity network.</p> \n<p>In December the department warned that the Forest Fire Danger Index was high around the electricity<strong> </strong> corridors for the Queensland-NSW interconnector and the NSW-Victoria interconnector, and that dust storms were possible, which could further threaten the transmission network.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe FDDI is tracking similar to those conditions preceding the Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday events,\u201d it warned.</p> \n<p>Emergency Management Australia said it activated the <a href=\"https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/emergency/files/plan-disaster-response.pdf\">COMDISPLAN</a> \u2013 which outlines how states could access non-financial assistance from the commonwealth during disasters \u2013 in early September 2019.</p> \n<p>It coordinated the first requests for commonwealth disaster assistance itself. The Australian defence forces became involved soon after, and by November had liaison officers in the NSW bushfire headquarters.</p> \n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/nsw-bushfires-state-of-tension-scomos-navy-call/news-story/1a9f4e2ea2e427e28997e78955fb2e71\">suggestions in the media</a> that NSW rebuffed help from the federal government, particularly around the use of Navy ships, during the crisis. </p> \n<p>There were clearly some communication problems. The New South Wales RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said neither he nor defence force personnel working from the state control centre were informed by Scott Morrison of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/04/australia-fires-death-toll-rises-and-six-people-missing-as-pm-calls-in-military\">a plan to deploy 3,000 army reservists to assist in the bushfire crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>Fitzsimmons said he learned of the plans through the media on 4 January, when fire crews were battling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jan/04/australia-nsw-fires-live-updates-victoria-bushfires-rfs-cfa-road-closures-near-sydney-melbourne-latest-news\">some of the most challenging conditions </a>of the summer.</p> \n<p>The dispute between Morrison and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, if there was one, appears to have related to whether a naval vessel should be sent in to <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/nsw-bushfires-bermagui-residents-ready-to-defend-homes-or-jump-into-the-sea/news-story/8f9a324c2fa0a2a56f0d536510948a14\">Bermagui to evacuate residents </a>.</p> \n<p>Documents obtained from the Department of Defence show there was close co-operation on the aerial firefighting tasks, with the RFS using Defence facilities at Richmond, on the fringes of Sydney, and that Defence rapidly scaled up to provide teams that could deal with displaced residents and help clear roads.</p> \n<p>But after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2019/dec/31/mallacoota-bushfire-thousands-evacuate-to-sea-as-victorian-town-burns-video-report\">Mallacoota fires</a> in Victoria on New Year\u2019s Eve, when thousands of people were forced on to beaches to escape the fires, the government began deploying naval ships to the coast.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e5997417-9741-4a80-b60e-fe756c9fa9fb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/32bGcwIzS1E?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the request of the Victorian authorities, HMAS Choules and MV Sycamore left Sydney on 1 January and arrived in the Mallacoota area the next day to provide support and evacuate 1,100 people who were sleeping on the beach.</p> \n<p>There were fears that a similar scene could unfold in one of several towns along the NSW south coast as fires threatened again on 4 January. The documents show HMAS Adelaide sailed on 4 January, as the second wave of fires tore through communities and cut roads. But Bermagui, while ringed by fire, did not burn.</p> \n<p>The documents show the NSW government and the RFS preferred to request Defence help clearing the Princes Highway before and after 4 January and evacuate by road, rather than by sea.</p> \n<p>Berejiklian refused to release an email exchange with the prime minister\u2019s office on 2 January, on the grounds that it would damage federal-state relations. Morrison\u2019s office refused the request on the grounds that it was too wide.</p> \n<p>RFS personnel say the liaison with Defence went very well, barring a few hiccups. A briefing note from Defence to the minister on 2 January recounted how Defence helicopters had assisted in the rescue of three people in Moruya the previous day.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe rescue was undertaken in extremely difficult conditions and was only successful due to close co-operation between the NSW RFS, NSW Ambulance Toll AME and the Australian defence force,\u201d the note said.</p> \n<p>But questions remain about whether the bushfire response was adequately managed by the responsible ministers.</p> \n<p>The summer of 2019-20 suggests there is much room for improvement in Australia\u2019s arrangements to protect it from natural disasters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"248822de-1dc8-48e1-9e6c-d21dbc1c56bb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kePvZkV-Zcs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

He also complained that some MPs were not paying heed to social distancing.</p> \n<p>In a partial climbdown, Rees-Mogg said he would put forward a second motion on Wednesday to allow the hybrid parliament to continue to allow MPs to attend debates virtually.</p> \n<p>However, while he did not rule out a virtual or proxy vote, there were no plans to allow MPs who could not attend the house on medical grounds to have a vote on legislation.</p> \n<p>He pledged there would be a \u201cpairing\u201d arrangement that would ensure each MP unable to make the vote because of shielding issues would be matched by a non-voting government MP.</p> \n<p>But he faced an immediate backlash, with MPs living hundreds of miles from Westminster branding it \u201cdemocracy for the elite\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, Alistair Carmichael, who took 18 hours to get to Westminster because of flight restrictions, said Rees-Mogg was giving a green light to a parliament for people \u201cwithin driving distance of London\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley said the move would \u201cobstruct\u201d the right to vote of the party\u2019s eight MPs as there were flight restrictions in place between Belfast and London, while the SNP\u2019s leader in the Commons, Ian Blackford, said it had taken him 16 hours to get to London because he had to get the sleeper train. \u201cWhat a waste of time in the middle of a national health crisis when MPs should be attending to their overflowing postbags,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Carmichael said it was also irresponsible.

  "<p>Where to start? If it wasn\u2019t already bad enough that the UK has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-50000-latest-official-figures-show\">highest mortality rate in Europe</a> and Dominic Cummings is given a free pass on his midnight flit to Durham and a 60-mile round trip eyesight test, the Tory government has now decided to turn the House of Commons into the world\u2019s worst theme park. One where the only attraction is the kilometre-long queue itself for a ride that doesn\u2019t exist.</p> \n<p>Some countries have used the global health crisis to discover the best of themselves. We have actively worked on becoming the worst possible iteration of ourselves. Still, at least the rest of the world can piss themselves laughing at our expense. So maybe look on it as a global public service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f3b2b840-8b20-4ba1-b6eb-fcdc8f0917b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ww0fVaaGjb0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To recap. Before the Whitsun recess, the Commons had a perfectly serviceable hybrid participation procedure, along with a fully functional remote voting system, to enable parliament to operate during the coronavirus pandemic. But Jacob Rees-Mogg wasn\u2019t happy with that. Having spent several weeks trying to close down the Commons last year during the unlawful prorogation, the leader of the house has now decided he wants it to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">make it as inaccessible for MPs as possible</a>.</p> \n<p>Anyone who is over 70, is pregnant or has health, childcare or travel issues is now effectively barred from parliament. With their constituents disenfranchised. Jakey likes to pretend to be the great parliamentarian \u2013 the master democrat steeped in centuries of tradition \u2013 but the reality is that Westminster is just a stage on which he gets to cosplay his public school fantasies in a suit that\u2019s several sizes too big for him. Ideally the only people he wants in the Commons are people just like him: MPs with large London houses, a private income and an inherited nanny.</p> \n<p>For reasons best know to himself \u2013 perhaps he had forgotten the chamber was still restricted to 50 MPs so he would still be basically on his own during prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 Boris Johnson chose to indulge Jakey\u2019s perversions by turning the vote into a three-line whip for Tory MPs. And as most of them are barely sensate lobby fodder with no mind of their own, they duly obliged by voting to deny other MPs a vote. Not for the first time in the past few weeks, the UK was putting on a good show of acting like a banana republic.</p> \n<p>Still, at least we got to enjoy the spectacle of Tory MPs having to suffer the humiliation of waiting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\">43 minutes in a queue that snaked round Westminster Hall and back into Portcullis House</a>. I shouldn\u2019t think Jakey and Liam Fox can remember the last time they had to queue for anything. And even when they got to the front, dozens could barely manage to blurt out their names and what they were voting for. Tory Stephen Crabb first went down the \u201cno\u201d side while shouting aye, before changing direction and heading for the \u201caye\u201d side where he promptly said no.</p> \n<p>It was low comedy performed by a cast of Tory grotesques who couldn\u2019t even manage to observe the basics of physical distancing. As if they believed themselves immune to a disease that had already killed 60,000 people \u2013 with a lot of help from their own government \u2013 by virtue of their own importance. Some at least had the grace to look slightly ashamed to be participating in this profoundly undemocratic land grab but Maria Miller appeared unrepentant. Until earlier this year, Miller had been chair of the women and equalities committee but was now more than happy to trample all over those whom she used to pretend to care about. How she sleeps at night is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately for the opposition MPs and the handful of Tory MPs with a conscience, they also had to participate in the farce. Not once but twice, as the government had to first see off an amendment tabled by the Tory chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, that proposed to maintain the hybrid status quo until the end of the summer. Some managed to maintain a modicum of good humour first time round, but as the exercise in futility extended towards the 90-minute mark many began to look seriously pissed off and their votes were cast with a definite edge in their voice. Kevin Brennan spat out the words \u201cMogg shambles\u201d.</p> \n<p>Then the voting merely reflected the nature of the debate. Only this time we were seeing the \u201cone rule for the elite, another for the rest of us\u201d enshrined in law. It\u2019s government policy for people to still work from home wherever possible, and here was Jakey and the rest of the cabinet actively making it impossible for MPs to work from home. If the government can treat its co-workers that badly, just imagine the contempt it has for the rest of us. Lou Reed had it about right. Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I\u2019ll piss on them. Your poor huddled masses, let\u2019s club them to death.</p> \n<p>But it was all just water off Jakey and Boris\u2019s back: Jakey even joked about the similarities to Alton Towers by telling MPs he had taken his sister Stigmata to the theme park. An opportunity for a cynical erosion of parliamentary democracy had been there for the taking and they hadn\u2019t been able to refuse a gift horse. There had to be an upside of the coronavirus somewhere and it could make Brexit a little less hassle. And the donkeys had just gone along with it. From now on, every vote will be a 45-minute conga, with at least a hundred or more MPs effectively excluded. The Tories have effectively taken us from a modern voting system to one that would have been rejected in the Middle Ages.</p> \n<p>If I was an opposition MP, I\u2019d tell any Tory asking for a pair to sod off. Make them all turn up and pray for the wettest June on record.&nbsp;Let it rain. Let them get soaked three times a day as the rest of the world sniggers at us. We used to pride ourselves on having the Mother of Parliaments. We\u2019ve now just voted for the Mother of all Fuck-Ups.</p>",
  "<p>Civil rights leaders have criticised Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to take no action against a Facebook post from Donald Trump appearing to threaten to start shooting \u201clooters\u201d, after a Monday night meeting with the company\u2019s executives ended in acrimony.</p> <p>\u201cWe are disappointed and stunned by Mark\u2019s incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,\u201d Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robison said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump\u2019s call for violence against protesters.</p> <p>\u201cMark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>The three activist leaders \u2013 the heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Color of Change \u2013 met Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, on Monday night. They discussed Trump\u2019s Thursday night post, which urged the military to intervene in Minneapolis with the words \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The message, originally sent by Trump as a tweet before being cross-posted to Facebook, was restricted on Twitter after the platform decided it broke rules about glorifying violence. On Facebook, Zuckerberg&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">personally intervened to leave the message up</a>, arguing that the company has a policy to allow warnings of the use of force by state actors.</p> <p>Zuckerberg\u2019s decision led to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/01/facebook-workers-rebel-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump\">virtual walkout</a>\u201c of Facebook staff on Monday, with hundreds of employees downing tools in protest. A number of Facebook employees publicly expressed their dissent on rival social networks such as Twitter, and were quickly supported by senior managers at the company.</p> <p>At least one employee has quit over the decision. Timothy J Aveni, a software engineer who worked on misinformation, said on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/timothy.j.aveni/posts/3006224359465567\">Facebook</a> that he had resigned on Monday. \u201cMark told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,\u201d Aveni wrote. \u201cHe showed us on Friday that was a lie ... Facebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponized hatred, is on the wrong side of history.\u201d</p> <p>A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe recognise the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership.\u201d </p> <p>The company would not require walkout participants to take paid time off, Facebook said.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Monday night, fresh detail about those internal discussions emerged, after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/6/1/21276969/facebook-walkout-mark-zuckerberg-audio-trump-disgust-twitter\">the Verge obtained recordings</a>&nbsp;of Zuckerberg speaking at an internal meeting on Friday night.</p> <p>\u201cHow to handle this post from the president has been very tough,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve been struggling with basically all day, ever since I woke up \u2026 This has been personally pretty wrenching for me.</p> <p>\u201cMy first reaction [to Trump\u2019s post] was just disgust,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not how I think we want our leaders to show up during this time. This is a moment that calls for unity and calmness and empathy for people who are struggling.\u201d</p> <p>Zuckerberg also told employees Facebook would review the policies that allowed Trump\u2019s post to stay up. \u201cThere is a real question coming out of this, which is whether we want to evolve our policy around the discussion of state use of force. Over the coming days, as the National Guard is now deployed, probably the largest one that I would worry about would be excessive use of police or military force. I think there\u2019s a good argument that there should be more bounds around the discussion around that.\u201d</p> <p>The Facebook walkout was followed by sanctioned events at other technology companies. A number of YouTube executives, including the company\u2019s chief business officer and its global head of music, told their teams they could take Tuesday off to participate in the protests,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">according to </a><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/youtube-execs-encourage-staff-to-take-tuesday-off-for-nationwide-protests\">the Information</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-06-01/spotify-stands-with-the-black-community-in-the-fight-against-racism-and-injustice/\">Spotify followed suit</a>, encouraging employees to join the day of action \u201cby taking time to reflect and educate themselves\u201d.</p> <p>The decision on whether to allow Trump\u2019s posts to remain on Facebook could be one of the final major calls made solely by Zuckerberg. The company recently confirmed the creation of an independent Oversight Board of academics, politicians and former journalists from around the world who will act as as a \u201csupreme court\u201d deciding what content should be allowed on Facebook, while providing guidance on policy.</p> <p>Members of the Oversight Board met on Tuesday afternoon and discussed the issue but the organisation is reluctant to start wading in to debates before it is up-and-running. It is due to be fully functional by the autumn - towards the end of the current US presidential election campaign.</p> <p>Members declined to give any detail what was discussed on&nbsp;Tuesday, although a spokesperson for the Oversight Board suggested Trump\u2019s posts are the sort of issue they will rule on in the future: \u201cThere are many significant issues relating to online content that we recognise people want the board to consider. We\u2019re working hard to set the board up to begin operating later this year so it can start considering cases referred by users and Facebook. We will make decisions without regard to Facebook\u2019s economic, political or reputational interests, in a fair, transparent and politically neutral manner.\u201d</p> <p>Twitter\u2019s decision to restrict the Trump tweet \u2013 which was followed by a Trump executive order aimed at reducing the platform\u2019s protections against civil claims \u2013 won the backing of the European commission.</p> <p>The EU executive branch\u2019s vice-president, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, said in her response to the dispute that politicians should answer \u201ccriticism with facts, not with threats and attacks\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI support Twitter in their efforts to develop and implement a transparent, clear and consistent moderation policy,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said. \u201cThis is not about censorship. This is about flagging verifiably false or misleading information that may cause public harm, linking to reliable information, or flagging content violating their policies.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels</em></p>",

The Conservatives made a clear commitment to address this in their election manifesto, he said. And he said that work on this issue had continued during the coronavirus crisis. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the positive things amid the terrible things that have happened during this crisis is that people have recognised social care and just how important it is.</p> <p>We need to follow that up with reforms to the way social care is supported and make sure more people get that dignity in their older age, and that people of working age get the support they need \u2026<br></p> <p>I am determined to push forward the social care reforms that I know so many [people] are interested in.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when pressed as to when the plans would appear, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the timeframe has been clear, which is that we have got to get these reforms done in this parliament and the prime minister has previously said we will get them set out this year.</p> <p>That was before coronavirus. We will still try to do that but it is not straightforward.</p> </blockquote> <p>A delay until 2021 would be hugely embarrassing for Boris Johnson. On the day he became prime minister in July last year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019\">in his speech in Downing Street,</a> he implied he had a policy that was all set to be implemented (\u201coven-ready\u201d, to use the phrase he applied in a different context). He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock declared that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d as he stressed the importance of addressing why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus - while failing to announce any concrete proposals.</strong> Earlier, the government published the Public Health England report into why BAME people and other demographic groups are more at risk from coronavirus. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033#block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033\">12.56pm.)</a> Referring to the report, Hancock used the slogan championed by the eponymous US-based human rights group. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice. And I get that. Black lives matter. And I want to say this to everyone who works in the NHS and in social care: I value the contribution that you make, everybody equally.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the report, which does not say much more about why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus than earlier reports (like<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronavirusrelateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to10april2020\"> this ONS one)</a>, has disappointed people hoping for firm policy recommendations. Hancock has responded by promising \u2026 a further review, headed by the junior equalities minister Kemi Badenoch. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is much more work to do to understand what\u2019s driving these disparities and how the different risk factors interact, and we are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing that gap.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7947bb79f7eceeca22f5b06ced40049195e542d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7947bb79f7eceeca22f5b06ced40049195e542d/0_0_4191_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock at the press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock at the press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/DOWNING STREET HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T18:25:20.710Z\">at 7.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed6882a8f084df971c8e6df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T17:14:12.298Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs have been told it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that children in <strong>young offenders institutions</strong> are still being locked up for more than 22 hours a day, 10 weeks after lockdown.</p> <p>Many of them have had no access to face-to-face education during that time, the justice select committee hearing on the impact of Covid-19 on the youth justice system was told.</p> <p>The custody estate should have moved more swiftly, and there were real concerns that young offenders, who had initially accepted the restrictions placed on them, would lose patience if they saw changes to lockdown in the community, but no relaxation of regimes in YOIs. </p> <p>Very few children had been released under the early release scheme, the committee heard.

<p>This morning the ONS released figures showing that 44,401 Covid-19 deaths had occurred in <strong>England and Wales</strong> by 22 May (these figure differ from the <a

the most draconian introduced by any British government in peacetime. It may not feel like that, but that is because the lockdown has widespread public support. On paper the powers taken by the state have been extraordinary (as<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11752310/sex-illegal-coronavirus-lockdown-another-household-police/\"> even the Sun newspaper has twigged)</a>.</p> <p>Yet ministers have managed to introduce these rules without putting a bill through parliament. The lockdown has been imposed under the Public Health Act 1984 using secondary legislation. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2#block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2\">2.04pm.)</a> The actual regulations have only received minimal parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpO7XzpNa8DyxZsWNgckexHeezN1PYR1/view\">a letter (pdf)</a> to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, the <strong>Good Law Project </strong>claims this is illegal. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the emergency procedure under section 45R of the 1984 act to be used, a minister must declare that s/he \u201cof the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved\u201d. This provision must be interpreted in the light of the authorities referred to above which confirm parliamentary accountability as a fundamental constitutional principle ...</p> <p>We simply do not understand how the amendment regulations were so urgent that it was not possible to put them to votes in both houses. There was no justification for parliamentary accountability to be jettisoned. It is inconceivable that parliament, when passing the 1984 act, would have conceived that the emergency procedure would be used repeatedly in order to avoid parliamentary accountability over the course of months.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is not unusual to hear lawyers make arguments like this, but Hancock might be advised to take it seriously. It is run by <strong>Jolyon Maugham</strong> QC and it was one of the parties involved in the successful attempt to get the supreme court last year to rule Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation illegal.</p> <p>Maugham is not taking Hancock to court - yet. But <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/news/it-is-not-good-enough/\">he reserves the right to do so.</a> In its letter the Good Law Project says it supports the aim of the lockdown. But it says that restrictions as sweeping as this should not be introduced via a mechanism that does not allow full parliamentary scrutiny, and it says it might launch a legal challenge using judicial review if Hancock tries to amend the lockdown again using the 1984 act.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T16:15:17.168Z\">at 5.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed671728f08f5e3730132b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:39:46.079Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Further 324 Covid-19 deaths in UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 324 people have died after contracting Covid-19, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed, taking the UK\u2019s official coronavirus death toll across all settings to 39,369.</p> <p>Another 1,653 people have tested positive for the virus, with 277,985 people having now tested positive since the start of the outbreak. </p> <p>A total of 135,643 tests were carried out yesterday, 7,000 more than the previous day.

She said the government had pledged to test all Scotland\u2019s care home staff regardless of whether they showed symptoms or not, after substantial outbreaks and mounting fatalities in care homes; those testing figures showed that promise had not been met.</p> <p> Johnstone, a list MSP for the Lothians, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures simply don\u2019t add up. Scotland is testing an average of 4,600 people a day, and that is across all sectors. </p> <p>If regular testing of care home staff had begun, as she claims, then that alone would use up to 7,570 tests per day, and that\u2019s before any residents, patients or NHS workers are tested.</p> <p>There is no point in increasing Scotland\u2019s capacity to test for Covid-19 if we are not going to use it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jackie Baillie</strong>, Scottish Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said the latest figures suggested only 2.1% of Scotland\u2019s population had been tested, when the WHO had urged governments to test as many people as possible.</p> <p>Baillie said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having to change the testing eligibility guidance seven times in three months clearly shows that the Scottish government got this badly wrong at the start of this pandemic and have been too slow to rectify the situation.</p> <p>Without a rapid expansion in testing we cannot move to the \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d stage and so cannot safely continue to ease the lockdown. </p> <p>It is time for the SNP government to swallow its pride and get to work to expand testing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:52:29.941Z\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed66b9d8f087122eca542bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:09:38.158Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At least MPs can queue in the shade, Labour\u2019s <strong>Ian Murray</strong> points out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanMurrayMP/status/1267835220939677696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We now appear to have entered the foliage in this voting fiasco <a href=\"https://t.co/6X1dyWYOU9\">pic.twitter.com/6X1dyWYOU9</a></p>&mdash; Ian Murray MP (@IanMurrayMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanMurrayMP/status/1267835220939677696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed66ad58f08f5e37301325c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:08:22.319Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has announced that <strong>Iain Stewart</strong>, a former whip, has been made a junior minister in the Scotland Office following the resignation of Douglas Ross.

People of BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad, which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services that are created by, for example, cultural and language differences.</p> <p>Secondly, people of BAME communities are also likely to be at increased risk of poorer outcomes once they acquire the infection. For example, some comorbidities which increase the risk of poorer outcomes from Covid-19 are more common among certain ethnic groups. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani background have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than people from White British ethnicity, and people of black Caribbean and black African ethnicity have higher rates of hypertension compared with other ethnic groups. Data from the National Diabetes Audit suggests that type II diabetes prevalence is higher in people from BAME communities.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:10:28.610Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63e498f084df971c8e304\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/haroonsiddique\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:56:57.797Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The delayed report into into why black, Asian and minority ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">has just been published.</a></p> <p>It says, after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region: \u201cPeople of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death when compared to people of white British ethnicity.

It examines how coronavirus affects different demographic groups. It runs to 89 pages and it is<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\"> here (pdf).</a></p> <p>There has been particular focus on what it will say about why BAME people are so much more at risk. This is what it says on this in the summary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People from black ethnic groups were most likely to be diagnosed. Death rates from Covid-19 were highest among people of black and Asian ethnic groups. This is the opposite of what is seen in previous years, when the mortality rates were lower in Asian and black ethnic groups than white ethnic groups. Therefore, the disparity in Covid-19 mortality between ethnic groups is the opposite of that seen in previous years. </p> <p>An analysis of survival among confirmed Covid-19 cases and using more detailed ethnic groups, shows that after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black ethnicity had between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British. </p> <p>These analyses did not account for the effect of occupation, comorbidities or obesity. These are important factors because they are associated with the risk of acquiring Covid-19, the risk of dying, or both. Other evidence has shown that when comorbidities are included, the difference in risk of death among hospitalised patients is greatly reduced.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what the summary says about comorbidities (underlying health conditions).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Among deaths with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, a higher percentage mentioned diabetes, hypertensive diseases, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia than all cause death certificates. </p> <p>Diabetes was mentioned on 21% of death certificates where Covid-19 was also mentioned. This finding is consistent with other studies that have reported a higher risk of death from Covid-19 among patients with diabetes. This proportion was higher in all BAME groups when compared to white ethnic groups and was 43% in the Asian group and 45% in the black group. The same disparities were seen for hypertensive disease. </p> <p>Several studies, although measuring the different outcomes from Covid-19, report an increased risk of adverse outcomes in obese or morbidly obese people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:28:57.268Z\">at 1.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63d5a8f087122eca5408f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:55:31.889Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sturgeon concluded her speech by rejecting suggestions one-metre distancing is enough to stop the spread of Covid-19. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might be reading or hearing in the media today some voices saying that one metre is sufficient, so I want to take the opportunity today to say the clear and strong advice from the Scottish government is to stay two metres apart from those in other households. </p> </blockquote> <p>She reiterated that people shouldn\u2019t meet up with more than one household, only once a day, and there should never be more than eight people in a group. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63c0d8f084df971c8e2ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:51:15.153Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>During her speech today, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> paid tribute to unpaid carers and volunteers.</p> <p>She said that an additional \u00a3230 payment to those eligible for the <strong>carer\u2019s allowance supplement</strong> - to help cover the strain of the coronavirus pandemic - will be paid automatically at the end of this month.</p> <p>The carer\u2019s allowance supplement, worth \u00a3460 a year, is paid to 83,000 people in Scotland.</p> <p>She also acknowledged that it is Volunteers\u2019 Week and said the efforts of volunteers are more important than ever during this period.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:53:23.293Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed638dc8f084df971c8e2b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:39:16.345Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest coronavirus numbers from <strong>Scotland</strong> as the first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> begins her daily press conference.</p> <p>As of 9am this morning:</p> <ul> <li>There have been a 53 further confirmed cases, taking the total to 15,471 positive cases.

Ferguson was appearing with three other academics. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05#block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05\">10.10am.)</a> At no point was he asked, or did he allude to, the circumstances that led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">his resignation from Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a>, although at one point in his evidence, when speaking about care homes, he did sound like someone holding back strong views about government ministers. (When Ferguson resigned from Sage, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/government-scientists-lockdown-breach-a-matter-for-the-police-says-speechless-matt-hancock\">seemed to relish denouncing him.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Ferguson said that he expected coronavirus levels to remain \u201crelatively flat\u201d as the lockdown was gradually eased over the summer but that it was \u201cvery unclear\u201d what would happen in September, when a fuller relaxation is expected.</strong> He implied a second spike was a real possibility. Asked what would happen, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the key issues is how much will relaxation of current controls lead to potential increases in transmission. I should say that it is not clear that it automatically will do so. But most of the modelling would suggest that we might get a small increase, but it\u2019s very unclear whether that will lead to the reproduction number being [above 1] ....</p> <p>I suspect, though, under any scenario that levels of transmission, and numbers of cases, will remain relatively flat between now and September - short of very big policy changes, or behavioural changes in the community.</p> <p>The real uncertainty is if there are larger policy changes in September, as we move into the time of year when respiratory viruses tend to transmit slightly better, what will happen then? And that remains very unclear. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that experts underestimated the extent of coronavirus in the UK in February, and that helped to explain why the death rate was higher than hoped</strong>. He said the experts had not realised how much infection was coming from Spain. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing the genetic data is showing us now is most chains of transmission still existing in the UK originated from Spain, to some extent Italy. We have been worrying about importations, infections from China - we\u2019re a very well connected country in the world, other Asian countries, the US - but it is clear that before we were even in a position to measure it, before surveillance systems were even set up, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals coming into the country in late February and early March from that area. And that meant that the epidemic was further ahead than we had anticipated.</p> <p>That explains some of the acceleration of policy then. It also explains, to some extent, why mortality figures ended up being higher than we had hoped.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was \u201cshocked\u201d at how bad countries around the world had been at protecting people in care homes.</strong> He was not talking specifically about the UK, but he was not omitting it either.

</p> <p>Flights will be at a lower frequency than normal, meaning the airline will operate at around 30% of its normal capacity between July and September. </p> <p>EasyJet previously announced it would resume operations on 15 June, but flights will mainly be restricted to domestic routes in the UK and France. </p> <p>A series of new safety measures will be introduced by the airline, including

Opposition parties want to retain electronic voting. But the vote on this issue will be resolved this afternoon by an \u201cin person\u201d vote. Social distancing rules do not allow MPs to congregate in the division lobbies, as they used to do pre-Covid, and instead they will have to form a long, socially-distanced queue.

MPs who are able to go in and vote will be able to show off to their constituents, like Giant Haystacks in the wrestling ring, yet those MPs who genuinely cannot come back to Westminster, will face questions from local residents why they are not voting, have to explain their personal circumstances, which may be uncomfortable for them to do, and, see their voting record trashed in the internet league tables.

FUCK YOU @lorealparis. You dropped me from a campaign in 2017 and threw me to the wolves for speaking out about racism and white supremacy. With no duty of care, without a second thought. I had to fend for myself being torn apart by the world&#39;s press because YOU didn&#39;t want to talk about racism. You even tried to get me to incriminate myself with pairing me up with your shady lawyers, when I had done NOTHING wrong. THAT is what you get for &#39;speaking out&#39; when employed by @lorealparis. Racist snakes. You do NOT get to do this. This is NOT okay, not even in the slightest. I said just yesterday that it would only be a matter of time before RACIST AF brands saw a window of PR opportunity to jump on the bandwagon. Fuck you. Fuck your &#39;solidarity&#39;. Where was my support when I spoke out? Where was my apology? I&#39;m disgusted and writing this in floods of tears and shaking. This is gaslighting. If you care about me or #blacklivesmatter, don&#39;t let @lorealparis get away with this.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/munroebergdorf/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> \uff2d\uff35\uff2e\uff32\uff2f\uff25</a> (@munroebergdorf) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-01T14:12:44+00:00\">Jun 1, 2020 at 7:12am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>In August 2017, Bergdorf was announced as one of the faces of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BYSwkyRnJ5Y/?utm_source=ig_embed\">True Match</a> diversity campaign to launch a range of foundations for a variety of skin tones.

  "<p>Depending on where you stand, an upside of Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown has been the abandonment of some of the more public and political elements of national celebrations to commemorate <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov.au/what-we-do/cultural-heritage/250th-anniversary-captain-cooks-voyage-australia\">the 250th anniversary of James Cook\u2019s arrival</a>.</p> <p>The slated Australian circumnavigation by the replica Endeavour was abandoned (Cook himself never did circle the continent anyway) while the big day itself \u2013 29 April 2020 \u2013 passed with little more than official murmur.</p> <p>Instructively, however, the plan for a $50m revamp of the site at Kurnell in Kamay national park where Cook first stepped on the east coast (and promptly shot at least one Gweagal tribesman before stealing spears and a shield) appears to be proceeding.</p> <p>Kurnell is a monolith of the national psyche, looming as either (again depending on your view) <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/on-cook/\">the place that opened the door to post-Cook invasion and all the ills of colonisation \u2013 or the vanguard of continental civilisation and modernity</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2020/apr/29/commemorating-james-cooks-arrival-australia-should-not-omit-his-role-in-the-suffering-that-followed\">Commemorating Captain James Cook\u2019s arrival, Australia should not omit his role in the suffering that followed | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister, Scott Morrison \u2013 the member for Cook (named after the navigator) and a big booster of the Yorkshire lieutenant, <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/honouring-captain-james-cooks-voyage\">unambiguously said</a>: \u201cAs&nbsp;the 250th anniversary nears we want to help Australians better understand Captain Cook\u2019s historic voyage and its legacy for exploration, science and reconciliation. That voyage is the reason Australia is what it is today and it\u2019s important we take the opportunity to reflect on it.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a position supported by most in government and opposition; challenging the Cook national foundation myth remains as dangerous in public life as accepting the absurd proposition that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/aug/16/white-supremacy-was-the-mainstay-of-australian-federation-little-has-changed\">the modern Australian federation (and all of the Indigenous misery and racism at its fundaments) was forged on the shores of Gallipoli in 1915</a>. </p> <p>While Kurnell \u2013 on the southern shore of what became Botany Bay \u2013 might be notorious in the Australian imagination, few actually go there. Not many Sydney residents let alone interstate visitors, who gravitate to the glittering harbour and its totems to modernity, would know where Kurnell is, never mind visit.</p> <p>The visitor\u2019s centre is an uninviting shrine to Cook, its attempt to dissect the clash of civilisations that began a stone\u2019s throw away on the foreshore imbued with the clumsy museological ethnology of the 1980s. School kids and others do visit. But on three consecutive visits to it and the surrounding memorial site last year, I barely saw another soul.</p> <p>Despite an intent to incorporate greater Indigenous agency and perspective into any new Kurnell visitor centre and memorial site (currently characterised by the view through an acute, outdated Anglo-Australian lens) will the visitors come? What could make it worthwhile or truly special?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/25/the-gweagal-shield-and-the-fight-to-change-the-british-museums-attitude-to-seized-artefacts\">The return of that Gweagal shield</a>, held tightly by the British Museum (among 6,000 Australian Indigenous cultural items, stolen and otherwise acquired) to its precise place of origin \u2013 its country \u2013 has the power to distinguish the visitor centre. </p> <p>Before the global Covid-19 pandemic, tentative overtures had been made from high levels of the federal government to Britain urging the return of the shield for Cook\u2019s 250th. In recent years the New South Wales lower house passed a motion calling for the shield\u2019s return. Last December federal parliament debated a similar motion moved by Labor\u2019s Matt Thistlethwaite and Linda Burney. Several government MPs spoke in favour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2019/dec/02/theres-a-new-push-for-the-return-of-looted-aboriginal-artefacts-in-the-name-of-truth-telling\">Britain returning the shield</a>. </p> <p>Rodney Kelly, a sixth-generation descendant of the warrior Cooman, who Cook shot on that day of first contact in 1770, has long been lobbying the musuem for the return of his ancestral shield.</p> <p>He last met senior officials from the museum in December. But again there was little significant progress, he says.</p> <p>\u201cHow ever that shield comes back here \u2013 whoever gets it back \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter to us. But it belongs back here and the right place to keep it would be at Kamay,\u201d Kelly says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s at the point now where [Morrison] could make a real difference in getting it back here for good if he wanted to.\u201d</p> <p>The shield was returned to Australia briefly in 2015 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/27/encounters-exhibition-a-stunning-but-troubling-collection-of-colonial-plunder\">an exhibition, Encounters, at the National Museum of Australia</a>. It was protected (at the request of the British government and the museum) by a special Australian act of parliament, the Protection of Cultural Objects on Loan Act to avoid any repeat of 2004 when Indigenous activists seized three barks belonging to the Dja Dja Wurrung people of Victoria, while they were on loan from the British Museum to the Melbourne Museum. After a protracted court case the barks returned to London. </p> <p>The British Museum has been intransigent in its refusal to countenance a return of the shield to Australia \u2013 even under the guise of a so-called \u201cpermanent loan\u201d to a major gallery or museum in Sydney.</p> <p>Returning it to Kamay, to a purpose-built institution on the site from which it was stolen, in the heart of the Australian prime minister\u2019s electorate, might sound like a more persuasive proposition to the museum \u2026 especially if the British government is lobbied at a similarly senior level.</p> <p>It would be premature to overstate the conciliatory value of this repatriation at a time when the federal government continues to stifle so many Indigenous rights, outcomes, hopes and opportunities. Still, its return would transcend the realms of gesture.</p> <p>The shield is a portal to \u2013 and a portent of \u2013 the experience of: an unceded Indigenous sovereignty stretching back further and further the more we look; British arrival, land-grab and illegal possession; violent dispossession, and ongoing oppression. It encapsulates Indigenous survival, adaptability, continued resistance and endurance.</p> <p>It should be brought back in Kamay.

  "<p>Words do not often fail Boris Johnson. They are the tools that built his career, wielded for persuasion and deception, often at the same time.</p> <p>But the gift has deserted him during the pandemic. His performances in parliament are halting and listless. It is a while since he seeded the national conversation with one of his trademark rococo phrases. No \u201cdoomsters and gloomsters\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/27/mugwump-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-mutton-headed-old\">\u201cmutton-headed old mugwump\u201d</a> or \u201cinverted pyramid of piffle\u201d. He had a jaunty metaphor for flattening the peak of infection \u2013 \u201csquash the sombrero\u201d \u2013 but that was before he caught the disease. Covid-19 drained the colour from the prime minister\u2019s speech as well as his cheeks.</p> <p>He is miscast as a leader for dangerous times. The role demands responsibility and attention to detail. The Tory leader prefers a less gritty script, but government is about shovelling grit. There is an arduous journey between making promises and keeping them. Johnson outsources that discipline to others. Two terms as mayor of London taught him the value of letting aides do the unglamorous part of the job.</p> <p>That is why he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/from-rose-garden-to-ridicule-how-a-week-of-disaster-for-tories-and-dominic-cummings-unfolded\">refused to sack Dominic Cummings</a> for bending lockdown rules. Cummings is vital in Downing Street as a man who sees things through, bulldozing obstacles when others might try to negotiate around them. That trait appeals to Johnson on an intellectual as well as a practical level. The two men have similar self-regard as brilliant mavericks who can ignore rules meant for little people. But Cummings has arranged that arrogance into a pseudo-scientific doctrine (spelled out verbosely on his blog). Johnson\u2019s version is a shapeless blob of intuition, half-learned history and cod classicism.</p> <p>The chief strategist is the stiff mould into which the jelly of Johnson\u2019s gut impulses is poured. Once set, the doctrine can then hold its shape, albeit with a wobble. That function is especially important for Eurosceptic ultras. When pressure over the lockdown breach was at its most intense, one device used to rally Tory MPs was the claim that Cummings must stay in No 10 to deliver the purest Brexit. The fear is that Johnson will be swayed by the case for extending transitional terms, blanching at the economic cost of a no-deal exit in December and lost popularity when manufacturing industries in marginal seats pay the price. Cummings is tasked with keeping a foot on the accelerator pedal as the cliff-edge comes into view. He is said to \u201ckeep the PM honest\u201d on Brexit.</p> <p>That is not \u201chonesty\u201d in the commonly understood sense of the word that involves verifiable truth. In the Eurosceptic usage it means loyalty to an idea of Brexit, for the sake of which all dishonesties are permitted. Long before rows over lockdown there&nbsp;were dodgy claims about Turkey joining the EU and \u00a3350m weekly budget contributions. Apparently, the higher truth of national liberation cancels out any devious means used to achieve it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/laughter-lies-boris-johnson-journey-journalist-mp\">Johnson was a liar before he fronted Vote Leave </a>but in a lazy, blundering way. He was into small-time, tactical fibbing that often backfired \u2013 making up quotes when he started out in journalism; denying an extra-marital affair when he served in Michael Howard\u2019s shadow cabinet. (He was exposed and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/why-are-we-so-surprised-that-boris-johnson-lied-when-he-s-been-sacked-for-lying-twice-before-a7105976.html\">sacked both times</a>.) Cummings honed that raw talent for deceit like a boxing coach who turns a back-alley street brawler into a heavyweight champ. Fighter and trainer need each other.</p> <p>Brexit talks are the next title bout and, for the anti-Brussels hardcore, killing talk of extension beyond December is the prize. There is a round of negotiations this week but no one expects meaningful progress. The two sides are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/brexit-talks-risk-stalemate-if-no-progress-on-key-issues\">miles apart</a>, accusing each other of stubbornness. It looks like a replay of last year\u2019s nail-biter, which ended with Johnson crumpling at the last-minute, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/sombre-eu-leaders-sign-brexit-withdrawal-agreement\">signing a deal</a> on terms he had once rejected and calling it a victory.</p> <p>Until recently, officials and business leaders on both sides of the Channel expected the same to happen again. They see the pandemic as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/14/calls-to-extend-eu-transition-period-as-europe-fights-coronavirus\">irresistible argument for postponing gratuitous economic disruption</a>. But confidence that reason will prevail is draining away because it is hard to find anyone in government who sounds reasonable.</p> <p>The chest-beating ideology that Tory MPs spout in public turns out also to be what many ministers say in private: freedom must be grabbed with both hands or Brussels will bind them with red tape; the cost of no deal is lower during a pandemic because trade volumes are depressed anyway; a shiny new economy driven by \u201cindustries of the future\u201d will have to be built anyway, so Britain should not waste time on relations with rusty old Europe. They do not say this as part of an elaborate bluff. They believe it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/who-and-what-uk-and-eu-resume-interupted-brexit-talks-future-relationaship\">Brexit talks: who is involved and what is being covered?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister will be more attached than ever to that script now because it gets him out of his gloomy Covid-19 pit, back to flights of optimism. He does not sound himself when urging caution. Hard truths are pitched below his natural vocal range. He will hate the solemn tones of the coming recession even more. He wants to be singing hymns to blue skies over Global Britain. The darker the horizon, the more he will need to believe in that brave new dawn, the more he will want to talk it into existence.</p> <p>Even the prime minister\u2019s allies do not describe him as a man of principle. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/07/boris-johnson-wife-affair-tories-party-cheat-liar\">struggles with fidelity</a> to people and facts. But his longest relationship is with rhetoric and it is a mistake to dismiss it all as bluster. The lies surround a solid kernel of belief \u2013 in himself and his role in Britain\u2019s national destiny.

What is usually a complicated private identity becomes a public one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-death-of-george-floyd-a-turning-point\">A black man is killed</a> by a white police officer in the United States, and suddenly the world is attuned to your race.</p> <p>Suddenly, the world is trying to help. It\u2019s trying to amplify black voices. It\u2019s posting Martin Luther King and Malcolm X quotes and videos. It\u2019s donating money. It\u2019s circulating videos of black protesters and black media voices.</p> <p>And it\u2019s being humbled. It\u2019s trying to learn. It\u2019s ashamed that it wasn\u2019t educated enough before about racism, and it is here to take a cue from black people \u2013 your book recommendations, your understanding, your absolution. And it\u2019s also here a little bit for the righteous feeling of proximity to you, to your virtuous victimhood, to your moment in history.</p> <p>I can almost feel the blackness tingle on my skin as it is stripped off, posted, projected and explained over a billion social media posts. It is uncomfortable. It feels unnerving. Is it unkind? It feels like spending your life asking for solidarity from others, then saying, \u201cNo, not like that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>During the Arab spring, one of the favourite lines of commentary was that it was the world\u2019s first \u201csocial media revolution\u201d. An image of graffiti painted on the shuttered gates of a travel agency <a href=\"https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/latest-updates-on-day-10-of-egypt-protests/\">in Cairo</a> went viral. It read: \u201cTwitter, al-Jazeera, Facebook.\u201d It was a neat little story about the virtues of globalisation, technology and the promise of youth: just a few apps and websites had helped to bring down outdated regimes that had not kept up with the times.</p> <p>The events after George Floyd\u2019s death feel like they\u2019ve also hit a new social media nerve. Today, that graffiti would say: \u201cTikTok, Instagram, Twitter.\u201d&nbsp;But it feels as though there is no promise here. The explosion of support around black lives just means that there is a new racial divide opening up. Black people are on the ground risking their lives and livelihoods, and white people are mostly online, where there is only upside.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because this is the easy part: no matter how much effort has gone in to making sure you are the right sort of ally, no matter how much money you have donated or supportive feeds you have curated. For white people in America, there is no solidarity that is not received without a heavy dose of scepticism. The frequency of black men and women dying at the hands of white police officers tars a whole nation, not just a police force \u2013 one that is so empowered only because of the systemic complacency and normalisation of black murder. Those officers who kill are not all flukes, they\u2019re not all \u201cbad apples\u201d. A black man would not end up under the knee of a white officer for almost nine minutes if a black life mattered. </p> <p>For white people outside America, the solidarity is simpler. You don\u2019t have to reckon with your role in this. You don\u2019t have to grapple with guilt as black people are handcuffed and pepper-sprayed. If the riots were on your doorstep in the UK, for example \u2013 in Hackney or Handsworth or Moss Side \u2013 you\u2019d have to balance any conflict about really totally seeing where the protesters are coming from with worrying about your daughter walking home from the bus stop, or the integrity of your windows.</p> <p>So while&nbsp;the action is happening far away in the US, you won\u2019t find yourself tempted to equivocate because the thought of a black man being murdered on your patch is too uncomfortable and taints you with a sense of complicity. You won\u2019t have to come up with excuses: perhaps he had a gun; perhaps he was drunk; perhaps he was threatening. You won\u2019t find yourself, as your neighbourhood is destabilised, instinctively feeling more empathy with the police, with whom you\u2019ve never had a bad experience; that yes, they are doing a tough job and have to make split-second decisions.</p> <p>Solidarity in the absence of proximity is a clean hit. America can be viewed as a uniquely violent place, cursed with a uniquely tragic racial history. It\u2019s an even more satisfying perspective when the voices and scenes emanating from the riots are so high-octane. With the heavy curation, editing and production quality of new social media channels, America\u2019s race riots already feel, even as they are still playing out, like a historical showreel montage. The impromptu speeches of African Americans, either pleading for restraint or choking back tears of anger, provide a lyrical and emotional soundtrack to the burning cars and buildings.</p> <p>The legacy of years of pain, of exhaustion, of retreading the same ground, have morphed into a sort of modern-day blues: a newly forming tradition of oratory that narrates the experience of being black in America. Giving it weight is decades of activism, literature, film and music that have made African American history vivid and intimate \u2013 so much so that outsiders feel an ownership and familiarity with the texture of race relations in America in ways they do not about their country\u2019s own.&nbsp;Racism becomes reduced to the US version, to its most dramatic transgressions. A tragedy for Americans, a break for everyone else, who&nbsp;can fret about how singularly awful it is over there.</p> <p>This mass global support cannot be separated from American cultural hegemony, from its power as exporter of its story. From its glamour. Hip-hop, the popular culture of African American distress \u2013 one that came into being to come to terms with death and dispossession \u2013 has been merely entertainment for everyone else. When the real thing happens, consumers treat it like just more celluloid, sharing it as an aesthetic and artistic arms-length experience, rather than the visceral expression of anguish that it is. It is not blackness that is being elevated here \u2013 an experience that is jagged, diverse and unbranded \u2013 it is African Americanism, sold as a consumer product.</p> <p>This is why the \u201cwhite ally\u201d support is uncomfortable. It kicks in only when black people conform to an image and live up to a single moment. It raises them at this point, but the rest of the time black voices are not fashionable, their grievances not dramatic&nbsp;or simple enough, or caught on camera. True solidarity, the one that helps in the long term rather than merely buys a sticking plaster for the short term, is in those moments. It is in the daily discomfort of taking risks, of challenging a&nbsp;&nbsp;system that subtly but emphatically excludes black people, when there is no reward for doing so, and of making way and giving up space where it counts \u2013 at the table where power sits \u2013 and when no one can see you do it.</p> <p>Parting with money and sharing on social media is the easy bit. And thank you, I guess. But the moments in between are the only ones that really matter.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Britain has vowed to build an international alliance of democracies going beyond \u201cthe usual suspects\u201d to force China to step back from the brink over its plans for a new national security law in Hong Kong.</p> <p>In a statement to MPs, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said that by threatening Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, China \u201cwas inexplicably putting at risk what has long been regarded as one of [its] economic jewels\u201d.</p> <p>He also accused Beijing of intimidation in building a pro-China global alliance, saying Britain was trying to build its own counter-alliance of democracies to defend Hong Kong freedoms. He said the alliance needed to stretch beyond \u2018the usual suspects\u201d in Europe and the Five Eyes alliance to include countries in Africa and Latin America so drawing together countries with \u201ca likeminded attachment to the rule of law\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jun/02/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">Hong Kong: the end of one country, two systems?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>&nbsp;Raab also clarified his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/three-million-hong-kong-residents-eligible-for-uk-citizenship\">offer last week of a path to citizenship</a> through an extendable right to stay for periods of 12 months was applicable at this stage only to the existing 300,000 Hong Kong British Nationals Overseas (BNO) passport holders. The offer, including a right to work and study, will extend the right to stay from six months to an extendable 12 months. He said the offer would be formally made only if China wentahead with its as-yet-unpublished security laws.</p> <p>He told MPs the UK offer was confined to the existing 300,000 BNO passport holders and their dependents in Hong Kong, and not to those eligible for a BNO passport but who do not currently hold one. He said the UK government had to be realistic about the numbers Britain could credibly and responsibly absorb.</p> <p>If the offer was extended to all those eligible for the BNO passport, as many as 2.5 million people would be entitled to come to the UK. On Friday, there had been suggestions that the offer would definitely to be extended to all those eligible to apply for a BNO.</p> <p>Raab also ruled out calls from some MPs to offer a UK visa to those not eligible to apply for the BNO. Many of the younger Hong Kong citizens at the centre of the protests against Chinese rule have never been eligible for BNO status as it is only available to those born before 1997.</p> <p>Revealing he had been looking at the BNO issue with the Home Office since September, he said the UK\u2019s offer met UK\u2019s moral responsibilities as a former colonial power. \u201cWe, as the UK, have historic responsibilities, a duty I would say, to the people of Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will stand by them, we will live up to our responsibilities,\u201d and added: \u201dWe have a proud tradition for standing up as a haven for those fleeing persecution\u201d,</p> <p>Raab told MPs: \u201cThere is time for China to reconsider. There is a moment for China to step back from the brink and respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and respect China\u2019s own international obligations.</p> <p>\u201cIf China continues down this current path, if it enacts this national security law, we will consider what further response we make, working with those international partners and others,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can cross the Rubicon and violate the rights of the people of Hong Kong, or it can step back and understand the widespread concern of the international community\u201d.</p> <p>He insisted the proposed new law breached Beijing\u2019s international commitments to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle in the former colony.</p> <p>A number of Conservative MPs demanded that the UK reset its relations with China, but Raab said he wanted to continue to cooperate with China on issues such as trade and climate change. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, called for the UK government to \u201cstep up\u201d its response. She told MPs: \u201cIt is time for an international democratic alliance to come together and speak with one voice.\u201d</p>",

He normally lives in a stock photo about online banking. Unfortunately, that environment seems not to have prepared Robert for questions about why the government is easing lockdown when they themselves said they would not do so until the official alert level was 3. \u201cThe alert level is changing,\u201d Jenrick handwaved. \u201cWe are still at level 4 but we are transitioning to 3.\u201d Is this like when I still haven\u2019t done the ironing but I am transitioning to having done it? Have I, at that moment, done the ironing? No. Of course I haven\u2019t. But I WILL have. Scientifically, it\u2019s a hugely interesting space to be in. I call it participle physics \u2013 which is like particle physics, except Robert Jenrick can do it.</p> <p>The above may already be my favourite tense, even compared to the football continuous. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done there, is he\u2019s thought he could come out of his house, but he\u2019s got blindsided by that flailing threat level, he\u2019s taken some virus right up the nose, and he\u2019s sadly died. You don\u2019t like to see that, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Occupying a similarly liminal space is the new joint biosecurity centre, which is supposed to assess the alert level, and for which Matt Hancock raised his bullshit category to 5 on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re getting it stood up,\u201d the health secretary blustered, as though it were an Ikea bookshelf, or a news story that 250,000 tests had been conducted, as long as you count cake tests, smoke alarm tests, pregnancy tests and online personality tests. \u201cIt\u2019s being formulated,\u201d Hancock went on of the biosecurity centre. \u201cIt\u2019s being pulled together.\u201d Sounds like it. Let us know if you need an Allen key. (Speaking of the ironing, these days my system is to do it during the 5pm Downing Street briefing. I find it helps to press down on something.)</p> <p>Staying with the good news, Priti Patel and Alok Sharma have reportedly been drafted in to \u201cbeef up\u201d the virus war cabinet. So this brains trust now comprises Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Hancock, Patel, Dominic Raab and Sharma. If you had to compare it to Harold Wilson\u2019s kitchen cabinet, I guess you\u2019d say it would be outperformed by the table. If they wanted to beef it up further they could buy 500g of mince. Or a gelatine sachet.</p> <p>Rumours of beef among the beefed-up have been debunked, however, with the Sunday Times <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/they-are-tied-together-but-is-the-dominic-cummings-and-boris-johnson-show-over-9qgxxdlvz\">scotching the idea</a> that Raab had punched Cummings in a fight broken up by Gove.&nbsp;It may be politically incorrect to say so, but one does sometimes wonder if the male temperament is quite suited to roles in public life, what with their hormones. Sorry, hormone. For balance, and to bolster any snowflakes melting at that joke, I\u2019d like to add the progressive view of Darren Grimes. Darren\u2019s a Conservative and Brexit campaigner, and the third brother Jedward refuse to talk about. In April, he endorsed Dominic Raab\u2019s view of Boris Johnson as a fighter. \u201cRaab would know this,\u201d he judged. \u201cHe\u2019s a karate black belt that trained and fought so hard he had to have a hip replaced.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster\">UK coronavirus live: Hancock announces further review into why BAME people more likely to die from coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moving on to middle-class etiquette black belt Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader has pushed for the full return of MPs to Westminster today and beyond. Having found the one place where he feels he fits in, Rees-Mogg is demanding it be reassembled the way he likes it, no matter the potentially deadly costs to disabled and vulnerable MPs or those they care for. He is assisted by the likes of Tory backbencher Christopher Chope, whose chief claim to fame is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-44524611/sir-christopher-chope-defends-blocking-upskirting-bill\">blocking a bill to criminalise upskirt photographs</a>, apparently to make some philosophical point about something or other. What an out-and-out Cnut. On Monday, Chope could be found dismissing the 2-metre social distancing rules as mere \u201cguidance\u201d, and suggesting that MPs were some kind of exception to them. Can he not he just use a 2-metre selfie stick like any normal committed pervert?</p> <p>As for the ongoing deceit over the alert level, it has now emerged that chief medical officer Chris Whitty refused to lower it, and thus allow his science to be led by the government. But by now you\u2019ll already be working on the principle that there\u2019s one elite threat level, and another one for the rest of us. All-powerful strategist Dominic Cummings is currently operating on an alert level of minus 5, connoting that he denies the existence not simply of the virus, but of China itself, and has powers to make you lick the railings outside a primary school if you wonder if no-deal Brexit is still the genius idea it once was.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s great news that Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t had to lose this Carnival Richelieu, this Otto von Jizzmark. I don\u2019t want you to read anything into the fact that alongside Cummings, last week\u2019s other highest-profile person to break the local lockdown rules was a 28-year-old Belgian princeling. This is sadly how we live now, no matter how wrong the public think it is. But sadly, you know? Definitely sadly.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Interest rates have never been lower and lenders have slashed the cost of overdrafts. Normally that would be the signal for UK consumers to flash the plastic and take on more debt.</p> <p>Not this time. According to the Bank of England, households reduced their credit card bills and paid off their non-mortgage loans at a record rate in April. Consumers tend to get warier about borrowing when times are tough: they behaved similarly during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/02/uk-consumers-repay-record-74bn-of-debt-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">a monthly debt repayment of \u00a37.4bn</a> is in a different league from anything seen before.</p> <p>Seen from one perspective, the repayment of debt is nothing to worry about. Consumers spent April confined to their homes and had little opportunity to blow the money provided either by their employer or by the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p>Spending options were severely curtailed. Go out for a meal? Not possible because of the risk of catching the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>virus. Take out a loan to buy a new car? Not feasible with all the showrooms shut. Book a cruise and put it on the credit card? Summer \u2013 as confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/02/stocks-shrug-off-us-unrest-china-tensions-amid-easing-of-covid-19-lockdown-pound-oil-business-live\">P&amp;O\u2019s decision to suspend sailings until mid-October </a>\u2013 has been cancelled this year.</p> <p>As a result, households saved more and spent less. They used the period of lockdown to pay off debt and put their finances in order. As the lockdown restrictions are gradually eased, consumers will be in a stronger position and will make up for lost time with a surge of spending. The debt repayments of March and April will prove to be exceptional, as will the 80% drop in mortgage approvals and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/02/uk-house-prices-fall-coronavirus-nationwide\">fall in house prices </a>reported by the Nationwide building society.</p> <p>This all looks a tad panglossian. The reason consumers tend to save more of their disposable income during difficult times is that they feel the need to build up a financial buffer in case they lose their jobs, have their hours cut or find that their wages are not keeping pace with prices. With more than 8 million workers furloughed, that\u2019s true in spades this time.</p> <p>So, not all of the reduction in borrowing has been caused by a lack of spending opportunities. Some of it is due to consumers \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 being worried about what the future may bring. Those anxiety levels will remain high for some time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How to help make the G20 function</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to understand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/gordon-brown-urges-g20-countries-to-back-25tn-coronavirus-plan\">frustration of the 225 members of the global great and good </a>who have written to the leaders of the G20 demanding a stronger international response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>pandemic.</p> <p>The G20 \u2013 a gathering of the world\u2019s key developed, emerging market and developing nations \u2013 had its moment of glory during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. Now it is effectively moribund.</p> <p>The G20 showed in 2008-09 that it is capable of acting in a coordinated manner. During the financial crisis there was a collective stimulus, funding for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and a commitment to avoid protectionism.</p> <p>Today the world faces an even bigger crisis and there is plenty that the G20 could be doing.</p> <p>It could be helping to make the health systems of poor countries more resilient. It could be co-ordinating efforts to finding a vaccine for the virus. It could be developing an action plan to rebuild the global economy with a green new deal. It could be ensuring there are the funds available to help the more than 100 countries that have applied to the IMF for help, and to prevent extreme poverty from rising. It could come up with a comprehensive debt relief plan.</p> <p>The G20 could be doing all these things and more but it has gone missing in action. While individual countries have responded quickly and decisively to the twin health and economic emergencies, the international response has been feeble.</p> <p>To turn the G20 into an effective body three things need to happen. Firstly, someone needs to provide the leadership that Gordon Brown showed in 2008-09. Secondly, relations need to be improved between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 the US and China. In the early years of the 21st century, Washington wanted Beijing to have a seat at the table when the big global issues were being discussed. Now, relations between the two countries are poisonous.</p> <p>Finally, there needs to be a recognition that collective action now is the best way to minimise the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 later this year. Otherwise, the G20 is a pointless relic.</p>",
  "<p>Poachers have killed at least six elephants in a single day in Ethiopia, wildlife officials said on Tuesday, the largest such slaughter in memory in the east African nation.</p> <p>The elephants died last week, when they ventured out of the Mago National Park in the far south of Ethiopia to drink water, Ganabul Bulmi, the park\u2019s chief warden, told reporters.</p> <p>\u201cThe poachers then removed all the tusks from the elephants. It was a mass killing. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this before,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Two other elephants might have been killed the same day, and an investigation continues.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt also has proved difficult to apprehend the perpetrators because the locals who live in the area are armed and were not willing to engage officials,\u201d Ganabul said.</p> <p>According to wildlife officials, Ethiopia had more than 10,000 elephants in the 1970s but poaching and habitat degradation have reduced the number to about 2,500 to 3,000 in recent years.</p> <p>Daniel Pawlos, director for trafficking and control at the Wildlife Conservation Authority, a government entity, said it was not thought that there was organised poaching in Ethiopia.</p> <p>\u201cLast year we documented up to 10 elephant killings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whenever there\u2019s demand, that triggers illegal poaching. What makes the latest poaching [incident] different is the high number of elephants killed within a day.\u201d</p> <p>Officials suspect that most elephant tusks and finished products are slipped out of the country to China and south-east Asian countries. In 2015, Ethiopian officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2015/mar/20/ethiopia-burns-ivory-addis-ababa-elephant-rhinoceros-tusks-trafficking-video\">burned 6.1 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2015/mar/20/ethiopia-burns-ivory-addis-ababa-elephant-rhinoceros-tusks-trafficking-video\">tonnes</a> of illegal elephant tusks, ivory trinkets, carvings and various forms of jewellery to discourage poaching and the ivory trade.</p> <p>Across Africa, the Covid-19 pandemic has provided opportunities for poachers, with security forces diverted to other tasks. Combined with the absence of visitors, this has left many reserves vulnerable.&nbsp;</p> <p>The elephant population in Ethiopia has been threatened for some time due to \u201cheightened and unavoidable human-elephant conflict\u201d, Greta Iori, Ethiopia technical adviser for the Wildlife&nbsp;Conservation&nbsp;Society, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/last-wolves-in-africa-fragile-wildlife-ethiopia-park\">told the Guardian last year</a>.</p> <p>A population of about 500 at the Babile Elephant Sanctuary, one of the country\u2019s most important elephant ranges, could be decimated \u201cin a blink of an eye\u201d through poaching, with park staff struggling to secure the sanctuary, she said.</p> <p>Nationwide, conservation efforts have been stymied in recent years by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/13/freedom-oromo-activists-qeerroo-ethiopia-standstill\">civil unrest</a>&nbsp;and the political transition following the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/08/abiy-ahmed-upending-ethiopian-politics\">appointment&nbsp;of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/08/abiy-ahmed-upending-ethiopian-politics\">Abiy Ahmed</a> as prime minister in 2018.</p> <p>Around 400,000 elephants are estimated to live across Africa, but are under pressure everywhere. Government responses to the problem have varied.</p> <p>In Botswana, where about 130,000 elephants live, hunting licences are being sold again after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/botswana-lifts-ban-on-hunting-elephants\">five-year ban was lifted</a> in 2019.&nbsp;</p> <p>Botswanan officials say hunting is necessary to ease conflict between animals and humans, especially farmers, whose crops and infrastructure have been destroyed by elephants roaming outside their feeding zones.</p> <p>Environmentalists are divided on the best means to manage the conflict, with some fearing licensed hunting could fuel demand and thus encourage even more illegal poaching.</p> <p>Drought has also been a problem. In September and October&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/drought-kills-more-than-200-elephants-in-zimbabwe\">more than 200 elephants died</a> due to a lack of water at Zimbabwe\u2019s main conservation zones in Mana Pools and Hwange National Park.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes,\u201d is how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/boris-johnson-cooperation-coronavirus-vaccine-bid#maincontent\">Boris Johnson described</a> the search for a coronavirus vaccine just a month ago. At the time, the prime minister urged countries to pull together and share their expertise. Yet if his government\u2019s actions are anything to go by, it seems more interested in siding with big pharmaceutical corporations than turning vaccine research into a genuinely collective endeavour.</p> <p>The last straw came on Friday, when the government refused to support <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool/solidarity-call-to-action/\">a World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool/solidarity-call-to-action/\">zation initiative</a> to encourage countries to share research on coronavirus treatments and produce any final medicines patent-free. This would mean they could be distributed fairly according to need.&nbsp;The proposal, a voluntary scheme that would pool knowledge, intellectual property and data about coronavirus health technologies, is not particularly radical \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t guess that from the recent protestations of pharmaceutical corporations.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b964cfb2-5f2e-4cb7-b9ad-535481495eaa\">Pfizer called the proposal \u201cnonsense\u201d</a>, while the big British companies working on coronavirus treatments, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKlein, refused to participate. When asked whether he would attend the launch of the WHO proposal, Thomas B Cueni, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wMMwDshed0&amp;t=64m23s\">International Federation of Phamaceutical Manufacturers and Associations,</a> a lobbying group, said he was \u201ctoo busy\u201d.</p> <p>The reaction from this industry shouldn\u2019t surprise us. Over the past three decades, big pharma has used its unparalleled lobbying muscle to secure market monopolies that vastly increase the power it holds over governments. Thanks to trade rules known as Trips (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) that were developed in the 90s to enforce minimum patent standards around the world,<strong> </strong>these corporations enjoy monopoly protection for new medicines they manufacture, allowing them to charge any price the market will endure.</p> <p>These rules provide little incentive to produce the medicines desperately needed to treat illnesses common in low-income countries, such as sleeping sickness and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/cholera-and-coronavirus-why-we-must-not-repeat-the-same-mistakes\">cholera</a>, but rather promote a narrow focus on drugs that mitigate chronic conditions common in the west, such as statins to treat high cholesterol. With chronic conditions, big pharmaceutical companies can sell the same medicines to the same patients for years, or even decades. Vaccines \u2013 designed to prevent diseases&nbsp;\u2013 are often used only once, and therefore don\u2019t tend to be as profitable.</p> <p>Governments have poured phenomenal sums of money into drug development to stimulate essential medical research that patents have failed to incentivise. But this money \u2013 like the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">\u00a3500m</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine\"> of coronavirus research funding</a> \u2013 rarely comes with any strings attached, allowing pharmaceutical companies to monopolise the resulting medicines. A recent study estimated that one contender for a coronavirus treatment, a hepatitis C medication produced by the pharma giant Gilead, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e72d0ed3-11c7-43f6-a5e4-53e446f1e5a2\">costs $5 per course to produce</a>. The academics who authored the study said the drug is currently on sale in the US for more than $18,000 per treatment course.</p> <p>Despite the fact coronavirus medicines will be discovered using vast sums of public money, the NHS may still have to pay through the nose for any final product, while poorer countries could be unable to access the drug. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time this has happened. In the 90s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/19/theobserver.uknews6\">, millions died unnecessarily in the A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/19/theobserver.uknews6\">ids crisis in sub-Saharan Africa</a>, because the medicines to treat HIV were out of reach of most people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s initiative launched on Friday is intended to avert a repeat of this. Many countries, rich and poor, support it \u2013 including Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Norway, Portugal and Belgium. But for the British government, the patent system is sacrosanct. The UK seems desperate not to upset its own pharmaceutical corporations or the financial sector that makes substantial returns from these companies, which spend <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/business/big-pharma-spends-on-share-buybacks-but-rd-not-so-much.html\">more money on share buybacks</a> than on researching drugs.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/us-and-uk-lead-push-against-global-patent-pool-for-covid-19-drugs\">officials attempted to</a> water down a resolution at the World Health Assembly to create a global \u201cpatent pool\u201d, which would have encouraged the production of patent-free coronavirus drugs. Then, on Friday, they declined to support the new WHO initiative for pooling research. Given the base of big pharma in the US and the UK, the withholding of support by industry and governments in these countries could easily scupper the WHO\u2019s plans.&nbsp;</p> <p>At that point it will be up to individual governments to use their power to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-treatment-drug-companies\">override corporate patents</a>. Nations including Germany, Canada, Chile, Israel and Ecuador have expressed their willingness to do so. This is perfectly legal, although big pharmaceutical companies might hope to convince us otherwise.&nbsp;</p> <p>There\u2019s reason to believe that the British government has misjudged the public mood significantly. Recent polling in Britain and the US shows public support for making <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/what-people-think-about-global-access-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines\">coronavirus medicines available internationally based on need</a>, rather than ability to pay. And pharmaceutical companies have been careful to appear sympathetic to the need for \u201cfair and equal access\u201d to coronavirus treatments. Some, like <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-advances-response-to-global-covid-19-challenge-as-it-receives-first-commitments-for-oxfords-potential-new-vaccine.html\">AstraZeneca</a>, have even pledged to supply vaccines at \u201ccost price\u201d during the pandemic. But with big pharma, each word needs to be carefully interrogated. As these companies have admitted, such pledges will have <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-advances-response-to-global-covid-19-challenge-as-it-receives-first-commitments-for-oxfords-potential-new-vaccine.html\">limited impact on the corporation\u2019s profits</a> because of vast public coronavirus subsidies.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to the crunch, pharmaceutical companies treat healthcare as a commodity, not a right. If anything good comes of coronavirus, we may hope that&nbsp;it deepens the public understanding of the system\u2019s failures, allowing us to build a genuinely public system of medical research and development. The WHO initiative could be the first step in that direction.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement)</p>",
  "<p>If you\u2019re asked to imagine a person who has a heart attack, who do you see? Most of us think of an old man. It\u2019s what we tend to see in movies. And while 3.9 million men live with cardiovascular disease in the UK, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/contact-the-press-office/facts-and-figures\">British Heart Foundation</a>, 3.5 million women also have a heart condition. However, <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/women-and-heart-disease/download-bias-and-biology-briefing\">we know much less</a> about how to spot cardiovascular health issues in women.

But over the past two decades, scientists have laid bare our need to know more about a wider range of bodies. As data is slowly catching up with reality, could technology help to plug the gap?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/24/why-does-medicine-treat-women-like-men\">Why does medicine treat women like men?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is a lot of latent bias,\u201d says Alicia Chong Rodriguez, founder and CEO of early-stage startup, Bloomer Tech, who trained as an engineer before focusing on health tech. \u201cWe\u2019re unaware about the differences of women\u2019s symptoms, and there are adverse treatment outcomes. I really wanted to solve this using technology.\u201d</p> <p>She met her co-founders, Aceil Halaby and Monica Abarca, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bloomer Tech is named after the 19th-century women\u2019s rights activist Amelia Bloomer who campaigned against corsets. Bloomer Tech embeds medical sensors in \u201csmart bras\u201d to collect data on cardiovascular health.</p> <p>\u201cMedical devices can be cumbersome and annoying,\u201d says Chong Rodriguez, so the Bloomer bra comes with lace and playful straps. \u201cWe transformed a typical medical device into everyday medical-grade garments that women will actually want to wear.\u201d</p> <p>This March, they raised $3m (\u00a32.5m) in seed funding and plan to scale the manufacturing of their prototype for further tests. Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Bloomer Tech has a handful of full-time employees and the team is growing.</p> <p>As their inspiration, the founders credit the wider movement of cardiologists in the US and across the world, who have provided decades of evidence-based research \u2013 showing that physiological differences between the sexes demand more women-centric solutions.</p> <p>It\u2019s a novel approach. After all, most technology is still designed by men, for men. For instance, smartphones that don\u2019t fit into women\u2019s smaller hands. Such design and development oversights can adversely affect women\u2019s health and safety.

Its products focus on light and its impact on health: \u201cI think people are very focused on what they eat and exercise, but light is so essential to life on the planet it\u2019s been neglected in the health calculation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her interest was sparked by research that suggested nurses who work night shifts at hospital \u2013 and are therefore more exposed to blue light \u2013 have higher rates of breast cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>Moving from Denmark to the UK, she enrolled in a master\u2019s programme on innovation design engineering at Imperial College, where she met her co-founder Hugo Starrsjo. The duo set up a Kickstarter campaign, raising \u00a355,978, and launched their startup in London in 2016. Their product is a button, the size of a \u00a32 coin. It\u2019s a wearable light-tracking device that helps people monitor the kind of light they\u2019re exposed to throughout the day.</p> <p>When it comes to our light intake, intensity, colour, timing and duration matter. \u201cYou have to avoid blue light at night before bed because blue light suppresses melatonin, your natural sleep hormone,\u201d says Friis Blach Petersen. Most offices are too dark, \u201cthey\u2019re telling you to go to sleep in terms of what light you\u2019re getting\u201d. The result is circadian rhythm disruption. This, in turn, has been linked to illnesses in the long-term, while affecting our sleep and energy levels in the short run.</p> <p>How did they go about designing wearable tech that would suit both men and women? \u201cI feel the problem with men designing for women, is they think: \u2018We\u2019ll just make it pink and fluffy,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI really thought about how we could make it minimalistic and Scandinavian and fit it into a modern lifestyle.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing the data disparity found in cardiovascular health, she says: \u201cA lot of the research done in academia with circadian rhythms is done with 25-year-old men, sitting in a lab with a spectrometer on their heads.\u201d But we know that women typically need more light than men.</p> <p>\u201cThis huge gap in medical data for women offers a lot of opportunities for tech startups,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Marija Butkovic, a lawyer from Croatia who moved to London in 2016, is the founder and CEO of Women of Wearables. It started out as a small get-together to connect women who worked in wearable tech, but has now turned into a global community with more than 20,000 members in 30 countries.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to women\u2019s health, there are business opportunities in any area you choose\u201d, she says, as long as you find good data. What\u2019s more, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25418222/\">women make 80% of healthcare decisions in the US in the home</a>, according to the US Department of Labor. \u201cThere\u2019s 50% of us on this planet, we cannot be niche.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, female-only startups still only received less than 3% of venture capital in the US, <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard\">according to PitchBook</a>. Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.diversity.vc/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/British-Business-Bank-UK-Venture-Capital-and-Female-Founders-Report.pdf\">83% of venture capital deals</a> in the UK went to all-male teams in 2017.</p> <p>While female founders deserve more funding, it\u2019s also clear that the issue of gender bias in medicine requires a larger societal shift. \u201cWe really need to approach this challenge in a holistic way,\u201d says Butkovic. Researchers, investors, corporates, and pharma companies need to get on board. Because, as she notes: \u201cThese problems and challenges cannot be solved<em> only </em>by innovative startups.\u201d</p>",

Cities still have a future, but the specific kind of&nbsp;city&nbsp;that has become globally dominant today shouldn\u2019t have a place in it.</p> <p>In&nbsp;places&nbsp;like London and New York, the development model over the past few decades has catered to the needs of elite individuals, powerful corporations and wealthy investors.

A set of intersecting crises has made urban life increasingly difficult for all but the wealthy. Housing has become unaffordable and insecure. Work has become casualised and wages have stagnated, leaving many workers unable to sustain an adequate standard of living.

The&nbsp;only&nbsp;solution to the urban crises we face is&nbsp;to establish a new direction for cities that reverses the inequities this pandemic has exposed.</p> <p>Emergency responses to coronavirus&nbsp;have shown that rapid change is possible. In neighbourhoods across the world, mutual aid networks have sprung up to coordinate everything from grocery shopping to rent strikes.&nbsp;Some cities acted swiftly to house the homeless, halt evictions,&nbsp;adjust traffic patterns&nbsp;and provide necessary health care. The reaction to the pandemic shows that the structures sustaining the unequal city are movable \u2013 and can be altered faster than had been assumed.</p> <p>As cities begin to change in response to the pandemic, it\u2019s crucial that they don\u2019t return to their previous trajectory.

The unrest sweeping the country could be the undoing of Trump \u2013 or it could dramatically increase his power. Which will it be? Toss a coin. Heads means this is the beginning of the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, tails means we can expect another term.</p> <p>I am not being flippant; I am trying to be realistic. There has been a lot of speculation about how the protests will affect Trump\u2019s chance of re-election, but the truth is that none of us, not even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/jan/06/trump-tweets-i-am-a-stable-genius-video\">a very stable genius</a> such as me, know how this will play out. By rights, a million different crises \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\">the Russia investigation</a> to the disputed accusation that he raped the journalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/e-jean-carroll-trump-rape-accuser-dna-sample\">E Jean Carroll</a>&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">his handling of the pandemic</a> \u2013 should have sunk Trump by now. But when it comes to this president, the normal rules do not seem to apply. One week, Trump is suggesting that we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">inject bleach to ward off the coronavirus</a>, the next he is threatening martial law. Everyone is shocked for a second, then we move on to his next drama.</p> <p>There is a school of thought that argues the urban uprisings in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/opinions/carnage-trump-right-and-wrong-answers-avlon/index.html\">will help Trump</a>. There have been numerous <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-06-01/trump-riots-protests-military\">comparisons to&nbsp;1968</a>, when Richard Nixon exploited an anti-riot backlash and rode a law-and-order platform to electoral victory. Trump seems to be trying his best to pull a Nixon. Before his extraordinary speech on Monday, he held an equally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">extraordinary&nbsp;video conference</a>&nbsp;with governors and law enforcement officials. On the call, Trump told participants that they were \u201cweak\u201d and needed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you\u2019ll never see this stuff again,\u201d&nbsp;Trump said. In other words: lock up a lot of people who might not vote for him. That is one way to win an election.</p> <p>There is another school of thought, however, that reckons this moment will harm Trump more than it helps him. He may be trying to ape Nixon, but there are enormous differences between 1968 and 2020 \u2013 not least the fact that Nixon was not trying to win a second term. Trump is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-retweets-account-slamming-democrats-as-floyd-protests-erupt-2020-5\">doing his best to blame Democrats</a>&nbsp;for the unrest, but he can\u2019t get around the fact that he is the president. He is the one who is supposed to be in charge.</p> <p>Again, it is too early to say how the situation will play out for Trump. It is, however, fair to say that Trump is in trouble \u2013 and he knows it. The protests don\u2019t exist in a vacuum:&nbsp;the coronavirus&nbsp;crisis means&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html\">one in four American workers</a>&nbsp;has filed for unemployment benefits and some of the country\u2019s swing states are expected to see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-01/trump-faces-drag-of-job-losses-topping-16-in-vital-2020-states\">prolonged job losses</a>. Trump is also doing very badly in the polls: Joe Biden has a 10-point lead over him in an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/01/poll-biden-lead-over-trump-general-election-293550\">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a>&nbsp;from Sunday and the president\u2019s approval rating has <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?cid=rrpromo\">dipped </a><a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?cid=rrpromo\">below 43%</a>. Trump is in trouble, which means trouble for the US. As the president made clear in his speech on Monday, he will not disappear without a fight \u2013 no matter how much collateral damage that causes.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist </p></li> </ul>",

Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan central hospital, died on Friday after being treated for Covid-19 and related issues for more than four months, state broadcaster CCTV said. Meanwhile city-wide testing of 9.9 million people between 14 May and 1 June found no new cases of Covid-19, and&nbsp;300 asymptomatic cases.

But in May, as the lockdown was gradually eased, the government counted a total of 26,573 new jobseekers in the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy, where the total number of unemployed stands at 3.8 million.&nbsp;The International Monetary Fund estimates unemployment in Spain could rise to 20.8% in 2020, while the government expects a figure of 19%.</p> <h2><strong>UK statistics watchdog criticises government\u2019s testing data</strong></h2> <p>Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97#block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\">In a strongly-worded letter</a>, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d.</p> <h2>First Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh dies of Covid-19</h2> <p>A 71-year-old man has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed601768f084df971c8e031#block-5ed601768f084df971c8e031\">the first of the Rohingya refugees</a> living in vast camps in&nbsp;Bangladesh&nbsp;to die from coronavirus, an official said.

The fatality was in Kutupalong, the largest of the camps, which is home to roughly 600,000 people. The man was among at least 29 Rohingya to have tested positive for the virus in the camps.

It is not a summer game. People want to play rugby in the winter in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Guess what? Townsend was a ball-playing fly-half while Johnson was one of the finest second-row forwards the game has seen. Both of them know plenty about playing and managing at the highest level yet they are poles apart when it comes to one of the modern game\u2019s fundamental debates. If their diametrically opposing views are any guide, finding a consensus may be tough.</p> <p>In some ways it is becoming a redundant argument: as the past month and a half of gloriously sunny weather has underlined, a large chunk of the season already takes place in summery conditions. The Premiership final was to have taken place on 20 June. Assuming Covid-19 precautions permit, England\u2019s leading clubs will train and play through July and August without a murmur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac3f924479438db88dedffdc52ebdb35ed17328\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac3f924479438db88dedffdc52ebdb35ed17328/0_96_1936_1162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gregor Townsend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gregor Townsend, the Scotland coach, is among those who would welcome a unified calendar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the plus side, how many vehemently hate the idea of a dry ball, more scope for the speedsters to shine and a nice cool post-match drink in the early-evening sun? There is not an attacking playmaker in existence who would miss the freezing fingers, slippery ball and icy fields of winter if the chance materialised to make a living in more conducive conditions. Name the visiting spectator who would be more inclined to drive to Sale on a dark, cheerless Friday night in January than a pleasantly warm June evening.</p> <p>It is at this point, inevitably, that the cacophony of counter arguments kick in. There are a vast array of other things to do in Britain and Ireland in summer. As rugby league has already found, union would be required to take its place in a lengthy queue, not least in the newspapers.</p> <p>The offer of strawberries and cream and a glass of Pimms at Kingston Park is not going to divert the majority from Wimbledon and Lord\u2019s. What happens to those who love their cricket AND their rugby? What are people going to do with themselves once the clocks go back and there is no rugby to fill the wintry emptiness? Who would want to sign the potential death warrant of tight forward play and play a sweat-soaked version of basketball?</p> <p>Different strokes for different folks. Some may also contend that the decisive tug of war between forwards and backs has already been settled. When the monarch of the glen, Sir Bill Beaumont, narrowly beat off the challenge of the former Argentina scrum-half Agust\u00edn Pichot to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/07/bill-beaumont-world-rugby-re-election-risks-global-rift-south-the-breakdown\">remain as the chairman of World Rugby</a> it was not on a campaigning platform of pi\u00f1a coladas at Murrayfield or pitch-side hot tubs in Cardiff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>But might it yet be possible to deliver the best of both worlds? The community and schoolboy game would stay where it is, offering more chance to support local and schools rugby rather than it being endlessly overshadowed by the pros. Television will still want to screen the Six Nations championship in April and no one objects to October internationals when the Rugby World Cup is happening.</p> <p>The Premiership clubs, collectively losing millions even before the shutdown, would get the chance to see if the unthinkable is actually a better financial bet. They may find that early-evening kick-offs (to avoid the warmest parts of the day) increase the number of people who want to watch, both at home as well as live.</p> <p>With firmer pitches, a more positive spectacle and greater incentives for spectators to hang around, it would also be easier to play double- and triple-headers, with women\u2019s rugby and sevens literally enjoying their moment in the sun. There would be fewer clashes with the commercial leviathan that is the Premier League and between club games and Tests. Rugby would also suddenly look different, shorn of its occasionally drab winter plumage. There would be international matches with both sides at their peaks, rather than one or the other limping to the end of their seasons.</p> <p>Stick it all together and what have you got? A sport with a growing identity crisis, possibly, but also one with a perfect opportunity to pursue something different. Is there anything to be lost by giving it a go in 2021, with the post-Covid calendar requiring a radical redraw anyway? And then extending the experiment for the remainder of the 2023 World Cup cycle? It could just deliver collective benefits for backs and forwards alike.</p> <h2>Second chance?</h2> <p>These are not easy times for anyone, let alone someone who has had to do as much recent soul-searching as Rob Howley. The former Wales assistant coach\u2019s nine-month ban for betting on the outcome of rugby matches expires in mid-June and anyone who has read the harrowing account of the family pressures that drove him to seek a degree of solace in gambling will wish him well wherever life now takes him. If he can add a successful new chapter to his coaching career it will rank among the game\u2019s most emotional comebacks.</p> <h2>And another thing \u2026</h2> <p>If there is a significant spike in rugby\u2019s popularity when the sport resumes it will be partly down to one man and two dogs. Just now <a href=\"@MrAndrewCotter\">Andrew Cotter</a> could commentate on the journey of a pair of underpants from bedroom floor to washing machine and still stand a fair chance of going viral. If any television broadcaster can be guaranteed to enhance a blank behind-closed-doors canvas it is Cotter.</p>",

It is expected to be extremely competitive this year and is considered a must-win state for both Trump and <strong>Joe Biden</strong> if they want to win the presidency.</p> \n  <p>The case involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">a challenge</a> from the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (Will), a conservative legal group. Will wants the voters removed because it says the state has \u201creliable evidence\u201d they may have moved. In 2019, the state sent out a mass-mailing to more than 232,000 people it believed had moved, based on data from other government agencies. </p> \n  <p>Will sued the state last year, saying it needed to remove people who didn\u2019t respond to the mailing within 30 days. Voting rights groups say such a quick removal would amount to voter suppression because there may be many people who are still qualified to vote and haven\u2019t moved, but just didn\u2019t respond to the mailing.</p> \n  <p>Wisconsin election officials want to wait to do the removals until well after the 2020 presidential election, saying they don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anyone who hasn\u2019t moved and is still eligible. A circuit court judge sided with Will in December and ordered the state to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">immediately purge</a> the voters, but he was later overruled<a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/14/appeals-court-blocks-purge-wisconsin-voter-rolls-time-being/4465158002/\"> by an appellate court</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Wisconsin Elections Commission <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">reported</a> last month that 4,709 voters who received the 2019 mailing had sent back postcards indicating they wanted to stay registered at their current address. Just over 57,000 had re-registered at a new address. 41,637 people on the list had become inactive based on other information that they were ineligible to vote. </p> \n  <p>129,151 voters have not updated their voter registration and could be affected by the supreme court\u2019s decision. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">Rightwing group pushes Wisconsin voter purge that 'could tip' 2020 election</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed569478f087122eca53a68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T20:51:02.532Z\">9.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>A dispatch from the Guardian\u2019s </em><em>Washington DC bureau chief inside the west wing today:</em></p> \n  <p>Since protests broke out, the world is waiting for Donald Trump to give an address from the Oval Office or elsewhere at the White House. Instead he dispatched Kayleigh McEnany, his press secretary, to the west wing briefing room on Monday.</p> \n  <p>One reporter noted that the president was literally taken to an underground bunker for his own safety on Friday night. \u201cWould you agree that he is hiding out on this issue and is that a good posture to be in?\u201d he asked.</p> \n  <p>McEnany replied: \u201cI would not agree with that at all. I was on the phone with the president at least half a dozen times yesterday and every time I talk to him, he was telling me about a different action he has taken whether it was talking to a governor about this or a foreign leader about ventilators. This president has been leading.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bridling at the idea that Trump has failed to speak out, the press secretary also insisted: \u201cMake no mistake, this president has not been silent. At this moment he is acting to protect this country from the lawlessness we saw just out here in Lafayette Park last night.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf246710b2c742a0ea549e39cd7871987f474401\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf246710b2c742a0ea549e39cd7871987f474401/0_152_4558_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It is now customary for all reporters at the White House briefings to wear masks.

set to reveal plans to refund robodebts, a Senate committee has been told, amid criticism the news was held until Friday afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Labor senator <strong>Murray Watt</strong> used the Senate select committee on Covid-19 to quiz department secretary <strong>Kathryn Campbel</strong>l over the handling of the announcement, which the opposition argues was timed late on Friday to avoid scrutiny.</p> \n  <p>Campbell confirmed she had provided advice to ministers in the lead-up to the decision to<a

have been straight out of an episode of Yes, Minister. </p> \n  <p>When asked to confirm the decision was made before the prime minister held his national cabinet press conference on Friday, Campbell made a statement of the obvious:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The decision was made before minister Robert made the announcement, senator.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Robert fronted the media at 3.45pm on Friday to announce the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and include recovery fee charges.</p> \n  <p>Watt asked Campbell whether in her current or

In April, total hours worked declined by an unprecedented 9% and more than 600,000 people lost their jobs, with many more people working zero hours. Household spending weakened very considerably and investment plans are being deferred or cancelled.</p> \n   <p>Notwithstanding these developments, it is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected. The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely. And there are signs that hours worked stabilised in early May, after the earlier very sharp decline. There has also been a pick-up in some forms of consumer spending.</p> \n   <p>However, the outlook, including the nature and speed of the expected recovery, remains highly uncertain and the pandemic is likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy. In the period immediately ahead, much will depend on the confidence that people and businesses have about the health situation and their own finances.</p> \n   <p>The substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy in Australia is helping the economy through this difficult period.

  "<p>Building new solar power projects would generate cheaper electricity than running most of the world\u2019s existing coal power plants, according to a global renewable energy report.</p> <p>New figures have revealed that more than half of the world\u2019s coal plants could be undercut by the falling cost of new large-scale solar projects, which are now more than 80% cheaper to build than in 2010.</p> <p>The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) has found that up to 1,200 gigawatts of the world\u2019s existing coal capacity could cost more to run than the cost of new utility-scale solar plants.</p> <p>If energy companies replaced only their most expensive coal plants with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy\">new solar power projects or onshore wind farms</a>, totalling 500 GW globally, they could save up to $23bn (\u00a318bn) every year and wipe out 5% of last year\u2019s total global carbon emissions, according to Irena.</p> <p>This global renewable energy boom would also stimulate $940bn in investment, or the equivalent of 1% of global GDP, as the world emerges from the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>&nbsp;Francesco La Camera, the director-general of Irena, said renewable energy is \u201cincreasingly the cheapest source of new electricity\u201d and offers \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/greening-economy-prosperity-financial-crisis-coronavirus\">tremendous potential to stimulate the global economy</a> and get people back to work\u201d.</p> <p>In under a decade the cost of large-scale solar power has fallen by more than 80% while onshore wind has fallen by almost 40% and offshore wind has declined by almost 30%.&nbsp;</p> <p>Irena\u2019s latest figures have revealed that costs are continuing to fall. The cost of large-scale solar power fell 13% last year to a global average of 6.8 US cents per kilowatt hour, while onshore and offshore wind costs both fell by about 9% to 5.3 cents&nbsp;per kWh and 11.5 cents per kWh respectively.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRenewable investments are stable, cost-effective and attractive, offering consistent and predictable returns while delivering benefits to the wider economy. A global recovery strategy must be a green strategy,\u201d La Camera said.</p> <p>Irena has found that increasing investment in renewable energy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/green-energy-could-drive-covid-19-recovery-international-renewable-energy-agency\">could generate major economic benefits</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/green-energy-could-drive-covid-19-recovery-international-renewable-energy-agency\"> and spark global GDP gains of almost $100tn</a> between now and 2050.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRenewables offer a way to align short-term policy action with medium- and long-term energy and climate goals. Renewables must be the backbone of national efforts to restart economies in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. With the right policies in place, falling renewable power costs can shift markets and contribute greatly towards a green recovery,\u201d said La Camera.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, President Donald Trump announced measures that could rewrite Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with the US. The territory now appears to be on the cusp of having its status in the world change more fundamentally than it did with the handover from Britain in 1997.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Beijing announced it would legislate a new national security law and impose it on Hong Kong by decree, bypassing the city\u2019s duly elected legislature in flagrant disregard of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement under which Hong Kong has been governed.</p> <p>In response, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reported to Congress under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act that Hong Kong no longer warranted treatment different from the rest of China, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">stating</a>: \u201cNo reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, last Friday, as a consequence of Pompeo\u2019s certification, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">announced</a> that he would be directing his administration \u201cto begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/hong-kong-officials-lash-out-at-trump-plan-to-strip-city-of-special-status\">Hong Kong officials lash out at Trump plan to strip city of special status</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As dramatic as the announcement was, Trump did not set out any specific measures: nothing has yet changed in the US-Hong Kong relationship. As such, there is still room for compromise, from both Beijing and Washington. However, the current environment does not suggest that compromise is in the air, and Trump\u2019s statement laid the groundwork and foreshadowed the White House\u2019s probable next steps.</p> <p>Many observers have wondered if the US might not end up hurting the very people they were supposedly trying to help: the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>Some of the potential US measures will not affect ordinary Hong Kong people or businesses. Certain bilateral agreements \u2013 such as those on extradition and mutual legal assistance \u2013 between Hong Kong and the US are likely to be the first casualties. This would end formal cooperation between Hong Kong and US authorities in criminal investigation and law enforcement, as well as remove the mechanism enabling the extradition of fugitives between the US and Hong Kong. Bringing Hong Kong within the scope of existing restrictions on exports of dual-use technologies is also a logical step, given Hong Kong\u2019s proximity, geographically and politically, to China. Hong Kong has allegedly been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/07/meng-wanzhou-huawei-cfo-court-bail-fraud-sanctions-breach-canada\">used to evade US sanctions</a> in the past.</p> <p>Sanctions are also on the cards for those Hong Kong and Beijing officials \u201cdirectly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d. This may include travel bans, or even extend to Treasury department sanctions over financial transactions and assets, and would cause pain for chief executive Carrie Lam and her ministers, but this would not affect ordinary Hong Kongers.</p> <p>However, the real challenge comes with Trump\u2019s threat to revoke Hong Kong\u2019s status as a separate customs and travel territory. This would mean the same tariffs, customs controls, quarantine and inspection standards, and visa rules would apply to Hong Kong as the rest of China, and would have serious adverse consequences for Hong Kong people and businesses. Many in Hong Kong are hoping that the US does not go that far. Pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/opinion/hong-kong-china-national-security-law.html\">argued in the New York Times</a> that \u201cremoving those privileges would only make Hong Kong more dependent on China\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps the most profound impact of the US action may be that Hong Kong, in the very near term, would become globally regarded to be part-and-parcel of China, and to carry with it China\u2019s reputation, for better or worse. In the past, Hong Kong has enjoyed its own, separate, global reputation. Hong Kong government leaders and trade delegations travelled the world meeting with foreign governments and advocating for Hong Kong in international business circles under the aegis of the \u201ctwo systems\u201d side of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. No matter what was happening in the rest of China, Hong Kong stood apart.</p> <p>Well, Hong Kong will stand apart no longer.</p> <p>It may be natural to blame the US for this, and some have already argued that the US measures are pushing Hong Kong closer to Beijing. Indeed, the changes in US policy towards Hong Kong are being driven by the bigger issue of a hardening US approach towards China, one of the&nbsp;few truly&nbsp;bipartisan issues remaining in US politics. In this sense, Hong Kong finds itself in the unfortunate position of&nbsp;being a pawn in an emerging cold war between the two superpowers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/beijing-hong-kong-beijing-china-uk-response\">Beijing has undermined the image of a stable Hong Kong | Isabel Hilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the sad reality is that Hong Kong government leaders have already been doing this themselves, all too willingly stepping into their role as proxies for Beijing, rather than standing up for the people of the city they are supposed to represent. This could not have been more evident than in the last week as Lam and many of her principal officials lined up to praise the new national security law, reciting from near-identical scripts that could have been drafted by the party central propaganda department.</p> <p>This is only the most recent example in a long-developing trend in which Hong Kong\u2019s leaders have gradually ceded its autonomy to Beijing. So, should there be any surprise when the Hong Kong they lead is finally treated accordingly?</p> <p>The reality is that Hong Kong\u2019s leaders have sacrificed the city\u2019s political neutrality: that special place Hong Kong held as a part of, yet at the same time apart from, the rest of China. The US measures are just the first international recognition of this process, and although they will also hasten its completion, it is hard not to conclude the process would have occurred in any event.</p> <p>The only hope for Hong Kong is that, with the advent of more enlightened leadership in Hong Kong or Beijing in the future, it might at some point be undone.</p> <p>\u2022 Antony Dapiran is the author of City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong</p> <p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>",

  "<p>Britons have been drinking earlier in the day than people from most other nations during the coronavirus pandemic, a survey has revealed.</p> \n<p>Nearly 47% of Britons who drink reported doing so earlier in the day than in February, compared with 23.3% in Greece at the other end of the spectrum, an interim report for the <a href=\"https://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/\">Global Drug Survey (GDS) shows</a>.</p> \n<p>More than 50% of British drinkers who responded reported an increase in the number of days consuming alcohol each week during the Covid-19 crisis, with a third reporting an increase in binge drinking. The main reasons given for increased drinking were boredom and having more time to drink.</p> \n<p>Poorer physical health was cited by more than 40% as a consequence of increased drinking, with decreased mental health, work performance and pleasure from drinking also commonly reported.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Similarly, of those who have drunk less during the period, more than 60% reported improvements in physical health and more than 40% improvement in finances.</p> \n<p>Prof Adam Winstock, a consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist and founder and director of the survey, said: \u201cThe survey shows that what you do matters. In a short period, people are feeling worse off mentally and physically through drinking.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we see the real significant benefits of drinking less. This is not about being sober and not getting tipsy. Just drop a day or two to see a difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>The GDS special edition on Covid-19 was developed as part of a global effort to understand the impact of the pandemic on people\u2019s lives, with a specific focus on the use of alcohol and other drugs, mental health and relationships.</p> \n<p>The majority of participants tend to be young, experienced with the use of illicit drugs, and employed or in education. There have been about 55,000 participants globally to date. The interim report is based on data from 12 countries.</p> \n<p>Globally, around 35% of participants who take benzodiazepines, also known as benzos and usually prescribed to treat anxiety and insomnia, reported an increase in use.</p> \n<p>The report said this can be viewed as a coping strategy and their use may compensate for access to other drugs.</p> \n<p>But it added that their \u201cefficacy as a long-term strategy for managing anxiety is poor, misuse and dependence are a real concern, withdrawal being protracted and, in some cases where higher doses are stopped suddenly, life-threatening\u201d.</p> \n<p>Winstock added that benzos were \u201cdiabolical\u201d in the long term, with some people taking up to two years to wean themselves off the medication. They are typically only prescribed for a maximum of two weeks.</p> \n<p>Niamh Eastwood, the executive director of the thinktank Release, said: \u201cRelease has set up a national monitoring network, made up of drug user activists, recovery folks, peers and harm reduction workers and the reports very much reflect the findings of the Global Drugs Survey.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn particular, the use of street benzos has increased significantly amongst people who are drug dependent. This is because these drugs are cheap to purchase and as people have lost income from begging and other similar activities they have moved to these substances, which are widely available.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are also reports of young people increasingly using drugs like Xanax, often ordered online. Neither of these developments are surprising considering that lots of people are reporting increased anxiety due to Covid-19 and the lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is why we need to support the safe supply of these substances, by prescribing benzodiazepines to people who are dependent thereby reducing their reliance on the illegal market and engaging them with drug services.\u201d</p> \n<p>Across all countries surveyed, 40% of cannabis users reported an increase in consumption, due to having more free time and being bored.</p> \n<p>For MDMA and cocaine, about 40% reported using less during the pandemic with the main reasons being fewer opportunities to use and less contact with people whom they use with.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>An additional question revealed the UK\u2019s participants were the second least satisfied with the leadership of their country\u2019s government during the pandemic, with only Brazil\u2019s participants less satisfied.</p> \n<p>The survey included a number of opt-in questions about tensions in relationships before and after Covid-19, and about behaviours ranging from physical abuse to being stopped from seeing or talking to family or friends, having access to money or checking contacts on social media.</p> \n<p>There was an increase in those reporting some or a lot of tension in their intimate relationships, from 42% to 49%, during the period, although most \u2013 74% \u2013 reported no change in the tension in their relationship.</p> \n<p>The survey is still open and <a href=\"https://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/\">can be completed here</a>.</p>",

Secure industrial jobs have evaporated in Europe and North America and reappeared on the other side of the world. Exports, which amounted to less than 10% of global GDP in the 1970s, now stand at 25%.</p> <p>Globalisation has been a massive social and economic transformation. It has, by the same token, been hotly contentious, creating losers as well as winners. And this raised the question: would it be brought to an end by eruption of opposition? Again and again \u2013&nbsp;after the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-globalization-why-seattles-1999-protesters-were-right/282831/\">1999 Seattle WTO protests</a>, September 11, the financial crisis of 2008 and the election of Donald Trump \u2013 there have been predictions of globalisation\u2019s terminal crisis.&nbsp;In the background lurks the memory of the 1930s and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/04/2010s-like-1930s-look-facts-unemployment-healthcare\">Great Depression</a>, when trade and capital flows contracted, not to recover for the best part of half a century.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 shock has raised globalisation angst to a new pitch. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres20_e/pr855_e.htm\">predicting</a> that trade may fall by a record 32%. The lockdowns were disruptive enough. But as the economic crisis deepens, 2020 is beginning to look like something worse: a perfect disruptive storm.</p> <p>To see why, consider the range of factors that shape the international division of labour.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Start with politics.</p> <p>The pursuit of profit extends across national borders and lines of political conflict. But if you are going to set aside politics and diplomacy, you need to agree to differ. It helps if you have an arbiter, a global hegemon. It is no coincidence that the surge in global trade and investment coincided with what seemed like decisive American victory in the cold war.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to politics, the flow of goods is driven by technology. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century centred on cotton. A quarter of a millennium later the garment supply chain still spans the world, from the cotton farms of Australia to sweatshops in Bangladesh and big box malls in American suburbs, now empty of customers. Twenty-first century smartphones are produced by a hyper-sophisticated network linking labs and software coders in the west with chip foundries in South Korea and Vietnam and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/foxconn-life-death-forbidden-city-longhua-suicide-apple-iphone-brian-merchant-one-device-extract\">assembly lines</a> in China and Vietnam. The greatest single driver of globalisation in recent years has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/maersk-shipping-revolution-sustainability\">containeri</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/maersk-shipping-revolution-sustainability\">sation</a>, which slashed the cost of shipping.</p> <p>Apart from politics and technology, who makes what, and where, is decided by the terms of trade, which depend on the balance of costs and prices and the matrix of exchange rates. Sudden movements in currencies shift costs, disrupting existing patterns of demand and supply.</p> <p>Finally, whether we have the appetite to buy goods \u2013 made at home or abroad \u2013 depends on the overall state of the economy, on what economists call \u201caggregate demand\u201d, the sum of consumption, investment and government spending.</p> <p>Add together technology, price effects, macroeconomics and geopolitics and it becomes clear why, in 2020, we face a perfect storm.</p> <p>On the technological front, containerisation and the revolution in outsourcing have run their course. The car industry, which operates the most complex supply chains, is undergoing a technological revolution. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/25/2020-set-to-be-year-of-the-electric-car-say-industry-analysts\">advent of electric cars</a> (or what the industry calls \u201ce-mobility\u201d) will simplify and shrink production, cutting millions of jobs. Consultants like McKinsey\u2019s reckon that it will only be a matter of time before the armies of female <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/garment-workers-face-destitution-as-covid-19-closes-factories\">factory workers</a> currently employed in cutting and sewing clothes will be replaced by robots.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Covid-19 recession has slashed consumption and investment. The US is by far the largest importer, and its demand has been hammered. The current strength of the dollar will go some way towards offsetting the fall in American consumption. A more valuable dollar makes it more attractive to export to the US. But it may also trigger new trade wars.</p> <p>Particularly aggravating to the White House will be the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-forex/brazils-real-falls-to-a-record-low-of-5-3750-per-dollar-idUSS0N2BG02B\">fall in the Brazilian currency</a>, the real. Trump may regard the Brazilian president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/brazils-left-and-right-unite-to-back-pro-democracy-manifesto-bolsonaro\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> as a kindred spirit, but he will not like the huge surge in Brazilian exports as China\u2019s pig farmers opt for the cheapest source of animal feed.</p> <p>The promise of increased agricultural exports from the US to China was key to the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/13/china-confirms-phase-one-trade-deal-us-tariffs\">phase one trade deal</a>, solemnised in January. At least for a few weeks early this year Trump stuck to the phase one script. But that restraint has not lasted. Since April there has been a truly spectacular escalation in rhetoric between Washington and Beijing.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s nationalist bluster plays to his gallery. China makes a good stick with which to beat Joe Biden, who is reputed to favour a more cooperative line. Altogether more serious is the systematic reorientation in US strategy towards China that had already begun under Barack Obama, with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/obama-foreign-policy-pivots-asia\">pivot to Asia</a>\u201d in 2011, and culminated in May 2020 with the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/U.S.-Strategic-Approach-to-The-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Report-5.20.20.pdf\">release</a> by the Trump administration of a comprehensive new strategy document.</p> <p>The document ends any further discussion in Washington of the possible convergence of China with the western model. Instead, all branches of American government are sworn in on a posture of great power competition. Nor is this merely rhetoric. It goes hand in hand with a further round of sanctions against China\u2019s telecoms champion, Huawei. By refusing to allow <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-help-taiwan-firm-build-chip-plant-iarizona/\">chips for Huawei</a>, even chips of Huawei\u2019s own design, to be manufactured on ultra hi-tech equipment that Taiwanese chip foundries source from the US, the Trump administration has effectively declared a technological war.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK has announced its decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/22/boris-johnson-forced-to-reduce-huaweis-role-in-uks-5g-networks\">exclude Huawei</a> from its 5G network within three years. Australia and China are embroiled in a mini-trade war over barley and beef. Huawei executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition\">Meng Wanzhou</a> awaits her fate under house arrest in Canada. If she is extradited to the US, expect a storm to break loose.</p> <p>Of course, there are countervailing forces. Business, including American business, remains deeply committed to foreign investment and trade. Europe is reluctant to choose between the US and China. Angela Merkel has announced that she will make <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-china/news/china-one-of-germanys-eu-presidency-priorities/\">relations with China</a> one of the priorities of Germany\u2019s presidency of the European council.</p> <p>But, deal-making apart, the broader vision of the flat world of globalisation is dead. The institution that most clearly embodied that \u201cend of history\u201d vision, the WTO, was launched in January 1995. Today, the WTO is in tatters. Its dispute-processing procedures have been paralysed by deliberate American obstruction and its head, Brazilian Roberto Azev\u00eado, has announced that he is resigning a year ahead of time, which leaves the WTO leaderless in the face of the greatest shock to world trade since 1945.</p> <p>Comparisons with the 1930s should not be taken too far. We don\u2019t live under the shadow of total war, and there are good reasons to welcome the end of 1990s-style hyper-globalisation. But we should not underestimate the break with the recent past or kid ourselves that there is any obvious alternative on offer.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a>&nbsp;today include:</p> <h2>Global infections pass 6.2 million</h2> <p>Infections from coronavirus worldwide now stand at 6,266,193 with 375,554 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</p> <h2>South Korea to trial QR codes in tracing</h2> <p>South Korea will begin trying out QR codes as part of its track-and-trace efforts<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to contain the virus. From 10 June, visitors to nightclubs, bars, karaoke clubs, daytime discos, indoor gyms that hold group exercises and indoor standing concert halls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/global-report-south-korea-trials-qr-codes-for-covid-19-tracing\">will be required to use an app</a>&nbsp;that generates a one-time personalised QR code that can be scanned at the door. It follows difficulties tracing potential infections from last month\u2019s Seoul nightclubs cluster of 270 cases, after people gave false or incomplete information.</p> <h2>People in Pakistan told to \u2018live with the virus\u2019</h2> <p>Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan,&nbsp;has defended his decision to lift almost all lockdown measures because of economic losses, despite rising numbers of cases. In a televised address, Khan said his government could not afford to continue giving cash handouts to the poor on such a large scale. He urged people to act responsibly but said more infections and deaths were inevitable. \u201cThis virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths,\u201d Khan warned. \u201cIf people do take care they can live with the virus.\u201d</p> <h2>New Zealand brings forward decision on easing restrictions</h2> <p>The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/ardern-says-new-zealand-on-track-to-eliminate-coronavirus-ahead-of-schedule\">restrictions may be eased again sooner than planned </a>as the country was \u201cahead of schedule\u201d in tackling Covid-19. Cabinet will decide next Monday whether to move to level-1 restrictions \u2013 the most lenient \u2013 two weeks ahead of when the government had planned to make that decision.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\">New Zealand</a>&nbsp;has had no Covid-19 cases for 11 consecutive days. Level-1 is thought to only involve border restrictions.</p> <h2>WHO warns of over use of antibiotics in crisis</h2> <p>The World Health Organization has warned that the increased use of antibiotics&nbsp;to combat the pandemic will strengthen bacterial resistance and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/who-warns-overuse-of-antibiotics-for-covid-19-will-cause-more-deaths\">ultimately lead to more deaths</a>&nbsp;during the crisis and beyond. WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Monday a \u201cworrying number\u201d of bacterial infections were becoming increasingly resistant to the medicines traditionally used to treat them.</p> <h2>Covid-19 infections in UK could double without two-metre rule</h2> <p>The risk of Covid-19 infection could double&nbsp;if the two-metre rule is reduced in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/risk-of-infection-could-double-if-2-metre-rule-reduced-study-finds\">a study part-funded by the WHO and published in the Lancet has found</a>. Last week, Boris Johnson said he hoped to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnsons-liaison-committee-appearance-what-did-we-learn\">be able to reduce that [2-metre] distance</a>\u201d, to make it easier to travel on public transport and boost the hospitality industry.</p> <h2>Central and south America are \u2018intense zones for transmission\u2019</h2> <p>The WHO sounded the warning as it said the epidemic in the regions had not reached its peak. On Monday deaths in Mexico passed 10,000, while Brazil registered 11,598 additional cases of coronavirus&nbsp;and 623 new deaths. It takes the country\u2019s confirmed cases to 526,447 and deaths to 29,937.</p> <h2>China reports five new Covid-19 cases</h2> <p>The National Health commission reported five new imported cases and no deaths on Tuesday.&nbsp;As of Monday there were 73 active cases in the country, according to the commission.</p>",
  "<p>In April, almost 40 million children missed their polio drops in Pakistan after the cancellation of the nationwide vaccination campaign.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alongside Afghanistan, Pakistan is one of only two countries in the world where polio is still endemic. It was very close to&nbsp;becoming&nbsp; polio free, with only 12 cases in 2018, but last year the number of cases rose to 147. In the same year, Pakistan was &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/07/pakistan-accused-of-cover-up-over-fresh-polio-outbreak\">accused</a>&nbsp;of covering up&nbsp;the&nbsp;resurgence of the&nbsp;P2 strain of the virus, which was thought to have been eradicated in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last year had been a challenge as polio bounced back,&nbsp;Dr Rana Muhammad Safdar, national&nbsp; coordinator for&nbsp;polio eradication, told the Guardian.&nbsp;\u201cWe&nbsp;will&nbsp;plan a nationwide campaign as soon as we get an opportunity. But we are equally worried about routine immunisation campaigns as&nbsp;those&nbsp;are being missed due to Covid-19. I fear for the outbreak of vaccine drive diseases, such as measles.\u201d</p> <p>So far this year 47 cases have been reported. The Guardian talked to six Pakistani polio officials and scientific experts, who are not officially allowed to talk to the media. They fear that Pakistan is back to&nbsp;2014 levels, the&nbsp;worst&nbsp;year&nbsp;in recent records.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) recommended on 24 March that all vaccination programmes be paused until the second half of the year.&nbsp;\u201cWe did not want to have the programme be responsible for worsening the situation with Covid-19,\u201d&nbsp;said Michel Zaffran, director of the World Health Organization-led group.</p> <p>Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq,&nbsp; who received an award for her work against polio, told the Guardian&nbsp;the pause was dangerous.&nbsp;\u201cIf one programme was not effective, we would call it a disaster, but missing an entire national campaign would have unimaginable consequences.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Officials say&nbsp;the disease has spread beyond the&nbsp;three core areas&nbsp;of&nbsp;Karachi, Quetta&nbsp;and&nbsp;Peshawar,&nbsp;and is now present in&nbsp;central Pakistan.&nbsp;The&nbsp; virus spreads easily in summer&nbsp;and this year could see more than 200 cases.</p> <p>\u201cNothing can be worse than this situation. We have positive samples everywhere. It is strengthening and spreading,\u201d a scientific expert in the programme told the Guardian.</p> <p>Pakistan has&nbsp;received&nbsp;international funding for polio eradication&nbsp;since 1994, but Safdar said it was not possible to know the exact amount, as the aid&nbsp;has&nbsp;come from various groups.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe have a failure tag attached with us,\u201d an official who has worked with&nbsp;the&nbsp;polio programme&nbsp;for&nbsp; more than 15 years&nbsp; said. \u201cWe are the most funded polio programme&nbsp;[in the world]. India eradicated polio with lesser funding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile the increase in cases in 2019 was disappointing, we are confident Pakistan can stop polio,\u201d&nbsp;a spokesperson for&nbsp; the Gates Foundation told the Guardian.&nbsp;The foundation&nbsp;has contributed $3.7bn (\u00a33bn) to the global eradication initiative since 2007. The funding is disbursed to countries like Pakistan through the World Health Organization and Unicef.</p> <p>Donors may not say it openly, but \u201cdefinitely, they are worried and frustrated\u201d, Farooq said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df88065f9029c4f4788aa2aa5312a5c8514013be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df88065f9029c4f4788aa2aa5312a5c8514013be/0_0_4030_2686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump arrives in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington DC, US, 29 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump has announced that the US will be ending cooperation with the World Health Organization.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Gripas/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> President Trump\u2019s freeze on US funding for the WHO,&nbsp;along with the focus on Covid-19,&nbsp; has also made &nbsp;it hard&nbsp;to&nbsp;fund&nbsp;the&nbsp;polio programme.</p> <p>The US&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of the founding members&nbsp;of the GPEI, and&nbsp;also provides&nbsp;assistance and funds for&nbsp;the&nbsp;polio programme. \u201cCDC-supported programmes and activities&nbsp;will&nbsp;be put at risk the longer&nbsp;a&nbsp;funding halt continues,\u201d Benjamin Haynes, deputy branch chief&nbsp;of the&nbsp;CDC, told the Guardian.</p> <p>There is also a fear among Pakistani officials that the virus could spread to other parts of the world.</p> <p>\u201cIt would not take it a long time to spread. Everything depends on the gaps and the time the virus gets in Pakistan to spread to other parts of the world,\u201d Safdar said.</p> <p>\u201cSome people don\u2019t take polio seriously because there is no direct death involved in it, but it does have a huge human cost not only for Pakistanis but for the world too,\u201d a scientific expert said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/27/a-rise-in-deaths-from-preventable-diseases-must-not-be-part-of-covid-19s-legacy\">A rise in deaths from preventable diseases must not be part of Covid-19's legacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The International Monitoring Board in its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1517651\">report</a>&nbsp;last year said the polio programme had become \u201ca political football\u201d in Pakistan.

  "<p>European Union and British negotiators will face each other screen-to-screen as the latest round of Brexit talks get under way on Tuesday. During this four-day round, the most time has been allocated to one of the toughest issues: fishing rights.</p> <h2><strong>Why is such a small industry such a big problem?</strong></h2> <p>Fishing is a drop in the ocean of the UK economy (just 0.12% of economic output) but has become one of the most intractable issues of the Brexit talks. The reasons boil down to history, geography and politics. More than 100 categories of fish straddle EU-UK waters. Securing greater British control of these fish was a big promise of the 2016 Brexit campaign, one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1203981568055947264\">repeated by Boris Johnson </a>ahead of his 2019 election victory.</p> <p>But the EU has eight member states with a lot to lose, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/12/so-long-and-thanks-for-the-fish-eu-trawlers-set-new-course-post-brexit\">Belgium</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/18/denmark-to-contest-uk-efforts-to-take-back-control-of-fisheries\">Denmark</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/09/worst-case-scenario-britains-too-german-fears-fishing-industry-brexit\">Germany</a>, who say they can trace their exploits fishing in British waters back hundreds of years. </p> <h2><strong>What does the UK want?</strong></h2> <p>More fish is the short answer. The government believes the deal agreed on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jun/02/guardian190-britain-enters-eec-1973\">British entry</a> into the European Economic Community in 1973 was unfair and needs to be unpicked. That agreement \u2013 later enshrined in the common fisheries policy (CFP) \u2013 is based on historic catches. The result is that EU-based fleets land about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/04/uk-to-take-charge-of-its-fishing-waters-under-post-brexit-plan\">eight times as much fish</a> in UK waters as British fishermen do in EU waters, according to UK government data.&nbsp;</p> <p>The UK wants to agree annual quotas with the EU based on the principle of \u201czonal attachment\u201d, meaning agreeing shares based on the percentage of fish inside each side\u2019s exclusive economic zone (a 200-mile area round the shore). British officials argue that this system would be fairer, more scientific and is already used by the EU in its annual quota-setting talks with Norway.</p> <h2><strong>What does the EU want?</strong></h2> <p>The EU wants the status quo, which allows member states to fish in British waters, with the most lucrative harvests for France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark. The negotiating mandate drawn up by the 27 member states instructs the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier \u2013 a former French fisheries minister -&nbsp;to \u201cavoid economic dislocation\u201d for European fleets, which have traditionally fished in British waters. For the EU this means \u201cquota shares\u201d that could be in place for as long as 25 years. EU officials say an annual negotiation is doable with Norway, where only six categories of fish are at stake.</p> <h2><strong>What does the fishing industry say?</strong></h2> <p>British fishing fleets were some of the most vocal supporters of Brexit. The Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation is urging the government to stick to its guns and ensure \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sff.co.uk/no-brexit-betrayal-warns-sff/\">unfettered control over access</a>\u201d to UK waters, although it doesn\u2019t rule out allowing in EU vessels. The shellfish sector, which is not covered by the CFP, wants to maintain access to EU markets and has warned that no-deal tariffs could cost \u00a341m a year. </p> <h2>Are there enough fish in the sea?</h2> <p>Conservationists worry that Brexit is a big distraction from overfishing. Around 41% of commercial fish stocks in the north-east Atlantic, including the North Sea, are overfished, according to Oceana. The NGO thinks the British government\u2019s fisheries bill does not go as far as the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy in its<em> </em>intentions to prevent overfishing, although it and other conservationists have often criticised the EU for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/18/eu-ministers-opt-to-continue-overfishing-despite-2020-deadline\">failing to meet promises</a> to prevent the overexploitation of the seas.</p> <h2><strong>Who holds the cards?</strong></h2> <p>EU officials think that the UK probably has more leverage over fisheries than any other aspect of the Brexit talks. But the EU also has cards to play: 71% of British seafood exports go to the EU, while European fleets in UK waters often specialise in catching fish that are less popular with British consumers, such as herring. Former senior UK official <a href=\"https://infacts.org/better-deal-uk-fishermen-will-hard-catch/\">Andy Lebrecht</a> has warned that English fishing fleets risk losing access to French and Irish waters if talks sour.</p> <h2><strong>Will there be a deal?</strong></h2> <p>The two sides pledged to exert \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to agree a fishing deal by 1 July to give crews time to adjust to changes from 2021. But hopes of an imminent breakthrough are low, despite hints of progress. Barnier has described both sides positions as \u201cmaximalist\u201d and said fishing was \u201cperhaps the only positive\u201d outcome from the last round of negotiations. While the two sides are set to hold deeper technical discussions from Tuesday, the EU\u2019s fishing member states have made it clear to Barnier that they are in no mood for compromise.&nbsp;</p> <h2>What if there is no deal on fisheries?</h2> <p>If the EU lives up to its oft-repeated threat, no deal on fisheries means no deal on anything.

  "<p>As lockdown loomed in March, I became obsessed with a football anthem for a team 400 miles away. I had read a news story about Edinburgh residents <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-residents-belt-out-sunshine-21712006\" title=\"\">singing</a> a Proclaimers song called Sunshine on Leith from their balconies. I didn\u2019t know the song, and when I looked it up, I found a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHkQYDoVJ0\" title=\"\">glorious video</a> of 26,000 Hibernian fans singing it in a sun-drenched Hampden Park, after a long-hoped-for Scottish Cup win in 2016. Both teams had left the pitch, and the Rangers\u2019 half of the stadium was empty. It looked like a concert in which the fans were simultaneously the performer and the audience.</p> <p>I was entranced. I watched it again, and again. The sight and sound of this collective joy was transcendent: tens of thousands of green-and-white scarves held aloft, everyone belting out the song at the tops of their lungs. When the crowd hits the chorus, the volume levels on the shaky smartphone video blow their limit, exploding into a delirious roar of noise. I thought of something that one of the leaders of the nationwide \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tunelesschoir.com/\" title=\"\">Tuneless Choirs</a>\u201d \u2013 specifically for people who can\u2019t sing \u2013 once said: \u201cIf you get enough people singing together, with enough volume, it always sounds good.\u201d Our individual failings are submerged; we become greater than the sum of our meagre parts. Anthems sung alone sound thin and absurd \u2013 think of the spectacle of a pop star bellowing the Star-Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl. Anthems need the warmth of harmony, or even the chafing of dissonance. They need the full sound of bodies brushing up against each other in pride, joy or righteousness.</p> <p>Sunshine on Leith is ostensibly a love song, but in this instance, it wasn\u2019t being sung to a lover, or to the victorious Hibs players, or to the football club, or to Leith \u2013 the 26,000 singers seemed to be addressing each other. In their many and varied voices, they had transformed it into a love song to the crowd: \u201cWhile I\u2019m worth my room on this Earth, I will be with you / While the chief puts sunshine on Leith, I\u2019ll thank him for his work, and your birth and my birth.\u201d In the YouTube comments, fans of other clubs, from Millwall to Lyon \u2013 and even Hibs\u2019 arch-rivals Hearts \u2013 congratulate the Hibbies; not on the cup victory, not on the performance of the team, but that of the crowd. \u201cEven the riot police horses shedding tears there,\u201d observes one.</p> <p>As the lockdown commenced, I found myself cueing up other songs that reminded me of crowds. In the way a single snatch of melody can instantly remind you of an ex, or an old friend, I wanted songs that reminded me of what it\u2019s like to be with thousands of strangers. I listened to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9BwWKXjVaI\" title=\"\">Drake\u2019s Nice for What</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8HoEvDh70Y\" title=\"\">Koffee\u2019s Toast</a>, which took me back to swaying tipsily in the crush of Notting Hill carnival, of being giddily overwhelmed, as the juddering sub-bass moved in waves through a million ribcages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1f4841c654ad29c6b6ac786970f3feca10dd5e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f4841c654ad29c6b6ac786970f3feca10dd5e4/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Notting Hill carnival in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Notting Hill carnival in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miles Davies/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I missed the disinhibition of dancing in a dark, low-ceilinged club. I missed screaming into the cold winter air of the AFC Wimbledon terraces about an outrageous refereeing decision. I missed the joy of chanting and feeling my own thin voice being made whole by others joining it in unison. I missed the tingling mixture of anxiety and vertigo of the moment you first step out into a festival or football or carnival or protest crowd, a feeling of over-stimulation, the ripples of noise and colour jostling for your attention, the anticipation of being subsumed in the crowd and yet powered up by it \u2013 of losing a part of yourself, and your independence, and being glad to. I missed the strange alchemy of congregation, when your brain pulses with the validation of being with so many people who have chosen the same path. <em>How could I be wrong? Look, all these people are here, too.</em></p> <p>While many of us were missing crowds, the realities of Covid-19 meant they had taken on a completely new meaning. Gathering with others was suddenly, paradoxically antisocial: it suggested you were careless about viral transmission of a deadly disease, more interested in your own short-term social needs than the lives of strangers. The very sight of a crowd suddenly seemed alarming. We shook our heads at rumours of parties, and shared pictures of Cheltenham festival or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stereophonics/status/1238944498006274048\" title=\"\">the Stereophonics\u2019 Cardiff gigs</a> as if they were clips from horror films. Festivals, congregations, assemblies, raves, processions, choirs, rallies, demonstrations, audiences in stadiums, halls, clubs, theatres and cinemas \u2013 gatherings of any kind became fatal. As lockdown begins to ease, people are again gathering to socialise in parks and on beaches, and to rail against injustice in Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/crowds-gather-in-britain-to-support-us-george-floyd-protests\" title=\"\">protests</a>, but crowds as we used to know them won\u2019t be coming back for many months to come.</p> <p>While the pandemic has made exceptional demands of us, even before the Covid-19 lockdown, crowds have been under threat. We were becoming ever more atomised, and pushed further into our homes, and crowds were becoming more domesticated, enclosed, surveilled and expensive to be a part of. Our opportunities to gather freely, in both senses of the word, have greatly diminished since the 90s. And yet, throughout human history, there has always been something pleasingly resilient about the crowd: however many new ways are found to disperse it, it will always find a way to reconvene.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Crowds have always had a bad rap: there is no gentle mob, no friendly pack. The same disinhibition that allows for moments of great joy can also enable grotesque crimes. The people who gathered to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/02/a-lynching-in-georgia-the-living-memorial-to-americas-history-of-racist-violence\" title=\"\">lynchings</a> in the US, or recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks\" title=\"\">attacks on Muslims</a> by groups of Hindu nationalists in India, were not just bystanders but participants. Their presence and acquiescence helped make the violence possible. And just as the people at the back of the crowd empower those at the front, the reverse can be true. The hooligan firm leader who throws the first cafe chair across a moonlit plaza on a balmy European away day makes it easier for more timid members of the crowd to cross their own \u201ccooperation threshold\u201d and join in.</p> <p>Even celebratory or worshipful crowds can go wrong, and when they do, they generate an unmatched horror. Few things strike fear like the the idea of mass panic, few words as chilling as \u201ccaught up in a stampede\u201d or \u201ctrampled to death\u201d. The horror of the 96 dead at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a> in 1989, or the 21 suffocated at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/31/germany-mourns-love-parade-dead\" title=\"\">2010 Berlin Love Parade</a>, or the 2,400 killed in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/2015-hajj-stampede-deadliest-ever-as-foreign-governments-put-toll-at-1849\" title=\"\">crowd collapse at the 2015 Hajj</a>, gnaws at something deep in our psyches. For some people, even a peaceful and orderly crowd can be scary, triggering intense anxiety or PTSD.</p> <p>Informed by tragedies, uprisings and protests alike, for a long time crowds were seen as inherently dangerous and lobotomising. But during the past couple of decades, thanks to work by social psychologists, behavioural scientists and anthropologists, a new understanding of the complexity of crowd behaviour has become increasingly influential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"571ae27664d666c868a877919fdc3db4cd1e66fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/571ae27664d666c868a877919fdc3db4cd1e66fc/0_0_3000_1991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A depiction of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819, when cavalry charged on a crowd at a political rally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A depiction of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819, when cavalry charged on a crowd at a political rally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For most of us, a crowd can be an alluring thing, because the desire to be among the throng seems to be innate. Gathering together for ritualistic celebrations \u2013 dancing, chanting, festivalling, costuming, singing, marching \u2013 goes back almost as far as we have any record of human behaviour. In 2003, 13,000-year-old cave paintings were discovered in Nottinghamshire that seemed to show \u201cconga lines\u201d of dancing women. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/15/highereducation.research\" title=\"\">According to</a> the archeologist Paul Pettitt, the paintings matched others across Europe, indicating that they were part of a continent-wide Paleolithic culture of collective singing and dancing.</p> <p>In Barbara Ehrenreich\u2019s 2007 book Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy, she draws on the work of anthropologists including Robin Dunbar to argue that dancing and music-making was a social glue that helped stone-age families join together in groups larger than the family unit, to hunt and protect themselves from predators. For Ehrenreich, rituals of collective joy are as intrinsic to human development as speech. More recent <a href=\"https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/news/the-power-of-singing-and-dancing-together\" title=\"\">experiments</a> by Dunbar and his colleagues have suggested that the capacity of singing together to bond groups of strangers shows it \u201cmay have played a role in the evolutionary success of modern humans over their early relatives\u201d.</p> <p>The power of crowds has long fixated religious and secular leaders alike, who have sought to harness communal energy for their own glorification, or to tame mass gatherings when they start to take on a momentum of their own. Ehrenreich records the medieval Christian church\u2019s long battle to eradicate unruly, ecstatic or immoderate dancing from the congregation. In later centuries, as the reformation and industrial revolution proceeded, festivals, feast days, sports, revels and ecstatic rituals of countless kinds were outlawed for their tendency to result in drunken, pagan or otherwise ungodly behaviour. Between the 17th and 20th centuries, there were \u201cliterally thousands of acts of legislation introduced which attempted to outlaw carnival and popular festivity from European life,\u201d wrote Peter Stallybrass and Allon White in The Politics and Poetics of Transgression.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the 19th century, as industrialising cities exploded in size, that the formal study of crowd psychology and herd behaviour emerged. Reflecting on the French Revolution a century earlier, thinkers such as Gustave Le Bon helped promote the idea that a crowd is always on the verge of becoming a mob. Stirred up by agitators, crowds could quickly turn to violence, sweeping up even good, upstanding citizens in their collective madness. \u201cBy the mere fact that he forms part of an organised crowd,\u201d Le Bon wrote, \u201ca man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation.\u201d</p> <p>While the discipline of crowd psychology has moved on considerably since the days of Le Bon, these early theories still retain their hold, says Clifford Stott, a professor of social psychology at Keele University. Much of the media coverage of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\" title=\"\">riots</a> that broke out across England in 2011 echoed the explanations of the 19th-century pioneers of crowd psychology: they were a pathological intrusion into civilised society, a contagion, spread by agitators, of the normally stable and contented body politic. Focus fell, in particular, on ill-defined \u201ccriminal gangs\u201d stirring things up, possibly coordinating things via BlackBerry Messenger. The foot soldiers \u2013 30,000 people were thought to have participated \u2013 were depicted as feral thugs. Hordes. Animals. The frontpage <a href=\"https://www.thepaperboy.com/uk/2011/08/09/front-pages-archive.cfm\" title=\"\">headlines</a> were clear: \u201cRule of the mob\u201d, \u201cYob rule\u201d, \u201cFlaming morons\u201d.

And yet everywhere you look, the narrative is still there.\u201d The reason, he argues, is straightforward: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very convenient for dominant and powerful groups,\u201d Stott says. \u201cIt pathologises, decontextualises and renders meaningless crowd violence, and therefore legitimises its repression.\u201d As Stott notes, by shifting the blame to the madness of crowds, it also conveniently allows the powerful to avoid scrutinising their own responsibility for the violence. Last week, when the US attorney general <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-minneapolis-police-protests-barr/us-attorney-general-says-outside-agitators-taking-over-anti-police-protests-idUKKBN2360PQ\" title=\"\">blamed</a> \u201coutside agitators\u201d for stirring up violence, and Donald Trump referred to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1266724553620930561\" title=\"\">professionally managed</a>\u201d \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1266231100780744704\" title=\"\">thugs</a>\u201d, they were drawing on exactly the ideas that Le Bon sketched out in the 19th century.</p> <p>In recent decades, detailed analytical research has produced ever-more sophisticated insights into crowd behaviour, many of which disprove these long-standing assumptions. \u201cCrowds have an amazing ability to police themselves, self-regulate, and actually display a lot of pro-social behaviour, supporting others in their group,\u201d says Anne Templeton, an academic at Edinburgh University who studies crowd psychology. She points to the 2017 Manchester Arena terrorist attack, in which CCTV footage showed members of the public performing first aid on the wounded before emergency services arrived, and Mancunians rushed to provide food, shelter, transport and emotional support for the victims. \u201cPeople provide an amazing amount of help in emergencies to people they don\u2019t know, especially when they\u2019re part of an in-group.\u201d</p> <p>Strange things happen to our brains when we\u2019re in a crowd we\u2019ve chosen to be part of, says Templeton. We don\u2019t just feel happier and more confident, we also have a lower threshold of disgust. This is why festivalgoers will happily share drinks (and by dint of their proximity, sweat) with strangers, or Hajj pilgrims will share the sometimes bloody razors used to shave their heads. In a crowd, we feel safer from harm.</p> <p>If we now have a better grasp of the complexity of crowd dynamics, the core truth about them is relatively simple: they have the potential to magnify both the good and bad in us. The loss of self in a crowd can lead to unthinkable violence, just as it can ecstatic transcendence. What is striking is that, in recent decades, the latter has troubled the British establishment every bit as much as the former.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u2018The open crowd is the true crowd,\u201d wrote Elias Canetti in his 1960 book Crowds and Power \u2013 \u201cthe crowd abandoning itself freely to its natural urge for growth\u201d, rather than those hemmed in by authorities, limited in shape and size. The Sermon on the Mount, he writes, was delivered to an open crowd. The obsequious flock, the brainwashed cult, the army marching in lock-step, is a world away from a fluid, democratic, sometimes anarchic congregation of the people. These open crowds have become harder to find, and harder to keep open.</p> <p>Contemporary Britain\u2019s idea of the crowd was formed by two explosions in unruly mass culture at the end of the last century. First, by 70s and 80s football fandom and its manifold sins, and the avoidable tragedy of Hillsborough \u2013 a tragedy created by the authorities\u2019 views of the crowd as animalistic thugs, a fear and loathing that permeated the media, police, political class and football authorities. And second, by the acid house explosion and rave scene of the late 80s and early 90s, a subcultural surge of illegal or at least illicit \u201cfree parties\u201d in fields and warehouses across the country. Both cultures flourished in spite of widespread media demonisation, both fought the law \u2013 and in both cases, the law won. Things have never been the same since for people who wish to assemble on their own terms.</p> <p>The policing, containment and enclosure of \u201cfree\u201d raves is particularly instructive, suggesting that the authorities fear a happy crowd as much as a pitchfork-carrying one. For the novelist Hari Kunzru, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/17/opinion/17iht-edkunzru.1.7534262.html\" title=\"\">reflecting on</a> his 90s youth a few years ago, approaching the site of a rave, feeling \u201cthe bass pulsing up ahead, the excitement was almost unbearable. A mass of dancers lifting up like a single body \u2026 [an] ecstatic fantasy of community, a zone where we were networked with each other, rather than with the office switchboard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30de306e340beeea56cedb538464374cb7202dea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30de306e340beeea56cedb538464374cb7202dea/0_0_2944_1976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An acid house rave in Berkshire, UK in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An acid house party in Berkshire in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The culmination of the rave era, and the beginning of its end, was the epochal 1992 Castlemorton Common festival, a week-long, outdoor free party in Worcestershire, with numbers in excess of 20,000. Writing about it in the Evening Standard, Anthony Burgess summed up the establishment mood, railing against \u201cthe megacrowd, reducing the individual intelligence to that of an amoeba\u201d. One man\u2019s escapist fantasy of community is another\u2019s vision of civilisational collapse, and the Thatcher-into-Major-era junta of the tabloid press, police, landowners and the Conservative party made it their business to disperse rave\u2019s congregation of squatters, dropouts, drug-takers, hippies, hunt saboteurs, anti-road protesters and travellers.</p> <p>In 1994, parliament passed the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/part/V/crossheading/powers-in-relation-to-raves\" title=\"\">outlawed</a> any open air, night-time public congregation around amplified music. \u201cFor this purpose,\u201d the act specified, \u201c\u2018music\u2019 includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.\u201d Any ambiguity about the target of the legislation was wiped away during the House of Lords debate on the bill. The Conservative deputy leader of the House, the hereditary peer Earl Ferrers, <a href=\"https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1994/may/24/criminal-justice-and-public-order-bill\" title=\"\">suggested</a> an amendment \u201cwhich would catch a rave party but would not also catch a Pavarotti concert, a barbecue or people having a dance in the early hours of the evening\u201d. I do hope, replied another, that they would not risk jailing Pavarotti under the new legislation.</p> <p>For the ravers, what had begun as a transcendent celebration turned into a question of the right to assemble in the first place. Before the bill passed into law, three elegiac \u201cKill the Bill\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/vd8gbj/anti-rave-act-protests-20th-anniversary-204\" title=\"\">protest-parties</a> took place in 1994, drawing tens of thousands, and culminating in October when bare-chested, dreadlocked protesters shook the gates of Downing Street to a soundtrack of whistles, cheers and repetitive beats. In archival <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpJj4AjtOjw\" title=\"\">video</a> from that day, a protester clambers to the top of the gates and sits there nonchalantly smoking a fag, while police in short-sleeved shirts look on in horror. It is a telling time capsule, because it is hard to imagine any crowd of protesters getting this close to No 10 ever again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"94e2940fe8bb4dcc756cfb8c31df5d48ba26b7fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e2940fe8bb4dcc756cfb8c31df5d48ba26b7fa/0_0_5419_3568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police stand guard over the decks after busting an illegal warehouse party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police bust a warehouse party circa 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PYMCA/Universal Images Group/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Criminal Justice Act killed the free party scene, and like Hillsborough, its legacy is still felt to this day. In fact, it was only the beginning of a series of restrictions on free assembly. The past 25 years have been a challenging time for crowds, thanks to the rise of surveillance technology and privatisation of public space. During the 1990s, 78% of the Home Office crime prevention budget <a href=\"https://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/criminology/msc/unit8/page_09.htm\" title=\"\">was spent</a> on implementing CCTV \u2013 and a further \u00a3500m of public money was spent on it between 2000 and 2006. London became the most surveilled city in the world for a time, and even today <a href=\"https://www.securitymagazine.com/gdpr-policy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.securitymagazine.com%2Farticles%2F90759-what-are-the-worlds-most-heavily-surveilled-cities\" title=\"\">no city outside China</a> has more CCTV per head.</p> <p>The explosion of CCTV is just one way the 21st-century city hampers the freedom of the crowd. Urban regeneration programmes are designed to channel us efficiently towards work and the shops \u2013 spaces built for Homo economicus, human beings interacting transactionally, rather as social citizens. What look like potential meeting grounds for crowds in the modern British city are often mirages: regeneration zones such as Spinningfields in Manchester, Liverpool One and More London have replaced genuine public spaces with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/revealed-pseudo-public-space-pops-london-investigation-map\" title=\"\">privately owned public spaces</a>. These are patrolled by security guards and underwritten by private rules and regulations, whereby the owners are perfectly entitled to ban gatherings and political protests, and move along whoever they like, whenever they like.</p> <p>In 2011, when Occupy London attempted to set up camp in Paternoster Square, outside the London Stock Exchange, they were blocked by police barricades, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/26/private-spaces-protest-occupy-london\" title=\"\">enforcing</a> an emergency high court injunction that established that the land was indeed private property. This was odd, the Observer\u2019s architecture critic Rowan Moore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/13/london-river-park-floating-public-space\" title=\"\">wrote</a> at the time, \u201cas almost every architectural statement, planning application, and press release, in the protracted redevelopment of Paternoster Square, described this \u2018private land\u2019 as \u2018public space\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If the average British city has undergone huge transformations since the Criminal Justice Act, then so have the people in it. Crowd behaviour in the 21st century has been conditioned by the new devices at our fingertips as much as the changing ground beneath our feet, or the laws that govern their movement. In his prescient 2002 book Smart Mobs, the critic Harold Rheingold identified new types of crowds that were able to act in concert even before they had met. He predicted a \u201csocial tsunami\u201d to come from the next wave of mobile telecoms, pointing to the mass SMS chains in Manila that were used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/20/johnaglionby1\" title=\"\">coordinate the protests</a> that overthrew the Philippine president Joseph Estrada in 2001.</p> <p>While alienation and isolation are certainly hallmarks of modern life, when a crowd is needed, it springs into life. The 2009 Iran green revolution, the 2011 Arab Spring, the Occupy movement, the Spanish indignados and the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/16/gezi-park-hotbed-turks-make-stand\" title=\"\">Gezi Park protests</a> in Turkey \u2013 all of these \u201cmovements of the squares\u201d saw physical public space unexpectedly replenished with fresh, angry crowds that had established many of their initial networks and political education via the internet. \u201cOnline inspiration, offline perspiration\u201d, as one slogan of the time put it.</p> <p>These digitally enhanced tactics took over British streets in the winter of 2010, when student and anti-cuts protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/blog/2010/dec/09/student-protests-live-coverage\" title=\"\">came out</a> against the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition\u2019s austerity policies and tripling of tuition fees. The police responded with the controversial crowd-control tactic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/26/metropolitan-police-lawsuit-student-protest\" title=\"\">kettling</a> \u2013 essentially imprisoning people outdoors between lines of riot police, without access to food, water, toilets, warm clothing or medical assistance, for hours at a time.</p> <p>Kettling worked against the student protesters on several fronts, dampening their spirits, disincentivising future protests, riling up some to violence and thus delivering the government the PR victory they needed. \u201cIs not the point of a kettle that it brings things to the boil?\u201d David Lammy MP asked Theresa May, then the home secretary, at the time. But it also radicalised many of them, precisely because they had had their freedom to move restricted, pushing them to direct action tactics in defiance of the tactics proposed by the leaders of the National Union of Students.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73735aa19e7f13cec2f36426dfa3e1c5b1f75b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73735aa19e7f13cec2f36426dfa3e1c5b1f75b06/43_0_2914_1749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mounted police drive their horses into protesters during student demonstrations in London in December 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mounted police drive their horses into protesters during student demonstrations in London in December 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Academic Hannah Awcock attended the 2010 protests as a student, and now lectures on the history of protest at the University of Edinburgh. She explained that <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/754776\" title=\"\">throughout history</a>, from the 1866 Hyde Park suffrage riots to the student demos, protest crowds have often pushed to go further than their organisers, or the authorities, will allow for. And yet, as febrile as the atmosphere around Brexit and austerity has been in the nine years since the student protests and London riots, large protests have appeared calmer, on the face of it at least. In the UK, \u201cthat really aggressive and confrontational policing that emerged post-9/11 seems to have diminished now,\u201d Awcock said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the protests themselves are less radical, but it\u2019s also because there\u2019s also been a turn towards more subtle methods of policing crowds, techniques like increased surveillance and intelligence gathering.\u201d</p> <p>The changes to crowd policing in the past decade owe a great deal to behind-the-scenes policy work by crowd psychologists. Clifford Stott has worked with police and football authorities for many years to discourage heavy-handed policing. One turning point, he told me, was the 2011 Liberal Democrat conference in Sheffield, where South Yorkshire police trialled Stott\u2019s recommendations. Unlike Brighton, Liverpool, Birmingham or Manchester, the city was not used to hosting conferences for a party of government, and substantial student and anti-austerity protests were expected. In preparation, police established a new \u201cdialogue unit\u201d of Police Liaison Teams (PLTs) in blue tabards, recruiting individuals to move among the crowd talking to them, rather than policing in numbers from the outside.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we found was that these dialogue units were policing the police,\u201d said Stott. \u201cThey were stopping unnecessary interventions. The PLTs were reassuring the commanders that an intervention wasn\u2019t needed.\u201d Instead of riot cops wading in, de-escalation and crowd self-regulation took over. Since then, Stott said, this approach has become more common. \u201cWhere the police have these capacities for dialogue and communication, there\u2019s less disorder. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p> <p>According to Ch Insp Melita Worswick of Greater Manchester police, this is part of a broader shift in crowd policing in the UK \u2013 away from the notion of enforcing \u201cpublic order\u201d towards an emphasis on public safety. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have the right people communicating with crowds,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is about building on policing with consent, and knowing that if we don\u2019t manage that right, it could result in disorder.\u201d It\u2019s also about learning to step back, rather than aggressively intervening at the first opportunity. \u201cSometimes taking no action is the right way,\u201d says Worswick. It\u2019s an approach that police in Glasgow have put into action for recent matches between Rangers and Celtic. Following advice from academics, they will now allow fans to jeer at each other for a while, because they know that\u2019s part of the ritual, and won\u2019t intervene unless it starts to get violent. Up to a point, at least, they trust the crowd members to self-regulate.</p> <p>While this sounds like progress, the reality does not always match the rhetoric. Even Extinction Rebellion, which initially attempted to cultivate a friendly relationship with the police, and sought mass arrest as a tactic \u2013 later <a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/2019/11/20/come-hell-or-high-water-extinction-rebellion-welcomes-netpol-report-into-the-mets-policing-of-its-october-protests/\" title=\"\">decried</a> the Met\u2019s \u201cover-reach characterised by systematic discrimination, routine use of force, intimidation and physical harm\u201d in hundreds of cases last year. Even more recently, the Met\u2019s use of Covid-19 social-distancing legislation to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52868465\" title=\"\">make arrests</a> at Sunday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest in London suggests that many elements in the police remain unwilling to step back from the crowd.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In place of the open crowd, nowadays we have come to understand a congregation of people primarily as a money-making opportunity. There is no greater evidence of the attenuated, monetised nature of the 21st-century crowd than the rise of the events industry. Events, in themselves, are of course not new inventions. But there are events, dear boy, and then there are Events: usually sponsored, probably with an admission fee, probably with a range of media partners, good for city-branding, good for tourism, orderly, pre-agreed, surveilled and dispersed at the agreed time. They have become an integral part of the contemporary city, and the reimagining of its citizens as income-generating instruments.</p> <p>London &amp; Partners, the public-private partnership set up by Boris Johnson in 2011 to promote the capital, <a href=\"https://files.londonandpartners.com/l-and-p/assets/events/event_tourism_report_2016.pdf\" title=\"\">estimates</a> that event leisure tourism contributed \u00a32.8bn to the city\u2019s economy in 2015 alone, \u00a3644m of which was from overseas \u201cevents tourists\u201d. Increasingly, people come not for the UK per se, but the things happening in it. Chief among these are sporting events, which generate more than 70% of major events-related spending in London (music is some way behind). Amid huge fanfare in the past few years, a growing number of major international NBA, NFL and MLB games have come to London. According to London &amp; Partners, 250,000 people <a href=\"https://www.londonandpartners.com/events/case-studies/major-events-case-study-nfl\" title=\"\">have attended</a> \u201cNFL on Regent Street\u201d, which isn\u2019t even an American Football game, just a promotional event for the idea of one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57af23c16f3bb85fdb443609fdc527bbe461f54f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57af23c16f3bb85fdb443609fdc527bbe461f54f/0_0_1776_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The plaza in front of City Hall in London, a privately owned and carefully controlled public space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The plaza in front of City Hall in London, a privately owned and carefully controlled public space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Watt/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where there are crowds, there are consumers, and in the absence of state support, commercial sponsorship (itself rebranded as \u201cpartnership\u201d) tracks the events industry\u2019s every move. Last year, the capital played host to the Virgin Money London Marathon, the Prudential RideLondon, the Guinness Six Nations and the EFG London Jazz Festival. Meanwhile, Pride in London somehow managed to rack up 73 \u201cpartners\u201d in 2019, from headline sponsors <a href=\"https://prideinlondon.org/news-and-views/pride-in-london-announces-tesco-as-new-headline-partner/\" title=\"\">Tesco</a> to PlayStation, the Scouts, the London Stock Exchange, Revlon and Foxtons, amid criticisms that the politics has been drained out of it in favour of corporate \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/06/pride-in-london-organisers-fend-off-pinkwashing-claims\" title=\"\">pinkwashing</a>\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to refute the argument that the more carefully planned and managed a large event is, the safer it is for those inside it, and the more the crowd will enjoy it. Not only do you minimise the risk of injury or potential trouble, but everyone \u2013 not least the most vulnerable \u2013 benefits when you have accessibility for people with mobility issues, the right number of toilets, the right number of exits, the right transport access, good sightlines, food and water and childcare facilities. And a reasonable argument is often made by organisers of cultural festivals that sponsors pay for these things, and pay for events such as Notting Hill Carnival, Pride and Mela to stay free, and accessible to all. But it\u2019s hard not to wonder if something is being lost along the way, in an era when venture capital-backed music video platform Boiler Room <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/599qdz/why-there-was-anti-boiler-room-graffiti-at-carnival\" title=\"\">receives</a> Arts Council funding to broker Notting Hill Carnival sponsorship deals and live-stream its intimate hedonism to the world; or popular, long-standing free community festivals such as south London\u2019s Lambeth Country Show suddenly have a heavy security presence, prompting outrage and <a href=\"http://www.brixtonbuzz.com/2018/07/locals-pledge-to-boycott-the-lambeth-country-show-2018-in-response-to-the-great-brockwell-wall-booze-ban-body-and-bag-searches/\" title=\"\">boycotts</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">'The way we get through this is together': mutual aid under coronavirus | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps this is too pessimistic. The 21st-century domestication of the crowd does not in itself snuff out its power. The experience of being part of a crowd can still change us in all manner of unexpected ways. If one thing should be retained from academics\u2019 debunking of the myth of the crowd as a single beast with one brain and a thousand limbs, it is precisely that the diversity of the individuals within the crowd is what makes it so vital.</p> <p>Far from behaving as one, everyone has different cooperation thresholds for participation, and there are some who by their nature will always be the first in the pool. For better or worse, crowds empower more shy or conservative people to do what they might not have done otherwise: to pronounce their political beliefs or proclaim their sexual orientation in public, to sing about their heartfelt feelings for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, to occupy a bank, to throw a brick, to fight with strangers, to dance to Abba in the concourse of a major intercity railway station.</p> <p>Being a crowd member is not a muscle that will atrophy through lack of use \u2013 our knack for it, and need for it, has a much longer history than the months we will be required to keep our physical distance.

  "<p>The name <a href=\"https://www.goyt-valley.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Goyt valley</a> may be pre-Celtic, but there isn\u2019t much sense of the ancient here by day. The sounds of traffic are constant and it has been much visited in lockdown. Some of its history is also salted with tears.

Infused further with willow warbler song, the walk is beautiful but haunted, although I confess that some of Goyt\u2019s ghosts are mine. The Grimshawes filled the valley with rhododendrons and azaleas, whose invasive impact has been curtailed lately, but 50 years ago I\u2019d visit here with my grandma, who loved the dusky-purple spectacular of their spring blossoms (she could also recall supplies delivered to the hall by coach and horse).</p> <p>As the last sunlight slanted down through the trees, I noticed how it illuminated a scintillating horde of mixed insects and sallow seeds billowing out in the valley.

Stelzer-Braid suggests bringing two towels, one dedicated to wiping your face and the other for lying on. She recommends using disinfectant wipes to clean equipment.

  "<p>Nobody seems to know quite how the sloth became the rock star of the animal kingdom. From high in the Latin American rainforest, the absurd mammal is the focus of a frenzied obsession that shows no sign of abating. Sloths are on bank notes, adverts, T-shirts, internet memes and Instagram fan pages.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are obsessed,\u201d says Costa Rica\u2019s president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, when asked why people have fallen in love with the creature. \u201cThe sloth is quite a unique animal. It\u2019s also very related to the forest. I believe it\u2019s the elegance of the movement.\u201d</p> <p>But as with many examples of anthropomorphised wildlife, the trappings of fame have started to cause problems for the humble sloth. They are among the most \u201cselfied\u201d animals on the planet, according to wildlife charity <a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.us/\">World Animal Protection</a>. An analysis of Instagram images by the organisation found that <a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/close-up-on-cruelty\">70% of selfies with</a><a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/close-up-on-cruelty\"> sloths</a> \u2013 from the Brazilian Amazon to Central America \u2013 involve hugging, holding or using them as props. </p> <p>The stress of constant handling and noise for a creature that spends most of the day asleep in the wild can have damaging consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bce41f8702fd2bc17d3ebf31f23f02defcb69f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bce41f8702fd2bc17d3ebf31f23f02defcb69f9/0_0_3500_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sloth selfie Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tourist snaps a picture of a sloth being cuddled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Carniel Machado/World Animal Protection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf people are just seeing their images but not really thinking of them as wild creatures, then it could do more harm than good because it\u2019s feeding the frenzy,\u201d says Sam Trull, who runs <a href=\"http://www.theslothinstitutecostarica.org/\">the Sloth Institute</a>, an organisation that rehabilitates the animals and reintroduces them into the wild in Manuel Antonio, on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica.</p> <p>The brown-throated three-toed sloths and Hoffmann\u2019s two-toed sloths that hang from the rainforest in Manuel Antonio are a reassuring part of life in the national park area. The sight of a grey ball of fur clutching a cecropia tree lifts the darkest of moods. Yet the urge to climb into the canopy and give the dozing mammal a cuddle has gone too far. Adoring tourists have become a threat.</p> <p>\u201cThe photo-prop trade is a really big problem, where people take sloths out of the forest and charge money for people to hold them and take pictures with them. That\u2019s the negative side of them being popular. Anything that increases their popularity in a shallow way could be dangerous,\u201d Trull says during a virtual tour of the sanctuary, where sloths are recovering from car accidents, dog attacks and exhaustion from the heat of the dry season.</p> <p>In response to the problem, the Costa Rican government has launched the <a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\">#stopanimalselfies</a> campaign to crack down on the practice. Although human and wildlife interaction has been illegal in the country for more than a decade, the 2017 World Animal Protection report said Costa Rica <a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\">ranked seventh</a><a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\"> </a>in the world for \u201ccruel\u201d animal selfies.</p> <p>\u201cThese interactions don\u2019t just put wild animals at risk, they put tourists at risk too. Animals can transmit zoonotic illnesses through biting and scratching,\u201d says Shirley Ram\u00edrez Carvajal, a wildlife biologist who works on the campaign.</p> <p>The problem with wildlife selfies is not limited to sloths. Instagram has also been alert to the issue and has introduced warnings about the abuse of wild animals on popular hashtags such as #koalaselfie, #elephantride and #monkeyselfie, which are often filled with beaming images of tourists and wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a323fd6539d5de65316a6748ca2535ec21d97c49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a323fd6539d5de65316a6748ca2535ec21d97c49/0_0_6969_4648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tourist takes a selfie with a ring-tailed lemur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tourist takes a selfie with a ring-tailed lemur. Critics say such actions put both animals and humans at risk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have a law that bans direct contact with fauna and feeding wildlife. In this way, animals maintain wild behaviour in the best possible way. Almost always, when animals get used to being fed or become comfortable around humans, there are accidents which can be quite serious,\u201d Ram\u00edrez Carvajal adds.</p> <p>Alongside the <a href=\"https://stopanimalselfies.org/en/home/\">eight-point code</a> on ethical wildlife selfies, the Costa Rican government is encouraging tourists to report illegal behaviour. The consumption of food meant for humans by monkeys and racoons in some national parks has caused issues with tooth decay, obesity and bone problems. It is hoped the campaign will raise awareness and reduce the number of such interactions.</p> <p>Once Covid-19 travel restrictions are lifted, thousands of tourists are expected once again to travel to Costa Rica, many of them hoping to catch sight of a sloth clinging to a tree in the rainforest. It is an unlikely turnaround from the reaction of Spanish colonists, who dismissed them as ugly and useless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12940330de50b5e1e39ca807321ecc8f1741b9d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12940330de50b5e1e39ca807321ecc8f1741b9d5/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sloths Amy and Aretha, currently in rehab at the Sloth Institute, Costa Rica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy and Aretha, currently in rehab at the Sloth Institute, Costa Rica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Trull/The Sloth Institute Costa Rica</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think that they are a really good example of balance.

Behind the brutal murder of an environment crusader</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ca\u0301ceres was exceptional, but her murder was not. Honduras is one of the most violent countries in the world; in 2009, a military-backed coup ushered in an authoritarian pro-business political party, which has since been accused by Honduran prosecutors of<a href=\"https://theglobalamericans.org/2020/01/honduras-is-losing-the-fight-against-corruption/\"> deep-seated corruption,</a> and implicated by <a href=\"https://www.univision.com/univision-news/latin-america/president-of-honduras-implicated-in-1-5-million-drug-money-conspiracy-by-new-york-prosecutor\">American prosecutors in drug trafficking and money laundering</a>. The nightmare which has unfolded over the past 11 years has forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/central-america-violence-refugee-crisis-gangs-murder\">hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to flee</a> a toxic mix of poverty, dire public services, corruption, gang- and state-sponsored violence.</p> <p>They risk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/21/mexico-kidnappings-refugees-central-america-immigration\">kidnap, extortion, rape and even death</a> at the hands of criminal gangs and corrupt state forces as they travel 1,500 or so miles overland through Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States. Like migrants and refugees from neighbouring Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico, those fleeing Honduras are looking for safety, prosperity and dignity, but what they find is an increasingly hostile country willing to violate international and national laws to keep them out.</p> <p>The Trump administration has used the Covid-19 pandemic as a pretext to issue a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-asylum-seekers-coronavirus-law-un\">legally sketchy total ban</a> on migrants and refugees at US land borders. The one thing the US does not seem willing to do is withdraw economic and political support from the post-coup ruling political party in Honduras. US policies for Central America have long been contradictory, and that\u2019s certainly true today. Meanwhile, in Honduras, the pandemic has been used to crack down on civil liberties, with reports that indigenous and rural communities considered hostile to the government are being denied basic food aid.</p> <p>Ca\u0301ceres\u2019s murder triggered international condemnation but failed to stop the bloodshed. At least&nbsp;25&nbsp;land and environmental defenders have been murdered in Honduras since&nbsp;2&nbsp;March 2016. Latin America remains the most dangerous region in the world to defend land and rivers from megaprojects like mines, dams, fracking, logging and biofuel cash crops, which are almost always licensed without proper consultation or compensation. Between March 2016 and November 2019, 340 defenders were killed in the Americas, according to Global Witness,&nbsp;a not-for-profit group. These high-impact, targeted assassinations&nbsp;go largely unpunished. Impunity breeds more violence.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We cannot talk about\u00a0'clean' energy\u00a0while communities\u00a0like those C\u00e1ceres defended\u00a0are\u00a0militarised and displaced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Generally, assassination is the macabre finale in a campaign that also includes intimidation, defamation, threats, attempted bribes, assault and, increasingly, judicial persecution.

  "<p>The amount of pristine tropical rainforest lost across the globe increased last year, as the equivalent of a football pitch disappeared every six seconds, a satellite-based analysis has found.</p> <p>Nearly 12m hectares of tree cover was lost across the tropics, including nearly 4m hectares of dense, old rainforest that held significant stores of carbon and had been home to a vast array of wildlife, according to data from the University of Maryland.</p> <p>Beyond the tropics, Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bushfires\">devastating bushfires</a> led to a sixfold increase in tree cover loss across the continent in 2019 compared with the previous year. Rod Taylor, from the World Resources Institute, part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalforestwatch.org/\">Global Forest Watch</a>&nbsp;network that released the analysis, said as the unprecedented fires continued into 2020, this was only a partial picture of the area affected in the southern fire season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/counting-the-cost-of-australias-summer-of-dread\">Counting the cost of the bushfires: Australia's summer of dread</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Australia\u2019s eucalyptus trees are generally well adapted to respond to fire, Taylor said this year\u2019s blazes burned more intensely, having followed a severe drought, and spread rapidly due to high winds. The fires killed 33 people directly, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/australias-summer-bushfire-smoke-killed-445-and-put-thousands-in-hospital-inquiry-hears\">445 more through smoke inhalation</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/14/a-billion-animals-the-australian-species-most-at-risk-from-the-bushfire-crisis\">hundreds of millions of animals</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhereas a normal fire might char the bark of a tree, this year\u2019s fires turned many trees into charcoal sticks,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAustralia can expect more extreme fire seasons as fire risk increases due to climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The loss of trees in the tropics was the third worst recorded since data was first collected in 2002, trailing behind only 2016 and 2017. The heaviest reduction continues to be in Brazil, which accounted for more than a third of all humid tropical forest loss. Government data shows that deforestation for agriculture and other new land uses increased rapidly in the Brazilian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/amazon-rainforest\">Amazon</a> over the past year.</p> <p>The biggest surge in forest loss was in Bolivia, where fires led to an 80% greater reduction in tree cover than in any previous year on record. The institute said many of the fires were probably deliberately lit to clear farming land for planting and spread into forests due to strong winds and drought exacerbated by the climate crisis. It follows the Bolivian government making regulatory changes to encourage the expansion of agriculture.</p> <p>There was a slight decrease in forest loss in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but it was still the third highest year on record, largely due to cyclical agricultural operations, though the institute said there was emerging evidence that commercial logging, mining and clearing for plantations was having an impact.</p> <p>Primary forest loss was down about 50% in both Ghana and Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and reduced for a third straight year in Indonesia, where it fell back to a level not seen for more than 15 years. This follows Jakarta introducing a permanent moratorium on clearing for oil palm plantations and increased efforts to ensure that laws were enforced.</p> <p>Frances Seymour, a senior fellow with the institute, said the level of global forest loss was unacceptable and that it was clear what was needed to reverse the trend. \u201cIf governments put into place good policies and enforce the law, forest loss goes down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if governments relax restrictions on burning, or signal an intent to open up indigenous territories for commercial exploitation, forest loss goes up.\u201d</p> <p>Seymour said the international community could help address the problem by introducing economic or market incentives for protecting forests. She called for governments to embrace four steps: preventing forest burning; increasing monitoring and enforcement to stop breaches; providing the poor and hungry with alternatives to forest exploitation; and not reducing protections to aid the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>",
  "<p> </p> <p>The final few months of Berta Ca\u0301ceres\u2019s life were filled with ominous signs. Just before Christmas 2015, she confided in her sister Agustina that her life was in danger. \u201cThe messages never stop, the harassment never stops, they have me under surveillance. They don\u2019t care that I have children. Those sons of bitches are going to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>Berta was involved in numerous land and water struggles alongside indigenous Lenca communities across western Honduras. But the battle to stop construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, in the community of Ri\u0301o Blanco, had her more worried than usual. Berta told her children she was scared, and that they should take the threats seriously. \u201cMum said there was a group of dangerous <em>sicarios </em>[hitmen] attacking the Ri\u0301o Blanco community and asking about us, her daughters,\u201d said Laura, 23, the youngest, home from midwifery college for the Christmas break. \u201cI knew the threats were serious because she wouldn\u2019t leave me alone in the house, not even for a night.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/berta-caceres-was-exceptional-her-was-all-too-commonplace\">Berta C\u00e1ceres was exceptional. Her murder was all too commonplace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berta had reasons to suspect the hitmen were hired by Desa, the dam construction company. Desa\u2019s trumped-up criminal charges against her and other leaders of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) had failed to silence them. Was it now it pursuing other means to stop the opposition?</p> <p>Her sense of unease intensified on 12 February 2016. Douglas Bustillo, a thuggish former army lieutenant and Desa\u2019s ex-security chief, messaged her Copinh deputy, Toma\u0301s Go\u0301mez, out of the blue, accusing Berta of cashing in on the Ri\u0301o Blanco struggle to win the prestigious Goldman environmental prize.</p> <p>Four days later, driving out of Ri\u0301o Blanco, Berta\u2019s car was shadowed by two SUVs carrying armed locals she knew were linked to Desa.</p> <p>On 20 February, Berta led a convoy to the Gualcarque, a river considered sacred by the Lenca people, to make a stand against the company\u2019s attempt to circumvent indigenous land rights by moving the dam across the shore. Desa was warned about the demonstration via its network of paid informants, and summoned its political and security allies to wreck the event. First, Copinh\u2019s buses and cars were detained at a checkpoint where everyone was forced out, registered and photographed by police and military officers. Then, a small crowd threw stones and insults. \u201cYou old witch, you\u2019ll never come back here!\u201d screamed the pro-dam deputy mayor at Berta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f7b2024115045043ebe379e2cea7581ef46683b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7b2024115045043ebe379e2cea7581ef46683b/0_0_800_1208/662.jpg\" alt=\"Who Killed Berta C\u00e1ceres?

Waiting along the gruelling unshaded track were hired thugs and armed security guards and police officers, including some Tigres \u2013 an elite US-backed special weapons and tactics (Swat) team trained for urban combat.</p> <p>A drone buzzed overhead taking photographs as Copinh protesters threw rocks at the company machinery. Desa\u2019s security chief, former police major Jorge A\u0301vila, appeared with a grisly warning: \u201cIn a few days, you\u2019ll be eating someone\u2019s liver,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still undeterred, Berta continued with the exhausted group to the river, where they sat on the shady bank to rest and connect with the Gualcarque\u2019s sacred spirit. When they finally left it was dark, and Berta\u2019s car was pelted with beer bottles and rocks, smashing the rear window.</p> <p>Less than a week later, around midday on 26 February, a double-cabin pickup truck with polarized windows drove up the narrow dead-end street leading to the Copinh head office in the city of La Esperanza. A tall man with a military-style haircut got out and asked for Berta, while the driver kept the engine running. When asked to identify himself, he jumped into the car and sped off.</p> <p>These incidents made Berta even more nervous, and she arranged to stay at Utopi\u0301a, Copinh\u2019s bustling training centre in La Esperanza, so as not to be at home alone when Laura returned to university in Buenos Aires.</p> <p>She also contacted her friend Brigitte Gynther, a researcher at the School of Americas Watch (SOAW), who catalogued threats against Copinh. \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d she wrote in a text message on 29 February. \u201cI have news.\u201d Brigitte was working in Colombia, but they agreed to speak later.</p> <p>On the morning of 1 March, Berta drove Laura to Tonconti\u0301n airport on the outskirts of the capital, Tegucigalpa. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d she said. \u201cEnjoy life, make the most of it, but remember this is where you belong, in Honduras, fighting to make this a better place.\u201d</p> <p>Just before Laura went through security Berta hugged her youngest child one more time. \u201cThis country is fucked, but if anything happens to me, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Laura assumed she was worried about being arrested again. \u201cMy mum was so well known that I really doubted anything serious would happen to her. I thought meeting the pope and winning the Goldman prize would protect her.\u201d</p> <p>At 2.08pm, Sergio Rodri\u0301guez sent a WhatsApp message to Desa shareholders and senior managers, among them company president David Castillo, a US-trained former military intelligence officer, confirming that Berta would be in La Esperanza the following day.</p> <p>Laura\u2019s plane took off just as Berta\u2019s old friend Gustavo Castro, a politically astute Mexican environmentalist, was landing at San Pedro Sula international airport on the other side of the country. Berta had invited Gustavo to give a workshop on alternative energy for Copinh members. The pair hadn\u2019t seen each other in several years and spent the evening catching up at Berta\u2019s new house in Colonia Li\u0301bano, a gated community on the southern edge of La Esperanza.</p> <p>Berta told him about the turmoil generated by the campaign to stop the dam, a construction project backed by members of one of the country\u2019s most powerful clans, the Atala Zablah family, as well as international banks. \u201cI had no idea how much pressure she was under,\u201d Gustavo would recall.</p> <p>They were both tired, so Berta suggested calling it a night and offered to take Gustavo to his lodgings, but he was worried about her safety. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark and isolated here, will you be alright driving back alone so late?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. But why don\u2019t you come and stay here with me from tomorrow night?\u201d</p> <p>The next day, Tuesday 2 March, Berta opened the workshop in Utopi\u0301a before heading to the outdoor kitchen area, carrying her three constantly chiming mobile phones and customary notebook and pen. She messaged Laura, telling her not to worry as Gustavo would be staying at the house. She also called her close colleague Sotero Chavarri\u0301a, who was in Tegucigalpa for medical treatment. \u201c<em>Hermano</em>, I need you back here, come soon, I have to tell you something, it\u2019s important,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Shortly after, Sotero received another call: security chief A\u0301vila and a dozen Ri\u0301o Blanco locals aligned with Desa were approaching La Esperanza in a Toyota pickup truck.</p> <p>What business did they have that day, were they coming to keep tabs on Berta? On his way back to La Esperanza, Sotero noticed the police checkpoint at the city entrance was unmanned. This was so unusual that he mentioned it to colleagues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86406eb1167f84b0515f3cc653bbab12418e3774\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86406eb1167f84b0515f3cc653bbab12418e3774/0_0_5591_3354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman places flowers on an altar set up in honor of Berta C\u00e1ceres during a demonstration outside Honduras\u2019 embassy in Mexico City on 15 June 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman places flowers on an altar set up in honor of Berta C\u00e1ceres during a demonstration outside Honduras\u2019s embassy in Mexico City on 15 June 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eduardo Verdugo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that morning, Lilian Esperanza, the Copinh finance coordinator, arrived at Utopi\u0301a with a handful of cheques and a donor letter that needed Berta\u2019s signature. \u201cWe need to change the signature,\u201d Berta said. \u201cWhat if something happens to me? I could be jailed or killed. If you have problems accessing money, then what would happen to Copinh? I keep on reporting the threats, but no one takes any notice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Nothing\u2019s going to happen to you,\u201d Lilian insisted.</p> <p>Why was Berta acting as if time was running out?</p> <p>It was late morning when she left the workshop with Gaspar Sa\u0301nchez, Copinh\u2019s young sexual diversity coordinator, heading for the central market where Berta was helping vendors oppose the mayor\u2019s plan to replace it with a shopping mall. Later, in the car on their way back to the workshop, Gaspar interviewed Berta for Copinh\u2019s community radio station. \u201cEnergy is not just a technical issue, it\u2019s a political issue to do with life, territories, sovereignty and the right to community self-determination. We believe this is the moment to profoundly debate capitalism and how energy is part of the domination of indigenous communities and violation of their rights \u2026 That\u2019s what Lenca communities like Ri\u0301o Blanco are living through right now.\u201d</p> <p>It would be her last interview.</p> <p>Berta then called her friend Ismael Moreno, a Jesuit priest known as Padre Melo. \u201cShe was scared, but it was Camilito she was most worried about,\u201d Melo said: Berta had recently received an anonymous message threatening to chop her only grandchild into pieces.</p> <p>Back at the workshop, Berta messaged SOAW\u2019s Brigitte Gynther at 4.44pm, asking when she\u2019d be back from Colombia. \u201cI never found out what she wanted to tell me,\u201d said Brigitte. \u201cBut she only contacted me when something was seriously wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Berta and Gustavo then left Utopi\u0301a, popping in to visit her mother before heading to her favourite downtown eatery, El Fogo\u0301n, for dinner and a beer. Just before 9.30pm, a black double-cabin Toyota Hilux with polarized windows and no number plates was seen by a neighbour outside her mother\u2019s house. Soon after, Berta and Gustavo arrived back at her place.</p> <p>Berta\u2019s green and gold bungalow stands amid a scattering of garishly painted houses enclosed by a mishmash of wire and white wooden fencing, with views of a lake and distant pine-forested hills. The bungalow is on a dirt road about 150 metres from the security gate, which is operated by two guards working in 12-hour shifts.</p> <p>The layout is unusual, with the front door leading into the open-plan lounge and a flimsy wooden back door leading into the kitchen. She and Gustavo sat on the front patio talking for half an hour or so, enjoying the breeze. Then he smoked a cigarette, while Berta finished working on a document.</p> <p>Gustavo retired to the guest bedroom nearest the lounge. Berta\u2019s room was at the other end of the narrow hallway. After changing into an olive-green T-shirt and black shorts, she sat on her bed and kept working. At 11.25 she sent a message to Juan Carlos Jua\u0301rez, a police liaison officer charged with overseeing her protection. \u201cWherever you are, I wish you well. Please be careful. <em>Besos </em>[kisses].\u201d</p> <p>At around 11.35, Gustavo heard a noise. Tap! Tap! Tap! He thought it was Berta cleaning or fetching something from the kitchen, and barely looked up from his laptop. A minute or less later there was a louder, duller sound. Thud! Gustavo assumed Berta had dropped something in the kitchen. Then he heard her call out: \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was then I realized that someone was in the house and something bad was going to happen,\u201d Gustavo recalled. Seconds later, a tall, dark-skinned youth with cropped hair, wearing a black top and white scarf, kicked open the bedroom door and aimed a gun at his head from about two metres away. He heard the fuzzy sound of a walkie-talkie. Seated on the bed, Gustavo was looking straight at the gunman, when he heard Berta\u2019s bedroom door being forced open. It sounded as if she was struggling to push someone away. Then he heard three shots. Bang! Bang! Bang! Berta\u2019s legs gave way and she fell backwards. She tried to defend herself and scratched at the gunman as he bent over her. But she was weak, and the killer stamped on her bleeding body until she could no longer resist.</p> <p>Gustavo jumped up off the bed and in a split second lifted his left hand to protect his face as the gunman fired a single shot. Bang! The bullet grazed the back of his left hand and the top of his left ear. Gustavo lay completely still on the floor as blood oozed from the wounds. The gunman was convinced and left, but still Gustavo dared not move. Moments later he heard Berta\u2019s voice. \u201cGustavo! Gustavo!\u201d</p> <p>He ran to her and saw his friend sprawled on her back between the bedroom door and the wooden closet, struggling to breathe. Her curly black hair was sticky with the blood from three bullet wounds, spreading across her shorts and T-shirt.</p> <p>Gustavo squeezed through the small gap between the door and her shivering body. He knelt down and wrapped his arms around her, trying to keep her warm and alive. \u201cDon\u2019t go, Berta! Don\u2019t die! Stay with me,\u201d he begged. But Berta Ca\u0301ceres was bleeding to death.</p> <p>\u201cGet my phone,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOn the table.\u201d At around a quarter to midnight Berta uttered her last words. \u201cCall Salvador! Call Salvador!\u201d</p> <p>Then she was gone.</p> <p>Berta Ca\u0301ceres had been murdered. Killed in her bedroom less than a year after winning the foremost prize for environmental defenders.</p> <p>Gustavo survived. But would his eyewitness evidence be enough to identify the gunmen?

Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the 7.6% yearly reduction in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p> <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering. </p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/covid-low-carbon-future-lockdown-pandemic-green-economy\">Covid-19 has given us the chance to build a low-carbon future | Christiana Figueres</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4be468f084df971c8d581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:45:59.424Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other things reopening today include: cinemas in Thailand:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at a cinema in Bangkok, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear face mask to help curb the spread of the coronavirus during a movie at the Paragon Cineplex cinema in Bangkok, Thailand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ikea stores in Britain:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30/0_250_4929_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham before it reopens, after the British government relaxed lockdown measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington as it re-opens following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And amusement parks in Japan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dolphin performs at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise near Tokyo, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks enjoy a dolphin performance as the Hakkeijima Sea Paradise amusement park opens after a two-month closure due to the preventative measures to help curb the spread of the coronavirus in Yokohama near Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4bced8f08f5e3730122e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:34:57.780Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trains are running today in Manila for the first time in two months, as the lockdown is eased in the <strong>Philippines</strong>.

Thank you for following along. My colleague Simon Burnton will be taking on the blog now to continue our round-the-clock coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>A reminder that we have a blog dedicated to the George Floyd protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live\">here</a>. </p> <p>Below are the latest developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Manila eases lockdown. </strong>Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</li> <li><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries. </strong>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</li> <li><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks. </strong>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</li> <li><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases. </strong>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. </li> <li><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases. </strong>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday, he rode a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him. </li> <li><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload. </strong>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country. </li> <li><strong>North Korea to reopen schools. </strong>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said on Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation.
