  "<p>When did it become real for you? Perhaps it was when the first grisly footage started emerging from Wuhan, of deserted and dystopian streets, of a human catastrophe beyond understanding. Perhaps it was when an entire airline went bust, when plans and schemes were thrown into disarray. Perhaps it was when the Italian government decided in effect to put an entire nation of 60 million people under house arrest or when every school in Ireland shut down.</p> <p>Or perhaps it was when they called off Fulham v Brentford on Friday night. If so, there\u2019s no need to feel ashamed or abashed about it: for so many of us, sport isn\u2019t simply a way of passing the time but a way of marking it. It offers a liturgy, a structure on which to measure the passing days and seasons. Tuesday and Wednesday: Champions League. Thursday: Premier League darts. Friday night: Super League rugby. And then the entire weekend, from the Saturday lunchtime kick-off to the PGA golf on Sunday night: hours and hours of it, all stretched out before us like a delicious picnic. In frightening times, virus or no virus, these are the rituals that offer the veneer of normality, a background noise as reassuring and immutable as the ticking of the clock.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/west-ham-karren-brady-calls-for-premier-league-cancellation-coronavirus\">Karren Brady calls for Premier League to be made \u2018null and void\u2019 over coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so, as the enormous industrial complex of global sport clanks to a terrifying halt, it is only natural to feel shocked, concussed, perhaps even a touch bereft. Things move pretty fast in the corona-verse: in the space of a fortnight we\u2019ve gone from ironic elbow-bumps in the pub to the postponement of virtually the entire sporting schedule, Euro 2020 potentially becoming Euro 2021, Mikel Arteta in quarantine. Every day, every hour seems to bring more jolts to a system that on some level we all took for granted.</p> <p>All four English professional football divisions, the top two FA women\u2019s divisions, the big five European leagues, the Champions League and Europa League: off for now. England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka, the Masters, the Giro d\u2019Italia, the London Marathon: all postponed. Tennis and Formula One simply not happening. This is, in short, the most seismic disruption to the sporting calendar since the second world war, with the possibility that an obliterated spring is simply the prelude to an annihilated summer and a torched autumn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The absence of sport offers a microcosm of the atomisation we can expect in the housebound weeks ahead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first point to make is that on plenty of levels none of this matters. Liverpool being denied the Premier League title on a technicality; the Six Nations being voided; the Olympics being called off \u2013 all of this pales against the human toll: the fear, the loneliness, the deprivation, the thousands and perhaps even millions being wheeled into hospitals for the last time. In a way this has been the first and most important sporting consequence of the pandemic: that for all the time and money and hope and anger we invest in this business of balls and implements, all of it is ultimately expendable.</p> <p>The second point to make is that clearly, to some people, it does matter a bit. One only had to read the responses of fantasy football managers to the news from the official Premier League account that Manchester City v Arsenal had been postponed on public safety grounds. \u201cAbsolute farce of a decision on your part,\u201d fumed one. \u201cComplete bullshit, just another example of how this game is complete luck,\u201d observed another. \u201cYour game\u2019s rigged, fuck off,\u201d said a user called Fents, which raised the salient issue of just how \u2013 and never mind the why for a moment \u2013 Fents reckons the Premier League confected a deadly virus outbreak that would sweep the UK just in time to deny him his rightful Aubameyang triple-captain points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f475adc0907b022a5fa8b2f4b118bf1b8de7078\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f475adc0907b022a5fa8b2f4b118bf1b8de7078/0_81_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Principality Stadium stayed shut on Saturday, with Wales\u2019 Six Nations clash with Scotland postponed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Principality Stadium stayed shut on Saturday, with Wales\u2019 Six Nations clash with Scotland postponed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malcolm Mackenzie/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It can be seen, too, in the toxic, self-interested shrillness with which some fans have greeted the havoc of a truncated season. Would Leeds or Coventry still be promoted? Would it be fair for Aston Villa to be relegated in 19th place with a game in hand? Would you be prepared to risk the deaths of strangers in order to guarantee that your club would win the league? I don\u2019t know how many fans would answer yes to that last question, but the last few days on social media have demonstrated that it is certainly higher than zero.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, this is the flip side to all the feelgood stories we tell ourselves in this job: if we are genuine about the power of sport to inspire, to edify, to spread happiness and bring people together, then we need to be honest about the consequences of its absence. This is about more than simply having nothing to watch on TV on a Saturday; although, if this is the sort of thing that gives your life meaning and shape, then who are we to judge? Rather, the absence of sport offers a microcosm of the wider atomisation that we can expect over these housebound weeks and months: a slow and gradual retreat from the shared spaces and shared consciousness that live events provide, away from the public and into the private.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/nigel-pearson-watford-liverpool-premier-league-coronavirus-interview-donald-mcrae\">Nigel Pearson: \u2018It's the right decision to stop playing, even if it was made under duress'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The broadcasters will still have airtime to fill, of course. Your favourite Sunday newspaper will still have column inches to populate. And in the meantime the hot coals of the internet will continue to rage as if nothing had happened. Sport\u2019s dark web \u2013 all that coiled tension and angst, all those interminable arguments about Goats and frauds and \u201ccredit\u201d, all those WhatsApp threads set up purely to bitch about people on other WhatsApp threads \u2013 this shall endure, even in the absence of any actual sport over which to fulminate.</p> <p>Perhaps, during these long weeks ahead, we could all use a little patience. Perhaps even a little humility, especially in the face of unfolding human tragedy. Perhaps we will succumb to the charms of a new obsession: live games of Fifa on YouTube, Bolivian nose wrestling on Eurosport 2, or perhaps one of the few sports \u2013 speedway, horse racing, non-league football \u2013 that at the time of writing has decided to plough on regardless.</p> <p>And then one day it will all be over. Athletes will emerge from their hibernation and return to training. Fixtures will be rescheduled. Stadiums will open for business. Little by little the galaxy of sport will blink back into life and it will feel like a benediction and an irrelevance all at once: a reminder that of all the things that don\u2019t matter sport matters most of all.</p>",
  "<p>The Eastleigh manager, Ben Strevens, has accused the National League of greed, saying there was \u201cno way whatsoever\u201d matches should have gone ahead given the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The non-league competition announced on Friday that games in their three divisions would proceed as planned \u2013 meaning that, with the Premier League, EFL and leagues across the continent suspended, yesterday\u2019s game between Notts County and Eastleigh inadvertently became the biggest in England.</p> <p>There were 4,942 in attendance as the hosts won 4-0. \u201cThe reason it went ahead is because whoever sits on the board of the National League just cared about the money,\u201d said Strevens. \u201cSimple as that. They didn\u2019t think about the well-being of the spectators, and it\u2019s not only the supporters: we\u2019ve got a kitman who is an old boy, and there\u2019s stewards who are older. They\u2019re the ones that are most at risk. There\u2019s no way whatsoever these games should have been played.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to Strevens\u2019s comments, the National League chief executive, Michael Tattersall, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not really a time for having an argument, it\u2019s a time for reflecting on what\u2019s happening in our society ... The National League is keeping the continuation of the season under constant review.\u201d</p> <p>Fans not following the non-league action experienced the eerie sensation of a Saturday largely without sport. With Six Nations and Premiership rugby union suspended, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">England\u2019s cricket tour of Sri Lanka abandoned</a> and this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/formula-one-australian-grand-prix-melbourne-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne also called off, i</a>t was left to horse racing and an Olympic boxing qualifier to fill the British calendar.</p> <p>But while supporters sought to entertain themselves in new ways, debate continued inside sport as to what direction to take in the face of a pandemic that could yet last for months. First and foremost on the list of concerns is the Olympic Games. With football\u2019s Euro 2020 expected to be postponed for a year at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, the biggest event of all is the last one standing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/wakefield-michael-carter-fears-coronavirus-impact-on-some-rugby-league-clubs\">Wakefield CEO fears \u2018astronomical\u2019 impact on some rugby league clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This past week the Olympic torch relay was aborted in Greece and the US president, Donald Trump, said the Games \u2013 due to take place in Tokyo in July \u2013 should be moved back a year.

The Japanese leg of the torch relay is due to begin on 26 March.</p> <p>In football the discussion has moved on to the possibility of the league season being cancelled altogether. It is understood the Premier League is considering a number of options ahead of an emergency meeting next Thursday. These range from trying to complete the season behind closed doors in a \u201csanitised\u201d environment to declaring this season void and promoting the top two teams from the Championship, Leeds and West Brom, to play in an expanded 22-team competition next season.</p> <p>One club executive, West Ham\u2019s Karren Brady, used her column in Saturday\u2019s <em>Sun</em> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/west-ham-karren-brady-calls-for-premier-league-cancellation-coronavirus\" title=\"\">call for the season to be voided if it cannot quickly be resumed</a>. That would carry substantial financial implications and, while most Premier League clubs would be able to take the hit, that is not the case for clubs lower down the pyramid who are much more reliant on gate receipts to keep running.On Saturday Steve Thompson, managing director of Dagenham and Redbridge who play in the National League, said the outlook was bleak for smaller clubs. \u201cPotentially some are not going to survive this,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a large social facility with two function rooms, and lots of clubs in non\u2011league and Leagues One and Two rely on that income.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-impact-lower-league-clubs-dagenham-redbridge-steve-thompson\">Coronavirus may put football clubs out of business, says Dagenham director</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For supporters, meanwhile, there was the relatively less stressful challenge of trying to fill their empty time.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>US extends European travel ban to UK and Ireland</strong></h2> <p>Vice-president Mike Pence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-unemployment-testing\">confirmed</a> that travel from the UK and Ireland will be suspended from midnight Monday (eastern standard time) in order to contain the outbreak. Earlier at the White House briefing, Donald Trump said that he has taken the test for coronavirus \u2013 but the results were not yet available.</p> <h2><strong>Only 36% of Britons trust Johnson on coronavirus \u2013 poll</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/only-36-of-britons-trust-boris-johnson-on-coronavirus-poll-finds\">survey commissioned by the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/only-36-of-britons-trust-boris-johnson-on-coronavirus-poll-finds\">Observer</a> </em>shows people have more faith in those with medical and scientific knowledge than they have in Britain\u2019s political leaders. The government is seen, overall, as having handled the crisis well. The findings come as the coronavirus death toll in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-death-toll-in-uk-doubles-in-just-24-hours\">UK doubled in 24 hours to 21</a> \u2013 and the total number of people to test positive for the virus rose to 1,140.</p> <h2><strong>All flights to and from Yemen suspended for two weeks</strong></h2> <p>Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government and Houthi rebels have both said they will be suspending flights to and from airports under their respective control. Prime minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed said all flights to and from government controlled airports would be suspended for a fortnight from 18 March. The suspension exempts flights for humanitarian purposes. Houthi rebels in control of northern Yemen have said all passenger flights to and from the capital Sana\u2019a will be suspended for two weeks. Five years of war have already decimated the nation\u2019s healthcare infrastructure.</p> <h2><strong>Syria has shut schools and cancelled events, but still insists it has no cases</strong></h2> <p>The conflict-affected nation has also reduced public sector hours to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Health Ministry said the steps were \u201cpreventative\u201d and \u201cprecautionary\u201d and intended to raise the health sector\u2019s readiness to control the virus should it emerge, and says there have been no cases in the country.</p> <h2>France to close most shops, cafes, restaurants and cinemas</h2> <p>France will shut down cafes, shops, restaurants and cinemas to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, prime minister \u00c9duoard Philippe has announced. Philippe said public transport will be kept open but asked citizens to limit their use, Reuters<strong> </strong>news agency reported. The closures will come into effect at midnight on Saturday.

  "<p>The UK faces having to wait longer and pay more to acquire a coronavirus vaccine because it has left the EU, health experts and international legal experts warn today.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/why-brexit-will-delay-uk-getting-vaccine-and-cost-more\" title=\"\">article published today</a> on the Guardian website, the academics and lawyers say Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to \u201cgo it alone\u201d, free of EU regulation, after Brexit means the UK will probably have to join other non-EU countries in a queue to acquire the vaccine after EU member states have had it, and on less-favourable terms.</p> <p>The authors include Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and legal academics Anniek de Ruijter of Amsterdam Law School and Mark Flear of Queens University, Belfast.</p> <p>The UK will leave the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the body responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines, at the end of the transition period on 30 December. This means it will no longer be part of the EU\u2019s regulatory regime, which allows for \u201caccelerated assessment\u201d of products developed by drugs companies during a pandemic.</p> <p>The UK has already withdrawn from the EU\u2019s emergency bulk-buying mechanism for vaccines and medicines, under which member states strike collective agreements with pharmaceutical companies, which speeds up their access to the latest products during a crisis.</p> <p>The academics write: \u201cFor all these reasons ... the UK is likely to have to join the queue for access with other countries outside the EU, and to pay more than it would otherwise as an EU member state.</p> <p>\u201cLooking further ahead, this problem will not be limited to emergencies and the UK can expect slower and more limited access to medicines, especially those for rare conditions or those used to treat children, where the market is small.\u201d</p> <p>They argue that the UK could still avoid the worst by agreeing to align fully with the EMA\u2019s regulations from outside the EU. But they say Johnson has so far indicated that his team have no intention of doing so and do not want to operate as \u201crule takers\u201d.</p> <p>While it appears the UK government wants to press ahead with its own regulatory system and rapid market authorisation system for emergencies, the experts say this will be all but impossible to put in place in time for a new Covid-19 vaccine, which is expected in about a year.</p> <p>Even then the view in medical circles is that pharmaceutical companies are likely to look first to the EU for regulatory approval and an agreement on sale, given the scale of the market they would be selling into.</p> <p>Olivier Wouters of the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: \u201cAfter the Brexit transition period, the UK will no longer be part of the EMA and will therefore have to make its own regulatory decisions, unless ongoing EU-UK trade negotiations result in the UK aligning itself with European rules.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK could, in theory, choose to recognise any approval decision made by the EMA to prevent delays, but this seems at odds with the UK government\u2019s pledge to \u2018take back control\u2019. If the UK authorities instead choose to set up a separate review and approval process for medicines and vaccines, then it might delay access to a new coronavirus therapy.</p> <p>\u201cThe country could experience disruptions as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the country\u2019s counterpart to the EMA, works to fill the gap left by the departure of the EMA.</p> <p>\u201cVaccine makers and drug companies may decide to first seek approval from the EMA, which represents some 500 million patients, before seeking approval from the UK MHRA, which covers a smaller patient pool.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the prospect of the UK having to pay higher prices for a vaccine, he said: \u201cIf a coronavirus vaccine is developed, EU countries may choose to band together to jointly procure the vaccine. This would give EU countries more bargaining power against a vaccine maker to try to secure a lower price. If the UK were excluded from such a joint procurement scheme, it\u2019s possible that the UK would end up paying a higher price than the EU for the same vaccine.\u201d</p> <p>EMA was based in London until January last year, when Brexit saw it relocate to Amsterdam.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK and our friends and partners across Europe are part of a concerted international effort to combat the threat of COVID-19. We are confident that our current close working relationships will continue as we ready ourselves for all eventualities. We\u2019re fully supporting the UK\u2019s world-leading, disease research sector to play a key role in the global effort, with \u00a340 million of new funding for rapid research into the virus.\u201d</p>",

If, as many environmentalists say, the struggle against global heating requires a sense of wartime emergency, then fighting it while chiefly relying on these assets is as if Britain fought the Second World War relying on the Home Guard.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\" title=\"\">budget</a> contained some useful steps to limit carbon emissions; but they are far too small, and offset by road construction and the failure to lift the freeze on fuel taxes brought in 10 years ago. </p> <p>Climate change, if unchecked, threatens the destruction of Britain; yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/uk-takes-first-small-steps-to-tackle-carbon-from-worst-polluters\" title=\"\">new money</a> allocated to combat it is less than one fifteenth of the annual defence bill and well under half the cost of the two Royal Navy aircraft carriers \u2013 which increasingly seem to have no national strategic purpose.</p> <p>The best way of looking at the idea of state-led national <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">green new deals</a> is to see them as the latest episode in the 200-year-old history of efforts to save capitalism from itself. The difference is that in the past, unrestrained capitalism could only destroy one country\u2019s political and economic order. Today, by continuing to boost carbon emissions, it can destroy the whole of modern civilisation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before 2008, we know it now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throughout modern history, just as today, there have been capitalists, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, who have called for the reform of capitalism, whether from conscience or fear of revolution, but, in the end, parliaments still had to pass the laws and states had to implement them. If we had left it to capitalism to regulate itself, seven-year-olds would still be working down coal mines \u2013 or, more likely, Britain would have collapsed into communism. Capitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\" title=\"\">crash of 2008</a>, we certainly know it now.</p> <p>Central to the taming of capitalism has always been the creation of welfare states. Enhanced social security and state healthcare as part of any green new deal are essential to the fight to limit carbon emissions for three reasons: to compensate those workers and sections of society that will suffer as a result of the abandonment of fossil fuels; to make the necessary sacrifices politically possible by sharing those sacrifices through progressive taxation; and to build the social and national resilience which we will need if our democratic orders are to survive the shocks of the decades to come \u2013 including the spread of tropical diseases as a result of climate change.</p> <p>This need for social solidarity links the green new deal to the patriotic origins of the welfare state. Both conservatives and socialists have agreed in attributing the welfare state to socialism; conservatives because they have come to dislike it, the left because they want to claim all credit for it.</p> <p>In fact, the origins of the British welfare state lie very largely in the social imperialism movement in the years before 1914. The supporters of this movement were an extraordinarily varied bunch: H G Wells, George Bernard Shaw and Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the left; liberal imperialists such as Winston Churchill and William Beveridge; patriotic writers including Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle; imperial bureaucrats such as Lord Milner and John Buchan; and soldiers including Field Marshal Lord Roberts. Their thinking echoed, in key respects, Bismarck\u2019s social security programme in Germany and the reformist <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/12/06/archives-president-teddy-roosevelts-new-nationalism-speech\" title=\"\">\u201cnew nationalism\u201d </a>of Theodore Roosevelt in the US.</p> <p>As Lord Roberts declared: \u201cTo tens of thousands of Englishmen engaged in daily toil, the call to \u2018sacrifice\u2019 themselves for their country must seem an insult to their reason; for those conditions amid which they work make their lives already an unending sacrifice.\u201d</p> <p>What all these figures had in common was a fear of social disintegration and revolution; a belief (right or wrong) in the British Empire as a force for progress; and a belief that social solidarity, \u201cnational efficiency\u201d, and a degree of national self-sufficiency were essential to survive what they (correctly) saw would be the colossal social, economic and political strains of a new European war.</p> <p>My own thinking about this has also been shaped by my experience of working in Qatar, which has engaged in an intense and successful state-led effort at national self-sufficiency in response to the blockade by Saudi Arabia and other neighbours.</p> <p>The social imperialist tradition flowed into the later development of the welfare state as a result of the Second World War. In the course of these conflicts most of the Labour party became intensely patriotic, while the Conservatives became one-nation Tories, committed to social solidarity and state involvement in the economy.</p> <p>When, in 1960, Bernard Semmel wrote his classic study of social imperialism, Imperialism and Social Reform, he took for granted its victory on both sides of the political spectrum: \u201cToday, the Cobdenites [ie radical free-market liberals] and the international socialists are virtually extinct breeds.\u201d</p> <p>This is the spirit we need to recover in response to the climate emergency and associated menaces. International agreements and protest movements are valuable and necessary but they can\u2019t do anything themselves. Their purpose is to nudge and shame states into taking action. And state governments, in the end, take action on behalf of their national populations. That is their duty, and it is also what those populations expect and vote for.</p> <p>The task then is to mobilise patriotism by convincing national populations that global heating is a threat, not just to humanity and the planet but to the interests and the future survival of their own countries; and that society, as a whole, will pull together, alleviate suffering and make sacrifices as part of a common effort.</p> <p>If we can\u2019t manage this I very much doubt that liberal democracy will survive what is coming at us down the line.</p> <p>\u2022 Anatol Lieven is the author of Climate Change and the Nation State: The Realist Case</p>",
  "<p>Investigative journalist Jess Hill interviewed dozens of abused women, domestic abuse-sector workers, male perpetrators, children\u2019s advocates and system experts over five years in order to write her award-winning book See What You Made Me Do. Here she answers some questions about child protection arising from the murders in Brisbane of Hannah Clarke and her three children, Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4 and Trey, 3.</p> <h2><strong>How does domestic abuse impact children?</strong></h2> <p> It\u2019s common knowledge that one woman a week is killed by a current or former partner in Australia, but not so common that <a href=\"https://lens.monash.edu/@medicine-health/2019/06/12/1375311/when-parents-kill-the-reality-of-filicide-in-australia\">a child is murdered by a parent every fortnight</a>. While not all of these are a result of domestic abuse situations, most are, and it\u2019s shocking. Why isn\u2019t the child homicide stat commonly known? Because even in these enlightened times, we still can\u2019t see children as individuals. In the public mind, children are subsidiaries of their parents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/08/patriarchy-and-power-how-gender-inequality-underpins-abusive-behaviour\">Patriarchy and power: how socialisation underpins abusive behaviour | Jess Hill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the voluminous research on children\u2019s development, we still can\u2019t seem to conceive that kids experiencing domestic abuse have unique wants and needs that not only differ from their parents but from their siblings, too. One child may be acutely aware of the abuse, and may take on the role of family protector. Their sibling may refuse to acknowledge it at all, even when physical violence occurs right in front of them. Another sibling may identify strongly with the abusive parent and start imitating their behaviours. This is a particularly tragic scenario that we see play out so often: the victim parent leaves the abusive parent, only to have their child replace the perpetrator as the violent oppressor in the family. Truly one of the saddest places I\u2019ve ever visited was a room in the children\u2019s court at Parramatta where parents were applying for intervention orders against their own children.</p> <h2><strong>What about kids that grow up with coercive control?</strong></h2> <p>The critical thing for people (and particularly our justice system) to understand is that children don\u2019t just witness incidents of domestic abuse. Their development is shaped by the abusive dynamic. That\u2019s why exposure to domestic abuse is increasingly being recognised as child abuse. Critically, there doesn\u2019t need to be any physical violence present for kids to be deeply affected. We now understand, thanks to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/car.2422\">recent research</a> from Dr Emma Katz in the UK, that children are harmed by coercive control in similar ways to their victim parent: they may be isolated from extended family, forced to obey trivial demands, degraded and threatened.</p> <p>Just as it is for their victim parent, it can be the little things that are the most frightening: one teenage girl told me that one of the worst things her father did was make this particular creepy smile. These are the kinds of things that haunt children, the signals that remind them that danger is ever-present and the threat is something they must continually manage. Their perspective, like that of their victim parent, is being virtually colonised by the perpetrator parent. They have to develop ways to resist that, to hold on to their own sense of self, and to develop independence and competence. Coercive control is as much a trap for children as it is for their victim parent.</p> <h2><strong>What are some of the long-term psychological impacts for children?</strong></h2> <p>The answer to this question, like all of these, could fill a book! But to tackle just one aspect of this, let\u2019s talk about complex trauma. Children who grow up with prolonged abuse may develop what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.blueknot.org.au/Resources/Information/Understanding-abuse-and-trauma/What-is-complex-trauma\">complex trauma</a>\u201d, or C-PTSD. As Dr Bessel can der Kolk describes it, kids with complex trauma \u201cdevelop a view of the world that incorporates their betrayal and hurt. They anticipate and expect the trauma to recur and respond with hyperactivity, aggression, defeat or freeze responses to minor stresses.\u201d This conditioning can start in infancy. Babies are not oblivious to abuse; they are acutely aware of their surroundings \u2013 particularly the emotional state of their primary caregiver.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think people fully understand how dangerous the family law system can be for children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Children (and later, adults) with complex trauma can harbour deep distrust for others, or may find that their \u201ctrust\u201d is commonly betrayed, which can lead to major problems with intimacy and friendship. Other common symptoms of complex trauma include suicidal thoughts, feelings of detachment from one\u2019s own body and mind, shame and guilt, the feeling of being like an alien, helplessness and hopelessness, self-harm and substance abuse. The thing is, their view of the world is not disordered \u2013 it is a product of the incredible strategies they developed (like dissociation, for example) to physically and psychologically survive their childhood. These strategies may have worked for them in the abusive environment, but they are maladaptive to life outside of that environment. The problem is, many in the psychiatric world don\u2019t acknowledge complex trauma, and thus misdiagnose children and adults with bipolar disorder, ADD, borderline personality disorder or oppositional defiant disorder.</p> <h2>Why is family law reform such a priority when it comes to protecting children?</h2> <p>I don\u2019t think people fully understand how dangerous the family law system can be for children.</p> <p>In previous centuries, judges could order an abused woman to return to her husband. The idea that a court would make such an order seems unthinkable now \u2013 but that is exactly what the family law system still does to children. Even when kids openly disclose abuse \u2013 and have their testimony corroborated by police, social workers, teachers and doctors \u2013 a family law judge may still order them to see or live part-time with their abusive parent. Worse still, they may even be ordered into the full-time custody of a parent they have openly pleaded to be protected from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6966615924ad0759eef93543d8203fa22e2ce374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6966615924ad0759eef93543d8203fa22e2ce374/0_0_4788_3293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of Hannah Clarke and her three children on display at their funeral in Brisbane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photos of Hannah Clarke and her three children on display at their funeral in Brisbane on 9 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once a family law order is made, it is virtually impossible for children to resist. If they run away, their custodial parent can apply for a recovery order, and the court can then order federal police to track them down and return them to their custodial parent. One teenager I interviewed, \u201cCarly\u201d, was pursued by federal police when she ran away from her father, who was controlling and intimidating towards her and had been violent to her mother and brother. She had to threaten suicide before the police would relent, on the proviso she was taken to hospital. After she was released she stayed for four months in a refuge, where despite asking for schoolwork, she received no schooling. Eventually, she was allowed to return to her mother \u2013 but only because the court decided she was old enough to make her own decision.</p> <p>Another teenager, \u201cAlex\u201d, also became suicidal after years of routine physical abuse from his father, whose sole custody he was ordered into when he was a toddler, after the mother\u2019s allegations against the father were disbelieved by the court. Alex ran away to his mother, with whom he was allowed only limited contact. When the family court requested he see another family report writer (to assess his claims and his mental state for the court), that writer concluded he didn\u2019t really want to die and that his threats were \u201cstress related\u201d. They recommended he be returned to his father, that contact be cut off with the mother, and that if he ran away again to his mother, she should be incarcerated. After he was ordered by the court to return to his father, Alex had to run away to police three times before he was taken seriously. Alex fought hard to be returned to his mother when he was 14. Now as a young adult he\u2019s been diagnosed with PTSD; he can\u2019t work, he can\u2019t study. He\u2019s now on the disability support pension.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They plead with their protective parent not to hand them over. They hide under the bed at handover time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The threat to children is not just anecdotal. The Australian Law Reform Commission review found that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/safety-must-come-first-in-family-law-legal-groups-reject-merger-plan-20191110-p5395q.html\">one in five parents reported safety concerns</a> for their children and/or themselves as a result of court-ordered contact with the other parent.</p> <p>When family law orders are made, children are ordered to comply \u2013 even when they are openly terrified. So they kick and scream at handovers. They plead with their protective parent not to hand them over. They hide under the bed at handover time. They call police. They self-harm. They may even be prevented by the court from accessing medical care and counselling. This is how weird \u2013 and destructive \u2013 parts of the family law system has become.</p> <p>Protective parents spend several years \u2013 and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2013 trying to protect them. Sometimes it\u2019s to no avail \u2013 they watch helplessly as their children develop medical conditions and regress into traumatised states, with no power to intervene. When an abused parent leaves, they do so to protect themselves and their children. But in the end, because the family law system is so dangerously inconsistent, they can\u2019t guarantee that they will be able to protect their children. That\u2019s why so many abused parents stay long past the time they would like to have left.</p> <h2><strong>Why are children being ordered into the care of abusive parents?</strong></h2> <p>So much of this comes back to the pro-contact ideology of the court. The Family Law Act states that when the court is considering how to allocate parenting, they must apply the presumption that the best interests of the child are served by both parents having equal-shared parental responsibility. That might be the case for regular families, but in the family law system, the vast majority of families are <em>not </em>regular. Up to 85% of families going through the family law system report histories of family violence, including emotional abuse, and half report physical violence. Despite this, only 3% of cases result in no contact with one parent, and around 79% end up with orders to share parental responsibility. But how can you share parental responsibility with an abusive parent?</p> <p>This presumption of equal-shared parental responsibility is, in theory, not supposed to apply where the child\u2019s safety is at risk. But in reality, we see allegations (and even proven histories) of domestic/child abuse being minimised, dismissed and disbelieved. They are seen as inconvenient, a barrier to making orders for shared parenting.</p> <p>I have to add here that within the family law system, there <em>are </em>judges that prioritise child safety, and family report writers who provided nuanced assessments of families. If you\u2019re leaving domestic abuse and entering the family law court, you may be lucky enough to get a judge and a report writer who believe you, and act to protect your children. But for too many families, that is not the case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62aa827e4ac14fd23bc104127346a32dba9271ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62aa827e4ac14fd23bc104127346a32dba9271ba/0_34_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian author Jess Hill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jess Hill, the author of See What You Made Me Do.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yaya Stempler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The standard operating procedure in so many of these cases can beggar belief. It is truly bizarre, for example, to see judges reject evidence from counsellors and doctors that corroborates the disclosure of a child or the testimony of their parents. Parents who apply for a no-contact order \u2013 even when they can prove a history of domestic abuse \u2013 are routinely warned by their own lawyers that unless they allow some contact, they may lose custody altogether. As Zita Adut Deng Ngor, CEO of Women\u2019s Legal Services South Australia, says: \u201cIt is always a delicate balancing act in terms of how far you push the issue of domestic and family violence. It can actually harm your client, if you push too hard with the wrong judicial officer.\u201d<em> </em>What does that say about how the system responds to the parenting risks associated with domestic abuse?</p> <h2><strong>What would be the most effective result of the family law inquiry to ensure the safety of children?</strong></h2> <p>Honestly, I don\u2019t know what it would take to reform the family law system. Policy changes alone won\u2019t fix it \u2013 this is a cultural problem that is throughout the family law system. Even if the government follows the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendation to revoke the presumption of shared parental responsibility, that in itself won\u2019t change the minds of experts and judges who routinely minimise the impact of domestic abuse and disbelieve victims and their children. The Gillard government made significant changes to the Family Law Act in an attempt to reprioritise children\u2019s safety, but we keep seeing the same old stories repeating. Child makes disclosure, child is disbelieved, protective parent fights to limit the abusive parent\u2019s access, and they either end up losing custody altogether or being coerced to agree to shared parenting arrangements that are unsafe for them and their children.</p> <p>Ultimately, it may be that the recommendation from the law reform commission \u2013 to abolish the federal family law courts and replace it with specialist state-based family courts, which would be better connected with state-based child protection agencies \u2013 is the only way to truly change the culture of family law in this country.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit <a href=\"https://www.1800respect.org.au/\">1800RESPECT.org.au</a>.

  "<h2>What is a pandemic?</h2> \n<p>Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of a disease, but is instead associated with concerns over its geographic spread. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations.</p> \n<h2>How does the WHO decide whether to call it a pandemic?</h2> \n<p>Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in a foreign country and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the \u201cindex case\u201d, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community.</p> \n<p>Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that.</p> \n<p>An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community.</p> \n<h2>When is a pandemic declared?</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met. For example, the Sars coronavirus, identified in 2003, was not declared a pandemic by the WHO despite affecting 26 countries. However, its spread was contained quickly, and only a handful of nations were significantly affected, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada.</p> \n<p>If declaring a pandemic triggers global panic, this can defeat the purpose of trying to raise awareness. Much <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-1754.2010.01912.x\">has been written</a> about whether <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/article/MED/21734768\">the declaration of H1N1</a>, colloquially known as \u201cswine flu\u201d, as a pandemic in 2009, caused unnecessary panic, overwhelming emergency departments and causing governments to overspend on antiviral medications. Coronavirus symptoms are generally mild and most people recover within six days.</p> \n<h2>Now the WHO has declared Covid-19 a pandemic, what will it mean for the way the outbreak is treated and prepared for?</h2> \n<p>The WHO has stressed that using the word \u201cpandemic\u201d does not signal a change in its advice. It is still urging countries to \u201cdetect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise their people\u201d.</p> \n<p>Dr Nathalie MacDermott, National Institute for Health Research academic clinical lecturer King\u2019s College London, says: \u201cThe change of term does not alter anything practically as the world has been advised for the last few weeks to prepare for a potential pandemic, which has hopefully been taken seriously by all countries.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe use of this term however highlights the importance of countries throughout the world working cooperatively and openly with one another and coming together as a united front in our efforts to bring this situation under control.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Speaking to parliament in 1855 as the carnage of the Crimean war grew, the radical MP John Bright produced an <a href=\"https://www.cobdencentre.org/2010/08/the-angel-of-death-has-been-abroad/\" title=\"\">imperishable image</a>. \u201cThe angel of death has been abroad throughout the land, you may almost hear the beating of his wings.\u201d</p> <p>Death\u2019s wings are beating countless millions towards the world of the sick today. You may enter full of confidence. You may think good health is like a car, and a hospital is a garage where you can park your malfunctioning body for the professionals to fix. Your confidence comes from the luck of living in an advanced scientific society with history\u2019s longest life expectancy and highest living standards. The world of the sick teaches you to dispense with certainties. You discover that your condition, or in my case the condition of someone you love, which seemed a temporary malfunction, is incurable or is possibly incurable, for no one really knows.</p> <p>Only the unlucky think about luck. Lucky people can fail to realise that luck exists. They think they have succeeded on merit, or they have thrived because of their good character or lovable personality. As comfortable people, they revolt against the thought that their comfort can ever end and their lives are contingent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wonder if our leaders realise how frightened people look to the state</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You saw them out in force at the start of this crisis, although their number is falling by the hour. Bluff voices boomed that coronavirus was no worse than winter flu. We had any number of scare stories about BSE, the millennium bug and Sars in the past. They turned out to be nonsense, didn\u2019t they? Keep calm and carry on. Go to races, go to the pub. It\u2019s just politicians trying to frighten us into giving them more power. Like the global heating deniers they resemble, they live so unthinkingly with the material benefits science and technology have brought that they have come to believe they can ignore science that inconveniences them.</p> <p>At a subconscious level, I suspect they make the calculation that it will not matter if they\u2019re wrong. The experts they disparage will find a way through with some clever technology or invention. They have yet to learn that the greatest divide is not between rich and poor, but between the healthy and the sick. They will learn one day for this is the divide everyone crosses in the end.</p> <p>Luck obsesses the world of the sick, which is just another way of saying that death obsesses us. Our doctors talk of probabilities. They don\u2019t know why a treatment helps one person live a reasonable life but not another. There\u2019s X chance you will get through this. There is Y chance that you will have Z more years of life. What you assumed to be the precise discipline of medicine blurs on close inspection into educated guesses. Just as victims of violent crime wonder what would have happened if they had not passed that pub, or the children of a parent who died young wonders how they would have turned out if their family had not fallen apart, so the world of the sick is a world of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d.</p> <p>Everyone is asking what if now. A virus without a vaccine, which proliferates undetected, and, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war\" title=\"\">experience of northern Italy</a> shows, can overwhelm the health services of even prosperous countries, makes it the only question to ask. Maybe infection will feel no worse than a cold. Maybe you will find that only the old will die, and you won\u2019t pass it on to kill an innocent stranger or someone you love. And if you are old, maybe it won\u2019t kill you. I don\u2019t often say this, but I feel sorry for a government having to deal with so many maybes.</p> <p>Having lived on the edge of the world of the sick for a decade, however, I wonder if our leaders realise how frightened people look to the state. Every crisis of the 21st century has proved the state\u2019s centrality. After the 9/11 attacks, dealers ran away from danger, fire officers ran towards it. Central banks and governments were the only institutions that could bail out the world economy after the banking crisis of 2008. Today, the state\u2019s strategies are our obsession. I am not saying the private sector and charities are irrelevant; tech firms and supermarkets may play a sizeable role in getting us through. I\u2019m simply saying that if you are sick and facing the prospect of death, the state is the only institution with the means and responsibility to help you.</p> <p>What else is there? Alternative health quacks are <a href=\"https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/march-2020/misinformation-alternative-medicine-and-the-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">exploiting public fears</a>, but only the desperate rely on them \u2013 and they will soon realise their mistake. Religion may comfort a few. But in Europe most agree with Philip Larkin\u2019s dismissal of faith in <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48422/aubade-56d229a6e2f07\" title=\"\">Aubade</a>, his great poem on the fear of death:</p> <p><em>No trick dispels. Religion used to try,</em></p> <p><em>That vast moth-eaten musical brocade </em></p> <p><em>Created to pretend we never die\u2026 </em></p> <p>The deaths of thousands may bring down administrations but they will not change the reliance on state institutions. Indeed, the crisis is showing that we need greater state action. Givingemployment rights and generous sick pay to insecure workers too frightened and too poor to take time off is more than common decency now. It is a matter of national security. My Italian friends say that, even in a country where suspicion of government is imbibed from childhood, 80% back the government\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/italy-covid19-coronavirus-death-toll-1000-lockdown-12533702\" title=\"\">lock down the country</a>. They support it because \u201cwe\u2019re so frightened\u201d.</p> <p>The British government believes we are still the country of last month\u2019s booming bluffers. It fears that, if it orders lockdowns now, fatigue will set in and the public will be breaking the curfews as the illness peaks. Perhaps it has more freedom than it imagines. Last month is another age, and the first thing everyone in the world of the sick learns is to put up with anything that might help them.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s dramatic announcement this week that the US would restrict most travel from Europe caused chaos and confusion at airports, shocked the stock market and took lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic by surprise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">Why has coronavirus testing in the US been such a disaster?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What it didn\u2019t do, according to experts, was help abate the spread of coronavirus in the US.</p> <p>Although epidemiologists are still learning which strategies work best to contain the spread of coronavirus, preliminary research on Covid-19, as well as studies on the spread of other infectious diseases, suggest that travel restrictions, if implemented early, can slightly slow outbreaks.</p> <p>However, public health experts say that once a disease has begun circulating within a community, banning outsiders is mostly futile.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, travel bans sound good,\u201d said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s TH Chan School of Public Health. \u201cBut we\u2019re way past the point where simply restricting travel is a reasonable response.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, the US restrictions \u2013 which initially applied to EU nations and which have now been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-unemployment-testing\">extended to the UK and Ireland</a> \u2013 ban most foreign nationals from entering the US but do not bar American citizens, permanent residents or many of their family members.</p> <p>That \u2013 is a \u201cprofoundly strange\u201d policy in the face of a global pandemic, Hanage said.</p> <p>\u201cAn Italian who\u2019s living in Italy, and a French person who\u2019s living in Italy \u2013 and an American \u2013 could all be just as likely to carry the virus,\u201d noted Danielle Ompad, an epidemiologist at New York University. \u201cThe ban that Trump announced, it\u2019s focused a little more on nationality and not exposure.\u201d</p> <p>Strict travel restrictions could theoretically delay the spread of disease, if not reduce the number of people who become infected, allowing hospitals and other healthcare facilities to better tend to patients, Ompad said. But evidence suggests that the restrictions only work if used strategically, in conjunction with other containment measures.</p> <p>But \u201cour response to this pandemic has been late, and our response has been inconsistent,\u201d Ompad said. Notably, the US isn\u2019t able to test most people who enter the country, let alone those living within its borders due to ongoing shortages of test kits. Although the administration announced plans to screen many passengers arriving at American airports, some infected patients show no signs of illness, so checking symptoms won\u2019t stop citizens or visitors from passing on the infection.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure a travel ban is the best use of resources right now,\u201d Ompad said. \u201cRegardless of travel restrictions, the number of cases is going to increase, probably dramatically, in the next week or two.\u201d</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">reported</a> more than 1,500 cases in the US as of Friday evening. But Congress\u2019 in-house physician reportedly told staffers to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/congressional-physician-predicts-75-150-million-us-coronavirus-cases-fec69e77-1515-4fbc-8340-c53b65c22c53.html\">eventually expect</a> 70m to 150m.</p> <p>Both Italy and China have adopted stringent travel restrictions, but to little avail, multiple epidemiologists pointed out. Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China, but it remains amongst the worst affected.</p> <p>In China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/05/science.aba9757/tab-figures-data\">published</a> in Science.</p> <p>Researchers used computer simulations to capture the impact of restricting movement, found that the ban delayed the progression of the outbreak in China by only three to five days. The coronavirus had already made its way to other major Chinese cities by the time the restrictions were put in place.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the travel ban there certainly didn\u2019t stop the spread of disease from China to all over the planet,\u201d said Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, Gainesville and a co-author of the study.</p> <p>Longini\u2019s team is the process of calculating the effect of the US\u2019s travel restrictions. \u201cBut we think we already know what the results will be,\u201d he said.</p> <p>From a historical perspective, there\u2019s little evidence that travel restrictions have been effective in stemming previous epidemics.</p> <p>\u201cIn ancient Rome when they would have epidemics just burning through the city, they would often lock the gates to not allow anybody else to come in,\u201d said John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cBut the problem was it was already inside and spreading in the city.\u201d</p> <p>Gates and walls didn\u2019t spare the Romans from a plague, and locked borders don\u2019t seem to have helped much since. Closed borders during the Spanish flu <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181023-the-places-that-escaped-the-spanish-flu\">outbreak</a> in 1918 and 1919, did protect some areas, but also blocked supplies from reaching others.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.wmpllc.org/ojs/index.php/jem/article/view/2688\">study</a> published last month in the Journal of Emergency Management<em>, </em>researchers attempted to review the effectiveness of travel bans in decreasing the spread of Ebola, Sars, Mers and the Zika virus \u2013 and found that they were only effective in the short term.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, modes and routes of transmission are different for different diseases,\u201d said Nicole Errett, an expert on public health emergency preparedness at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health who led the study. \u201cBut there\u2019s just not a lot of evidence that travel bans will eliminate risk of disease.\u201d</p> <p>If at best a travel ban may be futile, at worst - it could be harmful. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea the problem is out there, not here,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cIt perpetuates the idea that somehow, we might dodge this.\u201d</p> <p>Travel bans can and have cause huge disruptions to people\u2019s personal and family lives, and they also fuel racism. There are economic consequences, too, affecting not only those who work for airlines and airports but also those who depend on travel for their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cTravel bans are generally more unhelpful than helpful, and there are so many more important things that could be being done,\u201d said Hanage. \u201cAnd yet, instead we\u2019re talking about this.

She wants the rest of us to understand, she says, because it really matters, perhaps more than it\u2019s ever mattered (of which more later). Her mission to break open the mystery of how it feels to be autistic has already been impressively successful: last year she won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">Spectrum </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">art </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">prize</a> for her video piece <em>How </em><em>To </em><em>Be Autistic</em> and recently she wrote a book of the same name. Her hope is that, by opening up about her own journey through childhood, school and adolescence, she can change other people\u2019s perceptions and expectations about what autism is like, from the inside.</p> <p>We are talking in the sitting room of the semi-detached house overlooking a Suffolk field that Poe shares with three generations of her family.

Astonishingly, it wasn\u2019t until she was 21 that she received a diagnosis of autism. The reason, she says, is simple \u2013 society looks for autism in boys, not girls, and the way it presents means that boys are more likely to be identified with it. \u201cAutistic children are often quiet and obedient when they\u2019re very young \u2013 and if you\u2019re a girl, that\u2019s not unusual.

My brother is a doctor and I think he spent one day on it in his entire time at medical school.\u201d</p> <p>There are so many misunderstandings, she says. To take just one, autistic people are <em>not</em> unable to empathise. \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing, but people with autism get what others are feeling to a huge degree. It overwhelms us \u2013 that\u2019s why we often don\u2019t know how to respond, how to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>One focus of her difficulties, for several years, was her teeth. From the time they began to wobble she was unable to brush them. She\u2019s not sure why she found the loss of her milk teeth so disturbing, but she speculates that it may have been because \u201cautistic people are extremely sensitive to sensation, to change, to pain\u201d. The net result: \u201cI went through the entirety of first school and half of middle school with a mouth full of disgusting, stinking plaque.\u201d Although her teeth are fine now, she tries not to show them when she\u2019s talking or smiling.</p> <p>Having terrible teeth was one of the many things that made Poe stick out as different. She also had a tendency to vomit in public when her anxiety became too much to cope with (she ended up carrying a sick bowl around with her wherever she went, just in case). She was a picky eater and was unable to eat even a packed lunch at school \u2013 and she spent more and more time on her own in her bedroom.</p> <p>Academically she did well, although once homework got serious she found it increasingly difficult to tackle (\u201cThat\u2019s called executive dysfunction \u2013 you know you should do something, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to do it\u201d) and that led to her being seen as difficult.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t have the same filter and that makes us powerful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, she started playing up to her profile. \u201cYou think, if I\u2019m going to be seen as this, then it might help to just be it.\u201d But as things would turn out, it was embracing her sense of \u201cotherness\u201d that led to a way forward, and gradually, being \u201cdifferent\u201d became something she celebrated, rather than hid.</p> <p>She turned her attention to something she says is deeply ingrained in the autistic psyche \u2013 fandom. From <em>Harry Potter</em> to <em>Captain America</em>, she became a groupie, attending conventions and dressing up as her favourite characters. It felt like a liberation. \u201cFandom conventions are full of people with autism,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re somewhere we can be unashamedly who we are.\u201d That\u2019s because hyperfixation, she says, is both the best and the worst thing about being autistic. \u201cYou become very fixated on something \u2013 it\u2019s very helpful when you\u2019re working on a project, like writing a book for example, because you can write 20,000 words in a day. But it has very negative connotations for others \u2013 people who are over-enthusiastic about stuff are written off as \u201cautistic\u201d \u2013 and that devalues your opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Today Poe looks as different as she feels. Her arms and legs are covered in tattoos and, on the day I meet her, her hair is dyed blonde with hues of light pink and pale blue. Being autistic still limits her life \u2013 agoraphobia means she only manages to leave the house once or twice a month, and she has to take tranquillisers first \u2013 but stumbling on the existence of the Spectrum art prize for people with autism, and then making the winning video, changed her life.</p> <p>She\u2019d like to become a fiction writer, and is currently working on her first novel \u2013 but she\u2019s also committed to telling it like it is about autism. And that matters because, she says, autistic people, once diagnosed and understood, have great potential \u2013 they\u2019re often very effective individuals who can make a noise and a difference. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same filter as neurotypical people and that can make us powerful and strong,\u201d she says. \u201cLook at the environmental campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a>, for example.\u201d</p> <p>And there\u2019s more, she says, because we live in a time when people who are \u201cother\u201d are increasingly dismissed, cut out of the action \u2013 and those with autism, who naturally identify as outsiders, can be effective champions for all outsiders. \u201cWe really get what it means to not fit in. And with the rise of populist politics and an insular society, at a time when the notion of \u2018us versus them\u2019 is increasingly common, people with autism have really important viewpoints and experiences to share.\u201d</p> <p>Her most important point, though, is also her simplest. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like people to take away from my experience, that would help others with autism, it\u2019s this: be kind,\u201d she says. \u201cKindness is underrated. You don\u2019t need to know their story, you just need to think about being friendly and helping, rather than deciding they\u2019re strange or worthless and moving on fast. A little bit of kindness can make the world of a difference to someone who\u2019s struggling.\u201d</p> <p><em>How to be Autistic by Charlotte Amelia Poe </em><em> (Myriad Editions, \u00a38.99) is available for \u00a37.55 from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-be-autistic-9781912408320.html\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a></em></p>",

Its leaders have been willing to try something new and now they are starting to see the results.\u201d</p> <p>Dennett said Salford had invested millions in green infrastructure and had embraced the decarbonisation agenda long before it was in vogue. \u201cOur carbon management programme was put in place in 2009 and has helped to save 14,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd 60% of Salford is now green space.\u201d</p> <p>According to the study, the least sustainable area in England and Wales is Stockton-on-Tees in the north-east.

  "<p>Europe\u2019s economy was meant to have a decent year in 2020. Factory production in the 19-country eurozone rose strongly in January, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/15/amazing-deal-or-capitulation-why-the-us-china-trade-truce-may-not-last\" title=\"\">a tentative truce in the US-China trade war</a>. Consumer confidence was strong. Housebuilders\u2019 order books were full.</p> <p>The stage was set for a solid, albeit unspectacular year. The European economy would see \u201csteady and moderate growth\u201d, predicted the European commission\u2019s economic forecast on 13 February. It also warned of clouds on the horizon, including a new virus. Noting mounting concern about coronavirus, as well as \u201cdownside\u201d risks, the Brussels forecast concluded the outbreak would peak in the first three months of the year, with \u201crelatively limited global spillovers\u201d.</p> <p>That was then. One month later the global economy is heading for recession, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/markets-rebound-after-worst-day-since-1987-amid-coronavirus-panic-ftse-100-dow-jones-wall-street\" title=\"\">markets have taken a hammering</a>, investors are panicking. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/european-countries-take-radical-steps-to-combat-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Across the continent</a>, shops, restaurants and bars are shuttered, supply chains frozen, football matches cancelled, theatres, cinemas and hairdressers closed. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index had its worst-ever day on Thursday, plunging 11.5%, after a blunt message from the European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\" title=\"\">it was the job of governments \u2013 not the ECB \u2013 to protect indebted countries</a>.</p> <p>The head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described the pandemic as \u201ca major shock\u201d to Europe\u2019s economies, as she promised a \u20ac37bn (\u00a333bn) fund to handle the fallout.</p> <p>Attention is turning to eurozone finance ministers, who will meet on Monday, after the ECB disappointed markets by declining to cut interest rates as part of a stimulus package announced last week.</p> <p>Having fumbled the eurozone debt crisis, can EU leaders now protect their economies from the worst pandemic in more than 100 years?</p> <p>Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, is heading for rocky times. \u201cItaly has gone through many crises, unfortunately,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe problem is that, coming from all these crises in the past, the Italian government is weak right now and the public finances situation is even more fragile, so it\u2019s particularly dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>He is forecasting a 3.1% slump in economic output in 2020, or even 6.5% in a worst-case scenario \u2013 \u201cgiven how the situation is unfolding, [the latter] might become the baseline scenario pretty soon\u201d. The Italian government, which has said it is ready to spend \u20ac25bn to protect its economy from the fallout, has chided other Europeans for \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbour\u201d policies, such as Germany\u2019s export ban on surgical masks.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s banks are in a healthier position than 2011, when they were creaking under bad loans, but things could still turn nasty. To avoid a return to the \u201cdoom loop\u201d \u2013 where potential bank failure risks the bankruptcy of the state \u2013 Codogno is advocating support for Italy in the form of an EU precautionary credit line. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"600056639d10b69e28971f96d0aa4b39dbee14f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/600056639d10b69e28971f96d0aa4b39dbee14f5/0_143_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disinfection in process outside the Centrale railway station in Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disinfection in process outside the Centrale train station in Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Furlan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In France, the next-worst-affected European country, the government is warning of \u201csevere\u201d consequences for the economy. The outbreak is another blow, after a wave of strikes in 2019 chipped away at economic growth. France\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecast for the first quarter to 0.1%, down from a previous estimate of 0.3%, warning of a \u201csevere but temporary\u201d slowdown.</p> <p>Germany is not as badly affected by the virus as Italy or France, but its export-led economy was the first to feel the chill of China\u2019s slowdown. A survey for the ifo Institut last week revealed that 56% of German companies had reported \u201cnegative effects\u201d, with a 44% slump in demand and 52% of manufacturers saying they were experiencing difficulties with supply. In response to the pressure on the economy, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, even suggested that she was ready to reverse the rule of maintaining a balanced budget \u2013 the black zero or <em>schwarze Null</em> \u2013 that has proved an unbreakable political orthodoxy for the government in recent years.</p> <p>Speaking before the German government announced \u201cunlimited\u201d credit to keep companies afloat, the influential president of the ifo, Clemens Fuest, said that Berlin was \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d. He supports a temporary relaxation of the <em>schwarze Null</em>, noting that<em> \u201c</em>the black zero was a very good policy in good times, but it shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of taking decisive measures\u201d.</p> <p>The German economist thinks EU measures need to be similarly targeted and \u201cwe have not reached that point\u201d of needing precautionary credit lines for indebted countries.</p> <p>The coronavirus fallout is likely to be uneven. \u201cThe producers of toilet paper don\u2019t have a recession at all, and the restaurants and hotels have a very deep one,\u201d said Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, based in Berlin. Manufacturers, he said, have more hope of a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery \u2013 that is, an economic bounce-back as rapid as the descent \u2013 because they will benefit from pent-up demand.</p> <p>Odendahl observed: \u201cIf you want to buy glasses now but you can\u2019t because of supply chain disruptions, you will do so later, whereas a restaurant or a trip you just have to cancel.\u201d For that reason, he thinks Germany could see a more rapid rebound compared with countries more reliant on tourism, such as Spain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f13d00a12e2c5a1916d591c1ece1355be90fb6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f13d00a12e2c5a1916d591c1ece1355be90fb6f/0_380_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An opera is performed to an empty auditorium in Berlin, where all theatres are closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An opera is performed to an empty auditorium in Berlin, where all theatres are closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Adamik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that should not stop European policymakers from taking \u201cbold\u201d action, Odendahl said. All companies \u201cneed liquidity help to make sure they survive this long pause of economic activity intact\u201d. He also wants to see a European approach to help indebted countries: \u201cIf there was a time for risk-sharing, then this would be it. This is a situation where there is no moral hazard.\u201d Here he is referring to the debate that raged during the eurozone debt crisis, when creditor countries declined to pool risk for fear of \u201crewarding\u201d debtors.</p> <p>M\u00e1rio Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup \u2013 made up of the finance ministers of the eurozone \u2013 said that his members would come up with \u201ca very large policy response\u201d to address the crisis \u2013 greater than the \u20ac27bn Lagarde suggested was needed. Centeno expects ministers to agree fiscal measures that will ensure liquidity for companies, support unemployment benefits and help reduce hours for workers.</p> <p>But it is not clear whether these measures add up to the \u201cmassive\u201d economic stimulus plan that France is looking for \u2013 a measure EU leaders failed to agree to on a telephone conference summit last week.</p> <p>Pascal Canfin, a French MEP and ally of President Emmanuel Macron, has called for a \u201cEuropean stimulus package\u201d to be announced by the EU leaders\u2019 summit at the end of this month (26-27 March). Canfin, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment and public health committee, argues that this package must be aligned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\" title=\"\">the European Green Deal</a>, a plan to transform the economy to meet the demands of the climate emergency.</p> <p>In addition to using flexibilities in EU budget rules, the MEP said that a European stimulus package agreed on 27 March \u201cwould be a real answer to the problem right on the scale and right on the time\u201d. It would \u201cmake sure the green deal is alive\u201d, with spending to promote electric vehicles and energy-efficient housing.</p> <p>But some EU countries think it\u2019s premature to discuss this kind of stimulus. The European commission\u2019s vice-president in charge of the economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, has sounded a cautious note: \u201cIn current circumstances, I wouldn\u2019t be talking so much about fiscal stimulus, rather about crisis response.\u201d</p>",

The site is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/worlds-biggest-porn-site-under-fire-over-videos-pornhub\">currently facing serious allegations</a> of profiting from videos of rape and sexual abuse. Almost half a million people have signed <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/shut-down-pornhub-and-hold-its-executives-accountable-for-aiding-trafficking\">an online petition</a>, started by a group called Exodus Cry in the US, demanding that Pornhub be shut down and its executives held accountable for sex trafficking.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a company that is generating millions in advertising and membership revenue and yet they do not have an effective system in place to verify reliably the age or consent of those featured in the pornographic content it hosts,\u201d the Exodus Cry founder said.</p> <p>Pornhub vehemently disagrees. In a recent statement to the Guardian, the company said it \u201chas a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate\u201d.</p> <p>There have been rather a lot of suggestions otherwise. Kate Isaacs, the founder of Not Your Porn campaign, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/pornhub-needs-to-change-or-shut-down\">recently wrote a Guardian op-ed</a> detailing how she\u2019d worked with \u201c50 women who were turned into \u2018porn stars\u2019 without their permission\u201d. Isaacs notes that some of these women were under 18 \u201cwhen videos of them were posted on Pornhub without their consent\u201d. It took Pornhub weeks to get a video of one of Isaacs\u2019 friends removed; \u201cWhen one video had been removed, an identical video with her full name attached would pop back up again.\u201d</p> <p>Pornhub claims that it is simple for victims of non-consensual porn to request that videos be removed from its website; flagged videos are then \u201cfingerprinted\u201d to prevent future uploads. A <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9393zp/how-pornhub-moderation-works-girls-do-porn\">recent investigation by Motherboard</a> (part of Vice), however, found that this system can be easily circumvented.

However, figures released from the country\u2019s national health commission reveal that the number of cases brought in from abroad has exceeded those infected domestically for the first time, indicating that China\u2019s role in the crisis may be diminishing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The World Health Organization questions UK response</h2> \n<p>The WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, has cast doubt on the UK\u2019s decision to take a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">herd immunity response</a> to the coronavirus outbreak.

The airline said it was contacting customers who were planning to travel, or currently doing so, amid reports some flights in transit had been turned around mid-air.</p> \n<h2>India counts coronavirus as a notified disaster</h2> \n<p>This step will enable the country to take greater steps to combat the spread of coronavirus, including drawing on the state disaster response fund.

  "<p>Few figures in Formula One emerged with any great credit as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/formula-one-australian-grand-prix-melbourne-coronavirus\" title=\"\">the season opener fell apart in Melbourne</a>. Coronavirus, as had seemed inevitable, simply proved an implacable force against which the sport\u2019s attempt to pretend it was business as usual was left looking impotent and foolhardy. Throughout the process the major players had all been toeing the party line, but one had the backbone to articulate what many were thinking.

The atmosphere is superb as the city embraces teams, media and fans. The sheer pleasure felt in returning to racing after the close season is palpable. This time, it was altogether different.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/australian-grand-prix-formula-one-mismanagement-coronavirus\">Formula One brought to its knees by pandemic and mismanagement | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At best subdued, at worst there was a sense of foreboding. It was two-fold. There was disquiet that with the paddock such a tightly knit community \u2013 hundreds of people working in close proximity \u2013 should, as seemed plausible, the virus have travelled with them it could spread exponentially. Of greater concern, though, was the fear F1 would have brought the infection from Europe and that, at an event attracting up to 100,000 people a day, the sport would be responsible for giving the virus a real grip in Melbourne and Australia.</p> <p>The idea of an explosion of cases in the city in the weeks following the sport\u2019s departure was frequently discussed but not by the principal protagonists of F1. The stance taken by every driver was uniformly similar. George Russell of Williams even referred to it as the corporate line. They were, they all parroted, taking their cue from F1 and the FIA. They trusted the governing bodies: to ensure everyone\u2019s safety, to use experts to make the right decisions, and that hence F1 and the FIA were in the position to make the right call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f349df717c087229cf3b1d715bbc22fd01539cc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f349df717c087229cf3b1d715bbc22fd01539cc0/0_291_5634_3382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Australian Grand Prix was cancelled on Friday, hours before the first practice session was set to begin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Australian GP was cancelled on Friday, hours before the first practice session was set to begin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a banal enough abdication of responsibility at the best of times, such as over controversial decisions on regulations. When it came to a public health threat that was claiming lives around the world and F1 being in a position potentially to increase that suffering, it seemed extraordinary, almost a denial of basic human empathy in favour of swallowing the platitudes the sport was telling everyone and of which it had falsely convinced itself.</p> <p>On Thursday, expectations that anyone would stray from the orthodoxy were low. Hamilton, however, thankfully retains a genuinely independent spirit. He alienates some with his lifestyle, his embrace of music and fashion, the jetsetting and his forthright opinions from veganism to climate change, but he has always spoken from the heart. Now, as a six-times world champion and the only truly global star of the show, he can say whatever he likes. To Hamilton if there was a corporate line, it was at best a suggestion, at worst possibly something he rightly identified as so absurd he felt the need to speak out against it.</p> <p>When asked his opinion why the race was going ahead he was caustic. \u201cCash is king,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t add much more to it.

  "<p>Joe Root has outlined how the decision to abandon England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka was driven more by the unsettling effect of the coronavirus pandemic on his squad than the advice of the experts.</p> <p>As sporting events around the globe were cancelled in swift succession on Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cricket fell into line</a> to the relief of the England players. The immediate risk may have been minimal since there have been three confirmed cases in Sri Lanka, though that risk may have escalated with the arrival of 3,000 English fans, heading for Galle for the first Test, which was scheduled to start on Thursday.</p> <p>Root was refreshingly candid with PA Media news agency before his flight back to the UK. \u201cThere was an element of relief,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right decision has been made. You could see looking at the players that their minds were elsewhere thinking about people back home. Now that we can go and look after families and be with loved ones that\u2019s put a lot of guys at ease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\">England cricket tour of Sri Lanka called off due to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNaturally there was a lot of talk in the dressing room and it got to a stage where it overshadowed the cricket. Looking at how quickly things have happened at home, you\u2019re thinking about family and friends who might be a bit more vulnerable and that\u2019s hard when you\u2019re a long way away. It was clear it was getting in the way of performance and affecting the mental wellbeing of the guys.\u201d</p> <p>There were also concerns within the squad about the implications of testing positive and the subsequent necessity of being put into quarantine away from the team environment. The idea of being stranded a long way from home is currently unappealing to all travellers and England cricketers were no exception.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a number of different scenarios we could have found ourselves in that were pretty scary to be honest,\u201d Root said. \u201cYou think how things might have gone \u2013 being in isolation here, disconnected from the team, without the security we would usually have around us at the ground or the hotel. If one of the lads was to get it in these conditions, or a member of the public travelling, it could be quite a scary experience.\u201d</p> <p>So the team heads home after a bizarre few months. In South Africa, the squad was hindered by a virulent bug at the start of the tour but in the end they prevailed. But there was no way this virus could be defeated.</p> <p>Root has no better idea than anyone else when the team will reconvene. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll play again. I suppose you can\u2019t have mass gatherings so there won\u2019t be many training camps. I\u2019m sure over the coming weeks we\u2019ll prepare and do everything we can to be as ready as possible but until we know more it\u2019s just a case of common sense.

Even in a normal year, the vet team\u2019s work caring for the zoo\u2019s animals and treating some of the country\u2019s wild creatures is more serious than that, but 2019 was \u201cmonumental\u201d, he says.</p> <p>The respiratory disease aspergillosis began to spread through the endangered k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d population last April, threatening to reverse the gains of the bird\u2019s most successful breeding season in living memory.</p> <p>K\u0101k\u0101po are not just rare, they are also deeply weird: flightless, nocturnal, with fragrant feathers and a comical waddling run.

It was found to have aspergillosis, a brutal infection in which lumps of fungus form in the birds\u2019 lungs and slowly choke them to death.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to diagnose, extremely hard to treat, and usually fatal, particularly in wild birds. You usually just find them dead,\u201d says Chatterton. The disease had only ever been seen in one k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d before. \u201cWe thought it was going to be a one-off.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks later two more chicks died. Then two adult females became ill and had to be put down. \u201cWe thought: \u2018Something very unusual is going on.\u2019 You\u2019re dealing with a lot of unknowns.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ca2fbfbf0c1ba1fe859710f015d56772c3dba08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ca2fbfbf0c1ba1fe859710f015d56772c3dba08/0_0_3000_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d patients needed several months of treatment before being returned to the wild.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d patients needed several months of treatment before being returned to the wild.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Hosking</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With aspergillosis, by the time a wild bird begins to display symptoms \u2013 or anything unusual shows up in blood tests \u2013 it is usually too late to save them. The only way to diagnose the disease in time is using a CT scan or endoscopy to spot fungal growths in the lungs.</p> <p>The vets and DOC scientists began mapping which k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d had shared a nest with the sick birds and which had been on the same food run. The 12 deemed at highest risk were evacuated from their home, Codfish Island/Whenua Hou, and taken by helicopter to Auckland.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the city\u2019s veterinary CT scanner was being replaced and was out of action for a crucial five weeks, so the vets took the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d to one of the city\u2019s human hospitals. Though they appeared completely healthy, all 12 were found to have lesions on their lungs.</p> <p>That was a stomach-dropping moment, says k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d scientist Andrew Digby, who was based on Whenua Hou at the time. \u201cWe were beginning to think it could possibly have affected the whole island \u2026 When you\u2019re working with a threatened species, that\u2019s always the biggest fear. They could go extinct at any point. We could lose half the population quite easily in a disease outbreak and set the programme back decades.\u201d</p> <p>Aspergillosis can be treated with oral anti-fungal drugs if you catch it early enough. \u201cIt\u2019s worked really well with other parrots, but each new species you try needs a different dose,\u201d says Chatterton. \u201cWe had birds dying, so we went with a high dose, but worried that in saving some we might kill some.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fdf4aea03d9c9c8164fc482090150c6e004b918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fdf4aea03d9c9c8164fc482090150c6e004b918/0_0_3000_2143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d in care at the zoo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d in care at the zoo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Hosking</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To get the drugs into the birds\u2019 air sacs, the vets also needed to use a nebuliser. K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d may be the world\u2019s fattest parrot, but their airways are still too small for the droplets produced by an adult human nebuliser, so Chatterton tried a paediatric one. It worked \u2013 but New Zealand is a small country, and initially only two were available.</p> <p>Meanwhile, more at-risk birds were being flown in from the island.</p> <p>\u201cWe peaked at 19 birds in the hospital, each being nebulised for 30 minutes, twice a day, with only two nebulisers. We had to do weekly bloods to make sure we weren\u2019t killing them with liver damage from the drugs, and we had 19 birds that needed feeding twice a day and cleaning.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d13a2c3a528b5de51c2562df89a5470dd90b35b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d13a2c3a528b5de51c2562df89a5470dd90b35b/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Checking the patient\u2019s weight\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Checking the patient\u2019s weight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Hosking</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Volunteer vets arrived to help from around the world. Extra pens were built to house the birds. People brought in sheets and duvets from home to cover the floors, and these had to be washed every day.

Chatterton worked every day for five weeks.</p> <p>By September, 51 k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d had been evacuated and scanned \u2013 nearly a quarter of the entire population. Of 21 infected birds, aspergillosis had taken nine \u2013 though most of the deaths occurred before the anti-fungal treatments started.</p> <p>Many birds needed months of daily care, but the outbreak was contained. Chicks became juveniles, and while a few died from other causes, most survived and are now counted in the population number: 211, up from just 123 when Chatterton arrived in New Zealand seven years ago.</p> <p>It is a much happier ending than anyone was expecting. Digby and Chatterton put the team\u2019s success down to the close attention paid to the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d during the breeding season, the detailed records kept about each bird\u2019s movements, and the connections forged between scientists and vets over the past two breeding seasons.</p> <p>\u201cThe only chance these endangered species have is if we all work together,\u201d Chatterton says.</p> <p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",
  "<h2>Lily Kuo, Beijing bureau chief</h2> <p>I have overseen our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in China, from when there were just a few cases of \u201cunknown pneumonia\u201d in Wuhan in December to the lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in late January, and most recently as Beijing has begun to declare victory over the virus, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000here.</p> <p>We have focused on big-picture questions of how this crisis has dented the Chinese government\u2019s image in the eyes of its people as well as its impact on an individual level, the human cost of the outbreak as seen through the many families who lost loved ones. We also reported on what it felt like to be in this surreal state of limbo as the country ground to a halt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/guardian-challenges-covering-coronavirus-live-blog-paper\">How the Guardian is facing the challenges of covering coronavirus | Elisabeth Ribbans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have also tried to convey through our coverage the resilience, thoughtfulness and creativity of Chinese citizens. This ranges from doctors risking their careers to speak up about cover ups in the initial stages of the outbreak to internet users outwitting censors to preserve removed information, and citizen journalists who have gone missing after trying to report from on the ground in Wuhan.</p> <p>It has been one of the most complicated, difficult and important stories I have covered. At times I worried that the voices of the people most affected were being drowned out by the news. Other times I worry about the risks to those people when we tell their stories. We are constantly weighing how to show the human side of this crisis without endangering people.</p> <p>Even as the outbreak appears to be levelling off, the toll this has taken on the country is staggering. It may still be a long time before we can fully appreciate the impact this has had on China.</p> <h2><br>Sarah Boseley, health editor</h2> <p>Fear of the coronavirus is almost as great a threat as Covid-19 itself, the disease it causes. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has talked of combating the \u201cinfodemic\u201d alongside the epidemic. The public panic is such that social media is alight with speculation, while newspaper websites run stories with sensational headlines because they attract unprecedented traffic.</p> <p>A fundamental part of my job over the last couple of months has been to sift the emerging information to discard rumour, mistakes, gossip and error. As well as writing my own stories, I am quite often asked to cast an eye over others, to make sure we are not just accurate, but calm and non-sensational. I have made three <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/04/how-to-slow-the-spread-of-coronavirus-video-explainer?CMP=share_btn_tw\">video explainers</a> and written others that have taken off in an unprecedented manner, because we try to be factual and non-scary.</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy, because there is contradictory information even from the experts. Tedros recently talked of a death rate of 3.4%. Britain\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, some days later, gave evidence to MPs that it was 1% and, in his opinion, will probably prove to be lower. Both are probably correct. Tedros was counting only the officially recorded cases of those who became sick from Chinese hospitals. Whitty took into account the far larger numbers of people we know exist but can only estimate, because they have only mild illness and don\u2019t seek treatment.</p> <p>I listen to experts like these and other scientists from leading institutes such as the Wellcome Trust and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It\u2019s also fantastically helpful that the Chinese scientists and others elsewhere are publishing papers online with immediate and public access. There is unprecedented transparency in this epidemic \u2013 although it does mean the conclusions are tentative, so we need to be careful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64df488e09dfe0ec13f93bb2aa7a3405faba87b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64df488e09dfe0ec13f93bb2aa7a3405faba87b0/0_241_3267_1959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Xi of China speaking by videolink to a hospital in Wuhan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Xi of China speaking by videolink to a hospital in Wuhan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xie Huanchi/Xinhua/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ian Sample, science editor</h2> <p>There\u2019s a Journalism School rule that\u2019s driven into the brains of all who go down that path: check, check and check again. It\u2019s important whatever the story, whatever the subject, but never more so than in an unfolding public health crisis, and coronavirus is certainly that.</p> <p>The higher stakes do change how you work. You over-check \u2013 both what you write and how it is edited down the line \u2013 because the consequences of screwing up are potentially far more serious. If you get the mass of an electron wrong, readers will swiftly let you know, and some may suggest you leave your post, but the sky won\u2019t fall in. Misinterpret a scientific paper about how coronavirus spreads and you have more to worry about than angry emails and a battering on Twitter. What is that death rate figure that scientist said? Is it the number of people who have died among the reported cases? Or is it the infection-fatality rate, the chances that an infected person will die? The difference matters.</p> <p>Interviews are less breezy these days, more laborious. You are constantly checking whether a simple phrase has a technical definition you\u2019re unaware of, or whether you have the right source and context for a number recalled over the phone. We always need good scientists to talk to us; this job is impossible without their expertise and opinions. But it is doubly important in covering the coronavirus outbreak, because it is the scientists and medical specialists who can best chart a way through this. Even if they don\u2019t always agree.</p> <h2><br>Lorenzo Tondo, Italy correspondent</h2> <p>At 9:46pm on 9 March, 2020, my life as a reporter, husband, father, brother and son radically changed. Just as Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced the entire country would be placed under lockdown in an attempt to stop the coronavirus, for the first time in my career I wasn\u2019t simply covering a crisis, I was living it alongside my family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Readers have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not have been aware of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a reporter, while my hands pecked at the keyboard, I felt the huge responsibility to inform readers in search of balanced news. On one hand I sensed the necessity to express the crude realities of the outbreak, of the thousands infected and hundreds dead; on the other, the need to explain, factually, that it was possible to stop the virus. It was a thin line between the need to inform and the obligation not to cause alarm.</p> <p>But the biggest responsibility, the most challenging task, was the emergency I found myself in as a father. It wasn\u2019t easy to explain the coronavirus outbreak to my six-year-old son, Leoluca, who won\u2019t be able to attend school or leave the house except in extreme cases. Once again I found myself having to explain the seriousness of the situation while remaining level-headed. I reminded my son of his idol, Spider-Man, and what his Uncle Ben said to him: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d \u201cYeah, dad. I know,\u201d he answered. \u201cI don\u2019t have to jump around skyscrapers. All I have to do is stay home and wash my hands well.\u201d God bless him. It was easier than I thought.</p> <h2>Angela Giuffrida, Rome correspondent</h2> <p>It seems as if a lifetime has passed since that Saturday morning in January, when I was listening to an Irish resident in Wuhan speaking to LBC as news of the coronavirus outbreak in China emerged. He was describing life under quarantine, and how you only left your home to buy essentials \u201csuch as toilet roll\u201d. The situation seemed frightening, but very remote.</p> <p>As events unfolded, I followed the coverage of my colleague, Lily Kuo, in Beijing, all the while wondering how challenging it must have been for her to report the story in China while trying to keep healthy. But again, I never anticipated being in her shoes. Within a few short weeks, I have gone from writing about Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, which was initially confined to 11 northern towns, to living it.</p> <p>Reporting on this story has been among the most challenging of my career, not least because there are still so many unknowns about coronavirus. There is a huge sense of responsibility to tell the story correctly, but with not even the experts agreeing with each other, it has been a challenge to explain at times.</p> <p>We are fortunate that Italy has been transparent with data and swift in its actions. The government took coronavirus seriously from the beginning. Every day, the chief of the civil protection authority gives journalists a regional breakdown of new cases, deaths, those recovered and hospitalised. I also have a couple of trusted scientists to call for verifications as well as a team of colleagues at Rome\u2019s foreign press association, who have been invaluable in sharing their knowledge and experiences.</p> <h2><br>Ben Quinn, reporter</h2> <p>This has been one of the fastest-moving stories for as long as I can remember as a live blogger, demanding an unusual blend of international, political and science reporting as well as crowdsourcing and data analysis.</p> <p>In a story that\u2019s truly global, the Guardian\u2019s international network also really feels like it has come into its own, with our Australian office handing over to London and copy constantly coming in from reporters everywhere.</p> <p>But the very nature of the crisis has presented particular challenges too, such as in finding the right balance between covering the global picture and then knowing when and how much to drill down into localised and personal stories, while keeping them relevant to readers in a different part of the world.</p> <p>Given that our blog has really been global-facing by default, we\u2019ve also tried to take care, for example, to frame and explain specific British developments in a way that are coherent to readers elsewhere while also ensuring that readers in the UK get the depth of detail they expect.</p> <p>Readers themselves have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not otherwise have been aware of, or providing eyewitness accounts.</p> <p>Verification is obviously essential, and we\u2019re grateful to those who\u2019ve helped make this as easy as possible. That has involved, for example, something as simple as providing photos of boarding passes to help indicate that someone really is at an airport in Milan and can speak from experience about the impact of the Italian lockdown.</p> <p>Above all, as people find themselves with an unprecedented choice of information sources, we\u2019re still trying to make sure that we remain a calm and trustworthy source for the facts they need.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The rugby authorities have an important decision to make because I look at the outcomes of this week\u2019s various disciplinary hearings and it leads me to one key question: What is more important \u2013 the health and safety of the players or the game\u2019s image? In the past few days we\u2019ve seen a three-week ban for a punch to the face, four weeks for nearly taking someone\u2019s head off, nothing for a coach calling the referee a cheat and 10 weeks for Joe Marler \u2013 an incident that looks bad but contained no malice at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/joe-marler-cited-over-grabbing-alan-wyn-jones-groin-england-wales-six-nations\">Joe Marler faces season-ending ban for grabbing Jones' groin in Wales game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is just one of many paradoxes that exist in rugby. As someone who is entrenched in the sport, I can look at the Mohamed Haouas punch and understand how the disciplinary hearing reached a verdict of three weeks because I know how these things work and I\u2019ve seen plenty of similar cases.</p> <p>The same goes for Manu Tuilagi\u2019s red card and I understand that once Marler had been cited in the way that he was, he was facing a long ban if found guilty. But that level of inconsistency is alarming and your average \u201cRugby Flirt\u201d, someone who watches a few England matches a year, will not get it at all. I remember after England beat Ireland last year, trying to explain how a pass from Henry Slade that travelled forward three metres was actually legal in a sport where the laws state you have to pass backwards.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that common sense just is not very common when it comes to disciplinary issues. The laws can be so rigid that there just isn\u2019t any breathing space for anyone trying to make sense of what has happened and it is important to remember that if players, fans and referees can all be influenced by social media then so can disciplinary officers.</p> <p>Indeed, social media means that players effectively have two trials and the social media hearing effectively determines whether an actual one takes place. Let\u2019s take the Marler incident, I can almost guarantee that 10 years ago that would not go to a hearing because it would not be clipped up and all over Twitter immediately. I also believe that the TMO would have seen it at the time but I think that sometimes the referees protect themselves from making decisions.</p> <p>In the Marler case, it was such a unique situation, imagine Ben O\u2019Keeffe being in the middle of Twickenham with 80,000 around him and trying to make sense of what has happened. You could argue that referees are paid to make those decisions but I think a fundamental point in this is just how many people\u2019s attitudes will have changed in the days since the incident happened. I would ask anyone who watched the game, what decision would they have made on the spot and has that changed over the last few days?</p> <p>It\u2019s important for me to acknowledge that I\u2019ve known Joe for nearly 20 years, but my overriding view of the matter is that I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on it one way or the other. In this day and age it seems that you either have to be outraged by what Joe did or laud him. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any middle ground any more. The social media age that we live in means you have to be at one extreme or another but with regards to this incident I\u2019m somewhere in between. I\u2019m not applauding Joe and I\u2019m not patting him on the back for it.</p> <p>He\u2019s terrific bloke, a unique character and a hugely unique sense of humour. Loads of people have appreciated that and lauded him for it but times he can overstep the mark and get it wrong. In that situation he\u2019s got it wrong but was there any malice? Any intent to hurt or harm Alun Wyn Jones? Absolutely not. In his mind he\u2019s being playful, childish, petulant \u2013 whatever you want to call it. He\u2019s brought a spark to a rugby world that is forever getting sanitised but that\u2019s not to condone in any way what he did.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard the argument that \u201cthese things happen\u201d a lot but if we want to grow the game, get to new audiences, new territories and have more eyeballs there\u2019s a greater responsibility among players. I think to say, \u201cthese things happen\u201d is a bit amateur. Those days are gone. There are a lot of things that used to happen on the rugby pitch which we would just accept but they just can\u2019t happen any more. And the authorities have decided that these things need to be in the past now. We just can\u2019t have it because we want a global reach and a diverse demographic. With the extra revenue there is an extra responsibility for your actions.</p> <p>The final point on the subject I need to make is that I find some of the abuse directed at Joe on social media has been disgraceful. Unfortunately, we live in 2020 and it does not surprise me in the slightest. But it was only a matter of weeks ago that #BeKind was trending and to me it feels like those who were outraged and disgusted then are guilty of behaving in that manner now. In Joe\u2019s case #BeKind has undoubtedly gone out the window.</p>",

  "<p>In 2014, Giles Nicholson was battling the growing year from hell. A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The machinery] wouldn\u2019t go through it,\u201d says Nicholson, recalling the overspilling verges.</p> \n<p>But the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and biodiversity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. Butterflies and other invertebrates have returned in their droves.</p> \n<p>The reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for biodiversity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council\u2019s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council\u2019s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2ef1e72beb40802c13a94f5c6b4f78b0274875\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2ef1e72beb40802c13a94f5c6b4f78b0274875/0_0_4961_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing. Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The process is simple: cut infrequently, ideally, just twice a year in spring and then late summer once plants have bloomed and seeded; remove the clippings to gradually reduce the fertility of the soil and prevent a buildup of mulch; repeat, wait, and enjoy the resurgent wildlife and flowers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will not fail,\u201d says Sterling, who, as programme manager for charity <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/\">Butterfly Conservation\u2019s</a> building sites for butterflies project, has taken his roadside revolution around the country to any local authority that will listen. \u201cAs fertility declines in a soil, biodiversity increases. At first that seems a little counterintuitive because you imagine the more you pour into a soil, the more plants that can grow. That\u2019s not how it works in the natural system. In more fertile systems, a few species dominate and they swamp and smother everything else.\u201d<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"922cbc95404f5735b0f32fd3534c1fb9df0eed9b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/922cbc95404f5735b0f32fd3534c1fb9df0eed9b/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Wildflowers on roadsides are a haven for butterflies and insects. Photograph: Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Grass cuttings are almost always left where they fall along the thousands of miles of road verges that are maintained by law in the UK. Over time, the resulting mulch increases the fertility of the soil, meaning the grass grows with increasing vigour and needs to be cut more frequently. The cut and collect method breaks the cycle.</p> \n<p>The before and after photos of otherwise ordinary roadsides across Dorset show the dramatic effects of Nicholson and Sterling\u2019s maintenance regime, as suffocated seed banks have been allowed to spring back into life. Yarrow and yellow flashes of lady\u2019s bedstraw punctuate roadsides and roundabouts throughout summer. Magenta pyramidal orchids linger outside a branch of Tesco.</p> \n<p>The cost savings of managing roadsides this way are equally stunning for the council\u2019s accounting department. The annual budget for highway verge management dropped from nearly \u00a31m to \u00a3650k in five years under the cut and collect, low fertility approach. London boroughs, councils from across the country and European governments are paying attention.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor the last 40 years we\u2019ve been doing entirely the wrong thing,\u201d says Sterling, impatient with the possibilities for roadsides across the UK and beyond.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"52e275535201427db0f722900788c892e8ed8c1a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e275535201427db0f722900788c892e8ed8c1a/0_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Managing road verges with the \u2018cut and collect\u2019 method can save money for councils.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Managing road verges with the \u2018cut and collect\u2019 method can save money for councils.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: B Wilkinson/Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Wildlife corridors</h2> \n<p>Wildflower meadows, ancient British ecosystems that are crucial for wildlife, thrived for centuries with the help of traditional farming methods and livestock husbandry, but have largely vanished in the post-war era.

  "<p>\u201cSometimes I just need solitude, which is really rather nice,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/nigel-pearson\" title=\"\">Nigel Pearson</a> says in a deserted lounge at Vicarage Road on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-pandemic-visualising-the-global-crisis\" title=\"\">coronavirus pandemic </a>surrounds us but Pearson has spent an hour discussing a dizzying range of subjects, including his mental health during a relegation dogfight as well as the remarkable turnaround he has engineered since taking over as Watford\u2019s manager in early December. Watford, having snapped Liverpool\u2019s long unbeaten record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/watford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">with a 3-0 thrashing</a> two weeks ago, are just above the relegation zone. Pearson knows their position remains precarious but he underlines far more serious concerns about coronavirus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/nigel-pearson-condemns-boris-johnson-lack-of-leadership-coronavirus-watford\">Nigel Pearson condemns Boris Johnson over 'lack of leadership' on coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pearson is also dealing with the rawest stages of grief, having lost his mother in January, but he is engaging company whether talking about emotional intelligence, attacking football or his Spotify playlists. Amid some diverse choices, Pearson also listens to classical music. He is interested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jan/14/classicalmusicandopera\" title=\"\">Shostakovich</a> and his liking for solitude rises up again as he says of the Russian composer: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t listen to Shostakovich with other people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson is a very good manager. He has a gift for simplifying the game and inspiring his team with a blend that he says is both brutal and attuned to his players\u2019 shifting emotions. But he is perhaps more complex than any other manager in English football. There is deep introspection at the heart of the 56-year-old \u2013 and even Pearson seems amused by his need for some seclusion from the Premier League rollercoaster.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We have to keep this in perspective, but for Liverpool it would be such a tragedy not to conclude the season</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cSometimes I just need to be out in nature,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much I need time on my own. We\u2019ve got a place in Devon and I joined the golf club there. It\u2019s very friendly and, as a new member, you get people saying: \u2018Come have a round with us.\u2019 I think: \u2018No, actually, I just wanna hit some balls on my own.\u2019 It makes me sound a right miserable sod. But it\u2019s just me finding some quiet time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Three days later, on Friday morning, we talk again. The Premier League has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-football-league-suspended-until-4-april-coronavirus\" title=\"\">just announced a suspension of all matches until 4 April</a>. Our earlier conversation about seclusion seems ironic now Pearson faces the stark possibility one of his players has the virus and that he and many others at the club could be facing a period of self-isolation. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s nicer to choose when and where you are isolated.\u201d Pearson says wryly. \u201cBut for now it\u2019s the right decision and it\u2019s relatively proactive \u2013 even if it was made under duress.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson is still mulling over his disappointment after watching Boris Johnson shuffling around the issue and avoiding any decision in regard to cancelling sporting events. \u201cI was totally underwhelmed by him last night,\u201d Pearson says of the prime minister, \u201cand by the lack of leadership and any clear messages. At times like this we need strong leadership and it\u2019s important people have as much information as possible and that any decisions are made for their well-being. They need to be made for humanitarian rather than financial reasons. Of course, the economy is going to be hit but that can\u2019t be the main priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>I ask Pearson what he and his players will do this weekend now Saturday\u2019s game against Leicester City, his former club, has been suspended. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the report on one player who is being tested for the virus. The players are not expected to report for training until next Thursday at the earliest. But we might have to reassess that. For now we just want them to look after themselves and their families at home \u2013 and also to make sure that if they feel ill they report it straight away. We\u2019ve just got to be vigilant and minimise the risk for everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson had told me earlier in the week that the idea of playing games behind closed doors was \u201can absolute nonsense\u201d and that it also put players, coaches and officials at unnecessary risk. In the likely event the pandemic will have escalated by 4 April, should the season be abandoned? \u201cWell, the longer it goes on the more difficult it will be to conclude the season. We have to keep this in perspective, of course, but for Liverpool it would be such a tragedy not to conclude the season. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. It could be that when we get to April we may be able to resume and go into the summer months. How it looks for football pales \u2013 not into insignificance \u2013 but we need perspective on real-life issues. But, yes, purely on a football basis it\u2019s going to throw up problems we\u2019ve not experienced in this country before.\u201d</p> \n<p>The result of the test on the Watford player suspected of having the virus will be known by Saturday at the latest, so is Pearson steeling himself for self-isolation? \u201cI would follow the recommendations like everyone else. It depends on the outcome of the test and that will have a knock-on effect on how I behave. We\u2019re just sitting tight at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f1f9dac9-f7b9-43be-b136-34ce50ad170d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rvx_kXEwGpA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Stepping away from coronavirus, Pearson reflects on the hidden impact of management on his mental health. \u201cIt can be quite damaging. I know I\u2019m good at this job but certain aspects aren\u2019t very good for me. It can be absolutely draining emotionally and mentally. You then can neglect yourself. Those are the dangerous times.\u201d</p> \n<p>How does Pearson replenish himself when there is always some Premier League drama to face? \u201cI have things I enjoy doing on my own. I\u2019ve also got better in talking to friends. One of my strengths is dealing with people but I like to be alone as well. I\u2019ve noticed being back in football that, after some anonymity, people recognise you again. It\u2019s a pain in the neck. My wife said to me yesterday, on a walk: \u2018When you wore glasses that used to be quite a good disguise. But now people recognise you straight away.\u2019 I\u2019m going to have to wear a false beard and moustache.\u201d</p> \n<p>During his last stint at Leicester, when he saved them from relegation the season before they shocked everyone and won the Premier League in 2016, Pearson could be prickly. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/30/nigel-pearson-leicester-sacked\" title=\"\">losing his job in June 2015</a> broadened his vision. He discovered hiking and painting. He read and worked on his history degree. After a year away Pearson went back into football and soon fell out with Mel Morris, the chairman of Derby County, in October 2017. For the next 11 months he drew breath away from the game before accepting an offer to manage OH Leuven in the Belgian second division. Pearson \u201cloved\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/10/nigel-pearson-interview-leuven-belgium-leicester-ostrich\" title=\"\">his time in Belgium</a>, where he helped design the kit and managed a team in front of average crowds of 4,500 for 17 months.</p> \n<p>His latest break lasted 10 months and three days before, on 6 December 2019, with Watford bottom of the table and having already fired two managers this season, Pearson accepted an unexpected invitation from Vicarage Road. \u201cI was curious and thought: \u2018Let\u2019s give it a real crack.\u2019 People said: \u2018It\u2019s a bit of a risk.\u2019 But where\u2019s the risk? A club that\u2019s got eight points and might score a goal every 400 minutes? You risk a relegation on your CV. The real risk is you regret not having a go.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his first game in charge, away to Liverpool, Watford played well, despite losing 2-0. They then won four and drew one of the next five games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">beating Manchester United </a>and Wolves while looking a different team. Before his arrival they had won one league game out of 13 and their goal difference was -18. How did he rejuvenate a moribund team?</p> \n<p>\u201cBeing positive. Giving direction. Simplifying. Encouraging people to look at what\u2019s possible. I get worn down by people telling you what you can\u2019t do or what the problems are. Go on, give us a solution then. As I say to the players: \u2018I pick you for what you can do, not what you can\u2019t do.\u2019 I make people feel part of a journey to which they can contribute.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401520e405ebae9bf18268145eda07a81f35a4b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401520e405ebae9bf18268145eda07a81f35a4b1/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watford manager Nigel Pearson puts his arm around Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu after the Hornets\u2019 3-0 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford in February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watford manager Nigel Pearson puts his arm around Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu after the Hornets\u2019 3-0 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford in February 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pearson was once depicted as a ranting old-school manager \u2013 an English gaffer that gets called \u201ca proper football man\u201d \u2013 but the reality is different. He is a smart tactician who also stresses the importance of emotional intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to our success because footballers are people first and foremost. It\u2019s important that you\u2019ve got different types of people and it\u2019s my job to bring the best out of them. But I don\u2019t want to sound as if it\u2019s all touchy-feely stuff. Sometimes it can be blunt and brutal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet Pearson brings a light touch to his work. Before they outran, outworked and simply outplayed Liverpool, Pearson eased off in training that week. Watford did understated sessions, including a day of yoga and swimming. \u201cIt was spontaneous. As we went through the week we thought: \u2018Let\u2019s do something different.\u2019 But it\u2019s got to have authenticity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson gave Watford more solidity when he arrived by changing to 4-2-1-3 \u2013 with the idea that a more structured defence would unleash the team\u2019s attacking potential. Watford are fourth from bottom and, should this campaign recommence, Pearson insists they will keep attacking. This means he often replaces a defensive midfielder with a forward, even if Watford are leading. There have been 3-0 wins over Aston Villa, even after going down to 10 men, and Liverpool but they conceded last-minute winners at Villa Park and at home to Everton.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. I have a love-hate relationship with it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe need to win games,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we go gung-ho and take away the importance of solidity. But the way in which you play is dictated by what you have available and the situation you\u2019re in. We have pace and good attacking players but we can\u2019t be negligent. Sometimes we have to recognise that a point is great. But to give belief and hope we have to be positive and aggressive.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a relegation dogfight and we\u2019ve worked exceptionally hard to get back in contact with teams. Now we\u2019ve done that, results like last weekend\u2019s loss against Palace can feel a missed opportunity. But we can\u2019t dwell on disappointments. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">didn\u2019t take our chances against Palace </a>but we played OK. I have to detach myself from this emotional rollercoaster that everyone else is on.\u201d</p> \n<p>The more human backdrop is shaped by the fact Pearson lost his mum unexpectedly 10 weeks ago. He highlights the support of his wife, Nicky, and their adult son and daughter, James and Hannah, but he admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve found the right way of grieving yet. We\u2019re making sure we all rally around my dad. They were together 64 years. A long, long time. Mum was such an energetic, dynamic 84-year-old. She was the dominant figure in the family and so it\u2019s been difficult. It would\u2019ve been her 85<sup>th</sup> birthday next Wednesday. That\u2019s when we plan to scatter her ashes. So it\u2019s still very, very raw.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt happened on 28 December, the day of the Villa game, and straight after James said: \u2018We need to get ready quickly.\u2019 My mum had had a fall. The next few days were just backwards and forwards on the motorway. She died just a few days later, on the third. It was a huge shock. So now the focal point is my dad. I\u2019ve just lost my mum and I certainly don\u2019t want to lose my dad to [coronavirus]. It\u2019s going to be a further worry because the elderly are more at risk.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pearson visited his father on Monday evening, before the threat that the virus had reached the Watford camp had emerged. Now he knows that a fellow manager, Arsenal\u2019s Mikel Arteta, has coronavirus, is Pearson concerned he may also be affected and have passed it on to his 86-year-old dad? \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to presume that we may all have come into contact with someone who has got it. But it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how many have been exposed to it. That\u2019s not scaremongering. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is Pearson finding a balance between looking after others both inside and outside the club while taking care of himself? \u201cI hope so. But the reality of it is, like a lot of people, I\u2019m good at giving advice, but not so much when taking it. I\u2019m trying to enjoy the job a bit more. But that\u2019s never easy because I have a love-hate relationship with it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"784248dc-94b4-4d26-9b0b-5f952a88b359\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KfRm-YggRH0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond the travails of a pandemic virus and a relegation battle, Pearson relaxes and shares a couple of his many pleasurable diversions. \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying doing the Guardian crossword since I joined Leicester first time around [in 2008]. I try to do the quick ones under 10 minutes. Today\u2019s I did in nine minutes.\u201d Flicking through his Spotify playlist he reads out an eclectic mix stretching from Miles Davis to The Cure, Nick Drake to Chick Corea, Van Morrison to XTC, The Shins to a selection of Icelandic groups, his enjoyment is obvious.</p> \n<p>We drift back to football. If the season does resume will Watford survive the drop and can he possibly enjoy the challenge? \u201cYeah, I believe we will stay up. As for enjoying it I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. But I think the pain of it is also a stimulus. I\u2019d rather be bored sometimes \u2013 but then there would be other things to worry about. I just know we\u2019re in this situation and I\u2019m going to give everything to get us out of it \u2013 so we have to be ready to engage with it again when the opportunity comes along. But, for now, we\u2019ll put relegation worries to one side. The health of all of us is the priority.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The BBC is facing calls to delay the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/bbc-facing-funding-cut-as-licence-fee-consultation-launched\">licence fee</a> for over-75s in order to ensure that those most at risk from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/how-to-protect-yourself-coronavirus\">coronavirus outbreak</a> are still able to access accurate information on the pandemic from their television if they are self-isolating.</p> <p>However, letters have started arriving on doormats telling most over-75s that they will have to start paying the \u00a3157.50 fee from the beginning of June, around the time that cases of the illness are expected to peak. As a result, the charity Age UK has called for the policy to be delayed, amid concerns that some older viewers \u2013 who are most likely to rely on television news for their information \u2013 could choose to turn off their sets and cut themselves off from the world.</p> <p>Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cCovid-19 presents a real worry and risk to the health and wellbeing of older people. We would be pleased and relieved if the BBC delayed implementation of their plans to scrap free TV licences for most over-75s, and we are certain that older people would be too.</p> <p>\u201cMany older people tell us that they rely heavily on their TV for news and entertainment, particularly the lonely, chronically sick and disabled, so it\u2019s more important than ever for the government and the BBC to come together and come to a sensible agreement that preserves free TV licences for our over-75s.\u201d</p> <p>The government is particularly keen to ensure that news broadcasters remain on air in order to get health messages to the public, with audiences flocking to traditional mainstream news outlets in search of accurate reliable information, pushing up ratings for television news and seeing record traffic to news websites. The BBC News website has seen its second biggest week for readership, with tens of millions of Britons accessing stories about the coronavirus.</p> <p>While the decision in some countries to enter a full lockdown phase has seen talkshows in countries such as Italy ban studio audiences, British broadcasters have said they will continue to follow the government\u2019s lead and not ban gatherings until advised otherwise.</p> <p>As a result, they will continue to allow live studio audiences to attend recordings of programmes such as Question Time for the foreseeable future, as outlets work out how to cover the biggest global news story in decades without risking their own staff or the public.</p> <p>Rachel Corp, the acting editor of ITV News, said her team would be \u201cgetting all our programmes out by any means\u201d. In the most extreme circumstances, there is the option of moving ITV\u2019s London-based national news programme to a regional studio, but the contingency planning assumes that up to 20% of staff could be ill at any one time.</p> <p>She said viewers might notice some changes, with more interviews being conducted outside and microphones clipped to lapels being replaced with hand-held equipment in order to reduce contact between journalists and the individuals they are talking to.</p> <p>\u201cEven if you end up with very limited resources or a different style of programme, we want to get information out to the public,\u201d Corp said, adding that the story was swamping all other coverage. \u201cThe markets crashed and we didn\u2019t get to it until 23 minutes into the News at Ten.\u201d</p> <p>Radio stations are confident that they will be able to remain on air with ease, aided by improved broadcasting technology. Commercial group Bauer Radio said it had the capacity to broadcast shows remotely, pointing out that while its Magic Radio breakfast show host Ronan Keating was currently self-isolating after returning from Singapore, he has broadcast entire live episodes of his programme over a wifi connection using little more than an iPhone and a microphone.</p> <p>The virus could be financially catastrophic for many companies in the already struggling media industry. Advertisers are already pulling promotions ahead of an expected economic downturn, while there is likely to be a substantial impact on print newspaper sales if readers self-isolate at home.</p> <p>The risk of the pandemic sweeping the nation \u2013 and the political fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to ban public gatherings \u2013 has led to some companies taking views that differ from their editorial line. Staff at the Daily Mail\u2019s parent company have been told in an internal email that \u201cofficial government advice is no longer adequate enough to safeguard our staff\u201d, with non-editorial staff told to work from home.</p> <p>The line contrasts with the newspaper\u2019s praise for Johnson and his scientific advisers. The publication\u2019s editorial stated: \u201cStriking the right tone at this press conference was not easy, but Boris and his boffins carried it off well. At this stage, we must trust their judgment and do as they say.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is a revealing moment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/isabelhardman\" title=\"\">Isabel Hardman</a>\u2019s book where the author, a political journalist who lives with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\" title=\"\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, joins a forest therapy session. The therapist encourages her to \u201cconnect\u201d with herself and \u201cexperience nature better\u201d. Hardman wanders through the wood and finds a small hornbeam, which is twisting up towards the light, struggling to make its way in the shade of a mature oak. She is attracted to its shape, admires its bark, and draws parallels with her own life: how long it takes to heal and grow, how the scars we gather can still be beautiful \u201clike the zig-zagging trunk of this young tree\u201d. She reaches up and snaps one of its twigs: the tree is dead.</p> <p>\u201cServes me right for being so dreadfully whimsical,\u201d Hardman writes. \u201cThere seemed to be no neat life lesson here, nothing you\u2019d want to write on a fridge magnet or share on social media. I\u2019d come here hoping to connect with myself, and instead I\u2019d been drawn to a tree that was secretly dead.\u201d</p> <p>It is a valuable lesson in Hardman\u2019s <em>The Natural Health Service</em>, a practical and self-aware account of the relief from mental illness to be found outside. Hardman, and the many people she meets, identify respite, recovery and resilience in walking, running, cold-water swimming, gardening, \u201cforest bathing\u201d, birdwatching, botanising, horse riding and caring for pets. The common denominator is what Hardman calls \u201cthe great outdoors\u201d, that plangent, hearty Victorian-sounding cliche. But as she shows, other species and their ecosystems can be rebellious medics. At times, the \u201cnatural\u201d world resembles the magic mirror that undercuts Snow White\u2019s stepmother: rather than reflecting back ourselves, it is alive with its own agency, a challenge to our narcissism.</p> <p><em>The Natural Health Service</em> is one of a rapidly growing forest of new books that examine cures found in nature. This winter alone has brought the publication of <em>The Wild Remedy</em> by Emma Mitchell; <em>Losing Eden</em> by Lucy Jones; <em>Rootbound</em> by Alice Vincent; and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/wintering-how-i-learned-to-flourish-when-life-became-frozen-katherine-may-memoir-review\" title=\"\">Wintering</a></em> by Katherine May. One of last year\u2019s unexpectedly prominent books \u2013 unexpected because it was rejected by publishers and crowdfunded via Unbound \u2013 was <em>Bird Therapy</em> by Joe Harkness. Just as trend is followed by takedown, so this spring sees a potential debunking in the form of <em>Natural</em><em>: The Seductive Myth of Nature\u2019s Goodness</em> by American philosopher Alan Levinovitz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007/0_779_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Isabel Hardman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Isabel Hardman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea that human health can be salved by \u201cnature\u201d has been around for as long as we have regarded ourselves as a species apart from other living things. It truly arrived in Britain with the Romantics, for whom prosperity enabled a more reflective and worshipful relationship with the landscape that others had to toil in for a living. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\" title=\"\">Keats</a> and Byron loved swimming; sea-bathing was an upper-class health fad that inspired the first seaside resorts. The popularisation of nature\u2019s healing power peaked after the industrial revolution, when later Victorians were beset by fears of the all-conquering machine. Fresh air, exercise and healthful hobbies, from collecting butterflies to finding fossils, were prescribed in much the same way as GPs today are experimenting with \u201cprescribing nature\u201d to patients. Hardman reminds us of the prescience of Octavia Hill, the social reformer and co-founder of the National Trust in 1895, who campaigned to save urban land for city parks. London commons that could make developers fortunes had greater value as outdoor space, Hill argued: \u201cTo my mind they are even now worth very much; but they will be more and more valuable every year \u2013 valuable in the deepest sense of the word; health-giving, joy-inspiring, peace-bringing.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Losing Eden</em>, Jones shows that, ahead of today\u2019s scientists, even Florence Nightingale was aware of how green space and plants can assist recovery from physical illness. In 1859, Nightingale wrote that when she had been ill, her recovery quickened after she received \u201ca nosegay of wild flowers\u201d. The nurse noticed in her patients that there was \u201cmost acute suffering when [the] patient can\u2019t see out of the window\u201d; Jones and Hardman both cite a more modern scientific study by Roger Ulrich who examined the records of 46 patients recovering from gall bladder surgery between 1972 and 1981. Some patients were randomly assigned a hospital bed with a view of deciduous trees; others a view of a brick wall. Those with a view of trees had shorter post-operative stays, took fewer painkillers and had fewer minor complications. And yet 40 years on, hospitals are run as \u201csterile\u201d environments without plants, as Levinovitz notes in <em>Natural</em>: \u201cAn entirely unsuperstitious take on natural healing would recognise the importance of being around life \u2013 of facilitating hospital garden walks, say \u2013 instead of systematically excluding it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03f24d9ea256a1079b11ec9d430ab7447750f0f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03f24d9ea256a1079b11ec9d430ab7447750f0f7/0_188_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Out of the woods \u2026 green spaces have been proven to speed up recovery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of the woods \u2026 green spaces have been proven to speed up recovery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Travelpix Ltd/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the climate and extinction crisis quickens, so there is a rush for a literary cure. In Britain it began with Richard Mabey\u2019s <em>Nature Cure</em> in 2005. In many of the most popular recent examples of nature writing, other species and wild places have played a healing role \u2013 for bereavement in Helen Macdonald\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\" title=\"\">H </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\" title=\"\">Is for Hawk</a></em>, and alcoholism in Amy Liptrot\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/the-outrun-amy-liptrot-review-by-will-self\" title=\"\">The Outrun</a>. Nature Cure</em> (briefly) details Mabey\u2019s mental breakdown after completing his magnum opus, <em>Flora Britannica</em>, and the succour he found by forgoing his childhood home in the Chilterns for the bleaker plains of south Norfolk. When I ask Mabey if he regrets being midwife to the nature cure subgenre, an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d spills forth. \u201cI feel slightly guilty about the title, which was my idea and it was very euphonious, but I quite soon began getting letters from people saying they loved the book but that it was not much to do with nature curing me. If a pedantic scholar counted the paragraphs that were to do with the illness, it probably amounts to about six pages,\u201d he says. \u201cReally it\u2019s a book about encountering and adapting to a quite new landscape, which you could say was a post-cure experience.\u201d Mabey had to reach a certain stage of recovery to write <em>Nature Cure</em>. As he, Hardman and other nature cure writers emphasise, they can be too ill to leave the house to imbibe the healing wild, and too ill to write, too.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful when it occurs; people in distress find that encounters with the natural world do restore them,\u201d says Mabey. But two things concern him about the concept of a nature cure. \u201cI\u2019m worried that it\u2019s become mooted as a kind of panacea \u2013 green Prozac. And if there\u2019s anything wrong you just go out and look at the pretty flowers and you\u2019re going to be marvellous. That\u2019s a tall order if the natural world is in a state of crisis with the insect apocalypse and British songbirds collapsing all around us. There is also a danger that therapeutic nature becomes another way in which nature is reduced to service provider. The foregrounding of us being the centre of attention, the central agents of change and growth, all form part of a mindset that I think is obsolete. We need to rethink where we stand in relation to all these other organisms and what the transactions are between us, and stop saying they are all for our benefit, even though most of them probably are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b42a613ba2cf7096152929439691c06710560621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b42a613ba2cf7096152929439691c06710560621/0_1252_3338_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Mabey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Richard Mabey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Si Barber/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an insightful <a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5542/in-search-of-the-nature-cure\" title=\"\">essay on nature cures</a>, Richard Smyth quotes the poet Polly Atkin, who is diagnosed with chronic illnesses Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, a metabolic disorder that leads to a toxic accumulation of iron in the body. Like Mabey, Atkin has misgivings about this literary blossoming. \u201cThere is very little published work that points out how problematic it is \u2013 largely because the people who understand the problem are mainly those with incurable conditions and they\u2019re often too busy being incurable to write books about nature,\u201d she says. \u201cMore importantly, mainstream UK publishing is so attached to the \u2018nature cure\u2019 narrative that it can\u2019t imagine another story to tell about how we relate to the world around us.\u201d</p> <p>The stage is set for a debunking of the literary nature cure but in <em>Natural</em>, it never quite arrives. At the end of the book, despite Levinovitz taking smart aim at the snake-oil salespeople of late capitalism \u2013 those selling expensive natural remedies, natural \u201ccures\u201d for cancer, or loudly advocating \u201cwholly natural\u201d childbirth, sex or sport \u2013 he concludes that there is something innately glorious about the non-human natural world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m worried it\u2019s become mooted as a kind\u00a0of panacea \u2013\u00a0if there\u2019s anything wrong you just go out and look at the flowers</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Mabey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What Levinovitz critiques is what he sees as a religious attitude towards nature. An appeal to natural goodness \u2013 with \u201cunnatural\u201d as its evil twin \u2013 is among the most influential arguments in all human thought, ancient and modern, east and west. In fact, every human-made object is extracted from our planet; everything is \u201cnatural\u201d. Levinovitz argues our veneration of \u201cnature\u201d is dangerous, citing former South African president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mbeki\" title=\"\">Thabo Mbeki</a>\u2019s desire for Aids patients to take beetroot and other \u201cnatural\u201d treatments. What Levinovitz does is help us to identify the \u201cpropagandists, bigots, demagogues, and marketeers who wrap their rhetoric in the mantle of \u2018what\u2019s natural\u2019\u201d. </p> <p>When it comes to making money from nature, the small, poorly renumerated band of writers proselytising for its health benefits do not enter Levinovitz\u2019s line of fire. While <em>H </em><em>Is </em><em>for Hawk</em> will long stand as a literary classic, nature cure writing has taken a practical turn. Hardman and Harkness\u2019s books are squarely self-help. Their qualities include brutal honesty and generous advice. Both authors, alongside others such as Jones and Mitchell, make clear that while time in the natural world has ameliorated their mental illnesses, so too have antidepressants and talking cures. These writers don\u2019t succumb to the requirement for a happy ending either: no one suggests they are cured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3392a105a7aed1b724427f59f6b07eb0dee9e5d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3392a105a7aed1b724427f59f6b07eb0dee9e5d6/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild swimming in Snowdonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild swimming in Snowdonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stockimo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We might wonder if a writing cure is also part of their wider recovery, but it is not always so. John Clare, who died in 1864, has long been the most notable nature writer with mental health problems. The Northamptonshire farm labourer, whose superb poems made him a literary sensation in the early 19th century, could be considered both evidence for and against the theory that nature makes us well. Did he only fall ill once embraced by literary London, psychically uprooted from his rural heartland? Or was he ill despite surrounding himself with nature? A country life is no guarantee of mental wellbeing: depression is a major problem<strong> </strong>in modern farming; plenty of farm workers endure it.</p> <p>There is an echo of Clare\u2019s experience in Harkness\u2019s account of life since the publication of his debut, <em>Bird Therapy</em>. \u201cI will never write about nature again,\u201d says Harkness bluntly. He has been diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">obsessive-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">compulsive </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">disorder</a> and generalised anxiety disorder \u2013 mild medical terms for the crippling anxiety that Harkness vividly describes. After an attempted suicide and a breakdown, he began walking and discovered the exhilaration of encountering birds. \u201cOf all the therapies I\u2019ve tried,\u201d he writes, \u201cnothing has had the prolonged and positive impact that birdwatching has.\u201d He spotted that the requirements of birdwatching matched the five ways to wellbeing devised by a project endorsed by the charity Mind: to connect, to take notice, to give, to keep learning and to be active.</p> <p>As Harkness\u2019s profile grew on social media, he decided to write a book, receiving high-profile endorsements, including an incisive foreword by the naturalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-packham\" title=\"\">Chris Packham</a>, who declared it an \u201cexceptional\u201d publication because it would save lives. Eight months on, Harkness recognises that his book has brought positive things: his honesty about mental illness has encouraged others to reciprocate. He has been told by readers that it has indeed saved their lives. Unfortunately, the online platform that enabled him to promote his book also damaged him. \u201cThe more open I was on social media, the less people engaged with me. If you\u2019re already struggling with self-esteem, it is hell to be on it. The only way I could deal with it is not use Twitter any more,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2bad48acd5409ed167abd0bb8148bc0cd41d1bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2bad48acd5409ed167abd0bb8148bc0cd41d1bf/0_398_3978_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tenby in 1895 \u2026 sea-bathing, an upper-class health fad, inspired the first seaside resorts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tenby in 1895 \u2026 sea-bathing, an upper-class health fad, inspired the first seaside resorts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has also shed his illusions about the \u201cguild\u201d of nature writers. He imagined this literary world would be an inclusive salon for the free exchange of ideas about nature and mental health; instead he found a workplace, \u201ca competitive market with a lot of emphasis on product and what you\u2019re selling\u201d, where \u201cpeople become very focused on themselves\u201d. One nature writer, he says, told him that <em>Bird Therapy</em> only sold well because of Packham\u2019s foreword. Harkness, who is a special educational needs co-ordinator working with vulnerable young people, says he is so glad that writing is not his job. His post-book cure has been to remove himself from social media and literary \u201cbackslapping\u201d and simplify his birdwatching regimen. \u201cI don\u2019t drive to birdwatch any more. I walk from my house. I\u2019m under no pressure to see anything exciting. I\u2019ve stopped commodifying it. I just think of being out where I should be. Whenever I do that I\u2019m really thankful for it. Nature is not there to make me feel better. It\u2019s something we can use to help us but ultimately we have to be there for it as well. And we\u2019ve got to make wholesale changes to how we live.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p> <p>Most nature cure books, both literary triumphs and practical manuals, are overwhelmingly about us. Perhaps we should catch more glimpses of other species as we look into the mirror? Mitchell\u2019s <em>The Wild Remedy</em>, a diary of a year with severe depression, throws welcome attention on natural medicines \u2013 the thrilling dash of a sparrowhawk, or the cosy sight of ladybirds clustered together during winter in a knapweed seedhead. She recreates her encounters with other species around her home in Cambridgeshire in paintings, sketches, photographs and cabinets of curiosities. But, she says, \u201cI\u2019m not using my garden and the wood beyond my cottage as a sort of green Tesco, burgling myself some green serotonin and dopamine. It\u2019s much more of a two-way relationship.\u201d Mitchell, like Harkness, initially connected via social media with readers and others who lived with mental illness. She is not always well enough to visit a nearby wood every day. When she does, she monitors, observes and records the wildlife, and relays it to her audience. A biologist by training, Mitchell hopes her writing and art enlighten our increasingly urban society. \u201cI\u2019m trying to use the place where I live as a source of education for people who may not know what cherry plum blossom looks like \u2013 \u2018This is coming into flower, go and see if you\u2019ve got it on your patch,\u2019\u201d she says. Awakening readers to other species around us is a gift to those species, and it is bequeathed by almost every nature cure writer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As humans reshape life on Earth, it\u2019s hazardous to pin our wellbeing on the fragments of non-human life that remain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last summer, an area of flowery meadowland in the wood near Mitchell exploded with life. The hot summer of 2018 must have produced \u201ca metric fucktonne of caterpillars\u201d she laughs: the following year there emerged hundreds of marbled white butterflies. \u201cThe dose of dopamine was just off the scale.\u201d She filmed it for her social media followers. A few days later, in full flower, the meadow was scalped because of fears it contained ragwort, a flower that can in rare cases prove fatal to horses (and which landowners sometimes mistakenly believe they are obliged to control under an arcane \u201cinjurious\u201d weeds law). An exquisite ecosystem was cut down at its peak. Alongside Mitchell\u2019s enjoyment of this meadow emerged a deep connection with it, and a responsibility for it. \u201cMy connection with this land is not as a commodity. This is not skincare I get from a beauty parlour. This is not a monthly subscription to sniff some dead-nettle flowers. This is something that has changed my ability to live with my depression,\u201d she says. In this case, she went into battle with her local council, at some personal cost \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a spokesperson for thousands of invertebrates because they\u2019ve got no voice,\u201d she says \u2013 and succeeded in changing the cutting regime. The meadow won\u2019t be cut again this year until the flowers and invertebrates have finished flowering and flying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7c4c2b62f4d67f0132afe0725956f1eea5ff2e4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c4c2b62f4d67f0132afe0725956f1eea5ff2e4c/2543_145_3258_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Emma Mitchell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Emma Mitchell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Pope/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mitchell\u2019s experience also reveals that in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\" title=\"\">Anthropocene</a>, an era in which humans are reshaping all life on Earth, it is hazardous to pin our wellbeing on the fragments of non-human life that remain. Lucy Jones\u2019s <em>Losing Eden</em> is a passionate and thorough exploration of the growing scientific evidence showing why humans require other species to stay well \u2013 from a diversity of microbiota in our guts to a diversity of species in nearby green space. But she is aware that \u201cthe medicalisation of nature\u201d also \u201cdemonstrates that we still see ourselves as takers and overseers, the authority figures, rather than being on an equal footing with the rest of nature\u201d. Just as Mabey wonders if we can extract wellbeing from an environment we are traducing, so Jones considers the 21st-century challenge posed by ecological grief. Is the epidemic of mental illness in wealthy western societies in part because \u201csome part of our spirits [is] afflicted by the mass burglary humanity has committed on the Earth?\u201d Jones writes. \u201cI know that I feel rotten and out of sorts when I am selfish or hurtful to the people around me\u201d. The ecopsychologist and activist Chellis Glendinning diagnosed western culture as suffering from \u201coriginal trauma\u201d caused by our severance from nature and natural cycles. She noted that the symptoms were the same as PTSD: \u201chyperreactions; inappropriate outbursts of anger, psychic numbing; constriction of the emotions; and loss of a sense of control over our destiny\u201d.</p> <p>The Earth is our home and we are making ourselves homeless. Jones quotes the farmer-thinker Wendell Berry: \u201cWe are involved in a kind of lostness in which most people are participating more or less unconsciously in the destruction of the natural world, which is to say, the sources of our own lives.\u201d Perhaps some of our lack of awareness, Jones thinks, is an instinctive denial of death; just as we block out our own mortality, so too we pretend our compulsive consumption is not hastening the premature end of our species\u2019 enjoyment of the planet.</p> <p>As Jones argues, despite all our writing about \u201cnature\u201d, we still lack the language to bring its jeopardy \u2013 our jeopardy \u2013 to the forefront of our troubled minds. Western consumption has made the planet ill, and now we are patients too. Grief and mental illness can be introspective and paralysing or they can inspire action. Which path will we as individuals, societies and as a species choose?</p>",

  "<p>Mark De-Lisser is a voice coach, lately a media one, making heart-warming <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000cf47\" title=\"\">reality shows</a> in which he builds community choirs to beat loneliness, or the solitude of dementia, or just to soften the condition of being human. Many benefits are psychological, in a space beyond (but passing through) mindfulness, where you make your heart sing by singing. But there are physical benefits, too, from posture to breathing to a muscular skeletal reboot, which is why I\u2019m in De-Lisser\u2019s studio \u2013 though I want my heart to sing as much as the next man.</p> <p>In its anteroom are photos of Mark in front of his choirs: one catches my eye, a bunch of middle-aged women, all in green evening dress like bridesmaids to a bride determined to outshine them, looking absolutely pleased as punch to be standing next to him. \u201cI bet they\u2019re singing Abba,\u201d I thought. \u201cNo way on God\u2019s Earth am I singing an Abba song.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeeper breath,\u201d he starts. \u201cSinging encourages you to use deeper breath.

There is a whole deep-breathing culture, spun out of yoga, with precisely this in mind: the benefit here is that you also get to make a noise.</p> <p>But first, work on your posture: if you store a lot of tension in your shoulders, it makes your voice strained and weak. We spend quite a bit of time relaxing, teaching my arms how to go limp.

It is easy to imagine the chat, at least. Coronavirus has handed single people the most obvious of openers. Screw getting-to-know-you questions about work or family \u2013 right now all conversations come back to the virus. It\u2019s as ubiquitous as Brexit, but it moves faster and is less divisive than identifying as leave or remain. In fact, the pandemic has been oddly unifying: though we might not see eye to eye on the government\u2019s response, we can all agree upon the threat posed by Covid-19.</p> <p>The last non-political event I can remember that captured collective attention in this way was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jul/03/thailand-cave-rescue-where-were-the-boys-found-and-how-can-they-be-rescued\">Thai cave rescue in 2018</a>: a similarly fast-moving saga, breaking from dreary politics with multiple points of entry (the boys dreaming of KFC, the approaching storm, Elon Musk\u2019s offer of a hi-tech rescue to the trapped party before he called one of the rescue divers \u201cpedo guy\u201d in a now infamous tweet).

Yet dating, and app dating in particular, is a risk at the best of times. On the one hand, you\u2019re making yourself vulnerable to rejection. And on the other, especially for women, you are meeting a stranger who may intend to do you harm.</p> <p>In \u201cputting yourself out there\u201d, as we\u2019re often told is crucial to dating success, single people weigh up the likelihood of such outcomes. Like the threat of catching a virus, these risks are nearly impossible to anticipate. There is a certain irony in that it\u2019s only now Tinder has started warning users \u201cof the risk of meeting in person\u201d. Meeting a stranger you know from the internet has, to some extent, always been an exercise in trust.</p> <p>Covid-19 is similar in this regard: our continued participation in society is premised on trusting that people are acting in each others\u2019 interests. We have to assume that people who have the virus will isolate themselves \u2013 taking steps \u201cnot because we may feel personally at risk, but so that we can help lessen the risk for everyone\u201d, as Zeynep Tufekci<a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/preparing-for-coronavirus-to-strike-the-u-s/\"> wrote recently for Scientific American</a>.

Do you ask your date to wash their hands in front of you? Bail on their second cough? And with no repartee sparkling enough to win you a kiss at the end of the night, you might reasonably ask yourself: why bother?</p> <p>In this sense, the coronavirus crisis may offer some a reprieve. Those feeling fatigued by apps will be relieved to have an excuse not to participate \u2013 like a doctor\u2019s note authorising you to sit out the dating game. But it is also a strange and unsettling time to be alone. As the US writer Madeleine Aggeler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmaggeler/status/1237849611777093635\">recently tweeted</a>, \u201cHow many people are misguidedly reaching out to an ex during these trying times, I wonder.\u201d</p> <p>I received such a message myself (\u201cthinking of you in this weird and scary time\u201d). At 3am a friend of mine in a long distance relationship impulsively booked a flight across Europe to be with her partner in the UK, just before travel restrictions were imposed. \u201cI panicked,\u201d she said. More so than with any other crisis I can remember, weathering this one feels lonely, even if you\u2019re not self-quarantined. You may have no reason to believe you are infected, but you remain hostage to an abstract sense of threat, even if coronavirus is no more real to you than a run on pasta at your closest supermarket.</p> <p>I feel most for the people who are following the crisis alone. It is in this time of instability that you most want to retreat into relationships that make you feel safe, and supported \u2013 into a more secure, benign world of your own making.

  "<p>On 1 September 1991, a large private yacht cruised towards the Statue of Liberty. It was a clear, breezy evening, and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York, a golden sunset could be seen glinting off the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, a party was in flow. Scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and miniskirts, some as young as 14, danced under disco lights. It could have been a high school prom, were it not for the crowd of older men surrounding them.</p> <p>As the evening wore on, some of the men \u2013 many old enough to be the girls\u2019 fathers, or even grandfathers \u2013 joined them on the dancefloor, pressing themselves against the girls. One balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models, leering into a film camera that was documenting the evening: \u201cCan you get some beautiful women around me, please?\u201d</p> <p>The party aboard the Spirit of New York was one of several events that Donald Trump, then 45, attended with a group of 58 aspiring young models that September. They had travelled from around the world to compete in Elite\u2019s Look of the Year competition, an annual event that had been running since 1983 and was already credited with launching the careers of Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen and Stephanie Seymour. At stake was a life-changing prize: a $150,000 contract with the world\u2019s then leading modelling agency, Elite Model Management, run by John Casablancas.</p> <p>Trump was closely involved in Casablancas\u2019s competition. In 1991, he was a headline sponsor, throwing open the Plaza, his lavish, chateau-style hotel overlooking Central Park, transforming it into the main venue and accommodating the young models. He was also one of its 10 judges.</p> <p>In 1992, Trump hosted the competition again. On a similarly golden evening in early September that year, another group of contestants boarded the Spirit of New York, chartered for another Elite cruise. One of the girls on the boat was Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old from a small town outside Toronto. She recalls how the contestants were encouraged to parade downstairs, one by one, and dance for Trump, Casablancas and others. Lee, an introverted teenager who loved to draw but hated school, was in New York for the first time. \u201cA woman at the agency was pushing me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI said to her, \u2018I don\u2019t see why me going down the stairs and dancing in front of those two has anything to do with me becoming a model. And she said, \u2018No, you look great, take off your blazer and go and do it.\u2019 So I walked down the stairs. I didn\u2019t dance \u2013 I blew a kiss at them, spun around and walked away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81/0_256_5364_3219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4/0_225_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht, September 1991.

She says an organiser told her that if she refused, she would be excluded from the competition. \u201cI knew in my gut it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t being judged or part of the competition \u2013 it was for their entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>While Elite\u2019s official brochure stated that contestants were aged between 14 and 24, all of those the Guardian has spoken to, competing in both years, were aged between 14 and 19. Some had come to New York with parents or chaperones in tow; others were alone. Many were away from their families for the first time. For them, the stakes were high, and the pressure to impress the judges great. As Casablancas had warned them at the outset of the competition, in a scene recorded by TV cameras: \u201cYou are going to be judged, constantly judged.\u201d (In 1991 and 1992, the Elite contest was filmed for a 60-minute glossy television special, featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and later screened on Fox \u2013 an early foray into reality TV.) Casablancas was a powerful figure in the industry, and to many of the new crop of would-be supermodels, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss.</p> <p>Three decades on, a very different picture of the competition is beginning to emerge. Over the last six months, the Guardian has spoken to several dozen former Look of the Year contestants, as well as industry insiders, and obtained 12 hours of previously unseen, behind-the-scenes footage. The stories we have heard suggest that Casablancas, and some of the men in his orbit, used the contest to engage in sexual relationships with vulnerable young models. Some of these allegations amount to sexual harassment, abuse or exploitation of teenage girls; others are more accurately described as rape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5/592_0_2010_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell and John Casablancas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettina Cirone/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1/0_3_2994_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f/318_689_8865_5318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top left: John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale.

But his close involvement in the contest raises questions for the president. Did he know that Casablancas and others were sleeping with contestants? Why would a man in his 40s, whose main business was real-estate development, want to host a beauty contest for teenage girls?</p> <p>Journalists have scoured almost every corner of the 45th president\u2019s life, but his friendship with Casablancas, and his involvement in Look of the Year in 1991 and 1992, have been largely overlooked. Yet the competition is more than a footnote in the Donald Trump story. In time, it would prove to be the foundation of his pivot into reality TV. He even married a former Look of the Year contestant: the current first lady, Melania Trump, narrowly missed out on a trip to New York in 1992, after coming second in the Slovenian heat.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When John Casablancas arrived in New York in 1977, aged 35, he quickly caused a stir. Branded \u201cthe snatcher\u201d for poaching models from rivals for his Elite Model Management agency, he gained a reputation as a ruthless operator. Handsome and charismatic, the son of a former Balenciaga model and a wealthy Spanish banker, he formed the agency that became Elite in Paris in his late 20s. Within years of setting up shop in New York, Casablancas was generating millions of dollars in revenue each year, and ushering in the era of the supermodel. Glamorous friends flocked to Elite parties in fashionable clubs like Studio 54.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how Casablancas first met Trump but, according to several former models who encountered him during the 1980s, the businessman became a regular at his parties. With the opening of Trump Tower on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue in 1983, and the acquisition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mar-a-lago\" title=\"\">Mar-a-Lago</a> resort in Florida in 1985, Trump had gained the reputation of a high-flying playboy in his own right. In 1987 he published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Art </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Deal</a>, and a flurry of publicity followed. \u201cHe sits atop a $3 billion empire,\u201d proclaimed the Washington Post, \u201cand seems to have a Midas touch.\u201d</p> <p>It was perhaps unsurprising that Trump, a New York celebrity who liked to date beautiful women, should come to know the city\u2019s best-known model agent. \u201cTrump was good with PR and that was something John liked,\u201d says Jeremie Roux, who now runs System, a modelling agency he cofounded with Casablancas in 2009. \u201cGood or negative press was all good to Trump.\u201d </p> <p>Patty Owen, an Elle and Cosmopolitan cover star, recalls seeing Trump at Elite parties as far back as 1982. \u201cHe would always be at the bar. That\u2019s where he would stay and that\u2019s where all the new models would hang out,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I saw him, I was always like: why does John have to invite him?\u201d Barbara Pilling, also then an Elite model, told us Trump asked her out for dinner in the summer of 1989 at an industry soiree. She recalls Trump asking how old she was. \u201cI said 17 and he said, \u2018That\u2019s just great \u2013 you\u2019re not too old, not too young.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7/0_199_3312_4137/801.jpg\" alt=\"Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082/0_50_844_506/500.jpg\" alt=\"Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit of New York in 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve.

One was Shayna Love, an Australian model who was 16 when she came to New York for the first time in the summer of 1991. Recalling a dinner she attended, she says now: \u201cIt was presented as our duty as models at the agency. It wasn\u2019t an invitation. It was like, you have to go and do this.\u201d She says the dinner she attended, at which 10 or 15 models were present, was served at a long table in a private area of an upmarket restaurant. \u201cI was at one end with John, and Trump was up the other end\u2026 surrounded by the other girls.\u201d</p> <p>In the spring of 1991, Trump and Casablancas struck a business deal. Trump would sponsor Look of the Year\u2019s final and host contestants at the Plaza, which would double as the headquarters. At the time, Trump faced significant financial pressures and was close to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn\u2019t seem to deter him. In the newly unearthed, behind-the-scenes footage of Look of the Year 1991, Trump makes a series of appearances alongside Casablancas, whom he describes as \u201cmy friend John\u201d. At one point, Casablancas reveals how he and Trump struck their business partnership. \u201cI had prepared for a long meeting with Donald Trump to explain to him why this was going to be a great success,\u201d Casablancas tells the crowd. \u201cIn fact, I hadn\u2019t finished my third sentence and he said: \u2018I love the idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump now disputes being friends with Casablancas. The president\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he denies it \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d. Trump, they said, \u201chardly knew him, spent very little time with him, and knew very little about him\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Stacy Wilkes had never been anywhere like the New York Plaza when she arrived at Trump\u2019s hotel with another contestant in September 1991. Then 16, she was living in Louisville, Kentucky, with her mother, who was struggling to make ends meet. The teenager would hold yard sales and mow lawns to make extra cash. \u201cI was just so excited to be in a hotel,\u201d she says. \u201cTo go from a poor part of Kentucky to a place like this \u2013 I felt like the little kid in Home Alone.\u201d She recalls feeling out of place in a hotel where \u201ceverything was gold\u201d.</p> <p>The teenager had been selected as part of a sprawling international search, overseen by Casablancas, for \u201cnew faces\u201d. Many contestants had come through feeder competitions after winning regional heats, or being spotted in malls and hotel lobbies or, in one case, on the beach. Casablancas had visited Wilkes\u2019 local mall to host an Elite scouting event<strong> </strong>a year earlier, when she was 15. Her local agent had sent her to meet him, telling her what to wear and how to act. She says: \u201cI was told to put my hair down in front of my face and then, like, whoop it around and look up at him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Get%20in%20touch&amp;description=Did%20you%20attend%20Elite's%20Look%20of%20the%20Year%20in%20the%201990s%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Did you attend Elite's Look of the Year in the 1990s?

The contestants assembled beneath crystal chandeliers at the Plaza to meet Casablancas. He told them they would be judged over several days ahead of a gala evening, when the winner would be crowned. The girls would undergo makeovers and attend photocalls, donning spandex for an exercise routine in front of the Plaza. The behind-the-scenes footage shows Casablancas informing the would-be models that attention would be paid not just to appearance, but to \u201cthe way you are, your attitude, your personality, your sense of cooperation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d/178_29_809_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FameFlynet.uk.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36/0_416_2999_1799/1000.png\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top, from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.

The 1992 Fox documentary reported that the average age was 15, and the film\u2019s interviews make the youth of many contestants plain. Standing before the judges for the key swimwear round, the aspiring models are asked to tell the panel about themselves. \u201cI sing and love animals,\u201d says one girl, nervously. Another tells the judges: \u201cI like big dogs and chocolate.\u201d Later, during a photoshoot, a photographer instructs a 15-year-old to show more of her cleavage by pulling her bra lower. \u201cMore,\u201d he tells her. \u201cMore. More.\u201d</p> <p>In 1991, there were 10 judges in total, eight of them men, including Trump, Casablancas, the celebrity magician David Copperfield, and the president of Elite\u2019s European division, G\u00e9rald Marie. For the swimwear round, judges including Trump and Casablancas sat at a table in one of the Plaza\u2019s palatial rooms, rating the teenage models. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable, standing there in my bathing suit,\u201d recalls Wilkes. She says that at one stage of the contest the judges said she should lose weight: \u201cIt felt like they were ganging up on me.\u201d</p> <p>The contestant who came third in 1991 was Kate Dillon, then 17. Dillon, who went on to become a successful plus-sized model, says that many of her fellow competitors were \u201cfrom places that were very poor. I came from a family that had means, so it was something fun to do for a week to get out of school \u2013 but a lot of these girls were desperate.\u201d She recalls various \u201cafter-hours\u201d events over the course of the five-day competition. \u201cIt was very clear that there were opportunities to go out and party with Donald,\u201d she says. The contestants were led to believe \u201cthat if you were nice to certain people, good things will happen to you, and I think that\u2019s why girls were going out\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every time we changed, Trump would find a reason to come backstage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The behind-the-scenes footage seen by the Guardian shows brief snippets of the future president mingling with the Look of the Year models. At an evening reception, he seems to play the role of host, moving regally around the Plaza\u2019s ornate rooms in a suit and tie, talking to VIP guests and contestants. \u201cHow\u2019s the Canadian contestants?\u201d he asks, before moving over to a handful of Canadian would-be models and introducing himself. At another point, he circulates on the top deck of the Spirit of New York as the boat prepares to depart. Wearing a billowing cream blazer, pink open-neck shirt and oversized baseball cap, Trump grins while posing for photographs and chatting to several girls. One tells him she is just finishing school.</p> <p>Some former contestants recall him being there as they got dressed for events. \u201cEvery time we changed, it was like Trump would find a reason to come backstage,\u201d Wilkes says. A Canadian contestant from 1992 recalls similar incidents. \u201cHe\u2019d come by and say, \u2018Hey girls, are we ready?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking, what have I got myself into?\u201d Trump denies, \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d, behaving inappropriately with any Look of the Year contestants. His representatives say he was not aware of any predatory environment at the time.</p> <p>Others, however, observed a disturbing side to the contest. Ohad Oman, a young reporter for a magazine in Tel Aviv, was sent to cover it in 1991 and 1992. He attended a number of the after-parties, and remembers seeing girls drinking alcohol. He recalls one particularly debauched party, telling the Guardian: \u201cI saw girls sitting on guys\u2019 laps, and I remember one guy putting his hand down a girl\u2019s top. I remember thinking they were younger than me, and I was 17 going on 18.\u201d (The legal drinking age is 21 in the US.)</p> <p>Others who were present recall underage models being served alcohol at the contest. Trump\u2019s representatives say he did not provide alcohol to contestants, or encourage any models, whether below the drinking age or not, to drink alcohol, stressing he \u201cdoes not drink alcohol and does not encourage others to do so\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b/0_0_1366_820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behind the scenes footage from 'Look of the year'</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</p></li> </ul> <p>The finale of the 1991 competition was a glittering black-tie gala in the Plaza\u2019s ballroom. Casablancas and supermodel Naomi Campbell presented, as 10 finalists went through a series of costume changes, walking across a stage decorated with columns of sunflowers. Trump sat on the front row alongside a roster of celebrities, his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka perched on his knee.</p> <p>Ingrid Seynhaeve, an 18-year-old from Belgium, was crowned the winner. As the evening drew to a close, Seynhaeve was surrounded by photographers. Guests filtered out of the ballroom as a party got going in another of the Plaza\u2019s grand rooms. In the newly uncovered footage, a man can be heard off-camera, saying: \u201cCome on, babes. Let\u2019s get some liquor in you.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the months before and after the contests, Elite sent several of its teenage models to Milan, New York or Paris on assignments, usually by themselves. Shawna Lee, the 14-year-old from Canada who felt pressured to perform on the Spirit of New York in 1992, had spent the previous summer in Paris, working for Elite. She recalls days at castings, and nights out partying, including at the legendary Les Bains Douches nightclub.</p> <p>After one drunken night at the club, one of the first times she had drunk alcohol, she says a senior executive at Elite offered her a ride home on his motorbike. G\u00e9rald Marie, then in his early 40s, was head of Elite\u2019s Paris office, a powerful figure in the fashion industry and a 1991 Look of the Year judge. Lee accepted the offer. \u201cI was like, OK, sure, because I was always relying on whoever to get me home,\u201d she says. But she alleges that, rather than taking her home, Marie brought her to his apartment and told her to come to his bedroom. Lee says she initially refused, asking about his wife. She says Marie responded: \u201cOh no, just come and sleep in the bed with me, don\u2019t worry,\u201d and she relented. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know, I just went.\u201d</p> <p>Lee says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a> has emboldened her to talk about what happened next. It was her first sexual experience. \u201cI just froze,\u201d she says. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Looking back 30 years later, she feels she was taken advantage of. \u201cI just felt really pressured,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really young and I was manipulated.\u201d She told a friend what had happened, and this soon got back to Elite\u2019s agents. \u201cThey all knew something went down, but they downplayed it,\u201d says Lee, who is now 42 and works as a makeup artist in Toronto. \u201cIt was just understood that it was in my best interest to walk away from it and brush it under the rug.\u201d</p> <p>Questions about Marie\u2019s alleged mistreatment of teenage models are not new. In 2000, New York magazine reported that two of Elite\u2019s senior women executives had pleaded with both Casablancas and Marie to <a href=\"https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/columns/citypolitic/1866/\" title=\"\">stop sleeping with underage models</a>, but had been ignored. (\u201cWe are men,\u201d Marie reportedly said. \u201cWe have our needs.\u201d) In 2011, the Elite supermodel and actor Carr\u00e9 Otis alleged that Marie had repeatedly raped her when she was a 17-year-old model in Paris in the 1980s. Two years ago, another Elite model, Ebba Karlsson, accused Marie of raping her when she was 21.</p> <p>Marie did not respond to a formal letter from the Guardian, but in a brief phone call insisted he had never sexually assaulted any models, and denied the specific allegations levelled against him by Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, I don\u2019t know this person,\u201d he said. \u201cAllegations like this are becoming too easy to make. Frankly, it hurts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1/0_18_1975_2468/800.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the competition final in 1991\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final. Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>Other men closely involved in Look of the Year during this period have been accused of sexual misconduct by former contestants. Some allegations are contained in legal proceedings filed decades ago; others have been shared for the first time with the Guardian. The newspaper has decided not to publish some of these allegations, at the request of the women involved.</p> <p>One allegation already made public concerns David Copperfield, an associate of both Casablancas and Trump, who judged Look of the Year in 1988 and 1991, and once dated another Elite supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. Two years ago, as the #MeToo movement reverberated through the entertainment industry, he was the subject of allegations by Brittney Lewis, a 17-year-old contestant in the 1988 Look of the Year, held in Japan. According to her account, published on the <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/david-copperfield-accused-drugging-assaulting-17-year-old-model-1988/\" title=\"\">entertainment news website The Wrap</a>, Copperfield invited her to a show in California after she had returned home to Utah. Lewis alleged that she saw Copperfield pour something into her glass and then blanked out, but says she retained hazy recollections of him sexually assaulting her in his hotel room. Copperfield stated on Twitter at the time that he had been \u201cfalsely accused\u201d in the past, and was now having to \u201cweather another storm\u201d. He added: \u201cPlease for everyone\u2019s sake, don\u2019t rush to judgment.\u201d In response to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the alleged assault, his representatives said that the claims were false and seriously defamatory.</p> <p>Several of the 1991 contestants recall Copperfield behaving in a way that now strikes them as inappropriate. Stacy Wilkes says Copperfield called the hotel room she was sharing with another 15-year-old contestant, inviting the other girl to his room. Another remembers translating a phone call from Copperfield into Spanish so he could invite a teenage contestant to his hotel room. Aimee Bendio, who was a 14-year-old Look of the Year contestant in 1991, says Copperfield and his assistant contacted her at her family home several times after she took part in the contest, \u201cchecking in to see how my career was going\u201d. She says the magician invited her to his shows, offering to send a limousine, but she declined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A 14-year-old contestant says Copperfield contacted her family home several times afterwards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f/0_479_9102_5459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca/295_0_1401_1751/800.jpg\" alt=\"Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York in 1991, the year he was a judge</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer.

Copperfield categorically denies behaving inappropriately with any contestants at any time.</p> <p>In the early 90s, Look of the Year contestants who secured modelling contracts with Elite were introduced to a fledgling financial advisory firm, Star Capital Management. It was run by an associate of Casablancas, David Weil. Housed at Elite\u2019s Manhattan offices, and an official sponsor of Look of the Year, Weil\u2019s company advertised its services in the 1991 competition programme with a photograph of a small girl dressed in adult clothing and jewellery, alongside the marketing line: \u201cJust like you, we\u2019re not just another pretty face.\u201d</p> <p>By the following year, Star Capital Management was handling millions of dollars earned by Elite\u2019s models. The business soon caught the attention of federal authorities, who later accused Weil and his business partner of stealing at least $1.2m from their clients. In 1998, Weil pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. He also pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 15-year-old model he had met at Look of the Year in 1992.</p> <p>Weil was sentenced to serve weekends in prison for three months, and required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Mark Lawless, a New York lawyer who brought a civil fraud case against Star Capital Management on behalf of the 1991 Look of the Year winner Ingrid Seynhaeve and others, says that when he inspected its office, he found an adjoining bedroom. One of the desk\u2019s drawers, he recalls, contained \u201cbullets and condoms\u201d. Weil declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.</p> <p>Four years after Weil\u2019s conviction, in 2002, Casablancas faced his own set of accusations in the civil courts. A former Look of the Year contestant, known only as Jane Doe 44, filed a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73174/strokes-singers-dad-named-in-sex-abuse-suit\" title=\"\">accusing him of repeatedly sexually abusing her</a>, beginning when she was 15. The abuse began, according to the lawsuit, at Look of the Year 1988 in Japan, where Casablancas told Doe he was \u201cfalling in love\u201d with her. At the end of the competition, the lawsuit states, \u201ccontestants drank and partied late into the evening\u201d and Casablancas told the teenager to come to his hotel room. There, Casablancas sexually abused the girl \u201cseveral times over the evening\u201d. The abuse allegedly continued the following year; when the girl became pregnant, Casablancas told her \u201cshe would be having an abortion\u201d. The abortion was allegedly \u201carranged and paid for\u201d by Elite. Casablancas was 46 at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848/157_245_1343_1678/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant <br><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant. Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>The lawsuit also alleged that Casablancas \u201cengaged in a pattern of seducing, sexually exploiting and/or abusing minor girls, including girls as young as 14 or 15 years old\u201d. But in 2003, the Los Angeles superior court dismissed the claims against him because he did not live in California, where it had been filed. At the time, a lawyer for Casablancas said the allegations were without merit.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s representatives have told the Guardian he denies in the strongest possible terms having any knowledge at the time that Casablancas allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with Look of the Year contestants, including those who were under the age of consent, or that Casablancas allegedly enabled others to exploit or abuse teenage models.</p> <p>But Casablancas\u2019 sexual interest in teenage girls predated this period. His marriage to his second wife, Danish model Jeanette Christiansen, ended in 1983 when it emerged that he was having an affair with a 15-year-old model, Stephanie Seymour. Casablancas, who was in his early 40s at the time, later described Seymour as a \u201cwoman-child\u201d. He met his third wife, Brazilian model Aline Wermelinger, in 1992, when she was a Look of the Year contestant staying at Trump\u2019s Plaza. They married the following year; Casablancas was 51 and she was 17.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>By his own account, Donald Trump got to know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\" title=\"\">financier Jeffrey Epstein</a> in the late 1980s. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with,\u201d Trump famously told New York magazine in 2002. \u201cIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d After Epstein was charged with the sex trafficking of underage girls last year, the president distanced himself, telling reporters he knew the financier \u201clike everybody in Palm Beach knew him\u201d, but hadn\u2019t spoken to him in 15 years. \u201cI was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he had \u201ckicked Mr Epstein out\u201d of Mar-a-Lago for acting inappropriately towards staff.</p> <p>Photographs of Trump with Epstein, who owned a house near Mar-a-Lago, were widely circulated in the wake of the financier\u2019s arrest last year. Renewed attention was also given to a deposition by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was first approached by Epstein\u2019s friend, the British socialite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/ghislaine-maxwell-woman-accused-jeffrey-epstein-groom-girls\" title=\"\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 1999.</p> <p>It also appears that Epstein had a Casablancas connection during the 1990s. According to a lawsuit filed in the US three months ago, in 1990 Casablancas sent a teenage model for her first \u201ccasting call\u201d at a residential address on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, to meet a \u201cphotographer\u201d who, it turned out, was Epstein. The lawsuit states that Epstein ordered the 15-year-old girl to undress before taking photographs of her, pushing her against a wall and sexually assaulting her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

Houraney says that Trump asked him to organise a party that month with some of his pageant\u2019s finalists, promising to invite heads of modelling agencies and prospective sponsors for his competition. \u201cHe had me fly in all these girls, and gave me a $30,000 budget for airfares and limos to pick them up at the airport,\u201d he says. \u201cThe girls were all decked out, expecting to meet all these VIPs.\u201d But after an hour at the party, Houraney says, there seemed to be only one other guest: Epstein. \u201cI was like, \u2018Donald, where are the guys? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019\u201d Houraney says he realised \u201cthis is a Jeff Epstein party, basically\u201d.</p> <p>While suspicious of Epstein, Houraney was keen to have Trump as a business partner. A month earlier, in December 1992, Trump had met with Houraney and Jill Harth, who ran the pageant together. They were looking for a new sponsor for their contest, which each year saw models aged 16 to 22 compete to appear in wall calendars wearing bikinis and swimsuits while posing with classic cars. At dinner in the Plaza\u2019s Oak Room, Harth, Houraney and Trump discussed moving the American Dream competition from Las Vegas to one of Trump\u2019s casinos. \u201cHe wanted to build this into the biggest, the best thing that he could do. He was talking about television and pulling out all the contacts,\u201d Harth later said. Eventually, the pageant was held at Trump Castle in Atlantic City in November 1993, but for one year only.</p> <p>The partnership soured and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\" title=\"\">ended in two lawsuits</a>, but for Trump it was a prelude to a series of more lucrative ventures in the beauty business. In 1996, he secured what the New York Daily News described as \u201chis most beautiful deal yet\u201d. After months of negotiations, Trump acquired the Miss Universe Organization in a reported $10m deal that handed him control of three large, well-established pageants: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. Three years later, he founded Trump Model Management, poaching many staff from Elite.</p> <p>For Wolfgang Schwarz, a veteran model agent in Austria who worked closely with Casablancas, and met Trump at the Plaza in the early 90s, Trump\u2019s decision to establish his own agency was about him wanting his own private source for models. \u201cIf you have your own agency and you\u2019re the owner, you can tell your bookers to make a party,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier than calling 15 agencies in New York.\u201d Trump\u2019s representatives say he entered the modelling industry because it was a \u201cvery profitable\u201d business opportunity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3/0_16_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346/26_0_2723_3402/800.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Kate Dillon, in behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 contest</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14. Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>The Miss Universe deal allowed Trump to realise his ambition of turning a pageant into an international televised event. In 1997, he <a href=\"https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/cbs-trump-ink-beauty-of-a-partnership-1117433243/\" title=\"\">sold a 50% stake in the business to CBS</a>. Five years later, amid a slump in the Miss Universe ratings, Trump brokered a deal with NBC that led to the launch of The Apprentice in 2004.</p> <p>The move into reality TV positioned Trump as a heavyweight tycoon with a significant media profile. In many ways, it was a natural progression from his involvement in beauty contests and pageants. Where once he had judged young models, whose hopes, rivalries and insecurities became TV storylines in Fox\u2019s Look of the Year documentary, now he was ruthlessly separating aspiring business people into winners and losers. </p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Three decades on from the contests at Trump\u2019s Plaza, it is striking to reflect on the diverging fortunes of those who attended. Many of the powerful men Casablancas brought on board to help judge the girls thrived in the years that followed. G\u00e9rald Marie is now the chairman of a prestigious model agency in Paris, Oui Management. Although Marie told the Guardian he had retired, his LinkedIn page lists his responsibilities at the \u201cthriving newcomer\u201d agency as scouting for and managing talent. Oui Management did not respond to our request for comment.<strong> </strong>David Copperfield remains a prominent entertainer, with a current residency at the MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas.</p> <p>The fortunes of the teenagers who took part have been mixed. Some became successful models, Hollywood actors and TV hosts, while many more lived quieter lives. Ingrid Seynhaeve, the 1991 winner, became a face of Ralph Lauren and Dior, hosted Belgium\u2019s Topmodel TV show, and continues to front high-profile campaigns. Other contestants we spoke to include a beautician, a stay\u2013at\u2013home mother, a makeup artist, a yoga teacher and a bus driver.</p> <p>In 1992, the crown went to one of Look of the Year\u2019s youngest contenders: 14-year-old Mariann Molski. Months after her victory, a profile in the Chicago Tribune reported that the sporty high school student was \u201con the brink of a career of a kind that most young women only dream about\u201d. While she had some success as a model, it is not clear what happened to her in the years that followed; US public records indicate multiple arrests for probation violations, alcohol offences and prostitution, though there is nothing to say she was ever charged. Molski\u2019s current whereabouts are unknown, but she is believed to have been homeless in Arizona.</p> <p>After years of financial mismanagement, Elite was forced into bankruptcy in 2004. The Elite brand continues to be used by two separate agencies, owned by different corporate entities. One is Creative World Management, which bought the New York division in 2004. It strongly distances itself from the Casablancas-owned firm and era, saying it \u201cutterly\u201d condemns the kinds of \u201cdeplorable behaviour\u201d alleged to have taken place in the past.</p> <p>The other inheritor of the brand is Elite World Group, which operates the successor to Look of the Year, a similar global contest for the next top young model, called <a href=\"https://elitemodellook.com/int/en/home/index.htm\" title=\"\">Elite Model Look</a>. It, too, distances itself from the Casablancas era. \u201cWe would have no tolerance for the conduct you\u2019ve described,\u201d the company told the Guardian. \u201cEmpowering our models and protecting their safety is our foremost priority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e/93_299_8923_5358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af/0_534_8907_5344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year</p></li> </ul> <p>John Casablancas retired in Brazil in the early 2000s. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 2013, aged 70, long before the #MeToo movement heralded a new standard of accountability for powerful men accused of exploiting women and girls. He never got to see his old associate Donald Trump ascend to the White House, despite a cascade of allegations about Trump\u2019s own treatment of women. There are now <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T\">at least 25 sexual misconduct allegations</a> against the president, ranging from unwanted advances and harassment to serious sexual assaults. More than half relate to models or pageant contestants. Trump denies that he has ever behaved in a predatory or inappropriate fashion with any women or girls. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian 30 years on, several former Look of the Year contestants feel that a #MeToo moment for the modelling world is long overdue. \u201cThe girls are young and they look at these agents like parental figures, and they\u2019re not,\u201d says Shawna Lee. \u201cAnything they say goes, whether it\u2019s \u2018Go cut your hair\u2019, \u2018Go wear this dress\u2019. It\u2019s too bad that there were not more consequences for these men.\u201d</p> <p>After Look of the Year 1991, Stacy Wilkes returned to Louisville and quit school, despite having told the judges she would finish. \u201cI thought that was the reason I lost,\u201d she says, \u201cso I might as well leave if I want to make it as a model. We were really broke, so I thought I\u2019d try and make money for my mom, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d She is content with the path her life took, living in Louisville with her partner and three cats, but adds that women were raising concerns at the time and were ignored: \u201cI think models from the 90s tried so hard, over and over, and nobody believed what we had to say.\u201d</p> <p>Kate Dillon, now a businesswoman living in Seattle, remembers the contest as one that \u201cexploited women\u2019s assets, women\u2019s bodies. A lot of these girls were desperate. They thought modelling was about attracting men, which it isn\u2019t.\u201d There was a climate of opportunism, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the men were like, \u2018Yes, Look of the Year week, let\u2019s make sure my schedule is clear to have chicks over to my apartment.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great is that we now have a language, and a precedent of young people saying: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to let this continue\u2019,\u201d Dillon adds. \u201cThey would never accept being treated the way I was.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p><em>The Guardian will continue to investigate the issues raised in this story.

His immediate predecessors rose through the ranks at the bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street offices.</p> <p>Carney \u2013 who holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenship \u2013 was a polished technocrat with an international pedigree, described by the former chancellor George Osborne, who courted him for a year, as \u201cthe outstanding central banker of his generation\u201d.</p> <p>Carney, now 54, arrived on UK soil following a spectacular rise that included a five-and-a-half year stint as governor of Canada\u2019s central bank and 13 years at the investment bank Goldman Sachs before that.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/andrew-bailey-appointed-head-of-bank-of-england\">hands back the reins to Andrew Bailey</a>, a Bank of England lifer, who must wield the central bank\u2019s considerable resources to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus.</p> <p>Here we look back at five key moments in Carney\u2019s BoE career:</p> <h2><strong>Forward guidance</strong></h2> <p>When he took over from Mervyn King in 2013, Carney was determined to give businesses, consumers and financial markets a clear view of the bank\u2019s interest rate policy. Specifically, he wanted to show how the bank\u2019s base rate would move looking two years ahead. Already a popular concept in the US, forward guidance took over from the bank\u2019s traditional assessment of what to do that month based on the available data.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/07/bank-of-engand-links-interest-rates-jobless-target\">At his first quarterly inflation report meeting</a> in August 2013, he said a fall in unemployment from 7.8% to below 7% would trigger a rise in interest rates from their then all-time low of 0.5%.</p> <p>But unemployment quickly tumbled below 7% without any discernible jump in wages \u2013 which would have pushed up inflation and triggered a rate rise. Carney, the outsider, had misread the flexibility of the UK labour market and how fragile workers felt after the financial crash.</p> <p>A year later, the Labour MP Pat McFadden, a member of the Treasury select committee, accused Carney of behaving like an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d. Carney was a man who promised much and delivered very little, he said. It was a cruel jibe that stuck. Carney has never backed down, however. He defended forward guidance at his last appearance before MPs earlier this month.</p> <h2><strong>Project Fear</strong></h2> <p>The outgoing governor has been a lightning rod in the Brexit debate. Accused by Brexiters of abandoning the political neutrality expected of him and backing the remain campaign, he was admonished in the spring of 2016 as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/20/brexit-eu-referendum-economy-project-fear\">Project Fear</a>\u201d figurehead because of his repeated warnings about the negative economic impact of leaving the EU.</p> <p>The row continued after the referendum. He clashed with the rightwing European Research Group, and in 2017 was branded an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/25/bank-of-england-chief-mark-carney-is-enemy-of-brexit-says-jacob-rees-mogg\">enemy of Brexit</a>\u201d by its leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg. After the Bank warned in November 2018 that a no-deal Brexit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/28/economic-forecasts-strike-blow-to-theresa-mays-brexit-deal\">could trigger a recession</a> worse than the 2008 financial crisis, Carney was blasted on the front page of the Telegraph for unleashing \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/29/project-hysteria-how-the-papers-covered-mark-carneys-brexit-forecast\">Project Hysteria</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In an intervention undermining Carney\u2019s authority, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mervyn-king\">Lord King</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/29/uk-should-leave-eu-with-no-deal-says-former-bank-of-england-governor\">urged MPs to pursue a no-deal Brexit</a>, saying it would have little impact on the British economy in the long run.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit vote</strong></h2> <p>Carney\u2019s immediate reaction to the leave vote in June 2016 was feted by nervous investors.</p> <p>Dubbed \u201cthe only adult in the room\u201d at the time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/interest-rate-cut-likely-brexit-bank-of-england-mark-carney\">he was the first to react</a> when early economic indicators showed business confidence falling through the floor. He stepped in days after the vote on 30 June to say an interest rate cut was needed to steady the ship. Jittery financial markets rallied and stability was restored. The bank\u2019s monetary policy committee duly delivered a rate cut a few weeks later.</p> <p>While Carney did sound the alarm before the EU referendum about a recession that never ultimately materialised, his other warnings about the negative economic consequences have come to pass: the pound crashed, inflation spiked, economic growth slowed and the average household has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/14/brexit-has-cost-uk-economy-at-least-80bn-since-vote-bank-of-england-rate-setter\">left worse off</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Environment</strong></h2> <p>Carney\u2019s drive to push the climate emergency up the world\u2019s agenda stakes his claim for a lasting legacy. The governor first sounded the alarm over the risks to financial markets and the global economy in a speech in 2015, when he warned about the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/29/carney-warns-of-risks-from-climate-change-tragedy-of-the-horizon\">tragedy of the horizon</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In a landmark speech to the insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London, he said the world was running out of time to deal with global heating as the risks mounted from extreme weather events.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/22/carney-sides-with-greta-thunberg-against-trump-over-climate\">Carney sides with Greta Thunberg against Trump over climate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before Carney, central banks had typically kept away from climate issues. However, the Bank\u2019s governor used a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/17/mark-carney-tells-global-banks-they-cannot-ignore-climate-change-dangers\">letter to the Guardian</a> in 2019 to warn that the financial system faces an existential threat, placing the issue squarely on the agenda for global central banks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/18/uk-banks-insurers-climate-crisis-stress-tests-bank-of-england\">Stress tests</a> on banks\u2019 climate risks, proposed and developed on Carney\u2019s watch, will take place next year under Bailey. Although he is leaving the Bank, Carney will advise Boris Johnson on climate-related financial risks for the Cop26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow later this year.</p> <h2><strong>Coronavirus</strong></h2> <p>The biggest challenge for the world economy since the financial crisis hit just as the governor was preparing to leave. Carney used his final week in charge to launch an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-bank-of-england-makes-emergency-interest-rate-cut\">emergency interest rate cut</a> \u2013 the first since the 2008 credit crunch \u2013 slashing borrowing costs in a coordinated move alongside Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\">first budget</a> as chancellor.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25%, taking the key determinant of borrowing costs for households and businesses to the lowest level in the Bank\u2019s 325-year history.</p> <p>In a double-headed press conference alongside Bailey, he said the economic shock from the coronavirus would be large but ultimately temporary, as nations step up their response to the disease.</p> <p>Stock markets around the world crashed the following day by the most since Black Monday in October 1987, amid widespread investor panic over the dwindling chances of a quick recovery in the global economy.</p>",
  "<p>It was just before 9am and the sky was overcast when a small group of reporters were suddenly ushered through the White House\u2019s south portico. They gathered in <a href=\"http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/diplomatic-room.htm\">the diplomatic reception room,</a> once home to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfireside chats\u201d, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn \u2013 more than three times what the president himself had requested \u2013 and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing very well,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut it\u2019s an unforeseen problem. What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: \u201cHow do you keep people from panicking?\u201d Trump\u2019s response in part: \u201cCalm. You have to be calm. It\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p> \n<p>It has not gone away.</p> \n<p>A week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths. The stock market suffered its worst percentage drop since the 1987 Wall Street crash. On Wednesday night alone, Trump announced a travel ban on most of Europe during an Oval Office address, the National Basketball Association suspended its season and it emerged the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson had tested positive. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-401d8f45-603c-4491-9c4b-8c27d14f3a4b.html?chunk=0&amp;utm_term=emshare#story0\">The New York Post\u2019s front page headline</a> declared: A world turned upside down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is at such moments of peril that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/president-leadership-crisis.html\">a nation looks to its leader</a> for reassurance and direction.

The NSC\u2019s global health security chief, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, was fired the day after an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year intelligence agencies warned that the US remained vulnerable to the next flu pandemic but Trump, it seems, hoped that his long streak of political luck would hold.</p> \n<p>Distracted by impeachment in January, the president showed little urgency when the coronavirus exploded in China, apparently unwilling to sour his relationship with authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, whom he praised for having the outbreak \u201ctotally under control\u201d even as it raced across that country and beyond.</p> \n<p>The White House did impose a limited travel ban on China but that alone was not enough.

Even then, he urged aides, including Kellyanne Conway and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to go on television and preach confidence, according to five White House officials and Republicans <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-11/analysis-facing-virus-outbreak-trumps-tactics-fall-short\">interviewed by the Associated Press.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"538cecca-7ee7-4bb8-bf40-77cbda8b4dd3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W8Py8qaAV4M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was \u201cvery much under control\u201d and infections were \u201cgoing very substantially down, not up\u201d. On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be \u201cclose to zero\u201d.</p> \n<p>He also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as \u201ctheir new hoax\u201d, promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">usual playbook of deny and distract</a> proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Robert Shrum,</a> a Democratic strategist and political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cBefore it happened, he dismantled a lot of the preparedness that had been put in place under Obama and Ron Klain [Ebola czar] and Joe Biden, I suppose because they were things Obama had done so he wanted to get rid of them, like the Paris climate accords.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd since then he has over and over again contradicted his own health people and at one point tried to muzzle them. He called the coronavirus \u2018a Democratic hoax\u2019 and then they ran out to explain, \u2018No, no, the hoax was that they were blaming Trump for not handling it well\u2019. Well, I think almost universally people would say Trump has not handled this well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if Trump tried to dismiss the health statistics, he could not ignore the financial markets, an obsession he has made central to his reelection. He put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of a coronavirus task force, demoting Health Secretary Alex Azar, but continued to get in the way of the message.</p> \n<p>Soon after signing the congressional funding bill last Friday, Trump donned a \u201cKeep America great\u201d campaign cap and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/us-coronavirus-death-toll-washington-state\">visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> in Atlanta. In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a \u201csnake\u201d, praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this.</p> \n<p>But on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single worst day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person.</p> \n<p>Trump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government\u2019s top public health experts, testified: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RapD4-7uAbg\">\u201cBottom line, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d</a></p> \n<p>The president tried to provide further reassurance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">only his second Oval Office address</a> on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the \u201cforeign virus\u201d. He also failed to explain how tests will become available and committed factual errors the White House was forced to hastily correct.</p> \n<p>Susan Rice, former national security adviser, tweeted simply: \u201cOMG.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eight months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">from a presidential election,</a> the virus has jeopardised Trump\u2019s central reelection argument \u2013 a strong economy \u2013 just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage by offering stability and a safe pair of hands.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThe most calming and reassuring presidential voice of the past 24 hours has been Joe Biden.

He falls on his face.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vela, an LGBTQ and Latino activist and board director at TransparentBusiness, added: \u201cWe\u2019re walking around in ghost towns. Kids aren\u2019t going to school. Not enough people are getting tested.

  "<p>As Ronald and Eva Weissberger boarded the cruise ship bound for Hawaii, the couple were looking forward to the trip of a lifetime.</p> <p>The Weissbergers, the 74- and 69-year-olds from Florida, had heard stories about the boat\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan and ultimately resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">more than 700 </a>confirmed cases of coronavirus. But to them, the Diamond Princess \u201cseemed like a world away\u201d, says the couple\u2019s son-in-law, Jason Chalik.</p> <p>Little did they know, what would start as a 15-night cruise through paradise would turn into a waking nightmare for the 3,500 people on board.</p> <p>As passengers headed up the gangway to the Grand Princess and toward their rooms on 21 February they had no idea that a 75-year-old man from Placer county, California \u2013 who\u2019d stepped off the boat in San Francisco \u2013 was carrying Covid-19, the novel coronavirus that, by Friday afternoon, had infected more than 2,000 Americans and killed more than 40.</p> <p>The cruise ship they boarded has since become the center of a dramatic US crisis that has forced national and state governments to take measures that seemed unimaginable even a week ago. It has also become a potent symbol for everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">America\u2019s woeful lack of test kits</a>, which had to be flown in by helicopter, to the racial politics of who will shoulder the burden of the outbreak.</p> <p>Between the boat\u2019s departure and its return, the nation\u2019s handling of the virus would shift entirely. The World Health Organization declared the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">outbreak a pandemic</a>. Markets tumbled.

More likely, they said, he was already infected when he stepped aboard the ship, indicating the new coronavirus had been spreading onshore for longer than anyone knew.</p> <p>Genetic researchers <a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/national/scientist-links-state-outbreaks-with-genetic-fingerprints/article_796b09fb-2241-50e0-84e5-5712d7081d34.html\">this week</a> traced the virus that infected passengers on the Grand Princess to the same family tree of infections that spread through a cluster of patients in Washington state and likely originated from a patient who had traveled to Wuhan, China. The finding suggests an infected person may have traveled from Washington to California and had contact with the someone who boarded the ship.</p> <p>What is certain, however, is that the 75-old-year old Placer county man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on 4 March \u2013 the first death in California attributed to the virus.</p> <p>About 60 passengers who traveled with him to Mexico stayed on the ship\u2019s next journey to Hawaii, mixing with other passengers.</p> <p>Passengers had little reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary until the ship slowly started canceling events: first, the shows that drew large crowds, then the smaller events like music or dancing lessons that keep passengers busy at sea.</p> <p>The morning of 4 March, the same day the Placer county man died at a hospital, Grand Princess officials told the 60 passengers who traveled with him they\u2019d need to stay in their rooms until they could be screened for symptoms.</p> <p>Still, most were allowed to carry on, catching sun on the Lido deck and visiting with their shipmates.</p> <p>The elderly Weissbergers were playing cards with friends when news of the potential outbreak reached their daughter and son-in-law back in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cWe called [the Weissbergers] and asked if they were quarantined,\u201d said son-in-law Chalik, an attorney who has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/grand-princess-cruise-coronavirus-lawsuit\">in a lawsuit filed</a> on the couple\u2019s behalf, accusing the Princess Cruises of gross negligence for its \u201clackadaisical\u201d response to the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018No, we\u2019re playing bridge\u2019,\u201d Chalik recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it.

Cars honked, passengers whooped and cheered as the boat passed underneath San Francisco\u2019s iconic Golden Gate bridge.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew we were headed toward shore,\u201d said Rex Lawson, 86, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, 81. \u201cEverybody was very happy when we pulled under the bridge, they were out on their balcony, yelling and clapping\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dcd9e888e271537ab561a6dac1cab514fa0ad39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dcd9e888e271537ab561a6dac1cab514fa0ad39/0_0_2348_1464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on the Grand Princess wave as the ship approaches Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers on the Grand Princess wave as the ship approaches Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst, it seemed, was over. But still to overcome was was the colossal task of moving thousands of passengers, an untold number of whom had been infected, off the boat and onto buses, where they\u2019d be transported to hospitals, hotels or military bases for 14 days of quarantine.</p> <p>On Monday morning, just before the Grand Princess pulled in, trucks rumbled to and from the docks along the shoreline like any other day. Four large private passenger buses waited to transport the possibly-infected passengers.</p> <p>Passengers disembarked by order of priority, those with acute medical needs first. Officials said it could take up to three days to unload everybody. But by Friday, five days after the Grand Princess first docked, 14 international passengers still remained on board. Officials said they\u2019d be there at least through the weekend while their home countries arranged transportation.</p> <p>The boat\u2019s 1,000-plus crew is expected to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-infected-crew-members-kept-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-2020-3\">remain on board </a>under quarantine while officials determine a place to dock for good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Munsch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Quarantine issues emerge</h2> <p>Prince Cruises declined to be interviewed for this story, saying that currently \u201call team members are focused on the situation at hand and the well-being of our guests\u201d.</p> <p>But complaints quickly started mounting from passengers concerned that recommended <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html\">quarantine protocols</a> weren\u2019t being followed.

There were no hand-washing stations available in the food areas and the passengers had to serve themselves coffee using their bare hands on the coffee dispenser, she said.</p> <p>On 10 March, the day the Grand Princess first reached Oakland, passengers received an official document under their cabin doors that read: \u201cOnce you arrive at the military installation, you may choose to be tested for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>But Morse said that when she and her husband asked to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday, they were told no tests were available.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not testing us. On the ship they gave us a paper that said we would be tested. When we got here (three days ago), they took our temperatures instead,\u201d Morse said.</p> <p>Heckert, also quarantined at Travis air force base, said on Thursday that her family hadn\u2019t been tested, either.</p> <p>Congressman John Garamendi on Thursday filed a complaint with the federal department of Health and Human Services on Morse\u2019s behalf. It was only then, Morse said, that staff began delivering food to passenger\u2019s rooms instead of having them line up to grab plastic boxes from tall stacks.</p> <p>\u201cWe were better off on the ship,\u201d Morse said, adding that cruise ship staff left food outside their door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c/0_0_3836_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eric Olsen, a spokesman for Rep Garamendi, said the congressman sent pictures of the food distribution problems to HHS, which is running the quarantine.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to health guidelines, you\u2019re supposed to be separating people in their rooms,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIf someone is Covid-19 positive, this (mingling) is going to spread the disease. These people are supposed to be getting ready to be released to the public.\u201d</p> <p>As spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: \u201cOur number one priority was to screen passengers for symptoms, address any underlining health conditions, make sure they had access to their prescription medication, and get them settled into their rooms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis unprecedented response has raised many significant logistical challenges. We have assigned case managers to each of the guests to individually address their needs. We recognize this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can to passengers.\u201d </p> <p>For 86-year-old Rex Lawson, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, the experience hasn\u2019t soured his travel plans forever. His children told him he\u2019s never going on another cruise, but he said it\u2019s hard pass up the free trip Princess Cruises has offered him and his wife.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t say never,\u201d Lawson said.</p> <p>But he might be out a partner. He asked his wife if they might use the free ticket in the future. She\u2019d told him that next time, he\u2019d have to go by himself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Erin McCormick and Vivian Ho contributed reporting</p></li> </ul>",

From Monday, gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned. The chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> has just said this has put Australia in a good position.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are starting these measures perhaps a little bit before some have said they are needed. We in Australia want to flatten that curve and keep this under really tight control. We do not want to see rapid increases like we have seen in some parts of the world.

Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing.</p> \n  <p>But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6c28268f085e564ad83ece\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T00:44:46.728Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New Zealand cancels Christchurch shootings remembrance service</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a pragmatic decision.

From Monday, mass-gatherings of more than 500 people will banned, but will not include schools and universities.</p> \n  <p>Until Friday Morrison insisted he would go to the football to see the Shark\u2019s first NRL match, drawing criticism from his opponents and some public health workers. Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers.</p> \n   <p>Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well. But as soon as that advice was clear, I thought it was a gobsmacking lack of judgement for <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> to continue to go to the football, sending a terrible signal and message to the Australian people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Australia\u2019s home affairs minister<strong> Peter Dutton</strong> being tested with coronavirus, Bowen said; \u201cWe wish him the best, this is not a pleasant disease\u201d. However, Bowen said there was \u201ca lack of information before the Australian people, and this confusion makes it worse\u201d.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NeilMcMahon/status/1238622232399638528\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chris Bowen having a press conference now berating the government for the confusion.

These measures include:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Limiting non-essential organised gatherings to fewer than 500 people</li> \n   <li>Limiting non-essential meetings or conferences of critical workforce eg healthcare professionals and emergency services</li> \n   <li>Encouraging all Australians to exercise personal responsibility for social distancing measures</li> \n   <li>Initiating measures to protect vulnerable populations, such as reducing visitors to all residential care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>However schools, universities and shopping centres are not included in the ban.</p> \n  <p>Australian Medical Association president <strong>Dr Tony Bartone</strong> said the evidence around schools \u201ccan be somewhat difficult to interpret clearly, and we need to be understanding and follow the evidence in that respect\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So we will work with, again with the Chief Medical Officer and the other health officers to ensure the timeliness of that. Clearly, where there\u2019s been an outbreak in... the school it\u2019s appropriate that certain schools will be put into quarantine during that time. However, as we get deeper into the evolving pandemic response and effects, we will have to work with the best possible evidence. If we do nothing, if we turn a blind eye, our public hospital system will be overrun, and that is not in the interest of anyone in our community at all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Saturday morning the president of the Australian Primary Principals Association, <strong>Malcolm Elliott</strong>, told the ABC that \u201csome schools are a little more advanced than others\u201d in their preparation.

In the interests of children and the interest of families, social organisation, but what happens now of course is that we are all on tenterhooks. We\u2019re all unsure about what the spread the virus will be, when it might strike particular schools or how widespread this might become and how quickly.

He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system.</li> \n   <li>To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels.</p> \n  <p>Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. </p> \n  <p>One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b72be8f088d7575592b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:49:21.690Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports <strong>Rory Carroll</strong> in Dublin.<br></p> \n  <p>An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">announced restrictions on Thursday</a>.

It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. </p> \n  <p>The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East.
