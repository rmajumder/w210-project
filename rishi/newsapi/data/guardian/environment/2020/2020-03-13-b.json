  "<p>The world\u2019s most powerful central bank, the US Federal Reserve, is preparing a fresh attempt to shore up investor confidence despite a late rally on Wall Street on Friday that ended a torrid week for stock markets on a more positive note.</p> <p>Fresh pledges of help from China, Germany and the European commission combined with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency</a> over coronavirus to reassure investors after an ordeal for equities on both sides of the Atlantic that echoed the depths of the banking crisis.</p> <p>On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 closed 9% higher after Trump\u2019s move, although it was still down almost 9% since Monday. This week started with concerns that the Covid-19 outbreak would bring an end to the sluggish recovery of the past decade and hit company earnings.</p> <p>A day after its worst single trading session since 1987, the FTSE 100 closed up 2.5%, a rise of 129 points to 5,366. Three weeks ago, it closed at 7,404. </p> <p>Despite the surge late on Friday, Wall Street is now braced for the Fed to step up its response to the threat posed to the global economy by the pandemic when it meets in Washington on Wednesday.</p> <p>The US central bank is expected to cut interest rates by at least half a percentage point and announce a fresh wave of the money-creation programme known as quantitative easing as it seeks to revive confidence among traumatised investors.</p> <p>Some analysts predicted that the Fed could go for a full one point off US borrowing costs \u2013 currently running in a range of 1% to 1.25% \u2013 amid fears that growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy could collapse over the coming months as more Americans are infected with the virus.</p> <p>Trump, who triggered Thursday\u2019s market mayhem \u2013 also the worst day on Wall Street since 1987 \u2013 by imposing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/donald-trumps-eu-travel-ban-is-driven-by-politics-not-science-coronavirus\">EU travel ban</a>, stepped up pressure on the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, to act.</p> <p>\u201cThe Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks,\u201d the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238460927328075778\">president tweeted</a>. \u201cJay Powell [the Fed\u2019s chair] and group are putting us at a decided economic &amp; physiological disadvantage.

Our revised forecasts now include recessions in the eurozone and Japan. The US will teeter on the brink of one too.\u201d</p> <p>The consultancy said it was pencilling in global output falling by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the first three three months of 2020, led by contractions in Asia. \u201cThis is not far short of the 1.6% drop in world output seen at the depth of the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008,\u201d it added.</p> <p>Germany spearheaded Europe\u2019s response to the economic damage caused by the coronavirus crisis when it announced \u201cunlimited\u201d aid to see businesses through the difficult times ahead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/mar/12/trump-bid-to-calm-crisis-simply-caused-more-financial-chaos\">Trump's bid to calm crisis simply caused more financial chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government unleashed an initial \u20ac550bn (\u00a3500bn) in government-backed loans, which the economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said was \u201cjust for starters\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has described the coronavirus as \u201ca major shock\u201d to Europe\u2019s economies, as she promised a multi-billion euro fund to handle the fallout. In Europe, stock markets staged a minor recovery, but failed to recover their losses of the past week. </p> <p>The Stoxx 600, Europe\u2019s benchmark index, on Thursday endured a record fall of 11.48%. On Friday shares on the Stoxx gained 1.4%, with Germany\u2019s Dax index rising 0.8% and France\u2019s Cac 40 gaining 1.8%.</p> <p>A day after plunging by a record 17%, the FTSE MIB in Milan regained 7% as Italy \u2013 the European country worst affected by Covid-19 \u2013 banned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/city-watchdog-bans-short-selling-of-italian-and-spanish-shares-juventus-lazio\">short selling on a number of listed companies</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus\">Juventus</a> and Lazio football clubs. Spain imposed similar restrictions, and its Ibex index initially rose strongly, before moderating to an increase of 3.7%.</p> <p>Oil prices also recovered before falling steeply, with Brent crude futures rising before slumping back to $34 a barrel. Analysts polled by Reuters have drastically cut their average forecasts for oil prices over the course of the year, from above $60 a barrel to only $42, amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\">price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia</a>.</p> <p>More central banks on Friday moved to try to prop up their economies.

The European Central Bank (ECB) also took steps to boost lending by eurozone banks, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecbs-plan-to-support-eurozone-banks-is-underwhelming\">markets still took fright</a> as it held interest rates steady.</p> <p>Economists expect the ECB to take further steps in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Luigi Speranza, chief global economist at BNP Paribas, said: \u201cThe lack of an explicit commitment [by the ECB] to do whatever it takes in response to the shock caused by Covid-19 was noticeable.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the ECB is even more likely than before to have to revisit its toolbox in order to re-establish confidence in its determination to deal with the crisis in an effective manner.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>America\u2019s failure to provide quick and easily accessible testing to people suspected to have the coronavirus has been a central thrust of criticism about the US response to the threat from the global pandemic.</p> \n<p>That has left many wondering how the US could have got its coronavirus response so wrong, though it appears that steps are now being taken to try and catch up with the outbreak\u2019s spread.</p> \n<p><strong>The Trump administration is scrambling to provide more testing for Covid-19. What is happening?</strong></p> \n<p>New measures are being introduced that should speed up access to test kits. Roche, the manufacturer of state-of-the-art testing machines that are 10 times faster at getting results than other models, has just been given <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-13/roche-gets-clearance-for-coronavirus-test-that-s-10-times-faster?utm_campaign=news&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_source=applenews\">approval</a> by the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a new coronavirus test which should see 500,000 or so additional kits available from next week. New York state, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, has also been given permission to run its own testing operation using both public and private laboratories.</p> \n<p>At a White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-live-updates-news\">press conference</a> on Friday, Donald Trump said the federal government was working in partnership with private laboratories such as Quest Diagnostics to sharply increase capacity. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba13ce6a-1fc7-45a1-81b1-3dc9c1afeb5f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mOT8pnLvEOc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>All of this is good news, as it is should bring much more testing capacity on stream.</p> \n<p><strong>So now there will be more testing available the crisis is over, right?</strong></p> \n<p>Wrong.</p> \n<p>The US is woefully behind the curve in tackling the novel coronavirus, especially in terms of testing. It is now thought the disease may have first emerged in China as early as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">November</a> though Chinese authorities only revealed the crisis in January. Even so, Trump was only putting crucial elements of the US testing strategy in place on Friday, almost two months after the scale of the danger was fully known. With a virus that is as contagious and lethal for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/covid-19-what-we-know-and-do-not-know-about-the-coronavirus\">vulnerable populations</a> as Covid-19, that is unthinkably slow.</p> \n<p><strong>What explains this abysmal failure?</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cFailure\u201d is right. That\u2019s precisely the word that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, one of the top US officials dealing with the crisis, used to describe the testing fiasco on Thursday.</p> \n<p>A number of problems contributed to the disaster. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is marshaling federal testing, botched its rollout of test kits in February, sending out faulty materials. A bottleneck then ensued, with states all having to send their samples to the CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta for analysis which slowed results down.</p> \n<p>The federal government was also too controlling of the process, preventing states and private laboratories running their own decentralized efforts. The criteria for testing was set far too tightly. Doctors were initially told they could only test people who had traveled to China or had close contact with infected individuals. Only now can doctors freely offer testing, and even so there are simply not enough kits to go round.</p> \n<p><strong>So how bad is the shortfall?</strong></p> \n<p>Extremely bad. A few statistics put it in perspective. South Korea, which is increasingly being seen as a model of good practice, has been testing up to 15,000 people a day \u2013 and has reached more than 230,000 people.</p> \n<p>In the US, the total number of people who have been tested is still only about 11,000. That\u2019s a per capita rate that is about 130 times lower than in South Korea.</p> \n<p>This matters. South Korea\u2019s blanket testing has helped the country turn the corner of the epidemic. The number of new cases reported in South Korea every day is now falling, suggesting good policy and strong leadership can beat the virus. The US had neither.</p> \n<p><strong>Basic question: why is testing important?</strong></p> \n<p>The even more basic answer is that Covid-19 is invisible and can easily go undetected. It also spreads very quickly, and can be passed along by people who themselves have no symptoms. Trying to combat the disease without testing is like running through a forest blindfolded \u2013 it\u2019s not going to end well.</p> \n<p>The only way to get to grips with the disease, experts say, other than locking down entire cities like China and Italy have done, is mass testing. This allows doctors and government to operate on two levels: they can identify carriers of the virus who can then be quarantined until they are no longer infectious, and they can also carry out random sample testing in communities to spot localized outbreaks that can then be targeted as \u201ccontainment zones\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/nyregion/coronavirus-new-rochelle-containment.html\">New Rochelle</a> outside New York city is an example, where the National Guard was sent this week to deliver food to quarantined families.</p> \n<p><strong>How do the tests work?</strong></p> \n<p>Swabs are taken from the mouth or throat and then sent to laboratories. The aim is to gain a match with Covid-19\u2019s genetic sequence. The new Roche test takes only four hours to get results, but earlier versions can take up to 48 hours which slows things down.</p> \n<p><strong>So who is to blame for the lethally late push for testing?</strong></p> \n<p>With a health crisis of this dimension, the buck stops at the top, and that\u2019s Trump. From the outside, medical experts say, he has taken the wrong approach, thinking of Covid-19 as an outside threat to be dealt with by closing borders rather than an inevitable and already existing fact of life inside the US that must be dealt with through testing and isolation. This week, in his Oval Office address to the nation, Trump called it the \u201cforeign virus\u201d which is a dangerously misleading concept. Remarkably, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238478167695863817\">continued to talk</a> on Friday about combating coronavirus through \u201ca very strong border policy\u201d, when the disease has almost certainly been prevalent inside the US undetected for weeks.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that Covid-19 is happening on Trump\u2019s watch. He may find his usual techniques for deflecting criticism \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/fact-checking-trumps-address-nation-cornavirus/\">lying</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-coronavirus-threat/607825/\">adopting conspiracy theories</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">blaming others</a> \u2013 may not spare him the consequences this time.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Update: A previous version of this story referenced a Google site which Trump announced on Friday would advise individuals on how to gauge their symptoms and, if needed, steer them towards new drive-in testing facilities. Despite Trump\u2019s announcement of such a service, that service does not appear, with a subsequent statement by the Google-adjacent company in question, to be real. The company Verily, which shares a corporate umbrella with Google, released a statement after Trump\u2019s press conference announcing that it was developing a Covid-19 triage test tool, but the tool \u201c</em><em>is in the early stages of development\u201d,</em><em> and the company is \u201cplanning to roll testing out in the Bay Area\u201d,</em><em> not nationally.</em></p></li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>Steve Bruce and his staff at Newcastle are implementing coronavirus contingency plans that have been on the club\u2019s tactics board for a month.

Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, [our aim is] to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, [while] at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the number of diagnosed cases in the UK rose to 798, though the government believes the true figure to be 5,000 to 10,000, and the first death was confirmed in Scotland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\">criticised the lack of a coordinated international response</a>, urging global leaders to pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes,\u201d to tackle the outbreak.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Guardian, he likened the scale of the response necessary to the Manhattan Project, which led to the creation of the nuclear bomb. \u201cIf the Manhattan Project could bring people together in the 1940s to create the most lethal weapon in human history, surely we can come together in the 21st century to save lives and the livelihood of millions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brown blamed the spread of \u201cpopulist nationalism\u201d, which has been \u201csubdividing our world\u201d, for the inability of governments to deal with the crisis together. He encouraged them to be more open about how they were learning from each other\u2019s experiences.</p> \n<p>His plea came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced that world leaders will hold an emergency G7 video-conference summit on Monday. \u201cWe will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Global stock markets rallied on Friday after their worst day since the 1987 crash, on hopes that economic policymakers might deliver a coordinated response.</p> \n<p>In the UK, ministers have insisted their decision-making is based on scientific advice.

We will make the right decisions at the right time based on the best scientific evidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor example, we are concerned about the burden large events put on public services \u2013 including the health service and the police \u2013 from dealing with coronavirus. Officials are working with industry bodies to identify how to support businesses that will be affected by this decision.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have drafted emergency legislation to give the government the powers it needs to deal with coronavirus, including powers to stop mass gatherings and compensate organisations. We will publish this legislation next week.\u201d</p> \n<p>Parliament announced a clampdown on visitors, and urged MPs not to go on overseas visits.

The starting point is \u20ac8bn of unspent money from the EU budget for infrastructure spending - \u201csleeping money\u201d as von der Leyen put it - that is intended to trigger a further \u20ac29bn of public and private funds. <br><br>But EU member states and the European parliament - currently meeting in restricted sessions because of the virus - will have to approve the idea. <br><br>The commission also provided more details on measures announced earlier this week, such as loosening rules on state aid, and making use of flexibility in EU budget rules. <br><br>Measures include: <br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Relaxing airport slot rules. </strong>Airlines will not lose their prized landing and take-off slots, if they fail to use them as a result of travel bans and falling demand. A waiver on the usual \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rule that requires carriers to use 80% of their slots, will run until 30 June 2020 and can be extended if necessary.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Loosening rules on state aid, </strong>so governments can help companies by suspending tax payments or compensate those suffering losses. The commission said it had already signed off a Danish scheme in less than 24 hours, promising to do the same for other countries.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Releasing \u20ac1bn from the EU budget,</strong> which is expected to cover \u20ac8bn in loan guarantees, with the aim of providing liquidity to 100,000 small and medium-sized companies.<br><br></li> <li><strong>Governments will be able to use flexibilities in the EU stability and growth pact rules that restrict the deficit.</strong> In normal years a state\u2019s deficit cannot exceed 3% of gross domestic product. This rule will be relaxed under an \u201cunusual events\u201d clause, so governments can, for example, pay self-employed people or help companies that have put workers on half time, without facing fines from Brussels </li> </ul> <p>She also said France and Germany were \u201cwilling to adapt\u201d export bans on medical goods, such as masks and ventilators. Such restrictions flout EU rules on the free movement of goods and have angered countries that do not produce such products. <br></p> <p>Von der Leyen said the commission would do more if needed, delivering the message in the EU\u2019s three working languages of English, French and German. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis is an important economic package but we have to acknowledge the situation is evolving fast.

The doctor ordered a transfusion but Birx had read a report about the mystery disease and the risks of such a process.</p> <p>\u201cDo not let them give me blood,\u201d she screamed, before passing out from pain.</p> <p>Her husband followed her orders, stopping a transfusion the hospital later revealed would have been contaminated with HIV.</p> <p>\u201cIt made her think hard not just about the perils of this new disease, but about her responsibility to fight it,\u201d Kerry said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/podcasts/channels/strategerist/s2-ep02-amb-birx.html\">In a September 2019</a> interview, Birx explained how the sacrifices of infected soldiers helped define her commitment to fighting the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThey died with such courage and such willingness to try different things, realizing it may not help them, but it would help the person behind them,\u201d she said. \u201cI just never saw that level of altruism, amidst just death and despair, from the patients themselves.\u201d</p> <p>She spent the next two decades helping to lead an influential HIV vaccine trial and providing important contributions to understanding the disease in the military, where she was promoted to colonel. She was lured out of the military after George W Bush started Pepfar in 2003.</p> <p>The program began when drugs to manage HIV/Aids and prevent its transmission were available in the US but not in Africa, where millions were dying. Birx joined two years later, overseeing programs led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>Her work has taken her around the globe to study and learn and to ensure US money funding such programs is used effectively. Del Rio, who chairs the scientific advisory board for Pepfar, said Birx had confronted global health leaders misusing US funds.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019ll give you another opportunity,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cShe stands up to a minister of health and says: \u2018I\u2019m sorry but we\u2019re not doing that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At one point, the World Health Organization called for people to stop using a HIV/Aids medicine. Scientists at Pepfar thought it was the wrong call. Birx listened to them, then ignored the WHO.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, she was right,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cThis is the right decision. She listened to the data, she looked at the data and she said, \u2018Let\u2019s proceed.\u2019 She is a bold leader. I have a lot of respect for her.\u201d</p>",

Some 40% of the fledgling nation\u2019s population (predominantly men aged between 25 and 40 \u2013 a similar demographic to that which contributed most to this commonwealth\u2019s world war one fatality lists) would contract the flu that ultimately killed 13,000 Australians and 50 million people worldwide. And by mid-late 1919 \u2013 by which time the Australian papers were filled with articles about the hundreds of people who were dying weekly \u2013 the federation, still working on the myth that nationhood stemmed from a foreign war, was buckling in the face of contagion.</p> <p>As the historian <a href=\"https://honesthistory.net.au/wp/mcqueen-humphrey-spanish-flu-pandemic-australia-1912-19/\">Humphrey McQueen writes in The Spanish Influenza Epidemic in Australia, 1918-19</a>: \u201cIn 1915 an external menace had driven Australians together; by 1919, an internal danger revealed yet again how easy it was for Australian to stand apart.

The states effectively ceded control of borders and interstate traffic to the commonwealth.</p> <p>The first diagnosed case in New South Wales challenged the integrity of that agreement. He was a returned soldier who had come to Sydney from Melbourne. Victoria, despite medical evidence to the contrary, had not notified the commonwealth of the Spanish flu in its midst. It was only after NSW notified the commonwealth (its headquarters and federal parliament were based at the time in Melbourne) that Victoria itself made the formal notification. NSW, blaming Victoria for the transmission, responded unilaterally, shutting its border with Victoria and walking away from the agreement.</p> <p>Once transmitted to Australia the flu rapidly escaped a quarantine system whose efficacy relied on the honesty of ship medical officers to volunteer past or present cases on board, and the willingness of returned soldiers to self-report and voluntarily isolate themselves rather than seek \u201ccures\u201d.</p> <p>Quackery was rampant. The broader medical fraternity was divided on origins of the flu, methods and bases of diagnosis, and possible treatment.</p> <p>Then \u2013 as now with coronavirus \u2013 \u201cforeigners\u201d, even those who\u2019d been in Australia for generations, were treated with utmost suspicion.</p> <p>Indeed, in Australia and throughout allied Europe and the US, the supposed genesis of the Spanish flu had its foundations firmly in fear and blame of the other, not least the old enemy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">Spanish flu: the killer that still stalks us, 100 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis modern plague \u2026 has commonly been called Spanish influenza,\u201d <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/140221010\">the Australasian of 29 March 1919 reported</a>. \u201cYet it did not originate in Spain, nor was it exactly the grippe or influenza of other days. It appears that the Germans, in anticipation that the malady might be justly named German plague \u2026 broadcast a misleading name which they had craftily devised before the infection spread from Germany to other countries.\u201d</p> <p>There was no evidence the pandemic began in Germany. Epidemiologists have since determined it was likely that servicemen from the US \u2013 who entered the war late \u2013 brought a milder flu strain to Europe. It then transmogrified into the Spanish flu (so named because the king of Spain was among the first to die of it).</p> <p>In Australia schools were closed, sporting events \u2013 if they proceeded \u2013 were unattended, and worshippers stayed away from church.

A second tranche of proposed gun laws will allow police to deny or revoke firearms licences on the basis of extreme posts on social media.</p> <p>This year, Ardern\u2019s government has planned more a controversial change: a proposed new law to curb hate speech, which Anjum Rahman says is unlikely to find enough support.</p> <p>\u201cThere are quite a few political actors who use inflammatory rhetoric to get votes,\u201d she says, adding that she fears \u201cdesperate\u201d minor parties might deploy anti-Muslim rhetoric ahead of September\u2019s election.</p> <p>An independent inquiry is underway into whether action by New Zealand\u2019s government agencies could have prevented the attack, and is due to publish a report in April. Many Muslims are anxious to see accountability and consequences for any failings found.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people might have this idea that we\u2019ve done this much, that\u2019s enough,\u201d says Qur\u2019aan. \u201cWe should acknowledge how far we\u2019ve come but not just stop there.

The core of the Trump insurgency is weaponising mass distraction.</p> <p>Coppins noted Trump has the instincts of an autocrat, but he uses different methods. Instead of silencing experts, or censoring the free media to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis, Trump \u201ccan simply use his presidential bullhorn to drown it out\u201d. Unleashing a barrage of incoherence is intended \u201cto bombard people with so many contradictory claims, conspiracy theories, what-abouts and distortions that they simply throw up their hands in confusion and exhaustion\u201d.</p> <p>Deconstructing Trump in this way is not a new insight. Steve Bannon, once chief strategist for Trump, called this core methodology <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation\">\u201cflooding the zone with shit\u201d</a>.</p> <p>David Roberts at Vox has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/2/16588964/america-epistemic-crisis\">arguing since 2017</a> that America is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, \u201ca split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know \u2013 what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening\u201d. Roberts says American conservatives have triggered this rupture by rejecting the institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge, from scientists to journalists.</p> <p>The new question Coppins posed was whether Trump\u2019s methodology of sowing strategic doubt would continue to be a winner for him once his inveterate myth-making intersects with a rapidly escalating pandemic within his own borders.</p> <p>During a pandemic, people get ill, people die, essential services get disrupted, and the economy wobbles. People suffer if their leaders are feckless or amoral. Perhaps more in hope than in certainty, Coppins wondered whether flooding the zone with shit, and being seen to do that, works when \u201cthe dangers are more tangible and immediate to voters, regardless of whether they support Trump\u201d.</p> <p>Implicit in this musing is a big question: will coronavirus trigger an inflection point when alternative reality, the currency of modern day demagogues, finally implodes in the face of lived reality, allowing the whole system to reset itself?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/morrisons-coronavirus-stimulus-package-shows-sober-expert-advice-can-still-prevail\">Morrison's coronavirus stimulus package shows sober, expert advice can still prevail | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I reckon it\u2019s the right question to ask, but I don\u2019t know the answer, and to borrow from Lana Del Ray, hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have.</p> <p>Let\u2019s bail out of the insanity of the Trumpiverse and come home now. I said this week, after Scott Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/what-australian-governments-coronavirus-stimulus-package-means-for-you-explainer\">unveiled his $17bn stimulus package</a>, that evidence and expertise has staged something of a comeback. The battered technocrats, the maligned experts in Australia\u2019s bureaucratic and political class, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/morrisons-coronavirus-stimulus-package-shows-sober-expert-advice-can-still-prevail\">have hoisted themselves off the mat</a> and appear to be exerting some influence.</p> <p>Consider just one example. It is truly remarkable that in the space of a week, two at most, the Coalition executed a complete about-face on stimulus. You could easily miss it in the noise, but the Morrison government has now signed up to methods of pump-priming the economy that Liberals have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/06/cormann-rules-out-rudd-style-cash-splash-to-boost-australian-economy-as-coronavirus-bites\">spent more than a decade pillorying</a>.</p> <p>One senses Morrison\u2019s hard-wired political pragmatism and the steady hand of Treasury in this gear shift (government people report the new secretary, Steven Kennedy, has been a source of rapid and reliable advice) but this must be beyond galling for Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan, who copped the decade-long blast for doing a version of what Morrison announced this week.</p> <p>Lest I sound inexplicably upbeat this weekend, let me be clear. I haven\u2019t fallen into a rapture about sanity suddenly resuming transmission in Canberra after a dispiriting interregnum.</p> <p>We are a long way from that.</p> <p>When it comes to the government\u2019s management of the coronavirus, I have a bunch of practical questions. Is this stimulus large enough? Will it be rolled out quickly enough? Will people spend their handouts?</p> <p>On the health side: was Morrison too slow on mass gatherings<strong>, </strong>and has this lack of urgency posed unacceptable public health risks? (Plenty of serious experts with medical training seem to think so, although the prime minister seems to be following the advice of his own highly reputable experts).</p> <p>There was also one of those silly and counterproductive episodes that, in the age of rolling instant referendums, snowball, and become emblematic. There was the parable of the football match.</p> <p>At the Council of Australian Governments meeting on Friday, Morrison pointed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-mass-events-and-foreign-travel-should-be-cancelled-says-australian-government\">the imminent necessity of cancelling large gatherings</a> while saying in the same breath that he intended to go to an NRL game on Saturday night to watch his \u201cbeloved Sharkies\u201d \u2013 plans he had to walk back once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/13/australia-coronavirus-live-news-formula-one-f1-gp-grand-prix-melbourne-australian-government-stimulus-economic-package-asx200-latest-updates\">Peter Dutton revealed he had become infected with coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>It would have been better for Morrison to pull out on Friday afternoon to be consistent with where his own health advice was trending. But instead of ejecting elegantly, through a prism of considered leadership, there was an inelegant dismount late in the evening, and a mildly churlish statement from the office saying the prime minister had cancelled because of the \u201cpotential for the prime minister\u2019s attendance to be misrepresented\u201d. It wasn\u2019t really clear by whom.</p> <p>Related to this: I get that pandemics are fast moving, and complex to manage, but why is the messaging sometimes clear and sometimes confusing and seemingly contradictory, and could somebody perhaps fine tune that?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/rudd-mark-ii-what-experts-say-about-australian-governments-176bn-stimulus-package\">'Rudd mark II': what experts say about Australian government's $17.6bn stimulus package</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suspect it might be better if the government started mapping out where things are likely to head to help prepare people for what\u2019s just over the horizon, because as it stands now, some days it looks like advice is no sooner given than it is overtaken by new advice. Recent days have demonstrated messaging can be both clear and confounding, particularly in rapidly changing conditions. Also: where is the necessary public education campaign? That really does seem urgent.</p> <p>So it should be clear that I am not saying the government delivered a stimulus package that wasn\u2019t stupid, so everything is OK now. The only observation I\u2019m making is the official coronavirus-related conversations in Australia are certainly contested, but they are occurring within the boundaries of expert advice, and what you might term shared reality. At least so far.</p> <p>I really welcome that. We all should welcome that.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a number of other conversations in daily political life under this government remain stubbornly outside that frame, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/03/scott-morrison-wants-the-nation-to-trust-him-but-how-can-we-after-sports-rorts\">that general tendency undermines Morrison\u2019s current efforts</a> to project as a prime minister whose information can be trusted.</p> <p>Climate change is the obvious one. Can anyone tell me why Morrison can be counselled by experts with scientific training in managing a pandemic \u2013 and be seen to be doing that \u2013 yet ignore equally valid expert advice about another existential risk? I\u2019d really love to know.</p> <p>The other obvious one is the sports grants fiasco. Morrison is point-blank refusing to engage with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/06/bridget-mckenzie-reignites-sports-rorts-affair-by-denying-late-changes-to-grants\">evidence that shows his office was a hands-on decision maker</a> in at least one of the adjudications about sports grants, which runs counter to the narrative he\u2019s constructed where Bridget McKenzie was the decision maker.</p> <p>Morrison is also stepping around the central unresolved question about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/21/bridget-mckenzies-sports-grants-program-may-be-unconstitutional-expert-warns\">whether his government acted lawfully</a> in allocating these grants. The prime minister steps around this inconvenience by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/06/scott-morrison-refuses-to-take-questions-about-timing-of-changes-to-sports-grants\">either declining to take questions</a>, or taking the questions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/mar/13/the-sports-rorts-questions-scott-morrison-doesnt-want-to-answer\">and then declining to answer them</a>.</p> <p>Given this is all pretty depressing, let me leave you with one cheery thought.</p> <p>The optimist in me says this week\u2019s stimulus about-face example demonstrates that this government can turn on the head of a dime; that the opposite can also be true, if the time has come for the opposite to also be true.</p> <p>Think of it this way. If the Coalition can spend a decade defaming Labor for the crime of stimulating the economy to ward off a recession, and then follow Labor\u2019s playbook during a close encounter with an economic crisis on their own watch \u2013 then anything can happen.</p> <p>Anything, truly. A serious shift on climate change. True confessions on sports grants. Both unlikely, but in high octane times such as these, it\u2019s best never to leave your desk.</p>",
  "<p>Even by the ordinary standards of sport horse racing is an escapist place to spend your time. The Cheltenham Festival is its busiest, most hedonistic week and you can disappear into the fun of it and forget about harsh realities like global pandemics, which seemed to be one of the main attractions for the 68,859 who came here on Friday, oblivious to the disapproving noises made by everyone else on social media.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone told me it was like being in a bubble,\u201d said Ian Renton, who manages the racecourse for its owners, the Jockey Club. \u201cThat\u2019s a good description, having been here all week and not had time to take in much that\u2019s happened outside the bubble.\u201d</p> <p>Those outside were, in some cases, agog at the idea that so many could be allowed to gather in one place at a time when everyone is so concerned about slowing the spread of a vicious infection.

So people are listening, heeding the advice.\u201d</p> <p>For some, heeding the advice meant staying away, since Gold Cup day was, most unusually, not sold out.

Each sources its information from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. According to the former, 137,445 cases have been confirmed globally, while 5,008 people have died and 69,779 people have recovered.</p> <h2>Europe is now the centre of the pandemic \u2013 WHO</h2> <p>The situation in Europe is now so severe that the continent must be considered the centre of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He said Europe had now confirmed more cases and suffered more deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China.</p> <h2>UK cases rise by more than 200</h2> <p>The total number of cases increased to 798 after 208 more were confirmed by the Department of Health and Social Care. There have been 11 deaths so far from the virus in the UK, including the first in Scotland.</p> <h2>Sporting events suspended in UK</h2> <p>Professional football, including England\u2019s Premier League, has been suspended. Matches due to take place in the Women\u2019s Super League and English men\u2019s football\u2019s second, third and fourth tiers have also been postponed until 5 April, while the Scottish FA said all football under its jurisdiction would be suspended until further notice. Uefa also postponed all next week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> and Europa League fixtures. The London Marathon, which was due to take place in April, has been put back to October.</p> <h2>The Queen cancels engagements</h2> <p>Forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden, London, were cancelled. Buckingham Palace said the step was a \u201csensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances\u201d.</p> <h2>British elections postponed</h2> <p>Votes for 118 councils in England and eight posts for directly elected mayors \u2013 including for the mayoralty of London \u2013 that were due to happen in May have been put back until next year, Downing Street said.</p> <h2>Brazil\u2019s president tests positive</h2> <p>An initial test on Jair Bolsonaro came back positive, though his son cautioned against jumping to conclusions. Reports claimed the White House was to hold an emergency meeting on the diagnosis after Bolsonaro dined with Trump last week.</p> <h2>Spain declares a state of emergency</h2> <p>One of the worst affected nations in Europe became the latest to take such a step. As the death toll reached 120, the country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, activated a part of the constitution that allows him to limit the movement of people and ration the consumption of basic items, among other measures.</p> <h2>Other European nations take drastic steps</h2> <p>No more than 100 people are allowed to gather in France after the country followed the more stringent steps being taken in other European nations. The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said the ban would come into effect immediately.</p> <p>In Switzerland, all schools were closed and the government pledged about 10bn Swiss francs in aid for businesses.</p> <h2>Trudeau says he has no symptoms</h2> <p>After his wife tested positive following a trip to the UK, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he had no symptoms of the coronavirus and that he was feeling good. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau plans to remain in isolation for the next two weeks. Her symptoms were described as mild.</p>",

People without symptoms or only very mild disease were not being counted. Johnson said up to 10,000 people in the UK were probably now infected.</p> \n<p>Kellam said the value of community testing to find individuals who had a mild case of the disease was now questionable.</p> \n<p>\u201cEarly on in the epidemic, in Taiwan and countries immediately adjacent to China, there was not at the time an absolute certainty that the virus would spread worldwide, so early on the policy was to contain. Finding all the people who are infected and the people they have been in contact with to try to bring that infection chain to a standstill was the right strategy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But now it was a pandemic and likely to be an endemic infection, one that lingers in the population and could largely disappear, but will recur the following winter or year.</p> \n<p>Prof Sheila Bird, the former programme leader of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, said the number of cases had risen so far already that it would be hard to trace all the contacts of an infected person.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are being realistic. The capacity to do that sort of track and trace is probably already overwhelmed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe focus is now on monitoring the more serious end of the disease spectrum.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, she said, it did mean that the basis of the data being collected on the epidemic in the UK would change, and that that needed to be marked by a break in the figures; simply adding the new numbers to the old totals would skew the understanding of the epidemic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

But a great deal of practical help will be required to ensure it is not offered only to those victims of this nasty little bug who can shout the loudest, that precarious livelihoods and the infrastructure of amateur sport are also protected.</p> <p>For now there are plenty of unanswered questions and one in particular that is worth keeping in plain sight. Sport is prone to wildly overstating its importance at the best of times, interpreting all global events through its own prism. Racism, deadly viral flu, climate change: fine. But what\u2019s the Premier League angle here? What does Danny Mills think?</p> <p>And yet for for once sport is telling us something right now and something worth hearing. To date the most frequently-asked question has been: why did it take so long for major events to be postponed? Italy, Spain and the USA were all closed for business. Why did it take the diagnosis of active participants to get the Premier League and Football League to postpone their programme?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>These are good questions, deserving of a proper answer. To date analysis has centred on the usual hand-wringing over poor leadership and corporate greed. Both of these things, the founding vices of Big Sport, are, of course present. But the key point is that sport has simply been following government advice, reflecting the fact the UK is behind almost every other nation in deciding public gatherings in a time of plague may not be a good idea.</p> <p>Again, this is policy, not an oversight. The government has been relying on data that suggests sporting events don\u2019t spread contagion the way you might expect, with one pertinent example the measles epidemic around the 2006 World Cup in Germany. But look properly at Thursday\u2019s government briefing and there is another line of reasoning too, albeit one that is unpalatable to some.</p> <p>The UK has embraced the notion that herd immunity can be developed by exposing healthy hosts to the virus and surrounding it with those who have already processed it through their system. In effect, the government wants you to contract this disease. Sport was to be left alone as part of this, both a high-functioning industry and an existing tool of transmission through the entire populace that the government believes is inevitable.</p> <p>There may be great virtues in this approach: expose the healthy, cocoon the weak. But was any of this made clear as sporting events were left open? How many present realised the government wasn\u2019t telling them they were safe, but instead allowing them to participate as units of everyday transmission, with uncomfortable echoes of the way spectators at the sporting disasters of earlier decades were seen as a collective proletarian substance to be dispersed and managed.</p> <p>Either way, the infection of players and managers was always likely to halt this process. In the meantime, as that unplanned hiatus stretches away, it is important to remember that things recover as well as fall apart, that anxiety is itself contagious. And that like all things \u2013 seasons, teams, interrupted dreams of glory \u2013 this nasty little bug will also pass.</p>",
  "<p>Fashion operates on desire. How we dress feeds off cravings to be different as well as part of a tribe; to be en vogue but ahead of the pack. The message from the high street is that such wishes can be fulfilled, and fast fashion plays on the idea that hunger can be sated immediately. But to overcome such urges we need to reflect on the fragility of our planet. This means accepting that there is a better way to keep the pleasures of fashion open to all parts of society than promoting disposable clothes as desirable. This is not just about the high cost of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/22/cost-cheap-fast-fashion-workers-planet\" title=\"\">\u00a34 dress</a>; luxury retailers such as Louis Vuitton have offered small collections every two weeks.</p> <p>The fashion industry has benefited from globalisation to mass-produce goods by externalising the costs of production in the form of human and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/23/five-ways-fashion-damages-the-planet\" title=\"\">environmental damage</a>. Every year, 100bn new garments are produced by one out of six people worldwide. Yet only 2% of them earn a living wage. In this country it is an open secret that some garment factories are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\" title=\"\">not paying the minimum wage</a>.</p> <p>Fashion shouldn\u2019t cost the earth. But the industry has for too long promoted overconsumption as a good thing. About a fifth of <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/02/27/fast-fashion-waste-not-shop-not/\" title=\"\">mass-produced</a> clothing does not even sell and ends up being buried, shredded or burned. Garments now account for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Synthetic fibres are being found in Arctic sea ice and in fish.</p> <p>Britain has too readily embraced throwaway society. Shoppers in the UK buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe. It was a mistake last year for ministers not to take up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/18/ministers-reject-charge-of-1p-an-item-to-clean-up-fast-fashion\" title=\"\">MPs\u2019 suggestion</a> to reward via taxation companies that design products with lower climate footprints and penalise those that do not. Messages from public figures, such as the environmentalist Greta Thunberg, about not buying clothes has helped to persuade people to turn their backs on fast fashion. New research shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/12/i-wear-my-grandads-old-boxers-meet-the-people-who-havent-bought-clothes-for-a-decade\" title=\"\">51% of Britons</a> are opting to purchase expensive but longer-lasting clothes rather than cheaper throwaway items, up from 33% a year ago.</p> <p>The market is belatedly responding to the mood. Big brands such as H&amp;M and Zara have made new commitments to sustainability. John Lewis has this week introduced labelling to encourage a culture of handing down children\u2019s clothes. <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/sustainable-denim-jeans-brands\" title=\"\">Nudie Jeans </a>has become a success, with organic products and stores that promote repair services and resale.</p> <p>At no other time in human history has fashion been so accessible to so many people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/09/hi-tech-hyperlocal-and-3d-printed-a-proposition-for-the-future-of-fashion\" title=\"\">Technology will help</a> to make fashion greener. Better regulation of supply chains will help too. There is a discernible shift from discarding clothes to repairing, reusing or even renting them. However, it is hard to see how this will be enough to make fashion truly sustainable if the industry still produces more and more clothes. Once normal service is resumed, we need to think again about the wisdom of fostering competitive consumption, which upholds the persistent demand for expansion, in our society.</p>",

  "<p>Covid-19 could permanently shift working patterns as companies forced to embrace remote working by the pandemic find that their employees do not want to return to the office once the closures are lifted.</p> <p>The sudden increase in working from home is presenting problems as well as opportunities: on the one hand, startups such as Slack and Zoom and established giants including Google and Microsoft are offering their tools for free, in the hope that people who start using them in a crisis may carry on once normality returns.</p> <p>On the other hand, some systems are already creaking at the edges. Corporate networks, unused to having a majority of their connections coming in over virtual private networks (VPNs), are experiencing unusual quirks, while internet service providers have come under pressure to lift bandwidth caps so that remote workers do not get cut off from their employers halfway through the month.</p> <p>But it looks increasingly as if the situation will not ever go back to how it was: many employees for companies who have sent all staff home are already starting to question why they had to go in to the office in the first place.</p> <p>Large technology firms were some of the first to make the switch to remote working for all their staff, building on pre-existing infrastructure such as office chat groups, remote access to critical tools, and the fact that much knowledge work can be carried out remotely.</p> <p>In Seattle, the hub of many of America\u2019s early Covid-19 cases, companies including Amazon, LinkedIn, Microsoft and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-google-tech-dublin-twitter-work-from-home\">Google advised workers to stop coming in to the office</a> in late February. In early March, Twitter \u201cstrongly advised\u201d all its employees worldwide to do the same, and on Wednesday, made it compulsory.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times,\u201d Twitter\u2019s head of HR, Jennifer Christie, said in a message to staff. Christie promised to reimburse employees, including hourly workers, for the expenses required to set up home offices, covering the costs of buying things such as computer hardware, desks and ergonomic chairs. \u201cOverall, working from home doesn\u2019t change your day-to-day work, it just means you\u2019ll be doing it from a different environment,\u201d Christie added.</p> <p>Those sorts of investments have prompted many to wonder if companies that embrace remote working in a crisis may find it sticks around as normality returns. It is harder to say no to employee requests for working from home if HR has already bought them a new desk \u2013 and it is easier to view the investment as a sensible one if it pays off for years, rather than months, to come.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold,\u201d <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/\">said </a><a href=\"https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, chief executive of WordPress and Tumblr owner Automattic.

For example, we have been hosting free consultations for companies adapting to remote work for the first time. We\u2019ve been speaking to companies of all sizes and from all industries \u2013 from large enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees, to small businesses with a team of five.\u201d</p> <p>Slack isn\u2019t alone. Microsoft has made its cloud \u201cproductivity suite\u201d free to small businesses for the next six months, including its Slack competitor, Teams. Google followed suit with its own business subscription, while videoconferencing service Zoom has lifted limitations on its own free tier, allowing conversations to exceed 40 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/quarantine-video-call-coronavirus-colleagues-home-work\">The art of Skype set-dressing: how to video-call the office when in quarantine | Imogen West-Knights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But for every company smoothly moving to the future of remote working, others have hit problems. Some have been comparatively minor: Facebook employees found their corporate network was banned from the takeaway service DoorDash for suspicious behaviour, as the company\u2019s entire workforce began placing orders for delivery all over the Bay Area in California while logged in to a VPN connecting from the same IP address.</p> <p>Others have been more serious. An early fear that home broadband networks would collapse under the weight of usage was quelled by UK service providers, whose trade body, ISPA, pointed out that evening peak activity, when the nation sits down to stream Netflix and play online video games, is often 10 times the typical daytime demand.</p> <p>More pressing is the fact that internet usage in general is increasing across the board. Cloudflare, which provides online infrastructure that underpins a huge swathe of the internet, says it has been tracking the increase. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">Its chief executive, </a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">Matthew Prince</a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">, says</a> that \u201cas more people work from home, peak traffic in impacted regions has increased, on average, approximately 10%. In Italy, which has imposed a nationwide quarantine, peak internet traffic is up 30%. Traffic patterns have also shifted so peak traffic is occurring earlier in the day in impacted regions.\u201d</p> <p>The real problems start when schools get suspended. Usage of Italy\u2019s national network has surged by more than two-thirds, not due to working from home, but due to housebound schoolchildren logging on to games such as Fortnite, according to a report <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-emergency/\">from Bloomberg News</a>.</p> <p>Spikes in usage are most likely to affect people who pay for their internet with bandwidth caps, particularly common in the US and among those who rely on mobile broadband. Some American ISPs, including AT&amp;T, have <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v74qzb/atandt-suspends-broadband-usage-caps-during-coronavirus-crisis\">started suspending the practice</a> in order to avoid being blamed for preventing work, but not everyone has done so.</p> <p>Still, technology can only go so far, and working from home is not for everyone. \u201cI\u2019ve worked 100% remote before,\u201d said one tech industry worker who has been sent home, \u201cand there comes a point where even an introvert would like to see another human.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tools for remote working</strong></h2> <p><strong>Slack</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/\">Slack</a>, the \u00fcber workplace management tool, is loved and loathed in equal measure, but one thing it has going for it is its free-to-play business model: rather than needing to sign up the entire organisation at once, it is easy for individual teams, desks and offices to get started with the free tier, and expand as they see fit. That means it is best placed to help home workers quickly recreate the sort of in-person chat they had in the office.</p> <p><strong>Trello</strong></p> <p>Where Slack recreates the feeling of turning to a colleague for a quick chat that\u2019s as much personal as professional, <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a> is more like your boss walking over to \u201cjust check on how you\u2019re doing\u201d.

The app lifted its limit on free accounts as a response to the crisis, and theoretically supports up to 1,000 participants in a single meeting, though it\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s actually a positive. The company has had some controversies, however, from an <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3xpma/how-to-remove-zoom-from-your-mac\">insecure plugin for Mac clients</a> that was fixed in June to a questionable \u201cattention tracking\u201d feature that allows horrible bosses to use AI to check whether their employees are actually looking at the screen.</p> <p><strong>Tomates</strong></p> <p>Just as important as making sure you work well at home is making sure you take breaks from work at home.

  "<p>The startling spread of the coronavirus across the globe is causing understandable alarm. But though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions about how many deaths may occur, the statistics do point to general trends that can get lost in the drama.</p> \n<p>At present, one thing that does seem clear is that the vast majority of people who get the disease will survive.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern \u2013 but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.</p> \n<p>Any death is, of course, devastating for the families involved. But it is also worth noting the WHO estimate is based on confirmed infections and deaths, meaning it does not take into account mild cases that may not be diagnosed \u2013 cases that would lower the mortality rate.</p> \n<p>Indeed experts say that, in reality, the mortality rate is likely to be nearer to 1% or less. In other words, more than 99% of those who become infected are expected to survive.</p> \n<p>And not everyone will become infected. According to the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, the worst-case scenario is that about 80% of the UK population becomes infected. But that does not necessarily mean there will be 500,000 deaths \u2013 as would be expected from a 1% mortality rate.</p> \n<p>One reason is because the 80% figure is an estimate. \u201cThat is an entirely speculative number,\u201d Whitty told the press conference, adding that it was not known how many people would ultimately become infected.</p> \n<p>Another factor that will affect the number of deaths, and hence mortality rate, is who gets infected. According to figures from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those aged 10-39 have a 0.2% mortality rate, while those in their 60s have a mortality rate of 3.6%. For those aged 80 and older this rises to almost 15%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/two-zip/giv-3902FgOLd0cMi8q4/\" data-alt=\"china stuudy\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/two-zip/giv-3902FgOLd0cMi8q4/\">china stuudy</a> \n</figure> \n<p>While such figures may seem alarming, particularly for the elderly, it means that if the spread of Covid-19 to the most vulnerable populations can be prevented, or at least limited, there will be far fewer deaths than may otherwise be expected.</p> \n<p>In other words, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-ill-disabled-people\">protecting the vulnerable</a>, including those with underlying health conditions, is crucial.</p> \n<p>Experts currently caution against reading too much into figures from the UK. On Friday morning there were 798 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the UK, and 10 deaths \u2013 although the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has suggested as many as 10,000 people in the UK could be already infected with the virus.</p> \n<p>But simply looking at the current snapshot can be misleading \u2013 because of the time lag between infection, disease and death, those who have already died would have been infected earlier, when the number of cases were lower, while there has also been a rapid uptick in new cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is still technically early [in the outbreak]. You are not quite sure if the cases and the deaths are representative of what will pan out in the long term,\u201d said Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton. \u201cAs we go forward we will basically have better data,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>One thing that is clear is that mortality rates do differ from country to country. At present, Italy has been estimated to have a mortality rate of more than 6%, while in South Korea <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-response-specialre/italy-and-south-korea-virus-outbreaks-reveal-disparity-in-deaths-and-tactics-idUSKBN20Z27P\">the mortality rate</a> has been estimated at below 1%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-13T16:05:02/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Fatality rate\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-13T16:05:02/embed.html\">Fatality rate</a> \n</figure> \n<p>It is difficult to unpick exactly what is behind such differences. However a number of factors may be at play, including how many people are being tested: aggressive testing may flag up milder cases that would otherwise have been missed, meaning the crude mortality rate is lower.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/13/why-regular-handwashing-can-be-bad-advice-for-patients\">The hellish side of handwashing: how coronavirus is affecting people with OCD</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indeed it is believed that the coronavirus may have been circulating unnoticed in northern Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/from-confidence-to-quarantine-how-coronavirus-swept-italy\">since mid-January</a>, while it took repeated hospital visits before a 38-year-old man with symptoms was diagnosed with Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Other factors include the type of public health measures being employed, and the demographics of the population. Italy has a large elderly population \u2013 about 23% of the population is over the age of 65 \u2013 and it is known that older people are at greater risk from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>In short, Boris Johnson is correct to say that the death toll in the UK will rise. But at this point in time, it is not possible to put a figure on just how many will die. If public health measures are successful, there is hope the vast majority will be spared.</p>",
  "<p>Having had a temperature and a dry cough for some days now \u2013 don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to write That Column \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing the reading equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/31/10-10-fashion-shop-closet\" title=\"\">shopping in my closet</a>. And, ever a sucker for a theme, this has turned out to be that rare occasion where I\u2019ve ended up going: \u201cOoh, I must have some more Fruit &amp; Nut and get Daniel Defoe\u2019s A Journal of the Plague Year down off the shelves\u201d. Forgive me; that was unclear. Fruit &amp; Nut is a hugely frequent occurrence; a need for historical accounts of mass distemper less so.</p> <p>Obviously I\u2019m slightly put out to discover that what follows might not be the first review of the work. I understand Defoe\u2019s fascinating account of the 1665-66 London plague season received very favourable notices when it came out (the year 1722). I myself found it a brilliant curiosity of a book when I read it first time round (the year 1995). But from the particular vantage point of the year 2020, I can only say: guys, it really is all there. Ye olde panicke buying, ye olde refusal to self-isolate \u2013 \u201cthey did not take the least care or make any scruple of infecting others\u201d \u2013 ye olde wittering and twittering of conspiracy theories. \u201cThe error of the times,\u201d as Defoe optimistically judges them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\">Why is the government relying on nudge theory to fight coronavirus? | Tony Yates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor were our plague-plagued 17th-century forebears short of famous imbeciles with a public platform. Defoe\u2019s narrator marvels at the pitiable foolishness of one noted idiot who spent his time going about the city spouting deranged pronouncements and doomy surmise, the occupation of breakfast television presenter not existing at the time. Nor, indeed, the occupation of former leader of the Brexit party.</p> <p>There are suddenly familiar tales of the rich taking flight (in the 1665 version, to the countryside, as opposed to the sort of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/disease-dodging-worried-wealthy-jet-off-to-disaster-bunkers\" title=\"\">bunker complex</a> where one might have to know Mark Zuckerberg socially). The narrator voices huge admiration for the poorest workers and those on the frontline of fighting the pestilence, who \u201cwent about their employment with a sort of brutal courage\u201d. I thought of this when Jenny Vaughan of the Doctor\u2019s Association told Thursday\u2019s Channel 4 News: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/uk-moves-from-contain-to-delay-in-coronavirus-plan\" title=\"\">We will lose our colleagues </a>\u2013 we will be burying our colleagues.\u201d.</p> <p>Others in 1665 London behave absolutely appallingly, of course \u2013 worse even than you might see in the 2020 supermarket bog roll aisle. Then again, it\u2019s still early days for us.</p> <p>Speaking of shopping, it\u2019s striking how 350 years of retail innovation don\u2019t amount to a hill of beans. Like many of my friends right now, Defoe\u2019s narrator is sufficiently disorganised to have very little stuff in, when the plague gets serious. \u201cI was one of those thoughtless ones \u2026\u201d Thereafter, his stockpiling necessities are flour, malt to brew \u201cas much beer as all the casks I had would hold\u201d, salted butter and Cheshire cheese (the components of a much more agreeable supper than pasta, surely). Most ominous is his realisation that regular panic-buying sorties were likely the occasions on which many people ended up catching the distemper.</p> <p>So everything changes, and nothing changes. Almost 50 years after the plague, Defoe comes to write the book in what he regards as a media explosion. Newspapers and periodicals and pamphlets were now everywhere, meaning that reports, accurate or otherwise, \u201cspread instantly over the whole nation\u201d. This is the only thing on which we might pull rank on Defoe, with a friendly \u201cDude: it gets SO much worse. Wait till they get school parents WhatsApp groups, and uncles on Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, it\u2019s surely the 1722-ers who should be pulling rank on us. After all, you\u2019d hope that in three and a half centuries of supposed progress, we might just have moved beyond virally disseminated quack cures and \u201chearing that the virus is a bioweapon invented by the US / China???\u201d But we haven\u2019t, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/trump-china-coronavirus-127919\" title=\"\">presidents</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\" title=\"\">politburo officials</a> included. We remain, as Defoe put it, \u201caddicted to prophecies and astrological conjurations, dreams, and old wives tales\u201d.</p> <p>Most resonantly for the contemporary UK, perhaps, the infectious disease Defoe is writing about comes to an already divided nation \u2013 barely five years after the Restoration, not a whole lot more after the civil war, and with ideological and religious arguments positively frothing. The narrator rather hopes it will end up uniting people. \u201cAnother plague year would reconcile all these differences,\u201d he idealises. \u201cA close conversing with death \u2026 would scum off the gall from our tempers, remove the animosities among us \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Yup, well, SPOILERS: it doesn\u2019t. \u201cAs the terror of the infection abated, those things all returned to their less desirable channel,\u201d the narrator laments. \u201cThere did not cease the spirit of strife and contention, slander and reproach, which was really the great troubler of the nation\u2019s peace before.\u201d Likewise. Perhaps we\u2019ll make a better fist of it.</p> <p>For now, there is a distinct war-by-other-means to what we might euphemise as \u201cthe discourse\u201d around coronavirus, on social media and beyond. People have been very used to entrenching on leave and remain lines; now we seem to have almost reflexively self-split into Panickers and Deniers. These two categories don\u2019t mirror their immediate forerunners, of course \u2013 you can be a hard remainer and a hard panicker, for instance, or a hard leaver and a hard panicker and so on. Some people who\u2019d had enough of this lot having had enough of experts have now had enough of this lot deferring to experts.</p> <p>Still, we polarise about everything else \u2013 why not this? Maybe there is something of the comfort of the familiar in fighting pitched online battles about whether Boris Johnson is or isn\u2019t telling the truth about a matter. It\u2019s all we\u2019ve known for years. It\u2019s just the stakes are suddenly rather higher.</p> <p>Wishing the prime minister anything but the absolute best in his stewardship of this crisis is psychopathic. But it does feel a little late in the day for Johnson to set himself against whipped-up hysteria and dodgy fake news. In an era of rumour and superstition, Defoe laments that the government of 1665 didn\u2019t do more to clamp down on popular falsehoods, putting this down to their \u201cbeing unwilling to exasperate the people\u201d. Our current government seems markedly more willing to exasperate the people, with its coronavirus response atypically cavalier compared with that of so many other countries. This \u2026 might be a good thing? Then again it \u2026 might be up there with the very worst things? After four years which have upended so many of the certainties, it\u2019s rather difficult to get any bearings. But wherever we really are, and whoever Boris Johnson really is, we finally are all in this together.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

They\u2019re getting corona.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Tom Hanks is the first celebrity to get the virus,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cI would\u2019ve expected someone ridiculous like Flavor Flav or Charlie Sheen or Sarah Palin.

And the best way to do so is in a global forum \u2013 in 2008, this was the G20 leaders\u2019 group \u2013 within which decisions can be agreed. These decisions will then carry authority and legitimacy.</p> <p>But what depth of dialogue has there been today between the main global players \u2013 Presidents Xi, Trump, Moon of South Korea, and Prime Minister Conte of Italy \u2013 to benefit from each other\u2019s insights on travel restrictions, lockdowns and social distancing? Take testing: while the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing-10march\" title=\"\">UK is way ahead of Trump\u2019s America</a>, Britain had, up to 10 March, tested at less than half the rate of Italy and a just over a 10th the rate of South Korea. Slow to test patients who had not been in China, Italy or South Korea, perhaps we had something to learn from China\u2019s decision to test even the most marginal cases? And the delays in testing sum up why fears are still growing for our safety: despite the brilliance of Britain\u2019s medics, the government still seems behind the coronavirus curve.</p> <p>Of course, the very idea of global collaboration \u2013 and the convening of what would be a \u201cvirtual\u201d G20 \u2013 sits uneasily with the \u201cAmerica first\u201d, \u201cChina first\u201d, \u201cIndia first\u201d and \u201cRussia first\u201d populist nationalism that has been subdividing our world. Since the high point of cooperation in 2009, nationalists have been in the ascendant \u2013 building walls, closing borders, clamping down on immigrants and imposing tariffs.

Sadly leaders either panic, as now \u2013 or, until disaster hits, follow the course of least resistance: inattention and neglect.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, this us-versus-them nationalism has spawned a blame culture, with under-pressure governments holding everyone but themselves responsible for anything that goes wrong.

The world\u2019s central banks \u2013 for the last 10 years just about the only game in town \u2013 are increasingly exposed as emperors with few clothes.</p> <p>I believe a concerted global, governmental response is still possible.

Now, you become a celebrity without accomplishing anything. It\u2019s completely upside down, but I guess that\u2019s the way it is now.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibit features more than 250 photos, from Brooke Shields in the DJ booth with Calvin Klein, Grace Jones singing at 3am while pointing a gun at the audience, Bianca Jagger seated on a white horse on the dancefloor, Halston kissing Liza Minnelli, Tina Turner laughing with Francesco Scavullo, Diana Ross with a balloon on New Year\u2019s Eve and Truman Capote passed out with a hat over his face.</p> <p>\u201cAny celebrity that came into New York made a stop on The Tonight Show, then made a stop at Studio 54,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it was.\u201d</p> <p>The photos are not posed portraits; they\u2019re spontaneous moments captured on the dancefloor, in motion, off the cuff moments that capture the energy, style and raucousness of the era.</p> <p>\u201cThere was definitely a \u2018no photo\u2019 policy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a lot of the photographers were friends.\u201d</p> <p>Studio 54 is remembered as the first non-judgmental, queer-friendly mainstream nightclub, which was not unlike an adult amusement park. It was a mix of gay, straight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/16/how-we-made-studio-54-ian-schrager\">rich and poor</a>. It\u2019s also one of the few places <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/18/studio-54-michael-jackson-liza-minnelli-steve-rubell\">trans women were welcome</a>, and roller skating was allowed on the dance floor.

But it wasn\u2019t meant to keep anyone out. In fact, there was no real hierarchy for the clientele at Studio 54, according to Schrager. \u201cWe never believed in having a VIP area because it would take all the great people out of the room, and the other people would be short-changed,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a general rule, we still don\u2019t believe in taking those great people out of the room.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibit features Schrager\u2019s old business cards, telegrams, party invitations and his handwritten day planners, reminding himself to get a liquor license for the club (which he <a href=\"http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/97/04/13/reviews/disco-close.html\">failed to do</a>, and wound up having to close the club for a short period of time).</p> <p>There\u2019s Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s sapphire necklace, which she wore to the club in 1979, paparazzi photos by Ron Galella, Interview magazine covers with Cher, glittery outfits by Yves Saint Laurent and vitrines devoted to architectural drawings.</p> <p>Probably the most famous Studio 54 photo was the shot of Bianca Jagger seated on a horse, but Schrager remembers other moments, as well. \u201cI remember <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/11/photos-the-two-margaret-trudeaus\">Margaret Trudeau</a> dancing and making sure the photographer got it, because we knew it would be big press, big media,\u201d he says of the former first lady of Canada.</p> <p>\u201cI remember Andy Warhol walking around with his camera, in a funny kind of way, you might want to say he was the one who invented selfies,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cWhen I see a Studio 54 photo, it\u2019s just like yesterday.

When you have a club, it\u2019s supposed to be cool, subversive to the status quo, a little arrogant, underground, we thought that was a way to present it. It\u2019s a bit subversive and risque, but that\u2019s what a nightclub is about.\u201d</p> <p>His time behind bars and Rubell\u2019s passing are not easy subjects. \u201cI just think the only nightclub people I knew who survived the whole experience were Steve and I,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cWe barely survived because it almost destroyed us.\u201d</p> <p>Was it worth it all? \u201cCertainly,\u201d he says. \u201cWould I do it again?

  "<p>An American man has been sentenced to more than 25 years in prison for leading a sex trafficking ring in Ecuador that was connected to the murder of a 15-year-old girl and the rape, sexual and physical abuse of dozens more.</p> <p>Royce Phillips, 66, from Texas, and four Ecuadorean co-defendants, were jailed on Wednesday for <a href=\"https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/caso-el-abuelo-fiscalia-obtiene-maxima-condena-para-royce-ph-y-4-procesados-mas/\">25 years and four months</a>, the maximum sentence for people trafficking with the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p> <p>Phillips, dubbed El Abuelo (\u201cthe grandfather\u201d), ran the trafficking ring from his apartment in Quito Ten\u00eds, an upmarket neighbourhood in the Ecuadorean capital. Jonathan Paredes, Christian \u00c1lvarez, Carlos Erazo and Cristian Giler, who were convicted alongside him, groomed girls outside schools in the poorer district of Comit\u00e9 del Pueblo, in the north of Quito.</p> <p>The girls were invited to parties, where they were plied with alcohol and drugs. Many of the 13- to 16-years-olds were secretly filmed for pornographic videos.</p> <p>Last month, Giler, 21, was sentenced to <a href=\"https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/carenina-sentencia-carolina-violacion-muerte.html\">34 years and eight months</a> for the rape and murder of 15-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/20/mother-challenging-police-and-power-to-solve-daughters-murder-ecuador\">Carolina Andrango</a> in August 2018. She was beaten, raped and asphyxiated, and her body was dumped on a patch of waste ground.</p> <p>The sentence was greeted with relief by the victims and their families, who had received harassment and death threats that forced at least one family to go into hiding and seek witness protection.</p> <p>Phillips\u2019 lawyers had called 191 witnesses, in an attempt to lengthen the trial, and successfully excluded the press and public from the hearings.</p> <p>According to his Facebook profile, Phillips, from Corpus Christi, Texas, had lived in Quito for several years. His company has provided services to the oil industry and he counted important members of the country\u2019s police and air force as friends. Photos on social media show him playing golf at the air force\u2019s country club and posing with a squadron of police officers in uniform.</p> <p>Phillips was arrested at his home in March 2019. At the apartment, officers seized sex toys, marijuana, party invitation flyers, a computer, two cameras, eight mobile phones, erectile-enhancement pills and thousands of dollars in cash, according to local media reports.</p> <p>Gabriela* and her family were forced to leave Quito after she was threatened by Giler when she was 15.</p> <p>\u201cHe [Giler] said if I ever said anything he would do worse things to me than he had done to <em>La China</em> [Carolina)]\u201d, said Gabriela, now 18, who was a protected witness in the trafficking trial.</p> <p>Her mother, Susana*, had found her daughter being assaulted by Giler, who managed to escape.</p> <p>\u201cShe was so drugged, she was like a doll. She didn\u2019t even know her name,\u201d said Susana, whose daughter later begged her not to report him to the police.</p> <p>Susana resigned from her job as a carer and took her two daughters to the coastal city of Guayaquil before relocating.</p> <p>\u201cIn those days, they [the trafficking gang] were free, we had no one to protect us,\u201d Gabriela told the Guardian.</p> <p>Gabriela said she was flattered to be invited to <em>caidas</em> or parties at Phillips\u2019 plush home. She said the Texan would stand in the doorway controlling who entered. Inside, alcohol and large quantities of marijuana were freely available. When the teenagers were intoxicated, Phillips would encourage them to have sex in two rooms equipped with hidden cameras.</p> <p>\u201cGiler and his gang would boast about the pornographic videos and the money they would make for each girl they brought [to Phillips\u2019 parties],\u201d she said. \u201cThey treated it like a joke.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/20/mother-challenging-police-and-power-to-solve-daughters-murder-ecuador\">The mother challenging police and power to solve her daughter's murder | Dan Collyns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the family received multiple death threats and were followed by suspicious vehicles, Ecuador\u2019s interior minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo ordered police special forces to give the family round-the-clock protection.</p> <p>Gabriela says while she is happy that \u201cat last, they are in prison\u201d, she still does not feel safe.

  "<p>Boris Johnson does it while singing Happy Birthday twice. For Jacob Rees-Mogg, it\u2019s the national anthem. And as soap supplies run low, it seems much of Britain is following their example and heeding the official guidance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hand-sanitiser-or-hand-washing-which-more-effective-against-coronavirus-covid-19\">to wash hands thoroughly and often</a>, in order to minimise the spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>It is good public health advice, of course. Indeed, one question raised by the rush for soap is just what all those people without any in the house did before. But for some people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), to be warned they must scrub to protect themselves from an invisible enemy, and to do so in a ritualistic way with internal musical accompaniment, is akin to inviting a demon to come for tea. Some of these people have spent years trying <em>not</em> to wash their hands, often as a prescribed part of their treatment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely put a lot of the internal OCD dialogue back into my life. It\u2019s being reinforced by outside, authoritative voices,\u201d says Erica (not her real name), a long-term OCD patient. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to tell yourself that the urge to wash your hands is irrational when everyone on your Twitter feed or on the news is saying: \u2018Wash your hands. Nobody is washing their hands correctly.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The worsening outbreak affects people with OCD in other ways, too. Chiefly, the spike in anxiety about the virus can fuel existing obsessive fears of contamination and trigger destructive compulsive actions. For some people with OCD, coronavirus can become all they think about. \u201cI have seen three patients this week whose OCD has started to focus on coronavirus,\u201d says David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital in London. \u201cIt is a challenging time for people who have OCD.\u201d</p> <p>As anyone with the condition will know, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\">OCD is challenging all the time</a>. Often portrayed as a behavioural quirk, OCD is in fact a syndrome defined by recurring irrational thoughts. The compulsive actions \u2013 often the most visible feature of the illness \u2013 are usually only a response to those intrusive thoughts.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/21/ocd-sex-disorder-pure-rose-cartwright\">The irrational content of those thoughts is limited only by the spectrum of human imagination</a>. Since I published a book on my experiences with OCD, I have met people obsessed with the idea that if they close their eyes, the whole world will change while they are not looking, or that if they hand-write a letter or a number that contains a closed loop, their family will die. But OCD does tend to cluster around a limited number of themes.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest of these is contamination \u2013 with generic dirt or germs, or with a specific illness or disease. And these contamination fears are heavily influenced by culture, society and shared health scares. Coronavirus is only the latest.</p> <p>I have OCD that focuses on HIV and Aids, which makes sense because I grew up in the 1980s when global fear of that condition was at its peak. It wasn\u2019t just me. A generation was traumatised. The US psychiatrist Judith Rapoport wrote in her book, The Boy Who Couldn\u2019t Stop Washing, that by 1989 a third of her OCD patients focused on HIV and Aids. The disease, she wrote, appeared \u201cso terrifying, so irrational that it could have been the creation of an obsessive-compulsive\u2019s worst fantasy\u201d.</p> <p>In the 1920s, doctors in the US reported a surge in what they called syphilis-phobia, which coincided with a campaign to highlight the dangers of the disease. In the 1960s and 70s there was a spike in irrational fears of asbestos, just as the dangers of the material had come to popular attention. In 2012, Australian scientists reported the first cases of OCD in people who fixate on thoughts about climate change \u2013 a bogeyman for the new millennium and one that, like HIV in the 1980s, poses an uncertain, universal threat, depicted in lurid detail by the mass media. (Full disclosure: as the former environment correspondent for this newspaper, I used to write those stories.)</p> <p>If coronavirus continues to spread, experts expect related cases of OCD to spike as well. The disease and the attention it is receiving are \u201cgood for business\u201d, one psychiatrist told me with gallows humour.</p> <p>Exactly what makes some people predisposed to OCD isn\u2019t clear, but genetics and previous experiences seem to play a role. In some cases, Veale says, the coronavirus threat could bring on OCD for the first time. \u201cIf someone\u2019s got the right genes and they\u2019ve had all the right experiences to shape them, then this could be a trigger to set the whole thing off.\u201d There is some evidence that simply asking people to wash their hands can make them more anxious about their health. Psychologists have found that students asked to spend a week using hand sanitiser after they touched money, door handles or other possible sources of germs subsequently reported significantly higher signs of hypochondria.</p> <p>For Kyle MacNeill, a freelance writer, the 2009 swine flu scare initiated a years-long struggle with OCD. He traces it back to a remark from a family member that he wasn\u2019t washing his hands properly. Combined with the warnings about the virus, the comment sparked an obsession with germs. \u201cI\u2019d wash my hands 20 times in a row,\u201d he says. \u201cOn my way out I would accidentally brush against the door handle. It\u2019s very exhausting, you know, having to repeat that process again.\u201d MacNeill\u2019s anxieties were eventually successfully treated and he is not overly worried that coronavirus will set them off again.</p> <p>What about people who do worry they might convert rational coronavirus anxiety to OCD? What should they look out for? Veale says the signs of OCD are clear and different from the \u201cnormal\u201d response to the coronavirus. Fretting about the virus and washing hands a lot don\u2019t qualify on their own. An important difference is that someone with OCD will wash until they feel comfortable or \u201cjust right\u201d. \u201cThe key issue is the function,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it to reduce the risk of spreading of coronavirus, or is it done ritualistically in a specific order with termination criteria?\u201d</p> <p>The content of the thoughts and the nature of the anxiety are usually different, too. With OCD, the intrusive thoughts are exaggerated and irrational. One of Veale\u2019s patients with coronavirus OCD, for example, has started to fixate on whether they can catch the disease from Chinese food.</p> <p>It is important to stress that, as long as it is not excessive, handwashing to minimise the risk of coronavirus spread from other people is a rational response to a genuine threat. But OCD just isn\u2019t rational. Although many patients with OCD do wash their hands repeatedly, it is not always because they think they are dirty. In some cases, it is just a way to find comfort, to ease the mental burden of irrational obsessions that a loved one might die, or that something dreadful will happen to them. For some OCD patients, flicking a light on and off a set number of times can bring that relief. So can tapping, or saying a specific word, or shuffling from foot to foot or an infinite number of other nonsensical routines. For me it was seeking reassurance: checking for blood on a piece of glass I stepped on, or asking health professionals if I could catch HIV by doing this and that. In every case, I already knew the answer was no. But I wanted them to say it because for a second or two I believed and the world seemed a brighter place. The reassurance never lasted but it gave me a hit of happiness that became addictive.</p> <p>That is why OCD is so hard to treat, and why coronavirus and official advice on handwashing pose such a dilemma for some OCD patients and therapists. Treatment for OCD is based on the principle of exposure-and-response prevention. It exposes a patient to what they are afraid of, to spike their anxiety, but stops them performing the compulsive acts they would usually employ to make themselves feel better. For contamination-related OCD, that response prevention frequently involves getting them to not wash their hands, sometimes for days on end. In theory, the anxiety drips away and the patient realises they need not rely on handwashing to feel better. Being told they do need to repeatedly wash their hands after all could interfere with that recovery.</p> <p>It is a paradox and one that makes health officials jumpy. I spoke with one NHS psychiatrist who wanted to make the point that OCD patients with handwashing issues should follow the government advice on coronavirus, but not take it too far. They were told by their bosses that they shouldn\u2019t say so publicly because: \u201cIt may be a very risky strategy, including if a patient actually does catch the virus.\u201d</p> <p>For some OCD patients, the risky strategy is the correct one, says Jon Abramowitz, an OCD expert and therapist at the University of North Carolina. He is telling some OCD patients to ignore the official US government health advice on coronavirus and to keep on not washing their hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough call. What I have said to people is that your risk is low and I don\u2019t think you need to take all these kinds of precautions. And given you have OCD, you\u2019re probably better off not.\u201d </p> <p><em>David Adam is the </em><em>author of The Man Who Couldn\u2019t Stop: The Truth About OCD</em>.</p>",
  "<p>In 2000, in his book <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/brooks-bobos.html\" title=\"\">Bobos In Paradise</a>, the US commentator David Brooks noticed that the emerging class he called \u201cbourgeois bohemians\u201d had a particular fondness for rough textures: slate kitchen counters, coarse rugs, stone fireplaces, and so on. Where their parents prized smooth surfaces, these countercultural capitalists (and not to be rude, but I suspect the Guardian\u2019s readership contains a few) yearned to go back to the land. Brooks grasped, too, that they saw something moral in their choices. Their rough-hewn chopping boards didn\u2019t merely signify that they led better lives, but that they were better people.</p> <p>This came to mind the other day when I read a new study on the psychological phenomenon of \u201cmoral licensing\u201d. It\u2019s been known for a while, now, that we\u2019re prone to using our ethical acts as an excuse for our less ethical acts \u2013 so that, for example, the person who religiously eliminates single-use plastic from their life feels entitled to take a couple of extra long-haul flights per year, even though the harm of the latter might outweigh the benefits of the former. But a new German <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227036\" title=\"\">study</a>, by researchers Jannis Engel and Nora Szech, provides an alarming glimpse of just how ready we are to let ourselves off the hook.</p> <p>The experiment involved shopping for towels, and the details are a little complex, but the headline finding is stark: participants who felt they were doing something moral by choosing between \u201cpure organic cotton\u201d towels proved less bothered by whether or not they were produced under ethical working conditions than those choosing between regular towels. Even assuming that organic cotton is greener (and that\u2019s <a href=\"https://qz.com/990178/your-organic-cotton-t-shirt-might-be-worse-for-the-environment-than-regular-cotton/\" title=\"\">disputed</a>), many who value it surely do so for the rather selfish reason that they believe it\u2019s a higher-quality product. Yet this apparently made them feel so virtuous that it eroded their sense of obligation about the conditions in which it was produced.</p> <p>More and more, I find myself wondering if the ubiquity of findings like this points to something fundamentally wrong with the outlook the philosopher Daniel Kaufman has called \u201c<a href=\"https://theelectricagora.com/2017/09/02/morality-everywhere/\" title=\"\">morality everywhere</a>\u201d \u2013 the notion that we even <em>ought</em> to be considering our every daily move through an ethical lens in the first place. This \u201caggressive moral scrutiny directed at the minutiae of everyday life\u201d is suspect on multiple grounds, Kaufman thinks. For one thing, it backfires, triggering resentment against holier-than-thou types, and maybe contributing to events such as Donald Trump\u2019s election. (Which certainly hasn\u2019t been good for the environment.) Another problem is that it assumes morality\u2019s the only virtue worth cultivating \u2013 whereas the flourishing of the arts, sport, literature, family life and much else require that we don\u2019t make every decision about how to use our time, or spend our money, on ethical grounds alone. A society comprised exclusively of moral saints would be a worse place to live.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/17/delegate-but-the-buck-stops-with-you-how-to-end-the-housework-wars\">\u2018Delegate but the buck stops with you\u2019: how to end the housework wars | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m not sure I agree \u2013 or if I do, that this is any reason not to try to make ethical consumer choices.

  "<p><strong>My grandson is 11 years old and knows that his dad (my son) is very unreliable, but he has no idea why. This breaks my heart as he feels his dad doesn\u2019t love him. He </strong><strong>is a </strong><strong>much</strong><strong>-loved boy, but my son has been addicted to drugs for years and is about to go into a long rehab </strong><strong>programme. What do we say to his son? His mother (who has not had a relationship with my son for years, but is a great mum) is adamant that my grandson </strong><strong>should not find out his dad is an addict. </strong><strong>But how do we assure him his dad loves him when he is disappearing for such a long time?</strong></p> <p><strong>Is 11 old enough for the truth or a version of the truth?</strong></p> <p>Yes, it is. But the difficulty here is that your instinct on how to handle this, and his mother\u2019s, are different, so before anything else happens she and you need to have a conversation well out of earshot of your grandson. Perhaps show her this answer as a starter. It\u2019s incredibly important that the adults in his life \u201chave their story straight\u201d \u2013 practising what to say beforehand may sound weird, but is beneficial.</p> <p>I consulted two professionals about your letter: Ryan Lowe, a child and adolescent psychotherapist (<a href=\"http://childpsychotherapy.org.uk\" title=\"\">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>), and Prof Owen Bowden-Jones, a consultant psychiatrist with more than two decades\u2019 experience in dealing with drug addiction issues, and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01FM3W54I/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" title=\"\">The Drug Conversation</a> (which I recommend you and your grandson\u2019s mother read).</p> <p>We all agreed your grandson should be told the truth, in a safe environment and in an age/maturity-appropriate way. He should know he can ask questions afterwards. Because this won\u2019t be one conversation you will have, but many. Think of telling him as less an event, more a process. I would recommend his mother considers a few sessions with a child psychotherapist (following the link above) where she can talk through her fears, so she is better able to talk to her son; he can be brought into the sessions afterwards.</p> <p>Without knowing the truth about his dad, your grandson will be filling in the gaps and, as children internalise things, he may come to the conclusion that he\u2019s done something wrong and that\u2019s why his dad isn\u2019t around or takes drugs. A child\u2019s narrative that things going wrong is their fault is very strong, so he will need lots of reassurance.</p> <p>Lowe wondered, what is \u201chis mum\u2019s reason for not telling her son?\u201d That may give you a starting point to talk about this with her. Lowe thought it is a good sign you think she is a great mum.</p> <p>Once, I hope, it has been decided she will talk to her son (she\u2019s the best person to do it initially, unless she delegates), Bowden-Jones says the first thing to do is ascertain what he knows about drugs: don\u2019t presume. So that\u2019s a good way to start the conversation: \u201cYou may have heard people at school talk about drugs \u2013 what do you know?\u201d (Talking about drugs is a continuing conversation all parents should have with their children, regardless of family history.)</p> <p>Only you know the maturity and sensitivity of your grandson, but at 11, Lowe says \u201cchildren can have quite a good grasp of the complexities of relationships and, with lots of adult support, would normally be able to make sense of issues such as addiction and even the reasons why addiction took hold. Processing pain and difficult information is a fact of life and the more practise the better.\u201d</p> <p>In terms of the addiction part, Lowe suggested something very pertinent: \u201cAlmost all addicts are in pain; addiction is not a toward-pleasure thing, it\u2019s an away from pain one.\u201d You don\u2019t need to say that to him yet (it may be hard for him to think of his father in pain), but it may help you process the information, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/14/should-i-forgive-husband-cheating-with-ex-wife-ask-annalisa-barbieri\">Should I forgive my husband for cheating on me with his ex-wife?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bowden-Jones also covers drug addiction and genetics in his book, in a section you should read, as it details some people\u2019s in-built vulnerability to drug-taking and may be something to discuss with your grandson in time so that, going forward, he can make informed choices in his own life.</p> <p>So advice to his mum or you: do your research about drugs, get support (useful links below), find a safe, calm place to tell him when there\u2019s time to have a conversation, ask him what he knows about drugs, listen to his questions, answer him factually and calmly, let him know he can ask more questions, now or in the future.

  "<p>With its trees still naked after winter, Lordship Road in the London borough of Hackney is an urban vista of asphalt, brick and concrete. Heading north, a pair of tower blocks loom from the horizon. Pounding its pavements to the soundtrack of vans accelerating between speed bumps, it\u2019s hard to imagine that behind the barbed-wire-topped fence on my right, obscured by a tall, grassy bank, lies a nature reserve that is more biodiverse than much of what we consider the real countryside.</p> <p>As soon as you enter Woodberry wetlands, the soundtrack changes to an enthusiastic avian choir. The high-pitched honks of the coots that live year round on this drinking-water reservoir punctuate the shrill chatter and song of robins, blackbirds, dunnocks, greenfinches, parakeets, wrens, warblers, tits (great, long-tailed and blue) and many more. The 11 hectares of wide-open space is calming, like a giant deep breath, while the enigmatic rustles and darting movements of nature going about its business are delightful and reassuring.</p> <p>The reservoir was built in 1833, but was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/17/woodberry-wetlands-wildlife-urban-nature-reserve\">developed as wetlands with thriving reed beds</a> and opened to the public in 2016. This is the result of investing in what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephenmoss1\">natural history writer and television producer Stephen Moss</a> calls our accidental countryside. \u201cMy definition of it is quite simple,\u201d he says. \u201cExcluding farmland and gardens, it\u2019s any place that was created originally for human use that wildlife either stayed in, or found and moved into later.\u201d</p> <p>From ancient ruins, to disused railways, these unintended havens dot the British landscape. Tate Modern, on the Thames, with its nesting peregrine falcons, counts as accidental countryside. So do motorway service stations, which birders keen to spy pied wagtails know offer birds more food than neighbouring sprayed fields. Stonework in cemeteries attracts more than 600 species of lichen \u2013 a composite organism of algae and fungi living in symbiosis \u2013 some of which are hundreds of years old. \u201cNone of these places were designed for wildlife,\u201d says Moss.</p> <p>In a country in which farms take up almost 57% of the land, the tiny, unmeasured fraction of accidental countryside we have needs protecting, says Moss, who made programmes with Bill Oddie for many years and has been a birder since boyhood. \u201cOur society is geared to paying farmers very little money to produce huge amounts of food so supermarkets can make big profits and we have cheap food. Everyone\u2019s happy except the farmers and the wildlife,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He quotes the environmentalist Chris Baines who said that one way to improve the biodiversity of an arable field is to build a housing estate on it. \u201cThis may sound glib, but he was being entirely serious,\u201d writes Moss in his new book, The Accidental Countryside. \u201cMost arable fields are monocultural deserts, with virtually no wildlife, whereas Britain\u2019s gardens are often home to a suite of former woodland birds and other wild creatures.\u201d</p> <p>It is birders and other nature spotters who are often first to realise the ecological value of accidental havens. The classic example, says Moss, is Belfast docks. \u201cThey decommissioned three huge docks, and they left them because you can\u2019t build on them [straight away]. The silt has to settle. Of course the birds turned up, birds brought seeds, plants grew, and suddenly you had this fantastic place in the 1980s or 90s, where birders would climb over the fence and watch the birds.\u201d It is now a RSPB-managed nature reserve, \u201cin the middle of Belfast docks and it\u2019s incredible\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"331f91fcc8a45114d40f4d7126e6262d0efbad47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331f91fcc8a45114d40f4d7126e6262d0efbad47/0_0_4052_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dunnock at Woodberry wetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dunnock at Woodberry wetlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Occasionally, the thought of inviting the public into these sites has made naturalists nervous. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea that they\u2019ll spoil it for us,\u201d says Moss. But the birds won\u2019t get frightened away, he says, because they\u2019re used to people. He\u2019s right. I used to regularly hang out with leggy herons on the human-made New River in Islington. One once stood unselfconsciously a few feet away from me, with a pair of kicking frogs legs dangling from its beak. \u201cIf I walk along in the countryside and see a heron, it will fly away, the way the foxes run away,\u201d says Moss. \u201cBut here, you could walk up to them.\u201d Even here, however, you will only see the iridescent blue flash of the cautious kingfisher if you are really lucky.</p> <p>Cities invite biodiversity, says Moss, partly because they provide warmth \u2013 the reason he suspects he spotted his first bumblebee of the year here today, rather than near his home in Somerset. \u201cThere\u2019s a longer growing season so there\u2019s more natural and semi-natural food, places to nest and food that we provide.\u201d</p> <p>Moss is staunchly pro feeding the ducks. \u201cThere are a lot of theories about feeding ducks, but ducks eat lots of other stuff anyway,\u201d he says. He sees the ritual as a gateway for connecting with nature. \u201cI\u2019m only here because, when I was three, my mum took me to feed the ducks and I asked her what the funny black ones were.\u201d When he got home, he leafed through the Observer\u2019s Book of Birds to discover they were in fact coots. \u201cThat was my first bird spot, the funny black duck. So feeding the ducks is incredibly important. It\u2019s better if you can feed them seed, but not everyone can afford that. There\u2019s a nice coot down there now,\u201d he says, binoculars at the ready.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some long-tailed tits coming through here, see? A little flock of them,\u201d he says, pointing to the brambles on the outer edge of the reed beds. \u201cThey build amazing little ball-shaped nests out of lichen and spider\u2019s web.\u201d He picks out the call of a cetti\u2019s warbler from the throng, once a rare sound in cities.</p> <p>Sparrow populations, meanwhile, have declined in towns and cities where they used to be common, by 60% since the 70s and Moss said we won\u2019t see one today. Gazing into the reeds now, however, he says: \u201cThat looks remarkably like a sparrow. It <em>is</em> a sparrow, how amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s been a real understanding amongst conservationists that these places are not bolt-on extras, but they are where the wildlife is. Because it ain\u2019t in the field.\u201d At Canvey Wick in Essex, for example, a disused oil refinery is now known as a \u201cbrownfield rainforest\u201d, home to rare insects. \u201cBeing further east, it has a more continental climate. It has the second most invertebrates of anywhere in Britain. Some of these sites are extraordinarily biodiverse.\u201d</p> <p>And yet because they have been previously developed by humans, they are classified as brownfield, and are therefore fair game for development. Moss argues that in terms of boosting biodiversity, it could be better to build on fields than rewilded brownfield sites.</p> <p>\u201cThis is quite controversial,\u201d he concedes. \u201cNot everyone will agree with me. But fundamentally what I\u2019m saying is, if your brownfield site is in the middle of Finsbury Park [in London] and it\u2019s an old garage that\u2019s not needed any more, of course you should build housing on it. The problem is, the word brownfield is used for anything where there has been some kind of industrial build.\u201d</p> <p>While building on \u201cgreen\u201d land seems sacrilege, he says we have an exaggerated notion of how built up Britain really is. According to the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, 7% of Britain is built on, rising to 10.6% in England alone. In 2012, the BBC reporter <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096\" title=\"\">Mark Easton analysed this statistic</a> and found that when you take into account urban gardens, parks and other green areas, the proportion of England that is built up drops to 2.3% (and lower nationally).</p> <p>\u201cGiven that we need to build so many new homes to alleviate the current housing crisis, perhaps we should consider a radical solution: putting at least some of them in the countryside itself,\u201d writes Moss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"228f13d17980dedf3ab5f7e6249bc385b17ceac1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/228f13d17980dedf3ab5f7e6249bc385b17ceac1/0_0_5213_7819/667.jpg\" alt=\"A moorhen and a mute swan.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A moorhen and a mute swan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1993, Thames Water put the site of Woodberry wetlands up for sale, but local residents campaigned against building over the reservoirs (one has become the nature reserve while the other is a leisure and water-sports centre.)

One particular pond known to wildlife fans on the edge of the Chilterns to the west of London, home to the rare southern damselfly, had been drained when Moss returned to it as his book was going to press. And the rich surrounding vegetation, beloved of butterflies, had been cleared. \u201cThat\u2019s the fate of so much of the accidental countryside,\u201d Moss writes.</p> <p>Strolling around the reservoir at Woodberry wetlands, we pass walkers and runners wearing blissful expressions. \u201cOne of the most exciting things the accidental countryside offers,\u201d says Moss, \u201cis making nature available to everyone.\u201d A mother watches the water birds (there are five species of gull) while her toddler plays with stones on the pathway.

  "<p>I made my first home on a train. Underneath a large, empty luggage rack, at six years old. I curled myself away, hung up my coat to cover the space, so no one could see inside but me, and set out my belongings neatly. There was a pile of books \u2013 a library. An orange and some biscuits \u2013 the kitchen. And my backpack, a pillow, and, therefore, a bed. As we rumbled towards London St Pancras, my parents duly started pacing the carriageways to find me and I emerged, sad but sated, ready for the big city.</p> <p>We all know there\u2019s something special about train journeys, and for me, they will always be tied to my youthful imagination of personal time and space. It\u2019s the British in us, but on a seated train, where there\u2019s no expectation to talk to anyone, you can find peace and solitude in the untouchable space of your seat. You can strategise, evilly, and cover your coveted second seat with a bag to luxuriate in double the space. Pretend like you\u2019re on the Hogwarts Express and grab a cheeky rocky road and piping coffee from the trolley lady. But nowadays, as the Nakates, Hirsis and Thunbergs of the world take up the mantle of progress, there\u2019s an added benefit: environmental footprint.</p> <p><em>Tagskyrt</em> is the Swedish word for \u201ctrainbragging\u201d \u2013 the smugness<strong> </strong>you impart when you choose to travel by train rather than the road or the skies. You have good reason to feel that way \u2013 trains can emit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49349566\" rel=\"nofollow\">less than half</a> the amount of CO2 into the air than planes or a single person driving in a car, so even on a local level there can be a marked difference between taking a train journey versus gunning down the motorway in your dad\u2019s diesel-guzzling banger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-magic-of-train-travel/2020/mar/13/its-like-being-held-gently-in-someones-palm-a-love-letter-to-the-countryside-day-trip\">\u2018It\u2019s like being held gently in someone\u2019s palm\u2019: a love letter to the countryside day trip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to travel, my eco-consciousness awakening has been a while coming, but was predicated by natural inclinations.

But the thrill of travel is intoxicating, or, at the very least, often necessary for work. Trains give me the best of both worlds and travelling by them is an easy thing to feel good about, and an easy thing to encourage others to do, especially if you live in well-connected areas like the south-east.

  "<p>The coronavirus has turned the UK into an outlier. The rest of the world has seemingly gone into lockdown, shutting schools and public transport in a desperate bid to quell the pandemic. But Boris Johnson has gone in a different direction. According to him, the UK is business as usual.</p> <p>But what prompted such a policy? Is he privy to more advanced scientific knowledge than all the other countries? Is he really such a vocal proponent of herd immunity? Or is there something else going on? Perhaps to find out, we should travel back to 2006, when Johnson told an audience that \u201cthe real hero of Jaws is the mayor\u201d.</p> <p>Ah, Mayor Larry Vaughn, Amity\u2019s foolhardy leader who orders the beach to remain open despite overwhelming evidence that there\u2019s a massive shark in the water determined to eat everyone. Now everything suddenly makes sense.</p> <p>But still, at least Vaughn is finally getting his dues. Without him, Jaws would simply be a film about a policeman who spots a shark, imposes a stringent set of beachside social distancing rules and then kills the shark. But Vaughn is the necessary sand in the ointment. He can only see the potential economic losses caused by a beach closure, and pushes on against all arguments. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day,\u201d he tells the media at one point. \u201cThe beaches are opened, and people are having a wonderful time.\u201d Vaughn is the entire reason why Jaws became an enduring classic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72e8b100f7f9b68ef7cf66a1aa4890dcd8b0616d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72e8b100f7f9b68ef7cf66a1aa4890dcd8b0616d/0_113_2415_1449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaws.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The beaches are opened, and people are having a wonderful time\u2019 ...

True, in 2013 the comedian Howard Kremer released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EtQt6EBt7w\">song</a> celebrating Larry Vaughn\u2019s impressive the-show-must-go-on attitude (\u201cOnly three people got eaten / The rest had a great season / Cos of Larry Vaughn\u201d). And, true, Boris Johnson is a self-confessed Vaughnaholic. But that\u2019s about the extent of it.</p> <p>Looking back, Vaughn had three things going for him. The first, obviously, was his never-say-die attitude towards deadly shark attacks. The second was his incredible taste in blazers. This, remember, was a man so dedicated to his role as the mayor of a seaside town that he literally walked around in a jacket covered in little tiny anchors. Whatever you think of the man\u2019s policies, you have to admire his style. I have for some years been a member of a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Town-of-Amity-Mayor-Larry-Vaughns-Anchor-Jacket-133388460013741/\">Facebook group</a> devoted to discussions of Vaughn\u2019s anchor jacket. Paul F Tompkins once commissioned an <a href=\"https://paulftompkins.com/post/58966410097/amity-as-you-know-means-friendship-photo\">imitation suit</a> and the only thing stopping me from doing the same is my increasing suspicion that the money would be better spent on long-life food to feed my children when the coronavirus inevitably mutates and our quarantine period becomes indefinite.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=100X1R2fkKA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/100X1R2fkKA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The third thing is Vaughn\u2019s longevity. You\u2019d think that, in a fair and just society, he would have been removed from office the moment the people of Amity caught wind of his preposterous self-interest in the face of disaster. But no. Do me a favour and watch Jaws 2. It\u2019s set a few years after the devastating attacks of the original, but guess who\u2019s still mayor? That\u2019s right, Larry Vaughn. Better yet, despite even more overwhelming evidence that another shark is terrorising the coastline, Vaughn still continues to frustrate all of Brody\u2019s plans. The electorate, it seems, holds a lot of stock in Vaughn\u2019s total refusal to believe in the existence of sharks.</p> <p>Look, nobody is saying that Vaughn was perfect. In his ability to willingly send townsfolk to their deaths for short-term financial gain, some might argue that he was actually something of a villain. But to me, he is a figure of ultimate dignity. Was he a good man? No. Did he do his best? No. Is it a good thing that our prime minister is repeatedly being compared to him during a once-a-century global health crisis? No. But did he wear a nice jacket with some anchors on it? Yes. Yes, he did.</p>",

  "<p>If you have ever strutted around in sunglasses and a silken bomber jacket, and didn\u2019t even have to try to keep a straight face, chances are you\u2019re into synthwave. This subcultural genre of music, characterised by anthemic analogue synth lines, is explored in this stylish but shallow documentary.</p> <p>The partly crowdfunded film makes a reverse historical sweep of the genre, ending where the music started with the sober, even ascetic work of Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream. This was gloriously cheapened by Giorgio Moroder, who made the sound aspirational and decadent, inspiring not only pop but also film soundtracks, where synth sounds were easy signifiers for the future. The style fell out of favour as the 90s embraced guitars again, but Daft Punk became the key act to bring it back \u2013 their light-up pyramid stage set is the defining icon of the synthwave aesthetic \u2013 and influenced a host of new producers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usnW-CsFVwI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/usnW-CsFVwI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Social media and blogging play their parts, as people start to share their fetish for the neon lights and kitsch fonts of the 80s as well as the music. Stranger Things, today\u2019s most 80s-nostalgic pop culture, has a theme that is pure synthwave; another key moment is the 2011 Nicolas Winding Refn film Drive, which deployed a synthwave soundtrack and, married to the nihilistic glamour of Ryan Gosling\u2019s lead character, cemented its hipster kudos. Perhaps the best definition is music that makes you feel cool while walking at night.</p> <p>Director Iv\u00e1n Castell employs a diverse and global set of talking heads, which gives a sense how far the genre has pervaded, aided by the internet \u2013 he hops from New York and Toronto to Antwerp, Grenoble and beyond.

Carpenter is employed as a sensei-like narrator, recording his observations on to a cassette tape to be taken back in time by a Gosling-type pretty-boy street punk driving a DeLorean, in a series of impressively produced interstitial segments. This fantasy narrative gives the film its backwards-tracking structure to return to the source of synthwave, though Carpenter speaks as if he\u2019s reading an autocue that\u2019s been set up two yards too far away, and his rhapsodic guff about the \u201crebel beauty\u201d of the genre and his wise-old-sage pronouncements \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t intellectualise it, it all comes down to one thing, instinct, that\u2019s what you must keep close to you\u201d \u2013 are classy filler.</p> <p>There are some interesting moments.

One puts this introversion down to them being \u201cbundles of self-doubt\u201d; others say it\u2019s to focus on the music and escape the banality of today\u2019s image-led social media. British trio Gunship, who drive a car with a keyboard for a grille, are enjoyably forthright about how much better 80s films were versus those of the \u201cawful, meta, self-aware\u201d present.

In recent years we have seen Clark, another Warp artist, get major attention for his 2016 Last Panthers soundtrack; Mica \u201cMicachu\u201d Levi really find her feet as an artist with multiple soundtracks since 2014\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Cc20I-maM&amp;list=RDEMCudWujeBS3OZdihBlyRBgg&amp;start_radio=1\">Under the Skin</a>; and Ryuichi Sakamoto move back to his electronic roots alongside Alva Noto for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ1WE4uNMEs&amp;list=PLPxJzx2gifeeE9IsPtkJfTqffXDRczpeO\">The Revenant</a>. And all the while, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/22/clint-mansell-stoker-soundtrack\">Clint Mansell</a> and the team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/21/trent-reznor-nine-inch-nails-youre-seeing-the-fall-of-america\">Trent Reznor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/03/trent-reznor-atticus-ross-soundtrack-boston-bombings-patriots-day\">Atticus Ross</a> have painted Hollywood all kinds of shades of black with their moody synthscapes. Similar work has been put in by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/underworld\">Underworld</a> (through their relationships with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/danny-boyle\">Danny Boyle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anthonyminghella\">Anthony Minghella</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/leftfield\">Leftfield</a>, too.</p> <p>It makes sense, of course. Electronica producers deal in the kind of fine detail and gut-rumbling noise that really comes to life with full immersion in a Dolby-equipped cinema. Since the EDM explosion in the US, too, global ears have become acclimatised to synapse-twisting electro sounds, and as raves and festivals become visual extravaganzas, musicians increasingly create their sound with images in mind. The likes of Alva Noto and Al Qadiri have always been equally at home in galleries as at raves. As Warp\u2019s creative director Stephen Christian says: \u201cWe exist a lot in the contemporary art world because of the people we work with, be it video directors or designers. We put an emphasis on the visual side of things.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, we are in a golden age of electronic soundtracks not seen since the era of Tangerine Dream, Walter/Wendy Carlos and John Carpenter. So will all this one day sound as kitsch as those 70s and 80s synths? After all, as Philip French said of the Carlos-scored film A Clockwork Orange: \u201cNothing dates the past like its impressions of the future.\u201d </p>",

There was no light, there was nothing.\u201d</p> <p>He spent days with neighbours and rescue workers digging survivors and the dead out of the earth and was housed with hundreds of other residents in a local school before being allowed to go home.</p> <p>Days earlier, five <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2020/03/02/veja-quem-sao-os-mortos-pela-chuva-no-rj.ghtml\">people</a> died during heavy rains across Rio de Janeiro. One man drowned when the Acari favela in north Rio was flooded. Bruna Aguiar, an activist from the favela\u2019s Fala Akari collective, said rains have worsened there since a flood in 2013.</p> <p>\u201cOlder people talk about other floods in the 1970s, but nothing of this magnitude,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to data from Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), one Rio de Janeiro weather station logged 134 extreme rainfalls from 1960 to 1990, and 221 from 1990 to 2020. A S\u00e3o Paulo weather station reported 15 from 1960 to 1990 and 44 since.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s clearly been an increase of extreme events in the south-east of Brazil,\u201d Ambrizzi said.</p> <p>His own research from S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 capital of the state where four <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/sp/bauru-marilia/noticia/2020/02/11/chuvas-provocam-quatro-mortes-no-estado-de-sao-paulo.ghtml\">people</a> died in two days in February following <a href=\"https://noticias.r7.com/sao-paulo/capital-paulista-tem-maior-volume-de-chuvas-para-fevereiro-em-77-anos-26022020\">heavy</a> rainfall \u2013 backs this up.</p> <p>Data from two weather stations in the city showed an increase in extreme rain events, according to a paper Ambrizzi and other scientists <a href=\"https://jornal.usp.br/ciencias/ciencias-ambientais/dados-comprovam-aumento-de-eventos-climaticos-extremos-em-sao-paulo/\">published</a> in <a href=\"https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.14307\">Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</a> last month. The dry season has begun extending from September into October in recent decades, they found.</p> <p>\u201cThis, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of water-courses, leads to inundation, flooding and landslides,\u201d the paper said. \u201cChanges in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanisation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUrban heat islands\u201d created by the concrete and lack of vegetation in big cities increase temperatures, scientists said, and lack of permeable ground means more flooding. Global warming exacerbates the effect.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it is hotter, it rains more, and this gets worse if you have urban areas, areas of concrete and asphalt,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Marengo from Brazil\u2019s National Centre for Monitoring and Alerts of Natural Disasters, and another of the paper\u2019s authors.</p> <p>Not all scientists hold global warming responsible. Brazil\u2019s Space Research Institute said the rains were \u201cmeteorological phenomena typical of summer\u201d, and blamed them on the South Atlantic convergence zone \u2013 \u201ca band of clouds that channels moisture from the Amazon and the tropical Atlantic Ocean\u201d for three days or more, producing heavy rain and cold fronts. Nor has the rain increased everywhere: the north-east has seen more extreme droughts, it said.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t generalise everything and blame global warming for everything,\u201d said Jos\u00e9lia Pegorim, a meteorologist from the Climatempo weather service, while noting summer\u2019s rains have been exceptional. \u201cWe are breaking records,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In January, 59 people were <a href=\"https://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/gerais/2020/02/08/interna_gerais,1120493/chega-a-59-o-numero-de-mortes-apos-as-chuvas-em-minas.shtml\">killed</a> during heavy rains in Minas Gerais state. According to Inmet data, its capital Belo Horizonte saw 30 \u201cextreme rain\u201d events from 1960 to 1990, and 52 from 1990 to 2020.</p> <p>In Belo Horizonte, 13 people were killed in January, when 935mm of rain was recorded at one weather station \u2013 the highest level since 1910, and more than half the rainfall expected for the whole year.</p> <p>Extreme rain events and consecutive droughts are likely to continue, said Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil\u2019s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute for Advanced Studies. \u201cThis is the new normal,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Every nook and cranny teems with history. The tales of war, adventure, death and crime are myriad but for 30 years the people of Plymouth have only been able to gaze across at Drake\u2019s Island \u2013 but not set foot there.</p> <p>But on Sunday three boatloads of visitors will make the short hop from the Devon city to explore the crumbling fortifications, the bramble-covered barrack buildings and its mysterious tunnels.</p> <p>The island in Plymouth Sound has been off-limits since 1989 \u2013 when an adventure centre on the island closed down \u2013 but is now being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/15/plymouth-francis-drake-island-fortress-sale-hotel\">developed as a luxury holiday resort</a>, and before building work starts, people have been invited to buy tickets \u2013 the proceeds of which are going to a local hospice \u2013 to join exclusive tours.</p> <p>Demand for the 210 tickets for Sunday and a second trip in May was huge. They were snapped up within minutes and <a href=\"https://www.stlukes-hospice.org.uk/discover-the-secrets-of-drakes-island-and-boost-local-hospice-care/\">St Luke\u2019s Hospice Plymouth</a>, which will benefit from the proceeds, reported that its website received almost half a million hits during the sale period, not just from Plymouth people but from fans of history and islands from across the UK.</p> <p>Robert Maltby, the head of communications and marketing at the hospice, said the island was important to the people of Plymouth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an intriguing place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Plymothian it is right there in front of you all the time. It\u2019s a major piece of the city\u2019s history and everyone wonders what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>The 2.5-hectare (6.5-acre) island has been a place of pilgrimage, a refuge, a fort, prison and \u2013 until the late 1980s \u2013 the site of the Drake\u2019s Island Adventure Centre.</p> <p>Maltby has had a preview of the island, taking a trip there to take photos for the ticket sales. \u201cI was taken aback by how good a condition many of the buildings are still in,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are overgrown with brambles but the brickwork has somehow stayed looking pristine.\u201d</p> <p>His favourite part was the tunnels, which have been used to store ammunition and other goods over the years. \u201cThey were pretty amazing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The island\u2019s warden, avid historian Bob King, will lead the tour. Over the years his role has included guarding the island and keeping its shoreline clean.</p> <p>But he said: \u201cThe best part of my job is researching the history of the island and sharing it with as many people as possible.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the fortifications and how they have been used and defended Plymouth over the centuries is fascinating, what brings the history alive are the personal stories of the people on the island.\u201d</p> <p>The island was initially known as St Michael\u2019s \u2013 named after a 12th-century chapel built there. It is only in more recent times that it has been known as Drake\u2019s Island, after the Elizabethan sea captain.</p> <p>In the 16th century, as defending Britain\u2019s shores became more important, the chapel was demolished and artillery towers, musketry walls and barracks were constructed.</p> <p>At one point it served as a prison but as the naval dockyard in Devonport grew, its fortification and armaments were beefed up to protect the fleet.</p> <p>During the second world war it was a minefield control post and if there had been an invasion explosives would have been detonated from the island.</p> <p>It has also been a scene of tragedy. In 1774 a local shipwright and carpenter, John Day, designed a wooden diving chamber and made a bet over how long he could stay submerged. He perished in the adventure.</p> <p>Drake\u2019s Island has been a magnet for all types. Queen Victoria sketched it and in 1957 a bunch of schoolboys \u201cinvaded\u201d it and claimed the island for Plymouth. They were arrested by the guard, given breakfast and then taken back to the city for a double maths lesson.</p> <p>In 2005, anti-nuclear campaigners set up a peace camp and declared the island a nuclear-free state. They followed in the footsteps of brandy smugglers, who used the island as a stopping-off point.</p> <p>The island was bought last year by a local businessman, Morgan Phillips. His hotel plans include a glass elevator that will whizz guests up from the jetty.

Having previously been sceptical about vaccines, having read one of our <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/search/?q=vaccine#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=vaccines&amp;gsc.sort=\" title=\"\">fact checks</a>, she\u2019d decided to go ahead and have her children vaccinated. It sticks in my mind as an example of the harm that bad information can do \u2013 not just to our democracy, which as fact checkers we\u2019re often asked about \u2013 but to our health.</p> <p>Misleading claims around vaccines have encouraged parents to disregard medical advice and take unnecessary risks with their children\u2019s lives. Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus began, we have been fighting a similar tide of false claims and exaggerations. Much of this has originated and spread on social media. As is common during global news events \u2013 especially health crises \u2013 some have sought to pin the blame on familiar enemies, whether it is <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/wuhan-5g-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">5G technology</a>, the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/Rothschild-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Rothschilds</a> or <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-government-laboratory/\" title=\"\">Chinese lab scientists</a>. Many people have spread conspiracy theories, playing on our fears by suggesting that somehow the institutions that are supposed to protect us somehow had forewarning of \u2013 or even planned \u2013 the global outbreak of this deadly virus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Facebook post shared more than 300,000 times made several dangerous claims</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But of particular concern in the short term are those spreading false or misleading health advice. This is often done with the best of intentions: it\u2019s a natural response to a scary situation to pass on advice that you think might help protect your friends and family. But if that information turns out to be inaccurate, you risk doing more harm than good.</p> <p>The misinformation we\u2019ve seen broadly falls into three separate categories. Some, such as the claim that children are immune, begin life with a kernel of truth \u2013 here, that the symptoms in children are generally less severe than they are in older people. But without the proper context and caveats, these morph over time into something more dangerous. Children <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/children-can-get-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">may suffer less from the virus</a>, but they could still pass it on to more vulnerable friends and family.</p> <p>Others revolve around misconceptions of the term \u201ccoronavirus\u201d itself. Without the crucial context that coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that we\u2019ve known about since the 1960s, perfectly normal references to coronaviruses that predate this outbreak can suddenly seem like evidence of a conspiracy. And so we end up with people believing that vaccine trials for previously existing coronaviruses show the outbreak was manufactured, or even that the makers of Dettol somehow knew about the outbreak in advance, because they list <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/coronavirus-dettol/\" title=\"\">\u201chuman coronavirus\u201d</a> on their bottles.</p> <p>The third type is bad information masquerading as official health guidelines and advice. This week, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the NHS both announced measures designed to combat bad information around this coronavirus. DCMS has formed a cross-departmental taskforce to monitor misleading claims, while the NHS has teamed up with tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook to signpost official advice on their platforms. While these announcements are welcome, it is just as important to challenge bad information as it is to direct people to reliable advice.</p> <p>A Facebook post shared more than 300,000 times made several dangerous claims. Chief among them was the \u201cadvice\u201d that a runny nose means you have a common cold \u2013 not Covid-19. This is wrong; this symptom is rarer in Covid-19 sufferers, <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/coronavirus-claims-symptoms-viral/\" title=\"\">but it does not rule it out</a>. The post also made the unfounded claim that the virus will die in <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-graphics-unicef/\" title=\"\">temperatures above </a><a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-graphics-unicef/\" title=\"\">27C (80F)</a>. The potential real-world repercussions of such a post (which has now been amended after we approached the author) are plain to see. It\u2019s right that social media platforms have come under scrutiny. But we\u2019ve also seen misleading claims emerge from traditional print and broadcast media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-ban-travel-backfired\">Trump\u2019s coronavirus ban on travel from the EU is backfiring already | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Telling people that the new coronavirus \u201cdoesn\u2019t infect children\u201d \u2013 as one broadsheet columnist claimed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/1234627349569851393\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> \u2013 may lead people to make potentially fatal decisions. Journalists have also reported several false claims and conspiracy theories on the new coronavirus. At various times, readers of the Daily Express have been told that an academic paper claimed the virus has been \u201c<a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/new-coronavirus-not-genetically-engineered/\" title=\"\">genetically engineered</a>\u201d to pass between humans more efficiently and that the World Health Organization knew about Covid-19 years before the current outbreak. Both claims are untrue. And multiple newspapers reported a false claim that mass cremations may be secretly taking place in Wuhan, based on \u201csatellite images\u201d that a bit of checking revealed <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/satellites-wuhan-sulphur-dioxide-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">weren\u2019t satellite images at all</a>.</p> <p>As much as we rely on our public institutions and elected politicians, established news outlets are also seen as a dependable source of health information. While plenty of media outlets have been behaving responsibly, we deserve better than the exaggeration and speculation we\u2019ve seen from some.</p> <p>This is too important for a \u201cpublish first, check later\u201d approach. The good news is that we all, journalists and citizens alike, can take steps to slow the spread of misleading claims. By taking time to think before you share \u2013 about where a claim has come from, how you might check its contents, and how it makes you feel \u2013 we\u2019re less likely to inadvertently pass on bad information that puts our friends and family at an even greater risk.</p> <p>We face a global public health crisis in the age of unprecedented and rampant misinformation \u2013 good health advice can make the difference between life and death.</p> <p>\u2022 Tom Phillips is the editor of Full Fact</p>",

  "<p>Ekene Okonkwo studies political science, advocates for gun control and reproductive rights, and is voting in a presidential election for the first time this year. But only if she can vote for Bernie Sanders.</p> \n<p>The 19-year-old, who studies political science and lives in the Bronx, said the Vermont senator is the only candidate she trusts to deal with the issues she cares most about \u2013 on climate change, for instance, she called former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s plan \u201cunfeasible\u201d. A vote for Biden, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee in November, would only give the party more reason to take her vote for granted, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we lose to Trump then hopefully within the next four years maybe an AOC or Rashida Tlaib would be able to run,\u201d Okonkwo said, referring to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and another progressive politician who has gained popularity in the last two years. \u201cMaybe there would be a better chance to save the planet.\u201d</p> \n<p>Okonkwo is not alone in her unequivocal and uncompromising support for Sanders. She is part of a loosely connected but vocal group, sometimes uniting under hashtags like #BernieorBust or #NeverBiden who say they will not vote for Biden if he wins the nomination. While it\u2019s nearly impossible to know how large the group is, hundreds of people have shared this sentiment, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthonyvclark20\">including</a> progressive political candidates.</p> \n<p>It may be impossible to quantify their number, but not their influence. Those Democrats who will not yield to a moderate and vote for Biden if he wins the nomination are the same group who are sometimes blamed for Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 when disappointed Sanders fans sat out the general election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c92bd2584465722667c6f0071aa9b18002720e0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c92bd2584465722667c6f0071aa9b18002720e0/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on 27 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on 27 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Gibson/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And the past few weeks have been hard to swallow for Sanders fans. After a strong early showing in Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire his star faded on Super Tuesday. Supporters were left disappointed again this week when he lost to Biden in Michigan, where he edged out Hillary Clinton in 2016. This poor performance is partly due to an unexpectedly weak youth vote \u2013 despite Sanders\u2019 vaunted ability to mobilise younger Americans.</p> \n<p>As the Sanders campaign reckons with the fallout, and former Democratic candidates <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-builds-moderate-coalition-collecting-endorsements-2020-candidates/story?id=69442331\">rush to endorse Biden</a><strong>,</strong> the #BernieorBust fans are grappling with a repeat of 2016. It\u2019s hard to tell how their decision could affect the election, but in 2016, a similar group of people who boycotted Hillary Clinton on election day contributed to her loss in swing states like Florida, where <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/florida\">more than</a> 200,000 people voted for candidates from outside the two major parties, such as Gary Johnson or Jill Stein.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you distrust something, you are more likely to opt out of it,\u201d said Rashawn Ray, a governance fellow at the Brookings Institution. And Sanders supporters don\u2019t trust the Democratic party. \u201cThey think its political sabotage, and not allowing Bernie to have a fair shot. So what do people do? They opt out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Martha Baez, a 54-year-old who works in finance, is one of those voters. She is registered as an independent and voted for Jill Stein in 2016. \u201cThere was failure in getting me out to the polls with the \u2018lesser of two evils\u2019 theory\u201d, she said of the argument that whatever Clinton\u2019s perceived flaws, she was better than Trump.</p> \n<p>This year, Baez is planning to vote for Sanders in the New York primary, and will not vote for Biden if he is the nominee in November.<strong> </strong>But she said her real issue was not with the specific candidate, but losing trust in the Democratic party. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I should put aside my values and vote out of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DNC needs an overhaul, it lacks values, real leaders that represent the people not its donors.\u201d</p> \n<p>The impact on the supreme court or other policies, she said, was not her responsibility.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy is that my problem?\u201d she said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it have been considered before selecting the \u2018chosen one\u2019? Will they try and flip the script and make it my issue or fault?\u201d</p> \n<p>Jessica Wright, an avid Sanders supporter in east Texas, tweeted that she was #BernieorBust after his Super Tuesday defeat in her state. She said she was angry that other Democratic candidates had dropped out just before the big primary day to endorse Joe Biden, and wanted the \u201cso-called Democratic establishment\u201d to know they were letting down people like her.</p> \n<p>Wright, 37, works at a hospital and said she and her husband live paycheck to paycheck. She said Sanders\u2019 policies would be the best for her family, including family members married to immigrants struggling to gain citizenship status in the US. But given that a Trump election could be worse, and herald new conservative court appointees and other harmful policies, she is still considering voting for Biden, or at the very least, voting down ballot in other, non-presidential races on election day.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me not voting would be to send a message: what you\u2019ve done is not OK,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI wish there was a way to vote for [Biden] and still send that message.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard government professor who studies political campaigns, said there is a similar \u201csour grapes\u201d group during every election, even if it\u2019s not a big enough group to swing the result. But he said what determines whether or not Sanders supporters will show up for Biden depends on how the latter treats them in the coming months.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you lose [your candidate] it\u2019s like a death in the family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the bitterness of the emotions. Biden knows that bitterness so he could be empathetic and bring those people back to the fold.\u201d He gave the example of the 1988 Democratic primary, when frontrunner Michael Dukakis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/us/democrats-agree-on-rules-to-select-nominee-in-1992.html\">reached a compromise</a> with his opponent Jesse Jackson by changing party rules to tie the delegate vote more closely to the popular vote, giving Jackson a partial victory.</p> \n<p>Ansolabehere also pointed out that Sanders\u2019 progressive movement relies heavily on young people going to the polls. But even if they are politically engaged, this subset of voters consistently deals with more hurdles to register to vote because of restrictive voting policies around address changes and identification. In New Hampshire, for example, a Republican-backed law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/05/new-hampshire-2020-election-student-vote\">requires</a> that many young voters have a driver\u2019s license to vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to organize a campaign around younger generations,\u201d Ansolabehere said. \u201cYou only have 50% chance of being registered when you\u2019re 18 years old.\u201d And that could have played a role during Super Tuesday, when youth turnout (ages 18 to 29) was only an <a href=\"http://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/super-tuesday-2020\">estimate</a>d 14% in Virginia, and 5% in Tennessee, according to a Tufts University exit poll.</p> \n<p>Ray also said \u201cvoter suppression is alive and well\u201d and probably affected turnout for Sanders. But he said that the group that is more likely to determine the election is the 11% of white voters, mostly suburban and often women, who <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/\">switched</a> from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in the last election.</p> \n<p>For Sanders\u2019 supporters, these obstacles only drive home the frustration around an election system that they say works against their candidate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a381fa53-24c1-46a8-a648-7710acb74a3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K30TgRppDzg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Habiba Choudhary, a Sanders supporter who was canvassing in Michigan, saw the long polling station lines firsthand on Tuesday in Sanders-friendly communities like Dearborn and perceived this as a way to rig the election in favor of Biden. The New York-based 28-year-old, who identifies with the #BernieorBust movement, said the senator\u2019s message resonated with her family<strong>,</strong> Bangladeshi immigrants who share a one-bedroom apartment in Queens.</p> \n<p>Sanders seemed to be the only candidate whose policies could ease the plight of her father, a taxi driver dealing with healthcare issues, and her sister, who is straining to pay back student loans. \u201cEnough is enough \u2013 we tried the neoliberalism and we\u2019re sick and tired of it,\u201d she said. \u201c[Sanders] gave me and other people that voice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Choudhary said, she would follow Sanders\u2019 lead when it came to voting in November. In 2016, the senator accepted defeat after the primary, and went on to endorse Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know Bernie is super consistent,\u201d she said. \u201cHis supporters are gonna come out for Biden.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2020.

The durability and storage capacity of the batteries also need to be improved, to make them lighter and ideally to replace the lead with lithium without increasing the cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"379254512332268dc5959b9518fb562ce14a3151\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/379254512332268dc5959b9518fb562ce14a3151/0_133_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nantu shows the battery pack of one of the solar-powered canoes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nantu shows the battery pack of one of the solar-powered canoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Albarenga</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a long list of other improvements that are needed, but the process is well under way. During the next phase of development, solar recharging stations will be installed along the canoe route. Seven young Achuar people are being trained in using the technology. These are \u201cintercultural training\u201d programmes taught by peers, who are also instructed by indigenous technicians.</p> <p>Concerned about the future of a growing population, the Achuar community is gradually diversifying economically in terms of moving beyond self-sufficiency toward sustainability. There is already an ecotourism project where as many as 24 people can stay in two cabins managed by the community, and a balanced food project that uses a solar power plant. The main and imminent threat, however, is undoubtedly the proximity of the road.</p> <p>Nantu makes a very clear complaint to the authorities in Quito: \u201cI would tell the government not to carry out projects without consulting the indigenous peoples. They should carry out projects in consultation with the people, who are the owners of the territories. They should stop expanding oil frontiers and the arteries that reach the outer corners of the Amazon. It\u2019s becoming very dangerous for us.\u201d</p> <p>Nantu is aware that changes are taking place in the climate and of how global heating affects the territory and the world. \u201cThere is some variation of life here in the jungle. The flowering cycle has changed by one to two months. The rains are too intense, and the sun is too strong.\u201d</p> <p>He has a vision for the future of his five children. He imagines an Amazon capable of being economically self-sufficient, a few community tourism centres managed by indigenous people and solar canoes managed by the Achuar with recharging stations along the river. No roads, no pipelines, no oil.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was produced with support from the <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/tags/rainforest-journalism-fund-reporting\">Rainforest Journalism Fund</a>, in association with the Pulitzer Center</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>On the surface, the Wednesday afternoon matinee between the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles back in April 2015 appears as nondescript as it gets. It was an early season contest between a pair of teams hurtling toward mediocrity. The Orioles won 8-2, powered by a six-run first inning \u2013 but that isn\u2019t why we\u2019re talking about it. Peel back the box score, and the otherwise forgettable game\u2019s novelty comes into focus: it marked the first time in Major League Baseball\u2019s long history that two teams squared off with no fans in attendance, an extraordinary measure taken in response to the unrest in Baltimore that followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-police-officers-charges-dropped\">the death of Freddie Gray</a>, a black man who was killed in police custody weeks earlier.</p> <p>Five years after that surreal afternoon in Baltimore, and amid a pandemic that has left people around the world unnerved and anxious, the crowdless game may represent the American sporting community\u2019s only hope of salvaging its competitions<strong> </strong>\u2013 and revenues.</p> <p>That is, of course, if the games are played at all. By Wednesday night, the NBA was prepared to take its own drastic measures. With some games already underway around the league, fans gathered at Chesapeake Energy Arena to watch the Oklahoma City Thunder host the Utah Jazz. Starting lineups were announced, and officials prepared for tipoff. But after an extended delay, the game was abruptly postponed. The reason quickly came into focus: Rudy Gobert, the all-star center for the Jazz, tested positive for the coronavirus. Moments later, news broke that the NBA was suspending its season \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d On Thursday, other domestic leagues signaled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mls-suspends-season-as-coronavirus-outbreak-hits-us-sporting-calendar\">they would follow the NBA\u2019s lead</a>. Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League both announced that they were suspending their seasons for 30 days. MLB said its new season, due to start at the end of March, will be delayed for at least two weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mls-suspends-season-as-coronavirus-outbreak-hits-us-sporting-calendar\">MLS and NHL suspend seasons as coronavirus delays start of MLB campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The economic impact of the sporting world grinding to a halt could be enormous, though it may still be too early to gauge. NBA officials are anticipating potentially \u201closses in the hundreds of millions of dollars across the sport,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28885303/nba-union-weighing-ways-continue-season-curtailing-games\">an ESPN report, </a>another blow for a league still reeling from the economic damages from its frayed relationship with China. Mark Emmert, the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/sports/coronavirus-ncaa-tournament.html\">said</a> he expected the organization to lose tens of millions of dollars in ticket revenue as a result of playing college basketball\u2019s biggest tournament behind closed doors. Shortly afterwards, the tournament was cancelled altogether.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t begin to get to any exact numbers until you see how much worse this gets, and how much more extensive the sports and entertainment cancellations end up being,\u201d says David Carter, a professor at the University of Southern California and an expert on sports business and marketing.</p> <p>Carter says that the ripple effects of the slowdown will vary depending on the league and the market. Leagues such as MLS and NHL, he pointed out, are \u201cmore reliant on attendance than the NBA, which is more reliant on media contracts.\u201d Carter adds that \u201cplaying games without fans, you could argue, is less of an issue in the NBA and NFL than these other sports.\u201d</p> <p>But Carter is quick to say that while some leagues are more insulated than others, and markets with only one sports team are likely to suffer more than a city like Los Angeles with a massive global economy of its own, \u201cno one is even remotely impervious to what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f266eadc8a707fb5bf9e196bc4e8add59086c74e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f266eadc8a707fb5bf9e196bc4e8add59086c74e/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Detroit Red Wings head equipment manager, Paul Boyer, packs up after his team\u2019s game against the Washington Capitals was postponed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Detroit Red Wings head equipment manager, Paul Boyer, packs up after his team\u2019s game against the Washington Capitals was postponed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Smith/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He points to cities that were scheduled to host NCAA tournament games next week as particularly vulnerable to the changes. \u201cIf spending that would have otherwise gone to the arena goes to other parts of town, then everybody should be OK,\u201d Carter says. \u201cBut when we talk about March Madness, that\u2019s sports tourism. That\u2019s new money coming into where these games are being played. Those cities bid to be hosts because it brings heads in beds.\u201d</p> <p>Edward Schauder, an attorney who specializes in sports business, says that a postponement rather than an outright cancellation may ultimately help leagues avoid significant losses. \u201cBy postponing, you still have a chance to get 100% of the revenue and eliminate 100% of the risk,\u201d he tells the Guardian, noting that leagues have suspended play before, whether to allow players to compete in international competitions such as the Olympics or for general work stoppages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/nba-suspends-season-covid-19-coronavirus-basketball\">The NBA continued despite earthquakes and death. But Covid-19 is different</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prudent decision,\u201d Schauder says of the NBA\u2019s suspension of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart play because you\u2019re not forfeiting the revenue from the live game. When the stock market loses money, you don\u2019t lose money until you sell. The NBA is just deferring its revenue streams until a future point in time. If they cancel the season, it\u2019s a different conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Schauder says the deepest, and most immediate implications, will be felt by those employed by the stadiums, which play host to other entertainment ventures along with sporting events, as well as nearby businesses that capitalize on those gatherings. \u201cPlayers are going to be fine, the league is going to be fine. The real economic impact are these people who rely on this money, and it\u2019s countless workers: bathroom attendants, ushers, vendors, security personnel, the union workers \u2013 it goes on and on,\u201d Schauder says. There are signs that teams are willing to help workers: the Cleveland Cavaliers said they will compensate \u201cour event staff and hourly workforce that is impacted with the changes to our regular event schedule.\u201d Cavaliers star Kevin Love <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28894232/kevin-love-kicks-support-drive-arena-workers-100k-pledge\">said he would donate $100,000</a> to compensate staff affected by the NBA suspension.</p> <p>And Schauder believes that the NCAA could bear the largest brunt of the outbreak. \u201cWith the cancellation of March Madness, the NCAA, its student athletes and fans have emerged as collateral damage of the coronavirus. Unlike the professional leagues that have suspended their respective seasons and may still resume their seasons at some point in time \u2026 the NCAA tournament has been completely wiped out,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a result, seniors will not be afforded the opportunity to showcase their talents prior to the NBA draft and there will not be any of the anticipated upsets and magical moments that would have allowed student athletes to capitalize on under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/29/ncaa-votes-college-athletes-benefit-fame-name-image-likeness\">the new \u2018pay to play\u2019 laws in certain states</a>. Sponsors may also have the right under force majeure clauses to claw-back on sponsorship dollars advanced to the NCAA.\u201d</p> <p>Even in its offseason, the country\u2019s most popular league, the NFL, has been affected. The NFL Draft is scheduled to be held 23 April in Las Vegas, where there have been several positive Covid-19 cases. The league\u2019s annual meeting, a confab of all 32 team owners, was scheduled for the end of this month in West Palm Beach, Florida, but on Thursday it was canceled.</p> <p>The ever-shifting approach to the crisis dovetails with the swift spread of the virus itself. Players have experienced their own real-time evolution on the matter. Last Friday, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James scoffed at the idea of playing games behind closed doors. \u201cIf I show up to an arena and there ain\u2019t no fans in there, I ain\u2019t playing,\u201d James said defiantly. But by the following Tuesday, with the pandemic spreading, the country\u2019s most recognizable athlete shifted his position, signaling a better understanding of the severity of the situation. \u201cYou gotta listen to the people that keep track of what\u2019s going on,\u201d James said. \u201cIf they feel like it\u2019s best for the safety of the players, safety of the franchise, safety of the league to mandate that, then we\u2019ll all listen to it.\u201d</p> <p>It appears that James and his fellow athletes may be listening to the advice of those medical experts for some time to come.</p>",

  "<p>Sebastian Barry\u2019s new novel extends again the great web of story and history he has been weaving for years now out of the fictional Dunne and McNulty tribes, picking up fragments of anecdote and character from the past of his own family, developing and transforming them. Barry is a poet and playwright as well as a novelist, and he is Ireland\u2019s second laureate for fiction, following Anne Enright. His ambitious and Balzacian novel-project \u2013 which never feels programmatic, each book seeming to grow organically to become part of the whole \u2013 has assembled over time a richly significant map of the Irish diaspora, and of the ways Irish lives have intersected with global history, alongside the drama of their history unfolding at home. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/24/fiction1\" title=\"\"><em>The Secret Scripture</em></a> Roseanne McNulty approaches her 100th birthday in a Roscommon psychiatric hospital; in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/29/temporary-gentleman-review-sebastian-barry-novel\" title=\"\"><em>The Temporary Gentleman</em></a> Jack McNulty makes a life for himself in colonial and postcolonial Ghana. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/03/fiction.bookerprize2005\" title=\"\"><em>A Long Long Way</em></a>, set in the first world war, because Willie Dunne serves in the British army, he is seen as a traitor by some in Ireland; he is later caught up fighting the rebels in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/01/easter-rising-century-ireland-1916\" title=\"\">Easter Rising</a>.</p> <p>In <em>A Thousand Moons</em> we\u2019re reunited with Thomas McNulty and John Cole from his last book, the magnificent Costa-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/days-without-end-by-sebastian-barry-review\" title=\"\"><em>Days Without End</em></a>, which was set against the American Indian wars and civil war. At the end of that novel Thomas and John, soldiers and cross-dressers and a loving couple, have settled down on Lige Magan\u2019s tobacco farm outside Paris, a small town in West Tennessee. There they compose an oddly assorted family, including ex-slaves Rosalee Bouguereau and her brother Tennyson, and Thomas and John\u2019s adopted daughter, Winona, a Native American orphan whose real name, she tells us, is Ojinjintka, which means \u201crose\u201d in the Lakota language. Oddly assorted families, in which race and gender and role are all mixed up, are at the heart of Barry\u2019s ideal. Even the wicked and violent men in his novels, in fact, won\u2019t lie down neatly inside their category description.</p> <p>It is Winona who narrates <em>A Thousand Moons</em>, picking up the story when she is becoming a young woman and Thomas and John aren\u2019t good-looking boys any longer, but hardworking men beginning to turn grey \u2013 though Thomas still puts on a dress for special occasions. Winona is clever and John has taught her how to read and write; she\u2019s working for lawyer Briscoe, who is committed to reconstruction and justice for all, at a time when postwar hopes of a new south are beginning to crumble and the defeated Confederates are agitating, stirring racial violence. At the novel\u2019s opening Winona is hoping to marry Jas Jonski, a Polish boy who works at the local store and doesn\u2019t seem to mind that she\u2019s a Native American, unlike most of the Paris inhabitants. \u201cI was just the cinders of an Indian fire in the eyes of the town. Indians in bulk were long gone from Henry County. Cherokee. Chickasaw. Folks didn\u2019t like to see an ember drifting back.\u201d</p> <p>Then one night Winona is raped \u2013 although neither she nor Rosalee has a word for what\u2019s happened, and the men in their household take a long time to catch on. Winona was drinking whiskey and has no clear memory of who raped her, though she knows it may have been Jas. The rest of the novel is the complicated fallout from that violent despoiling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The politics and power struggles, male brutality and race rhetoric are\u00a0imagined with an intuitive, unsparing realism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barry prefers moral complication to the righteous simplicities of \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d, just as he\u2019s always written against the grain of certain pieties in Irish history. In <em>The Whereabouts</em> <em>of Eneas McNulty</em>, the young Eneas joins the Royal Irish Constabulary, then witnesses the murder of a fellow policeman: Irish rebels sentence him to death, and he escapes to a lifetime of wandering in exile. Willie Dunne in <em>A Long Long Way</em> is torn in anguish between his loyalist father and the passionate conviction of the rebels. Political conflict isn\u2019t seen in the abstract, but gets expressed along the fault lines in families, or inside individuals. Winona knows that Thomas and John took part in the massacre of her Lakota family, though they saved her life afterwards, and have devoted themselves ever since to her wellbeing: \u201cThey both gave me the wound and healed it, which is a hard fact in its way.\u201d When, in <em>A Thousand Moons</em>, Winona goes in disguise as a boy to the camp of Confederate renegades, and meets her enemy Aurelius Littlefair in his cabin, she fears she\u2019s entering \u201cinto the very hall of evil\u201d; but in fact his room has \u201can air of clemency and order\u201d, and Aurelius treats her with grave courtesy, explaining his aspiration, in a perfect world, to have all the children educated. The sheriff\u2019s deputy Frank Parkman is mostly bigoted and vicious, but in one episode, when he thinks Winona is a Native American boy, he brings her a bowl of stew and asks very gently if she\u2019d mind kissing him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care to, I don\u2019t mind one whit \u2026 Hey, Cochise \u2026 You not offended?\u201d Barry is interested in how innocence can persist inside an individual, mysteriously all mixed up with their violence and wrong ideas and wrongdoing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"85dffdf573eb5d9c6318b28d13284a64c0b5b6d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85dffdf573eb5d9c6318b28d13284a64c0b5b6d8/1462_428_1844_1106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Barry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sebastian Barry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yvette Monahan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If this novel isn\u2019t as persuasive as <em>Days Without End</em>, it\u2019s partly due to the eternal problem with sequels; the fresh action is overshadowed by what has come before, and there has to be quite a bit of explaining of backstory. Some characters \u2013 particularly Thomas and John \u2013 are handed down wholesale from the past, rather than made complex in new treatment, and perhaps because of that the household at Lige Magan\u2019s farm can feel a little too good to be true, a folksy dream of toleration and forbearance in the midst of a dark world. We have it all through Winona\u2019s telling, and she\u2019s passionately invested in their goodness; it may be because he\u2019s chosen a woman\u2019s voice for his narration that Barry makes it at moments a little too sweet.</p> <p><em>Late in the night the way people do we settled down like horses after a long gallop and enjoyed the blazing fire and felt pretty comfortable in our dark cabin under the stars and for that while my heart was not sore and Lige Magan turned to the medley of lullabies and laments on his fiddle and the four strings vibrated their lovely music and our hearts were full.</em><em> </em></p> <p>And when Winona falls in love with Peg from the renegade camp, Peg needs to exist with more solidity on the page, rather than just through Winona\u2019s besotted description: \u201cIf you could make honey hover in the air it would be Peg. If you could take a sliver of the wildest river and make it a person it would be Peg.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly, however, the writing brings off Barry\u2019s characteristic balancing act, between the lyrical telling that comes to him naturally and the grubby, tormenting world he wants to show us. \u201cYou just had to look like you done something wrong in America and they would hang you, if you were poor.\u201d The politics and power struggles, male brutality and race rhetoric in this novel are imagined with an intuitive, unsparing realism \u2013 and so is its material detail: \u201cgreat wheel gouges hewn into the soil\u201d, a taken-aback black bear in the woods, dirty suds from the women\u2019s washing \u201cfleeing downriver\u201d, Aurelius Littlefair with a \u201cmouth of forsaken teeth\u201d. Barry\u2019s prose always has this sturdy yet dreamy quality of a fairy story, even when he takes us into the darkest places of cruelty and violation \u2013 or perhaps especially when he takes us there. Because of something unguarded in his writing, and his idiom borrowed from ordinary speech and proverbial wisdom, we can trust him to touch the terrible stories from our collective past without betraying them, or turning them merely into clever art. His work reminds us how much we need these rare gifts of the natural storyteller, for reckoning with our past and present.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Thousand Moons by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (RRP \u00a318.99).

  "<p>For a sport proud of presenting its drama on a global stage Formula One\u2019s curtain raiser in Melbourne offered only farce. With the Australian Grand Prix cancelled because of coronavirus, events that have seemed all too predictable were portrayed as having accelerated beyond expectations. The governing bodies were left wringing their hands, protesting impotence as the wheels came off, with the next races of the new season also most likely condemned to cancellation. The global drama has been brought low by the global pandemic.</p> <p>On Friday morning at Albert Park, F1, along with the sport\u2019s governing body, the FIA, and the race organisers, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/formula-one-australian-grand-prix-melbourne-coronavirus\" title=\"\">announced the race was to be abandoned</a>. It had been almost 12 hours since McLaren had revealed one of its team members had tested positive for coronavirus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/weve-been-robbed-fans-anger-at-last-minute-formula-one-cancellation\">'We've been robbed': fans' anger at last-minute Formula One cancellation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decision-making process, involving all the governing bodies, teams and government health officials, had been long and tortuous, but not communicated externally and not announced until fans were already queuing to get into the circuit in their droves. It was merely mismanagement that had crowned what increasingly appears to have been at best an optimistic decision to bring thousands of F1 personnel from a Europe already creaking under the assault of coronavirus to a mass gathering event that attracts up to 100,000 people a day. In the light of sport across the world curtailing activity to restrict the spread of the virus, that F1 felt it could escape unscathed seems hopelessly naive.</p> <p>At Albert Park on Friday under suitably overcast, gloaming skies, the big screens dotted around the track incongruously still glared their bright, digital greetings, welcoming one and all to the Melbourne GP. Their audience desultory, dusty expanses of empty space. Their bright entreaties now hollow, baleful, monuments to the hubris that had surely fuelled this failure.</p> <p>At a hastily assembled press conference held outdoors at the track, F1\u2019s chief executive, Chase Carey, did his best to put his company\u2019s case for coming so far and in doing so taking the risks of further spreading the virus ultimately for nothing.</p> <p>\u201cIt is obviously a fluid situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation today is different than it was two days ago, which was different than it was four days ago, so trying to look out and make those sorts of predictions when it\u2019s changing this quick is challenging.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/australian-gp-under-threat-as-mclaren-pull-out-after-positive-coronavirus-test\" title=\"\">the positive test result</a> that precipitated the collapse of the house of cards. It led to McLaren withdrawing from the race and to other teams including, it is understood, Ferrari and later Mercedes, insisting they too would not take part. That someone in the paddock might be infected was surely inescapable. Shortly beforehand Lewis Hamilton, the six-times world champion whose position at the apex of the sport lends his words both freedom and weight, had dismissed the decision to come to Australia witheringly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/two-more-haas-team-members-tested-for-covid-19-on-eve-of-australian-grand-prix\" title=\"\">with the words \u201ccash is king\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Certainly F1\u2019s very existence is bound inextricably to its complex finances. Race-hosting fees are one of the three biggest sources of income for the sport, income on which every team depends for their survival. The other two streams are broadcast rights and sponsorship. Both are at risk when there is no show in town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50cd13e5bb8280835052881198ed799ed3d876a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50cd13e5bb8280835052881198ed799ed3d876a4/0_64_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Masi, FIA race director; Paul Little, chair of Australian Grand Prix Corporation; Andrew Wesatcott, AGPC CEO; and Chase Carey, F1 Group chairman speak to the media.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Masi, FIA race director; Paul Little, chair of Australian Grand Prix Corporation; Andrew Wesatcott, AGPC CEO; and Chase Carey, F1 Group chairman speak to the media.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a complexity too to the relationship of the players involved. The organisers do not want to be the ones to cancel a race, for risk they will lose their race fee. Likewise F1 does not want to be the one to do so or be held responsible for failing to deliver its product to broadcasters and sponsors, and potentially having to return the race fee. Between them the FIA apparently also tries not be held culpable for cancellation for fear any of the other parties find it responsible.</p> <p>This Gordian knot tied F1 to coming to Australia, and it was only ultimately severed as things fell apart. Not solved by Alexandrian invention but rather, as the teams departed, simple expediency.</p> <p>\u201cIf cash was king we wouldn\u2019t have made the decision we did today,\u201d said Carey, despite every indication that those involved had been muscled, kicking and screaming, into making the decision. The circumstances, he kept insisting, were impossible to predict, although coronavirus was presenting such a clear and present danger across the globe. \u201cIn many ways this is an unprecedented situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never lived through anything like this. The magnitude, the extent, the unpredictability, the fluidity of this.\u201d</p> <p>As the conference drew to a close, sporadic, weighty drops of rain began to fall as if the skies of Victoria itself were calling time with a slow handclap on an unconvincing performance.</p> <p>More fallout is to come and goodwill towards F1 will be a casualty here as well. Outside the track, fans who had not seen any action were left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/weve-been-robbed-fans-anger-at-last-minute-formula-one-cancellation\" title=\"\">disappointed and angry</a>. These are supporters F1 can ill afford to alienate and the overwhelming impression was that it would have been better to simply have taken the bold step to postpone long before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/formula-one-australian-grand-prix-melbourne-coronavirus\">Formula One\u2019s Australian Grand Prix cancelled amid coronavirus fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As things stand Melbourne may only be the first domino. McLaren have announced that 14 members of the team and the one confirmed case are now in quarantine at their hotel for 14 days. No other team members will be able to go the factory for 14 days after returning to the UK. With the Bahrain GP set to take place behind closed doors next weekend McLaren\u2019s participation looks all but impossible and, with them potentially backed by other teams, goes the strong likelihood that race will not happen.</p> <p>Carey acknowledged Bahrain was now an urgent issue. \u201cWe have to deal with it imminently,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the very short term we need to be addressing the immediately upcoming events, we expect to address that with our partners, the FIA, our partners in Bahrain.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly he had to visit Vietnam just before coming to Australia to hold talks in Hanoi as the meeting there is reportedly on the brink of bring being pulled.

Furthermore, women were more likely to be caring for children and family members during the critical evacuation time.</p> <p>Women who do survive such disasters often end up in unclean evacuation centres where they can be exposed to gender-based violence and cannot access health services. Research by the International Union for Conservation of Nature found climate change and environmental impacts are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/29/climate-breakdown-is-increasing-violence-against-women\">increasing violence against women</a> and girls including domestic abuse, child marriage and sexual assault.</p> <p>In many societies, encouraging progress is being made towards gender equality, but climate change can stop or even reverse this progress.</p> <p>If business-as-usual climate action continues, there are dangers that the gains of gender equality will be lost. There is a risk that as climate change accelerates, gender roles could become more entrenched. More men may be forced to move in search of better job opportunities, while women are left behind to care for members of their extended families and bear the burden of household responsibilities. Those who have to remain in more disaster-prone or vulnerable locations as a result are then likely to experience greater poverty, have their livelihoods destroyed and suffer increasing health issues.</p> <p>We know that any attempts to restore environmental degradation and lower the risks posed by global heating are likely to fail if they do not take into account gender inequality.</p> <p>We know, from <a href=\"https://www.wateraid.org/uk/media/short-changed-on-climate-change\">a report</a> published last week by WaterAid, that climate finance is still not reaching the poorest and most vulnerable people, who are likely to be most affected by climate change. \u2013 about half of all countries receive less than $5 (\u00a33.86) a year for each person. </p> <p>In 2016, a UN report found that only 0.01% of all worldwide funding went towards projects addressing both climate change and gender, despite specific provisions in the 2015 Paris agreement for women\u2019s empowerment. </p> <p>Such statistics are sobering, but there are some encouraging signs of progress. Developed countries have pledged $100bn a year in climate finance by 2020 to help developing nations cut emissions and adapt to problems such as worsening droughts, flooding and sea-level rise. The Green Climate Fund, the main channel through which climate finance is dispersed, stipulates that all grants must treat women\u2019s needs as a priority.</p> <p>The Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub, based in Mauritius, is already making impressive progress in unlocking much-needed resources for countries and communities that would not otherwise have the capacity to lodge successful applications for funding already pledged. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/29/climate-breakdown-is-increasing-violence-against-women\">Climate breakdown 'is increasing violence against women'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Rwanda in June, we can expect leaders to consider further innovative approaches to tackle environmental priorities, including the strategy proposed by women\u2019s affairs ministers, which focuses on gender and climate change.</p> <p>The strategy is designed to encourage countries to collect and analyse data disaggregated according to criteria such as sex and age in order to devise improved climate solutions and to target them more accurately.</p> <p>Women like Milikini need more than speeches, however sincere.

  "<p>Shortly before Brexit, a touching little farewell ceremony took place in the Berlaymont, the European commission\u2019s Brussels headquarters.</p> \n<p>On Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s last day as president of the commission, he made a final appearance in the basement press room at midday \u2013 the time the commission has been briefing the world\u2019s press every day for much of the past 60 years.</p> \n<p>Juncker gave an emotional valedictory. When he stopped speaking, an Italian journalist stood up. \u201cHistory will judge you, Mr Juncker,\u201d the journalist said solemnly, \u201cbut we will never forget you\u201d before urging a round of applause for the Luxembourger\u2019s \u201c30 years as a true European\u201d.</p> \n<p>A British reporter shook his head in mild disapproval at the tribute, muttering: \u201cYou did your job, Mr Juncker, we did ours.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a98b795-e636-4e75-b443-22e9e6429f26\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/this-is-europe\">This is Europe</a> is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all.

But for much of the UK\u2019s 50 years of membership, British coverage of the EU seemed so confrontational as to lose all sense of perspective.</p> \n<p>Deliberations in Brussels were written up as national victories or defeats \u2013 an art form pioneered in the early 1990s by a young reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/10-best-euro-myths-from-custard-creams-to-condoms\">by the name of Boris Johnson</a>). The idea of compromise and collaboration simply didn\u2019t enter into the adversarial narrative.</p> \n<p>The question now is, with the UK relegated to the sidelines, will the Eurosceptic British press just disengage or gloat at every setback? Post-Brexit, collective decisions taken by the EU27 will continue to have a profound impact across the European economic space. Britain will be affected. Will its press be watching?</p> \n<p>Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, says a narrowly focused UK media could find its access to the corridors of power in Brussels receding in time.</p> \n<p>\u201cMuch of what is leaked and briefed in Brussels is done to influence the internal debates among member states on key policy decisions \u2013 and to influence the views of the domestic electorates,\u201d Boffey said. \u201cBut the British government is no longer a decision-maker in Brussels.\u201d<br><br>Boffey believes that the Guardian\u2019s huge readership, broad European appeal and stated commitment to cover pan-European affairs in all their complexity will guarantee its relevance. <br><br>\u201cIn the run-up to Brexit, people often asked me whether I would be staying in Brussels,\u201d his Brussels-based colleague Jennifer Rankin said. \u201cIt was an easy answer. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere because (I think) the UK will be in semi-permanent negotiations with the EU over something. But also because we are here to cover the EU in all its rich complexity. I\u2019m delighted that the answer is even easier today.\u201d<br><br>Just figuring out what is going on in Brussels can be the initial challenge for the newly arrived EU correspondent. Not necessarily because it is the remote, elite place of legend, but because it is a complex, hybrid decision-making system that lacks any parallel in national politics.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnpalmer\">John Palmer </a>was dispatched to Brussels for the Guardian in 1974, the year after Britain acceded to full membership. Those early years were \u201cprimitive\u201d for journalists, Palmer recalls. Reporters were left to stand in muddy fields to wait for ministers to emerge from whichever German <em>schloss</em> their meeting was taking place in.</p> \n<p>Palmer had a ringside seat for all the huge political realignments that followed the end of communism in 1989 and the EU\u2019s expansion eastward.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/29/from-entry-to-exit-what-did-eu-membership-mean-for-britain-podcast\">The end of the affair: how Britain walked away from the EU - podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He also chronicled the extraordinary political switch in the Conservative view of Europe \u2013 from enthusiastic backing to open hostility.</p> \n<p>The high watermark of the European project coincided with the tenure of the charismatic Jacques Delors in the 1990s. \u201cDelors came to symbolise the push towards European integration,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cYet it was clear from early on that decisions would have repercussions on national politics. The UK drove hard for the single market. But then it began to assume a dynamic of its own \u2013 you could see it would eventually lead to a single currency.\u201d</p> \n<p>British diplomats also became \u201caghast\u201d, Palmer recalls, to see that Bavarians, Catalans and other autonomous regions had their own \u201cgovernments\u201d represented in the EU\u2019s committee of the regions. \u201cThey began to see where all this might lead,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\" data-alt=\"faf\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\">faf</a> \n</figure> \n<p>By then global media interest had ballooned and the EU could boast a press corps to rival Capitol Hill. \u201cAll three Mexican TV channels had a correspondent accredited,\u201d Palmer remembers.</p> \n<p>Stephen Bates was Brussels correspondent for the Guardian for four years in the 1990s and remembers a panic-inducing bewilderment at the acronyms, arcane structures, committees, the system of <em>porte-paroles </em>[spokespersons], all rooted deep in French administrative culture.</p> \n<p>A former Westminster reporter, Bates grew to love the role because \u201cfor all its faults the EU had a forward looking and expanding view, it was a positive project for Europeans and it was about collaboration\u201d.</p> \n<p>He blames British political journalism for much of the incomprehension. \u201cUK journalism is predicated along Westminster lines: a majority government is in power, and it does things. But the EU works in labyrinthine circles, decision making is slow and often very technical, as well as being essentially about collaboration and compromise.\u201d</p> \n<p>The paradox was that the EU was attacked for ruling people\u2019s lives, when the opposite was true. \u201cIn a way, the problem is that it is so diffuse it\u2019s very difficult to get a decision through,\u201d Bates says. Often it\u2019s a miracle that 27 countries can agree about anything.</p> \n<p>Bates recalls a story about how UK chocolate was going to have to be relabelled \u201cvegelate\u201d, because it contained so little cocoa compared with Belgian or French varieties.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wrote that story at least four times,\u201d says Bates \u201cand it was always illustrated with the same picture of a bar of Dairy Milk. But we never seemed to get it resolved because it kept being referred back.\u201d</p> \n<p>That is a feeling familiar to Rankin. \u201cThe EU often feels like one endless process: meetings that result in decisions to convene a meeting at a higher level. One broadcast colleague complained there were never any pictures in Brussels: just endless shots of middle-aged men shaking hands in rooms.\u201d </p> \n<p>A regular complaint from those hostile to the EU is that it is undemocratic, with decisions cooked up behind closed doors. Palmer blames the democratic deficit on a decision by national governments deliberately to keep the directly elected European parliament weak. But no Brussels correspondent ever complains about a lack of information.</p> \n<p>\u201cFinding out what had been decided was never a problem,\u201d Palmer insists. \u201cWhat was more difficult was to establish what would happen next or what lay behind any decision. What you never did was rely solely on your own government to tell you. You went to talk to the Finns, the Irish, whoever.\u201d</p> \n<p>The skill, adds Rankin, is in knowing what not to bother about. \u201cBrussels has always been abundant in information, the trick is finding the useful nuggets from endless press releases, announcements and invitations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rankin is on her second spell in Brussels \u2013 and notices a big difference from her first stint in 2006.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn my first stint, the UK was part of the EU machine,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBritish ministers spoke on the record to British and international media after EU councils. </p> \n<p>\u201cBy the time I returned (in 2015) the UK was detached. Barely touched by the eurozone or migration crisis of 2015, the UK also didn\u2019t play such a big role in the EU law-making councils. Those on-the-record ministerial meetings with journalists had disappeared.\u201d<br><br>The expectation is that this detachment will only grow, with less and less about the EU and European affairs in the pages of British newspapers. </p> \n<p><em>Katherine Butler was a Europe correspondent in the 1990s.</em></p>",

Thereafter, an impartial investigation should follow.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Police safe hid paedophile images \u2013 </strong>A hard drive containing indecent images of children was not used as evidence against a former lord mayor of Leeds and was instead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/12/hard-drive-containing-child-abuse-images-held-pcc-safe-leeds-yorkshire\">kept in a police commissioner\u2019s safe for 14 years</a>.

Taggart, who died in December, had also been chairman of the West Yorkshire police authority. Mark Burns-Williamson, the current West Yorkshire police commissioner, told the BBC of the hard drive: \u201cSome images have been found on there, much later on, of course, and I can only assume he [Taggart] knew full well that was the case, and that\u2019s why he asked for it to be stored.

Nor did it cap the total subsidy.</p> <p>Word spread that boilers meant profits, and the more boilers and the more you burned, the richer you became. The result was a scramble to install boilers and run them 24/7. Farmers, went the joke, were using oven gloves to open sheds.</p> <p>A whistleblower reported abuses to Stormont officials in 2013 and 2014, to no avail. The scheme continued and was extended until the belated realisation that the UK treasury would not foot the bill.</p> <p>The debacle prompted Sinn F\u00e9in to pull the plug on its power-sharing administration with the DUP, creating a damaging three-year political vacuum that ended in January when political parties agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/13/from-bitter-stalemate-to-smiles-at-stormont-how-the-deal-was-done\">restore the assembly and executive</a>.</p> <p>Drastic revisions to the scheme\u2019s terms have turned an envisaged overspend of hundreds of millions of pounds into an underspend.</p> <p>The pendulum may have swung too far back. Many RHI claimants say they signed up in good faith and borrowed money to install boilers, assuming the scheme was properly managed and would benefit them and the environment, only to find themselves branded unethical and greedy \u2013 and then financially marooned when tariffs were slashed.</p> <p>A farmer in county Down who spoke on condition of anonymity said he borrowed \u00a375,000 on the basis his boiler would generate about \u00a36,500 per year, but that had dwindled to \u00a32,000. \u201cMore than likely we will have to sell some of our other assets to try and pay off that RHI loan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been scapegoats in all this.\u201d</p> <p>A county Antrim farmer said he was receiving just 10% of the original tariff, a fraction of what farmers in the rest of the UK received, miring him in debt. \u201cI\u2019m stressed financially, emotionally, psychologically.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Australia to stop mass gatherings from next week</h2> <p>Prime minister Scott Morrison has said the Australian government will adopt medical advice to cancel organised mass gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday onwards. The order doesn\u2019t include schools, universities, or public transport. The government also stepped up travel advice to say Australians should reconsider non-essential overseas travel.</p> <h2>Markets dive</h2> <p>Asian markets opened in freefall. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 10%, and Australia fell 8% before surging back up to a 4.4% gain for the day. New Zealand\u2019s benchmark NZX50 was down 7.9%, and trading was briefly halted on South Korea\u2019s stock exchange when the benchmark KOSPI index fell 6.8%.</p> <h2>Mass graves in Iran prompt fears over extent of virus coverup</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-iran-mass-graves-qom\">Satellite images of mass graves in the city of Qom</a>, first published by the New York Times, have suggested Iran\u2019s coronavirus epidemic is even more serious than the authorities are admitting.</p> <h2>Trudeau\u2019s wife diagnosed with Covid-19</h2> <p>Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sophie-gregoire-trudeau\">Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau</a>, tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a visit to the UK with flu-like symptoms, and the Canadian prime minister is now self-isolating.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBeing in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.\u201d</p> <h2>Australia\u2019s home affairs minister tests positive</h2> <p>Peter Dutton has announced that he has tested positive for Covid-19 after waking up with a sore throat and a fever and getting tested. He says \u201cI feel fine\u201d.</p> <h2>Australian Grand Prix cancelled</h2> <p>In Melbourne fans arrived at the gate of the Australian Grand Prix to learn that the event had been cancelled. The decision followed days of concern over the risk that the large gathering would pose, including from racing team participants themselves.</p> <h2>United Nations, Ghana, Gabon report first cases</h2> <p>A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus, according to a note sent to UN missions, making the woman the first known case at the world body\u2019s New York headquarters.</p> <p>Gabon and Ghana became the ninth and tenth countries in sub-Saharan Africa to register positive cases.</p> <h2>Catholic churches closed in Rome</h2> <p>In Italy, where the outbreak has taken a devastating toll, all Catholic churches in Rome closed under orders from the Vatican.</p> <p>The papal vicar for Rome said the churches would reopen when a broader Italian government crackdown on public gatherings expires on 3 April. \u201cThe faithful are consequently exempt from their obligation to fulfil the festive precept,\u201d a statement from Cardinal Angelo De Donatis said.</p> <h2>Hopes raised that South Korea\u2019s outbreak is slowing</h2> <p>South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since the country\u2019s first patient was confirmed on 20 January, raising hopes that Asia\u2019s biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing.</p> <h2>Lockdown in the Philippines</h2> <p>Metro Manila, home to 12 million people, is preparing for a lockdown that will be imposed from Sunday. All schools will be closed, mass gatherings suspended, and many public sector workers told to stay home, following a spike in cases in the Philippines.</p> <p>President Rodrigo Duterte has also imposed a 30 day ban on domestic land and sea travels to and from Manila, which will begin on 15 March.</p> <h2>Death toll in Italy passes 1,000</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-live-updates-who-declares-pandemic-as-italy-introduces-stricter-measures?page=with:block-5e6a6ff58f085f0b8d9475e0#block-5e6a6ff58f085f0b8d9475e0\">death toll</a> in Italy rose by 189 to 1,016, an increase of 23%, in the last 24 hours, the civil protection agency said on Thursday. The total number of confirmed cases in Italy, the European country hardest hit by the virus, rose to 15,113 from 12,462, an increase of 21.7%.</p> <h2>Boris Johnson says coronavirus is worst public health crisis for a generation</h2> <p>Speaking at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">press conference</a> after an emergency Cobra meeting, the British prime minister said: \u201cWe have all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation. Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Malaysia\u2019s government plunged into chaos last month, some believed the country\u2019s veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad was likely to emerge an even more powerful political force. Instead, it was Muhyiddin Yassin, a much quieter figure, who was eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/malaysian-pm-sworn-in-amid-questions-over-legitimacy\">appointed prime minister</a>.</p> <p>Muhyiddin, a conservative Malay nationalist, is a low-profile and cautious politician, say analysts.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at his political history, every time there has been a political crisis he is the last one to show his hand,\u201d says James Chin, professor of Asian studies at Tasmania University. \u201cHe sits between all the warring groups, lets them fight it out, then he will come in at the last minute.\u201d</p> <p>As the ruling alliance became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/malaysias-political-turmoil-everything-you-need-to-know\">consumed by a power struggle</a> between supporters of Mahathir and his successor-in-waiting, Anwar Ibrahim, Muhyiddin managed to outmanoeuvre both.</p> <p>His swearing in as prime minister on 1 March followed a long political career, the majority of which has been spent with Umno, a party that has been in power in Malaysia for six decades and has since been entangled in corruption scandals.</p> <p>He joined Umno in 1971, in Johor, a Malay heartland, where he was later appointed as chief minister. Muhyiddin also served in several positions in central government, including as deputy prime minister under Najib Razak, but was fired in 2015 after questioning Najib\u2019s handling of allegations surrounding the 1MDB affair, one of the world\u2019s biggest financial scandals.</p> <p>After his dismissal, Muhyiddin went on to join the Bersatu party, which was set up by Mahathir to oust Najib\u2019s scandal-hit government from power. In 2018 it achieved a historic election victory when voters opted for a multiracial reformist alliance that promised an end to corruption.</p> <p>But, following the collapse of the alliance only two years later, Muhyiddin has partnered again with Umno, returning to power the same party that he helped to remove from office. With Muhyiddin reliant on support from the former regime, there are doubts as to whether those implicated in corruption scandals will be held to account.</p> <p>There are also concerns over what Muhyiddin\u2019s government will mean for minorities. His appointment follows growing dissatisfaction among many in the Malay majority, who accuse the previous ruling alliance of giving too much support to minority interests.</p> <p>About 60% of Malaysia\u2019s population are ethnic Malay Muslims, while the country also has large ethnic Chinese and Indian communities. Muhyiddin, who once described himself \u201ca Malay first\u201d, has included very little representation from minority groups in the key government positions that were announced this week.</p> <p>Azmil Tayeb, a political scientist, fears that if economic or political troubles get worse, Muhyiddin may be tempted to \u201cexploit ethno-nationalist tensions to divert attention from the real problems\u201d.</p> <p>It appears likely that Muhyiddin, whose bloated cabinet features far more posts for supporters than that of the previous alliance, will survive a looming no-confidence vote. But analysts point out that he was ushered into power through a flurry of backroom deals and does not have a public mandate.</p> <p>He will face high levels of scrutiny, said Bridget Welsh, an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham Malaysia\u2019s Asia Research Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s a different era in Malaysia and there is a lot more caution and care over corruption.\u201d </p> <p>Muhyiddin has tried to define his leadership as being anti-corruption, but some of the individuals in his cabinet were tainted with allegations, although the cases are not ongoing.</p> <p>He has become prime minister at a difficult time for the country, Welsh adds. \u201cYou have the coronavirus, an underperforming economy with very limited economic reform, the significant drop in the oil price and very limited revenue options in terms of the high level of debt that the government inherited from the 1MDB scandal among others,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Muhyiddin will not only need to prove his own legitimacy as a leader, but also address Malaysia\u2019s deep economic and political problems, she added. <strong>\u201c</strong>He faces a much more challenging political and economic environment than perhaps I would argue any previous prime minister has ever faced in Malaysia.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia and non-essential travel overseas should be cancelled to halt the spread of coronavirus, federal and state governments have agreed.</p> \n<p>On Friday the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, and state and territory chief medical officers unanimously agreed that mass gatherings should be cancelled, a recommendation which was then adopted by the Council of Australian Governments (Coag) meeting in Parramatta.</p> \n<p>Scott Morrison told reporters that \u201cby Monday we will be advising against organised, non-essential gatherings of persons of 500 people or greater\u201d as a \u201ccommonsense precaution to ensure we can manage the transmission of this virus in the most effective way

\u201cOnly essential travel should be considered if you are going overseas from this point forward.\u201d</p> \n<p>The call came on a day when the Australian market tumbled as much as 8% in early trade but rallied strongly during the afternoon, surging as Morrison warned against mass gatherings to finish up 4.4% for the day.</p> \n<p>Earlier, the Reserve Bank made a dramatic intervention in the markets in a bid to stop a credit crunch, pumping $8.8bn in short-term funding into the banks.</p> \n<p>It did this by agreeing to buy assets such as portfolios of loans from the banks for cash, and then sell them back the same assets later on.</p> \n<p>While the late rally erased losses experienced on Thursday, when the market dived 7.4%, the damage inflicted since coronavirus selling began on 20 February still means all gains since the start of last year have been wiped out.</p> \n<p>Although Australia has \u201clow rates\u201d of infection, the prime minister said the government had escalated its response due to \u201cgrowing evidence \u2026 [of] greater community transmission of the coronavirus throughout Australia\u201d.</p> \n<p>Murphy confirmed the decision was \u201cexactly as decided\u201d by the Australian Health Protection Principles Committee, composed of himself and the state and territory chief medical officers.</p> \n<p>Murphy said the advice applied to a \u201cstatic gathering where people are together for a period of perhaps up to two hours\u201d, rather than aiming to prevent \u201ccasual exposure\u201d of people transiting through spaces such as airports, which are of \u201clower risk\u201d.</p> \n<p>Morrison suggested that gatherings such as church services could be reconfigured by holding \u201cmultiple services at different periods\u201d to comply with the guidance.</p> \n<p>The Coag meeting agreed to convene a \u201cnational cabinet\u201d consisting of state and territory ministers to meet weekly to manage the coronavirus and receive advice from the federal, state and territory chief medical officers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are many measures that can be taken and the commonwealth government, together with the states, have already been taking to both contain and slow the transmission of the virus in Australia,\u201d Morrison said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is incredibly important because as we slow it, as we manage it, that ensures that \u2026 the health system run by states and territories will be able to accommodate the increasing demands we\u2019d expect to see as a result of the coronavirus spread throughout Australia\u201d.</p> \n<p>The escalation of Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus follows a wave of cancellations of major events, <a

Whatever people\u2019s view at the time in 2013, today we must all accept that locking people up for seven years is simply shocking, it\u2019s staggering to most Australians that it could possibly happen.</p> <p>\u201cWe just want to see an end to the suffering of over 450 people offshore.\u201d</p> <p>Albion Park City FC executive director, Thomas Arculi, said sport could be larger than just the contest on the field, and \u201cit has the power to make the world a better place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur club believes in human rights, we have made a pledge to provide an environment of equal rights for all and this means standing up for those without a voice. Football, as the multicultural game, stands for equality among all people and no one deserves to spend seven years of their lives being deprived of freedom, and certainly not those fleeing persecution.\u201d</p> <p>Football was a critical outlet and social support for the refugee communities on both Nauru and Manus Island. Informal games were held almost daily on both islands, and organised internal football competitions contested regularly.</p> <p>In the weeks before he died on Nauru, Fariborz Karami proudly represented the refugees of Iran, defeating the Nauruan team. Behrouz Boochani, best known as the author of No Friend But the Mountains, was a keen striker and regular goalscorer in games on Manus.</p> <p>More than 450 refugees and asylum seekers remain stranded in Port Moresby \u2013 following the forcible closure of the Manus Island detention centre \u2013 and on Nauru.</p> <p>About 40 refugees are in line to be resettled in the US, but there is no agreement for the resettlement of others. New Zealand has a standing offer to take 150 refugees from Australia\u2019s offshore system every year, but this has been resolutely refused by the Australian government.</p> <p>Foster said many of those held offshore were lovers of football.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I know they\u2019ll be touched by seeing others take the field to signify the shared humanity and community between us, and to highlight what they\u2019ve been unable to do for the best years of their lives,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He praised Albion Park\u2019s \u201ctremendous gesture, which gives us inspiration to believe that sport can stand for much more than just 90 minutes\u201d.</p>",

It was a universal and fundamentally human pain. It was the visceral pain of knowing that innocent people had been murdered. It was the outrage at the media outlets that <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/zealand-tabloids-condemned-humanising-mosque-attacker-190316081740694.html\">humanised</a> the terrorist by referring to him as an \u201cangelic boy\u201d and an \u201cordinary white man\u201d.</p> <p>At the start of this month, I felt a sense of anxiety. I thought it was just me. In preparing to write this piece, I started reaching out to my Muslim friends to check in with them and ask how they were feeling with the one year anniversary of the tragedy fast approaching. The responses have been similar in many ways \u2013 united by a common thread of sadness, fear, frustration, and a deep sense that pain is still felt.</p> <p>Mohamed Hassan, a poet and journalist from Cairo, Egypt has just launched a new podcast entitled The Guest House which explores the five stages of grief specifically in relation to the events of 15 March 2019. In the fourth episode, Hassan explores the connection between negative media rhetoric about Muslims and Islam, and the corresponding backlash that Muslims experience. Similarly in Australia, a University of Sydney <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2019/04/01/vast-majority-of-nsw-hate-crimes-race-and-religion-related--stud.html\">study</a> found that Muslims were the most common victim religion of hate crimes, followed by Jewish people (73% and 14% respectively). An Asio analytical report prepared after the Christchurch massacre has revealed concerns that far right groups may carry out a terrorist attack in Australia in the next decade, drawing on the Christchurch terrorist attacks as \u201cinspiration\u201d.</p> <p>What has followed is vicarious trauma. What this concept has meant for us, as individual Muslims, and for our Muslim identities after the Christchurch massacre varies from individual to individual. For some Muslims it meant de-veiling. It meant standing with our backs to the wall on the train platform. It meant not setting foot in a mosque. It meant feeling a certain anxiety in public spaces \u2013 and for some it still does. However, it has also presented opportunities for us to lean on our communities for support, to express ourselves through art and poetry and to be unapologetically Muslim.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/new-zealand-gun-reform-stalled-as-christchurch-anniversary-approaches\">New Zealand gun reform stalled as Christchurch anniversary approaches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We hold the Bankstown Poetry Slam on the last Tuesday of every month. Our event at the end of March 2019 was a space for community healing, support and love. The energy in the room was different. It was nervous, tense and sad.

Iman Etri asked rhetorically: \u201cDon\u2019t you know? <em>He </em>preyed on them in prayer but we make mosques of everywhere we go.\u201d In many ways, spaces like this provide a platform for us to illuminate our struggles, our fears, our love, and our pain.</p> <p>For many of my Muslim friends, life has not changed. The stereotypes continue to be perpetuated. The fear of being attacked is palpable. The stares linger. In many ways, life has not changed because the world has not changed. However, hope exists. Hope is the opioid of the oppressed. As long as there is hope, the light of a future world that we can dream into existence looms on the horizon.</p> <p>Our Prophet Muhammad\u2019s cousin, Imam Ali (peace be upon them both) is known for two quotes which I try to embody and live by.</p> <p>The first is to \u201cbe like the flower that gives fragrance, even to the hand that crushes it\u201d.</p> <p>The second is that \u201cevery person is either your brother in faith or your equal in humanity\u201d.</p> <p>If we all truly saw each other as equals, we can start to rebuild \u2026 with open mosque doors and open arms.

They seemed heavy-handed at first, but now I believe they are wise decisions,\u201d said Andy Chen, general manager of Taiwan Comfort Champ, a mask manufacturer that has been ordered to ramp up production.</p> <p>Despite the sense of calm, Taiwanese officials are still on high alert. The health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said last week community transmission was unavoidable in the long run and Taiwan needed to be prepared.</p> <p>Chan, from National Taiwan University, agrees more needs to be done, including more widespread and efficient testing for Covid-19. South Korea, a country of 51.8 million, conducts around 15,000 tests a day and has drive-through test centres. Taiwan, with a population of almost 24 million, currently conducts only around 800 screenings a day and not everyone under quarantine is tested.</p> <p>There will be more and more confirmed cases as the US and other countries conduct more tests, Chan added.</p> <p>For Bryant, who is temporarily in the country while en route to Canada, he is happy to wait out his quarantine. He is fine with authorities tracking his movement for now, but he expresses slight concern about the \u201cbig brother\u201d implication. Taiwanese officials say it is legal, assuring that they are tracking individuals only during the period of mandatory quarantine.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not using any advanced surveillance technology. It\u2019s simply tracking based on their phone\u2019s sim cards and their nearby base stations,\u201d said cabinet spokeswoman Kolas.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to protect the person as well as others in Taiwan,\u201d she said. \u201cTo prevent more infections and fatalities, it\u2019s a measure we have to take.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>One of the most popular topics on the Chinese microblog Weibo on Thursday was a one-minute clip of a US congressional hearing this week on how the country was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">dealing with the coronavirus</a>.</p> \n<p>In the video posted by the People\u2019s Daily, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is asked whether there may have been deaths attributed to influenza that could actually have been the result of Covid-19. Redfield responds in the affirmative: \u201cSome cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Redfield\u2019s vague answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China \u2013 that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/interactive-coronavirus-tracker\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!\u201d one commentator said. \u201cThe US owes the world, especially China, an apology,\u201d another said. \u201cAmerican coronavirus,\u201d one wrote.</p> \n<p>The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on 27 February that although the virus first appeared in China \u201cit may not have originated in China\u201d.</p> \n<p>Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not \u201cequate to it being the source\u201d. He told reporters: \u201cBut neither can we conclude that the virus came from abroad. Only through investigation and tracing can we answer that question.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet only Zhong\u2019s first comment has stuck, repeated by Chinese diplomats, state media and officials who have subtly encouraged the idea.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesman suggested without evidence the US military might have brought the virus to the Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. Zhao Lijian accused the US of lacking transparency, saying on Twitter: \u201cWhen did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\u201d</p> \n<p>China\u2019s ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily \u201cmade in China\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AmbLINSongtian/status/1236322524281044993\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Although the epidemic first broke out in China, it did not necessarily mean that the virus is originated from China, let alone \"made in China\". <a href=\"https://t.co/EVXLkQnyfF\">pic.twitter.com/EVXLkQnyfF</a></p>\u2014 Chinese Ambassador to South Africa (@AmbLINSongtian) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbLINSongtian/status/1236322524281044993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>An editorial in Xinhua last week also echoed Zhong: \u201cThe epidemic was first reported in China but that does not mean it necessarily originated in China \u2026 The WHO has said many times that Covid-19 is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">global phenomenon</a> with its source still undetermined.\u201d</p> \n<p>Officials have framed the campaign as a protest against the \u201cpoliticisation\u201d of the outbreak by countries such as the US, where some officials have continued to use the terms \u201cChinese coronavirus\u201d or \u201cWuhan virus,\u201d despite the World Health Organization\u2019s discouragement. But analysts say China may be looking to deflect blame as the coronavirus spreads around the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe might be heading into first global recession caused by Chinese Communist party mismanagement,\u201d wrote Bill Bishop, author of the China newsletter Sinocism. \u201cPrevious manmade disasters in China since 1949 never really spread outside the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s borders in meaningful ways.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThis time looks to be different \u2026 And that is likely one of the reasons the propaganda apparatus and PRC officials are pushing so hard the idea that virus may not have originated in China,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>For weeks, Chinese state media pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan as the likely origin for the virus while researchers said the source had not yet been determined, but few have floated the idea that it came from outside of China. Another respected Chinese researcher, Zhang Wenhong, said in an interview with the China Daily that he did not believe the virus had been imported into China.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf that was the case, we should have seen patients emerging from different regions in the country around the same time rather than their concentration in Wuhan,\u201d he said, in comments that later appeared to have been removed from the interview.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the consensus is still clearly that the virus did originate in China,\u201d said Jane Duckett, professor at the Scottish Centre for China Research, University of Glasgow, focusing on Chinese policy and health.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis would appear to be a nationalist narrative aimed at countering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\">criticism of the Chinese government for not better managing the outbreak</a> in its early stages,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Shifting the narrative may also be important as China tries to move forward, now that new infections appear to have levelled off. This week, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/xi-jinping-visits-wuhan-for-first-time-since-coronavirus-outbreak-began\">visited Wuhan for the first time</a> since the outbreak began as state media pronounced \u201cvictory is near\u201d. State media showed elaborate celebrations marking the closure of the last of the temporary hospitals in Wuhan.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a propaganda effort aimed at the domestic audience. Among the Chinese public, there is a general awareness that delays in notifying the public led to many more infections in Wuhan,\u201d said Victor Shih, a politics professor at the University of California, San Diego.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThis campaign is aimed at distracting the public from the party\u2019s delayed response.\u201d</p>",

Brief shutdowns have occurred due to hurricanes or the September 11 attacks. Earlier this year, Disney shuttered its parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo to protect against coronavirus spread.</p> <p>The company estimated in February that the shutdowns of Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland alone would cost $175m if both remained closed for two months. </p>",

What they got was a sense of urgency which we have not heard up until now. In short, the meeting\u2019s participants concluded that Germany is now in crisis mode, with a plan to be unrolled with immediate effect to restructure the country\u2019s hospitals in order to boost the number of intensive care beds (currently there are 28,000 of them, 25,000 of which are equipped with respiratory apparatus). All non-urgent operations are to be postponed. The state will offer financial help to the health insurance companies to ensure this happens, Merkel said. </p> \n  <p>She appealed to Germans to restrict social contact as much as possible. She also advised on the cancellation of all gatherings which are not strictly necessary. She said the next \u201c4, 5 weeks\u201d would be \u201cvery very crucial in determining the question as to what happens next\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Markus S\u00f6der, premier of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, admitted that the situation was \u201cfar more dramatic than we had thought even one or two weeks ago\u201d. He said that the government\u2019s quick introduction of so-called \u2018Kurzarbeit\u2019 - or work reduction policies introduced at the height of the banking crisis, which ensure workers receive their wages, and see employers compensated by the state \u201csend an important signal to German businesses\u201d. He coined a phrase used by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank at the height of the Euro crisis, \u201cwe will do whatever it takes\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although many Germans had hoped or expected they might do, the leaders did not decide on:</p> \n  <p>- a universal policy on closing schools, kindergartens and universities, although S\u00f6der did announce this evening that Bavaria (which currently has 500 people with coronavirus, and one death) will do so from tomorrow, becoming the first state to do so.</p> \n  <p>- Neither did it decide on the closure of German borders (though it will control them including checking temperatures).</p> \n  <p>- Neither did it decide to stop flights to and from Italy.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6aa40f8f087df56e4c79d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/deniscampbell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:10:08.850Z\">9.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Should schools in Britain shut? Interestingly, although other countries such as Italy and Ireland are doing that, there appears to be no groundswell of medical or scientific opinion in the UK that it should follow suit. </p> \n  <p>There are slightly mixed opinions among experts surveyed by the Science Media Centre (<a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/\">https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/</a>), but no one urging immediate closures like those seen elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNot closing schools seems understandable to me\u201d, said Dr Jennifer Rohn, a cell biologist at University College London. \u201cChildren will be the least likely to be affected and therefore the least likely to be shedding virus, which is directly proportional to more serious symptoms. In contrast, if you close schools you\u2019re keeping a very large number of parents away from work. As long as it is deemed feasible to keep workplaces open, it\u2019s probably better not to harm the economy further in this way.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, is more sceptical. \u201cI would like to see a bit more about why they\u2019re not closing schools and banning large events. We do know, in general, that school holidays lead to a marked reduction of transmission in infections and at the end of school holidays, infection rates take off. Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they\u2019re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He would like to know more about how ministers and government advisers reached their decision. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s based on good quality science. But we don\u2019t know what that science is. The science isn\u2019t being shared with us in a way that makes it easy for us to understand the logical basis for all of this. I would hope that more of the information and science that the government is relying on to make these decisions would be made available so we could interrogate it and see if it\u2019s valid.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Dr Charlotte Jackson, from the UCL Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, points out that school closures have proven effective against outbreaks in the past. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are examples from the UK and elsewhere of school closures reducing transmission of influenza. During the 2009 flu pandemic, the UK saw a reduction in cases following the closure of schools for the summer holiday, and an increase when schools reopened in the autumn. There are also studies from various other settings, including France, Hong Kong and Mexico, suggesting reductions in transmission of seasonal or pandemic influenza associated with school closures. Social distancing measures in general did seem to slow down transmission in US cities during the 1918 flu pandemic\u201d, she says. </p> \n  <p>However, that does not mean that they would help delay the spread of the Coronavirus, she adds. \u201cWith the current coronavirus outbreak, countries have generally used lots of control measures at the same time (this also happened during the 1918 flu pandemic) so it\u2019s difficult to separate any effects of school closures from other interventions. I wouldn\u2019t like to comment definitively on whether closures would be effective for this particular virus.\u201d </p> \n  <p>What about Boris Johnson\u2019s new policy of advising schools against overseas trips? Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at UCL, says: \u201cBanning overseas school trips is a difficult one, but remember that any trips involve groups of people going to airports, going on boats and coaches and living together, and since this virus is ubiquitous now, anything like that is likely to increase acquisition of the virus. We know that children are less likely to get severe disease from coronavirus, but they nevertheless are likely, if they do get infection, to spread to others. It\u2019s a sensible measure before closing the schools\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>(With thanks to the Science Media Centre). <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6aa0868f08c2df6d27896b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T20:59:37.721Z\">8.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A further update from Spain: The government has announced that another member of the cabinet has tested positive for coronavirus.

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!
