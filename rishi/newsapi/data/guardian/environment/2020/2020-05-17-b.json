Talon, a former business magnate who came to power in 2016, has been accused of a crackdown that drove key rivals into exile.</p> <p>Parties allied to the president won all the seats at the polls last year after opposition groups were effectively banned from standing, but turnout was only 25%.

But Benin disregarded the ruling and severed some ties with the court in protest at the decision.</p> <p>Opponents called on voters to boycott the poll over the political situation and the risks from coronavirus. Many among the electorate appeared set to heed the call to stay home given the result looks certain to go in favour of those backing Talon.

and faces, <strong>Quebec</strong> is now debating whether to force everybody to put masks on.</p> <p>As the province <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-montreal-canada-hit-hard\">at the centre of Canada\u2019s coronavirus outbreak</a>, Quebec is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks \u2013 but the measure will not be mandatory.</p> <p>Asked why not, <strong>Horacio Arruda</strong>, the province\u2019s public health director, told reporters: \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d</p> <p>But such arguments ring hollow to <strong>Nour Farhat</strong>, a Montreal lawyer whose dreams of being a Crown prosecutor were dashed after the Quebec government passed legislation last year barring certain public sector workers from wearing religious symbols at work.</p> <p>The law \u2013 known as <strong>Bill 21</strong> \u2013 mainly affects Muslim women working in education, law and other public sectors. Farhat said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Bill 21 violates the rights of religious minorities without a real or urgent situation. And now that we\u2019re in a real and urgent situation, the premier cares about violating people\u2019s rights.</p> <p>For them, it was always OK to violate the rights of religious minorities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bill 21 has always permitted masks for medical reasons, and government media representatives say their hesitancy on masks is not related to that law.</p> <p>But head and face coverings carry a certain political weight in Quebec. Recent years have seen multiple instances of people trying to snatch hijabs from women\u2019s heads in the province. </p> <p>And only last year did Montreal <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-will-be-allowed-to-protest-wearing-masks-as-bylaw-to-be-scrapped/\">reverse a seven-year ban on people wearing masks at protests</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/quebec-masks-mandatory-veil-ban-coronavirus\">Quebec ponders making masks mandatory after banning the veil</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ec12b5f8f0864e579f12827\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-17T12:22:35.029Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia\u2019s virus spread stabilising, health official says</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The growth of new coronavirus cases in <strong>Russia</strong> is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week.<br></p> <p>The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> <p>On Sunday, it announced new cases had dropped below 10,000 for the third day this week at 9,709. </p> <p>The head of Russia\u2019s public health watchdog, <strong>Anna Popova</strong>, said in an interview on Rossiya-1 television: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve moved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for.</p> <p>I would say that of today, we have halted the growth [in the number of cases].</p> <p>For the last 10 or 11 days now, we haven\u2019t seen additional growth or it\u2019s been very small.</p> <p>Stabilisation can be seen over the whole country.

The leaders of <strong>Italy</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>, together with the European commission and council, called earlier this month for any innovative tools, therapeutics or vaccines to be shared equally and fairly.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,\u201d they said in a statement.</p> <p>The sole resolution before the assembly this year is an EU proposal for a <strong>voluntary patent pool</strong>. Drug and vaccine companies would then be under pressure to give up the monopoly that patents allow them on their inventions, which means they can charge high prices, so that all countries can make or buy affordable versions.</p> <p>In the weeks of negotiations leading up to the meeting, which is scheduled to last for less than a day, there has been a dispute over the language of the resolution. </p> <p>Countries with major pharmaceutical companies argue they need patents to guarantee sufficiently high prices in wealthy nations to recoup their research and development costs.</p> <p>Even more fraught have been attempts to reinforce countries\u2019 existing rights to break drug and vaccine company patent monopolies if they need to for the sake of public health. </p> <p>A hard-fought battle over Aids drugs 20 years ago led to the <strong>World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha declaration</strong> on trade-related intellectual property (Trips) in favour of access to medicines for all, but the US, which has some of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies, has strongly opposed wording that would encourage the use of Trips.</p> <p>Campaigners say the resolution expected to be passed by the world health assembly\u2019s 198 member states is along the right lines, but too weakly worded. </p> <p><strong>Jamie Love</strong> of Knowledge Ecology International said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a global crisis like this, that has such a massive impact on everyone, you would expect the WHO governing body to have the backbone to say no monopolies in this pandemic. </p> <p>It\u2019s one thing for a country to use its economic clout to buy preferential access to drugs or vaccines.

Some research indicates that children are far less likely to become infected compared with adults but other studies suggest that when they do become infected, they carry as much viral load as an adult, and therefore pose a real risk of passing the virus on to others.</p> <p>The situation was summed up by a senior Labour frontbencher last week: \u201cEither you put the education of children at risk by keeping schools closed, or you take a risk with their safety.

  "<p>The impartiality of the criminal justice system is being undermined by the requirement that defendants declare their nationality at the start of proceedings, a report into the legislation has said.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.commons.legal/the-state-of-innocence\">critical study</a> of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 found 96% of surveyed lawyers did not support the regulations and 90% felt it had a negative impact on perceptions of fairness in the justice system.</p> <p>Introduced by Theresa May as part of her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a>\u201d policy to deport more foreign criminals, section 162 of the act makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to 51 weeks in prison, not to provide the court with details of nationality or give inaccurate information on first appearance.</p> <p>The study compiled by <a href=\"https://www.commons.legal/\">Commons</a>, a not-for-profit London law firm specialising in defence work, was funded by charitable trusts through the <a href=\"http://www.strategiclegalfund.org.uk/\">Strategic Legal Fund</a>. It examined more than 500 cases across England and suggested the law was creating \u201cracialised courtrooms\u201d.</p> <p>David Lammy, the shadow justice secrerary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/08/racial-bias-uk-criminal-justice-david-lammy\">whose own report three years ago</a> highlighted racial bias in the criminal justice system, said the latest study exposed the regressive nature of the legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy is undermining criminal justice and the rule of law,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe question is sometimes not asked when it is mandatory to do so and asked when it is non-mandatory \u2026 [It] is often not understood by defendants \u2026 A significant proportion believe they are being asked for their race or ethnicity \u2013 some have even been known to give their religion.</p> <p>\u201cThe policy is having an impact on the perception of fairness in the justice system. Some defendants, particularly non-British nationals or those from ethnic minority backgrounds, feel they may not receive a fair trial or may be discriminated against. Justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.\u201d</p> <p>The report calls for an urgent review of the law. Stating nationality only on conviction would be less discriminatory, it suggests. The study found:</p> <p>\u2022 96% of legal practitioners surveyed did not believe in the policy.</p> <p>\u2022 79% of lawyers surveyed had a client state their ethnicity or race instead of or in addition to their nationality.</p> <p>\u2022 Two-thirds of defendants not asked for their nationality were white.</p> <p>\u2022 90% of practitioners felt the nationality requirement had a negative impact on perceptions of fairness in the justice system.</p> <p>\u2022 Some felt the question created a sense of otherness and alienation among defendants.</p> <p>Despite the criminal sanction, there were no prosecutions in 2018 for failure to provide nationality.</p> <p>Sashy Nathan, the Commons solicitor who oversaw the project, said: \u201cOur research shows the nationality requirement is being implemented in a way that is undermining fair trial rights and the perception of fairness in criminal courts. We should all want a justice system that we can be proud of and revising the rules on this issue would be a simple but meaningful step in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on the survey, Lammy said: \u201cEquality before the law is a fundamental principle of UK democracy that is admired across the world. It is unsurprising that 96% of legal practitioners do not agree with this regressive policy.</p> <p>\u201cIf the purpose is to find out which offenders are foreign nationals, only those who receive a guilty verdict should be asked about their nationality at the end of the trial. It is wrong to ask this question to all defendants when they are legally innocent.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to removing foreign national offenders from the UK and continue to work closely with international governments to increase the number of prisoners deported.</p> <p>\u201cThese changes help identify foreign national offenders earlier, meaning the Home Office can begin deportation action sooner \u2013 saving the taxpayer money as a result.\u201d</p>",

Almost a third of employers (31%) are delaying start dates and more than half are planning to induct new starters remotely.</p> <p>Stephen Isherwood, the chief executive of the ISE, said: \u201cThere is no denying that this will be a challenging year for young people entering the labour market. </p> <p>\u201cSome employers are backing graduates over non-graduates and others have found it too difficult to start new apprenticeships, which means that school leavers will be among the hardest hit by the crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that students should assume the jobs market is dead.

  "<p>Investing in companies with better records on social issues and good governance pays according to the world\u2019s largest asset manager, with those investments having proved to be more financially resilient during the coronavirus market crash.</p> <p>Investment funds tracking the performance of companies with better ratings on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues lost less money than those including worse performers in 94% of cases during the crisis, according to analysis by BlackRock, the US investment manager which managed $6.5tn (\u00a35.3tn) in assets at the end of March.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns of the world\u2019s largest economies caused chaos on financial markets, costing investors trillions of pounds as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/28/how-coronavirus-sent-global-markets-into-freefall\">stock markets tumbled</a>. The S&amp;P 500, the US benchmark stock index, fell by more than 30% from the start of 2020 to its lowest point in March.</p> <p>BlackRock\u2019s analysis, co-authored by the company\u2019s vice-chairman Philipp Hildebrand, suggested that companies with stronger \u201csocial\u201d scores on factors such as better customer relations and better workforce management did better in the turmoil, as did those whose boards were judged to be more effective and independent.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies with strong profiles on material sustainability issues have potential to outperform those with poor profiles,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn particular, we believe companies managed with a focus on sustainability should be better positioned versus their less sustainable peers to weather adverse conditions while still benefiting from positive market environments.\u201d</p> <p>However, environmental factors \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/22/just-how-ethical-is-ethical-investment\">the focus of much ESG investment </a>\u2013 were not responsible for outperformance. Neither was the relative lack of oil companies in ESG funds behind the outperformance, the report said, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">the collapse in oil prices </a>weighing heavily on fossil fuel producers\u2019 shares.</p> <p>BlackRock said sustainable indices outperformed standard indices in market downturns in 2015-16 and in 2018. The outperformance also lasted through the market recovery, with 88% of sustainable funds losing less than their non-sustainable counterparts in the year to 30 April.</p> <p>The outperformance of higher-ESG-rated companies was evident across stocks and bonds.</p> <p>The data suggests that sustainable investments can also be financially rewarding for investors \u2013 contrary to the common perception that investors in sustainable companies will pay a price for more \u201cmoral\u201d investments.</p> <p>Despite the crisis, investors have poured more money into sustainable investments during 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, global sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds brought in $40.5bn in new assets, a 41% increase year-on-year, according to BlackRock calculations. Separate data from Morningstar showed that the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/977328/despite-the-downturn-us-sustainable-funds-notch-a-record-quarter-for-flows\">set consecutive records for inflows </a>into US sustainable funds.</p> <p>BlackRock has itself been responsible for much of the recent growth in ESG investing. In January it launched a raft of ESG products as it battles persistent criticisms of its role as the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/12/top-three-asset-managers-fossil-fuel-investments\">largest owner of oil companies amid a global climate crisis</a>. It also pledged to exclude companies who make more than 25% of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/blackrock-says-climate-crisis-will-now-guide-its-investments\">revenues from thermal coal</a> from its portfolios on climate grounds.</p> <p>The investor has faced strident criticism from activists for being a relative laggard in relation to other investors when voting on environmental issues at companies, although it says it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/21/blackrock-investor-climate-crisis-blackrock-assets\">focuses on engagement with company bosses </a>rather than using its votes to force changes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Less than $500bn of BlackRock\u2019s assets have some element of screening out companies on various criteria, such as moral or religious reasons, but only about $100bn of that is managed according to full ESG criteria. BlackRock has an ambition to increase that to $1tn by 2030.</p> <p>In a separate report, the asset manager Janus Henderson said global dividends paid out this year could fall by up to 35% to $933bn, as the coronavirus pandemic hits company profits. Europe and the UK are likely to see bigger falls than the US, the company said, with banks, discretionary consumer sectors and economically sensitive industrial companies most affected.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cLook at this, Lee,\u201d I say as I lower my head towards the screen. Lee Hendrie peers back at me. We have been talking for an hour during a gripping and sometimes distressing interview on Zoom. We have reached a painful segment as Hendrie, the former Premier League footballer who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/10/sport.comment1\" title=\"\">played once for England</a>, has opened up like never before. After detailing the \u201cfive or six times\u201d he has tried to kill himself, Hendrie has spoken about his feelings of shame.</p> <p>\u201cYou see how white my hair is?\u201d I ask Hendrie.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replies, wondering if I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Lee, it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m wise. It\u2019s just tells you that I\u2019m a very old fucker.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43b49f7aab555a72bc428c2851427deec1ecec22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43b49f7aab555a72bc428c2851427deec1ecec22/0_14_1878_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against West Ham United in November 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Hendrie celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against West Ham United in November 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The industrial language is meant to make Hendrie laugh and it does. His laughter makes a lovely and uproarious sound. I lift my head and look straight at him. The real point, I say, is that I\u2019ve done hundreds of interviews over the years and this one has touched me more than most. He should not feel ashamed. I feel certain that people are not going to see him as the \u201closer\u201d he sometimes fears he has become. I am hopeful they will respect his courage and honesty. They will understand that, despite his vulnerability, he is trying hard to step out of the darkness that has trailed him for so long.</p> <p>Hendrie is anxious as he awaits publication of this interview and his appearance on ITV\u2019s three-part series <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week21/harrys-heroes-euro-having-laugh\" title=\"\">Harry\u2019s Heroes</a>, which is being screened from Monday to Wednesday. He turns 43 on Monday, on the same day his wife, Emma, turns 36, but he has not been thinking much about joint birthdays. He has been consumed, instead, by worry and shame.</p> <p>The usual knockabout stuff of Harry Redknapp managing a group of middle-aged former footballers, as they prepare to play Germany in a search for \u201credemption\u201d, has a moving segment in the second episode. Hendrie sits down with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/05/vinnie-jones-footballer-this-much-i-know\" title=\"\">Vinnie Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/paul-merson-opens-up-mental-health-depression-gambling-addiction\" title=\"\">Paul Merson</a>. He finds it hard but, slowly, he talks to them about two occasions when he tried to kill himself. It is a big step.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6deb48a5b0695a97ea17ef1a4f3e9c9574a75efa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6deb48a5b0695a97ea17ef1a4f3e9c9574a75efa/0_0_2367_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie talking to Vinnie Jones during the filming of Harry\u2019s Heroes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Hendrie talking to Vinnie Jones during the filming of Harry\u2019s Heroes, which is on ITV this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Ward/Talback Thames/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights,\u201d Hendrie says now, \u201cthinking how it\u2019s going to come across, how are people going to discern me, how are they going to judge me. Lots of memories will wash over me and it\u2019s going to be difficult to watch.\u201d</p> <p>Those memories remain raw and searing. His most recent attempt was only 18 months ago and there are days when it\u2019s hard for Hendrie to get out of bed. \u201cI end up drinking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing worse than taking alcohol and getting to the extreme levels where you don\u2019t care at all. When that happens I\u2019m at my most vulnerable and think it may be time to do something. The last time was a year and a half ago. The good thing is that now, when I\u2019m low, it\u2019s nowhere near the extremes of what I did when times were very, very dark.\u201d</p> <p>Hendrie has made considerable progress since then. Can he admit this to himself? \u201cI can. But I don\u2019t like to praise myself too much and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner. That\u2019s my fear. Things can be fantastic one day or one week and then it can turn. I can sit in bed for three days and not want to get up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m my own worst enemy. I don\u2019t feel I deserve any plaudits. But I\u2019m proud I\u2019ve become someone different. I\u2019ve ended up getting myself into a great job working for Sky Sports. I\u2019ve got to thank lots of people that have taken a punt on me and realised I\u2019m not that person I\u2019m painted out to be. For all the bad press, I\u2019m still a human being. I\u2019m striving to do this new job well but I always have that fear things could go wrong again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To see my family absolutely distraught was a picture I can\u2019t ever get out of my head</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before Hendrie explains his concerns as a freelance pundit in the depths of a global pandemic, he takes me back to the blackest days. In August 2010 his property portfolio, once worth \u00a310m, had been swamped by huge debt. Hendrie knew his home and the house he had bought for his mum would both be repossessed. \u201cThe football was almost over and my head was gone. I\u2019d been trying to sell property but the housing market crashed. I got to the stage where I just wanted to end it all. I\u2019d hit rock bottom.\u201d</p> <p>After he tried to kill himself the first time, Hendrie says: \u201cI vaguely remember bits of the ambulance ride. It was very blurred. But one thing that really stood out was waking up. It was horrible. I didn\u2019t like the fact I was still alive. There were lots of worries. \u2018Am I going to a psychiatric ward because I\u2019ve done this?\u2019 But, most of all, I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to do this again. I want to be free of everything.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cMy wife went through an awful lot. She\u2019s seen me on life-support machines. She\u2019s seen me in distress and pain. But it\u2019s hard to explain when you can\u2019t reach out to someone. I was a closed book. I still am to a certain extent. But if I\u2019d had that confidence to reach out to someone, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be telling you a different story.\u201d</p> <p>Nine months later, in July 2011, Hendrie tried to end his life again. \u201cI was adamant I was going to do it. It felt like everything had been taken away. My divorce [to his first wife] was prolonged. Bankruptcy was in the wings. So this time I was going to finish it off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730825b438db16833bf57df9b663d355ab06b667\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730825b438db16833bf57df9b663d355ab06b667/0_280_8036_4821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie in May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Monday is a treble bash because my wife\u2019s got the same birthday as me and we\u2019ve got Harry\u2019s Heroes in the evening.

I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been on a life-support machine. To see my family absolutely distraught was a picture I can\u2019t ever get out of my head. I still use that to this day when I feel very low. I can\u2019t do that to them again. My mum says: \u2018You\u2019ve got to stop all this. You\u2019re hurting everyone.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think of it like that. I just thought of it selfishly as you do when you\u2019re in them dire straits.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife took a photo of me not long after that second time. But she deleted it because she didn\u2019t want to be reminded of how close it was to me not being around, and not bringing up my children. I\u2019ve always been brought up as a provider. And when you\u2019re a proud man and you can\u2019t provide? That\u2019s when I thought it was the end.\u201d</p> <p>Hendrie mentions only two attempts to kill himself in the ITV documentary. But were there others? He nods. \u201cI could easily name five, six times where I tried to do that in the bad period.\u201d</p> <p>This upsetting news is deepened by the uncertainty of the coronavirus. Hendrie is still on antidepressants and his mental health is being tested again in a precarious working environment. \u201cOne thing that kept me quite close to Sky has been doing some Zoom calls with managers and players,\u201d Hendrie says brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s been really good and really interesting. But the situation\u2019s very difficult. Not getting paid\u2019s one of the big issues a lot of people are going through. I\u2019m self-employed and not contracted so I don\u2019t get furloughed. I\u2019ve had a kind gesture off Sky that\u2019s been magnificent. The last few months have been super as I\u2019ve felt part of a team.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a17db6346d83d7a402ef2548986a750e287acef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a17db6346d83d7a402ef2548986a750e287acef7/484_420_1517_1667/910.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie working as a pundit at MK Dons v AFC Wimbledon in September 2019\" width=\"910\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Hendrie working as a pundit at MK Dons v AFC Wimbledon in September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Brown/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hendrie pauses. He rubs a hand across his face. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019ve had a few days where I haven\u2019t really got up. But the kids have kept me going and kept me sane.\u201d</p> <p>Is he optimistic about getting more work as a pundit? \u201cI am. But it\u2019s hard to escape the lockdown. My job relies on the football industry, and it\u2019s hanging in the balance. I\u2019ve had a lot of sleepless nights because it could be months before I\u2019m getting back into work. You\u2019ve always got that doubt of people coming in and taking your job. The sport industry\u2019s ruthless at times. But hopefully football can resume and I get back into it.\u201d</p> <p>In episode two of the ITV series, which captures Hendrie talking to Jones and Merson, we see him score a hat-trick against San Marino.

I\u2019ve reviewed more than 10 companies that have been submitted as being a PPE supplier and there have been inaccuracies in documentation.\u201d</p> <p>He said this ranged from \u201cbrute falsification\u201d to distributors mistakenly putting unverified kit into the market.</p> <p>\u201cIf companies don\u2019t go through that due diligence there\u2019s a higher likelihood of PPE that\u2019s not fit for purpose,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Pink called for the establishment of an early warning system to flag up potentially inappropriate PPE to employers.

The HSE lost more than half of its budget while workplace inspections fell by 70%.</p> <p>\u201cWe all want to get Britain back to work but only when it is safe to do so. The HSE and local government must be given the resources they need to ensure workers\u2019 lives are not being put at risk.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow business minister, Ed Miliband, called the extra money \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d last week.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the HSE only found out about the new funding when Sharma announced it, meaning it had not started planning for how to use the money.</p> <p>An HSE spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just been given the encouraging news of access to additional funding to support our advice and regulatory activity as businesses implement the new guidance on working safely during coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cAs businesses start getting back to work, we can see scope for making proactive enquiries of employers.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need our approach to be adaptable and regularly reviewed as workplaces get to grips with managing this unprecedented health risk.

  "<p>An experimental coronavirus vaccine will go into production this summer at a \u201crapid deployment facility\u201d before clinical trials have established whether the shots are safe and protect against the infection.</p> <p>The business secretary, Alok Sharma, said the \u00a338m centre would allow manufacture to begin \u201cat scale\u201d this summer in anticipation of the vaccine being shown to work by the end of the year.</p> <p>The centre will churn out doses of vaccine before a larger facility, called the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), opens next summer at the Harwell science and innovation campus in Didcot, Oxfordshire.</p> <p>\u201cThe centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months,\u201d Sharma announced at the No 10 daily press conference, where a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/17/widespread-technical-issues-with-zoom-hits-uk-covid-19-briefing\">technical glitch</a> meant journalists\u2019 questions were read out loud because they were unable to ask them in person via Zoom.</p> <p>\u201cBut if, and it is a big if, a successful vaccine is available later this year, we will need to be in a position to manufacture that to scale and quickly,\u201d he added. The rapid deployment facility would help ensure a vaccine is widely available for the UK public \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Sharma praised scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London for the rapid progress they had made with two experimental coronavirus vaccines. The first tranche of volunteers have received the Oxford vaccine, with Imperial due to start clinical trials by mid-June.</p> <p>In a further announcement, Sharma said a global licensing agreement had been finalised between Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Under the contract, if the vaccine is successful, AstraZeneca will work to make 30m doses available to the UK by September, with a further 70m earmarked for the US and the rest of the world.</p> <p>Sharma said the UK would be \u201cfirst to get access\u201d to the Oxford vaccine \u2013 comments that are likely to raise eyebrows around the world. Last week more than 140 world leaders and experts called for future coronavirus vaccines to be made available to everyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/global-report-leaders-urge-free-vaccines-as-france-allows-staycations\">free of charge</a>, amid concerns that wealthy countries would pay to be at the front of the queue.</p> <p>Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-article-in-the-mail-on-sunday-17-may-2020\">cautioned</a> in an article for the Mail on Sunday that there remained \u201ca very long way to go\u201d in developing an effective vaccine, adding: \u201cI must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition.\u201d</p> <p>The article is the latest to reflect a change in tone of the prime minister\u2019s optimism. Last week Johnson stressed there was no guarantee a vaccine would work, though his chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, was more upbeat, saying: \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something.\u201d</p> <p>In April, AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said scientists could know as early as June or July whether the Oxford vaccine works. Researchers running animal trials <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093195v1\">reported last week</a> that monkeys who received a single jab produced antibodies to the virus within a month. The vaccine did not completely protect the animals from infection but did appear to prevent them from developing the kind of serious lung damage that has claimed so many human lives.</p> <p>Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cWe do not yet know which if any vaccine will work. It is more than likely that at least one will prove effective and safe. The most important thing is to get the infrastructure in place to vaccinate tens of millions in the population, so it is simply unknown whether opening a vaccine manufacturing facility is the best use of the money.\u201d</p> <p>Sharma said that \u201cin spite of the tireless efforts of our scientists, it is possible that we may never find a successful coronavirus vaccine,\u201d and that six drugs that might help fight the infection had entered UK clinical trials.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2020.

  "<p>It was only a month and a half ago that the private equity specialist Peter Wiggs was hailed as the saviour of Australian rugby, whose financial fragility had been exposed by the coronavirus pandemic. The chairman of Supercars was seen as the ideal candidate to repair relations with the broadcaster Fox Sports and organise a resumption of play.</p> <p>But Wiggs only lasted 37 days as a Rugby Australia (RA) director. The day he was to be appointed as chairman, 6 May, he resigned after the board rebuffed his choice of a new chief executive, the Australian Olympic Committee CEO Matt Carroll.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/rugby-australia-appoints-hamish-mclennan-as-new-chairman\">Rugby Australia appoints Hamish McLennan as new chairman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wiggs\u2019s departure would have been more damaging if not for the fact RA had another possible saviour ready to fill his shoes \u2013 the former Network Ten chief executive and News Corp executive Hamish McLennan, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/rugby-australia-appoints-hamish-mclennan-as-new-chairman\">appointed to the board as chairman on Friday</a>, just nine days after Wiggs left.</p> <p>Rumours had circulated for months McLennan would join RA\u2019s board. Ironically, Wiggs and McLennan were meant to join together as part of the first wave of RA\u2019s process of renewal, but for whatever reason that did not happen. Having that pair together would have given the board extra energy and expertise, but at least McLennan will finally get there when his appointment officially starts on 15 June.</p> <p>On the same day RA announced McLennan\u2019s appointment it confirmed it received $14.2m in \u201cfunding\u201d from World Rugby as part of the global governing body\u2019s coronavirus relief strategy. In truth it is a low-interest loan and will need to be repaid. RA\u2019s interim chief-executive, Rob Clarke, said the sum would see the game through the next 12 months, but what about after that? That is where McLennan comes in.</p> <p>We know he can count to a billion. A quick glance at McLennan\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 indicates he possesses the financial expertise to help steer Australian rugby through troubled waters. He is the chairman of several ASX-listed companies, including REA Group, and deputy chair of Magellan Financial Group, a global equity fund. It is all multi-billion dollar stuff.</p> <p>Running Australian rugby should be a walk in the park by comparison, but it is not. It is a difficult, complicated, frustrating exercise, which has seen numerous saviours come and go. As McLennan himself says: \u201cFortune favours the brave.\u201d He will need to be brave to take on this Herculean task.</p> <p>McLennan has stated he wants to \u201crebuild trust\u201d across the rugby community. We have heard that before, too many times. If there is one thing that there is just too little of in Australian rugby it is trust, particularly between RA, the state unions and the premier clubs.</p> <p>Eight years after implementing a so-called independent governance structure, RA is seeking to transform its governance model once again \u201cto ensure all parts of the rugby community can thrive\u201d. Creating the right governance model that is mutually beneficial for all of Australian rugby\u2019s stakeholders is the key. It is a bit like a coronavirus vaccine. It is elusive, but once found a lot of problems will disappear.</p> <p>In the meantime, the best way for McLennan to rebuild trust with the stakeholders will be to help RA re-negotiate its broadcast deal to put the game back on a secure financial footing, giving it some degree of certainty in uncertain times.</p> <p>Fox Sports is playing hard ball after a falling-out with RA\u2019s previous leadership, but it is unlikely someone with McLennan\u2019s broadcast experience would have accepted the chairmanship if he did not think a deal could be done with Fox or someone else.</p> <p>There have been reports Fox Sports is now only willing to pay $10m-15m a year for the broadcast rights, way down on its current $57m-a-year deal, while other reports say the pay-TV network has walked away from rugby. This is where McLennan\u2019s experience in negotiating the Big Bash League TV rights will come in handy, but it is his time as a Mahogany Row insider at News Corp that will be potentially invaluable to Australian rugby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/from-aaron-cruden-to-maa-nonu-are-big-money-rugby-signings-worth-it\">The Breakdown | From Aaron Cruden to Ma'a Nonu: are big-money rugby signings worth it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fox Sports survives on subscriptions.

  "<p>A week ago, 27 million viewers watched as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> signalled the first steps out of the Covid-19 lockdown. The aim of providing a route out of lockdown was a reasonable one. But the strategy and execution were badly mishandled and confused. The botched broadcast fractured a valuable existing consensus. At a stroke, a unified UK-wide approach was cast aside. A week ago, Mr Johnson became in effect the leader not of the United Kingdom but of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-prime-minister-england-coronavirus\" title=\"\">England alone</a>.</p> <p>Mr Johnson\u2019s announcements were not followed by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations. Instead they chose to stick to the lockdown. This division among the partner nations was avoidable. It is also unhelpful to their citizens as a whole. The error was Mr Johnson\u2019s. He needs to focus urgently on restoring a common approach across the four nations that avoids what the Greater Manchester mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/are-we-all-in-this-together-it-doesnt-look-like-it-from-the-regions\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham</a>, has called a London-centric approach. There are, of course, underlying political tensions in the four-nation relationship, and within each nation too, but they had not disrupted the fight against the virus until last week.</p> <p>The Welsh government\u2019s handling points to a better way forward. On Friday, the first minister, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-52667873\" title=\"\">Mark Drakeford</a>, did what Mr Johnson should have done. He made his own statement at the same time as launching a detailed and realistic <a href=\"https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-05/unlocking-our-society-and-economy-continuing-the-conversation.pdf\" title=\"\">document on unlocking</a>, with an easily understood \u201ctraffic light\u201d approach to eventual easing in different contexts. Where Mr Johnson was bullish, blustering and baffling, Mr Drakeford was careful, calibrated and clear. Unlike Mr Johnson, with his anachronistic idea of gung-ho leadership, Mr Drakeford made clear that he is trying to lead a continuing and reasoned conversation. This is a much more modern and devolution-aware approach, which <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-52683789\" title=\"\">Keir Starmer</a> correctly underscored at the weekend, as well as far better suited to the complexities and risks of the pandemic. Similar approaches have been taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/four-nation-exit-strategy-coronavirus\" title=\"\">four-nations</a> approach to the emergency is a valuable asset for the UK. It has the virtues of clarity and coordination. Above all, it was and is the right public health approach. Health policy has long been a devolved responsibility in the UK. It was devolved even before political devolution in the late 1990s. But the virus \u2013 like science \u2013 knows no borders, either of nations or of what used to be called health authorities. Faced with an enemy like Covid-19, it is irresponsible, as well as dangerously ineffective, for different parts of a nation state like Britain to adopt sweepingly different approaches. For that reason alone, joint decision-making remains essential.</p> <p>There will be an increasing case, when the pandemic fades, for different approaches in different communities on a local level. There are signs of that already. But the key point is that these differences should be determined by science and by local public health needs, not by the UK\u2019s internal borders. Despite last week\u2019s unilateral English lurch by Mr Johnson, many of the differences of approach remain reconcilable. It is therefore time to compromise for the common good. Last week, Mr Johnson\u2019s previously enviable ratings <a href=\"https://savanta.com/coronavirus-data-tracker/\" title=\"\">slumped</a>. He doesn\u2019t do contrition, but the more sensitive tone he adopted in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-article-in-the-mail-on-sunday-17-may-2020\" title=\"\">a weekend press article</a> shows that he knows there is a problem.</p> <p>There are many reasons why a collective approach should be re-established for the remainder of the pandemic. The protection of public health is overwhelmingly the main one. But politics is important too. Each part of the UK is governed by a different party. Partisan issues will never be entirely separable from a shared process of this kind. But they must not dominate it. If you need a warning about what the partisan politicisation of Covid-19 can do, look no further than the unfolding catastrophe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-world-leaders\" title=\"\">in the United States</a> and to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/may/17/barack-obama-criticises-trump-in-virtual-graduation-speech-video\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> said at the weekend. The life and death issues involved in the fight against the pandemic are much too important for the UK to go down that disastrous road.</p>",
  "<p>The 75th anniversary celebrations of VE Day may have been more muted than planned, but they still had the ingredients of a national pick-me-up. It remains striking how little the annual commemorations make space for reflection on the reality of living through war and the years that followed. Speak to those affected, and individual memories are far more complex than the national story of years of hardship followed by the sweetness of it all being over.</p> <p>So many of the parallels drawn between war and pandemic have come in the form of cheap battle metaphors, which have little to add. But a better understanding of the way in which the social earthquake of war, experienced collectively by a generation, profoundly affects family relationships over the long term, might offer something.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same for the first world war: we rarely talk about the fact that the dreadful death toll \u2013 almost 750,000 British men were killed \u2013 meant that single young women outnumbered their male peers by more than a fifth in the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-481882/Condemned-virgins-The-million-women-robbed-war.html\">1921 census</a>, a group the press distastefully dubbed \u201cthe surplus women\u201d. An <a href=\"http://www.virginianicholson.co.uk/singled-out\">account</a> of that generation\u2019s lives by Virginia Nicholson documents how many remained single long after the war, some content with their status, others less so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are some areas where the government should be paying a bit more regard to our emotional wellbeing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Three decades later, the postwar baby boom bears connotations of joyful reunions after years of parents bringing up children alone under the strain of war. Yet we know that many men came back utterly traumatised and damaged, at best making it hard for couples to rebuild what they had, at worst resulting in violent and abusive relationships.</p> <p>Living through a lockdown is, of course, a completely different experience to war, but it feels like we too are experiencing a moment that will have long-term implications for family relationships and emotional wellbeing. Partly because we don\u2019t yet know what those implications will be, partly because it is easier to track changes to our economic and physical health, and partly because we value emotional health less, a lot of the discussion about this feels hopelessly superficial: well-meaning but cliched guides for couples on surviving lockdown; dating app press releases boasting of increases in their swipe rates; lawyers predicting a rise in divorce rates while others speculate about a lockdown baby boom.</p> <p>Thanks to campaigners, we are talking about rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/28/calamitous-domestic-violence-set-to-soar-by-20-during-global-lockdown-coronavirus\">levels of domestic abuse</a> more than I can ever remember. But beyond the awful situation of being trapped in lockdown with an abuser, there are plenty of people who will find themselves in fraught circumstances when it comes to their intimate and family relationships. The strain of negotiating unhappy relationships while physically distancing, home schooling and experiencing extreme economic pressure and the particular impact of this on women\u2019s lives; the dilemma of whether to move in together if you\u2019re in a relationship in its infancy; the challenges for long-distance relationships where circumstances mean you might not get to see your partner for months.</p> <p>My single friends are debating whether it\u2019s worth continuing to date, or to give up until things return to something like normality, which could feel like an eternity for women in their late 30s who want children. One is six weeks into a relationship based on daily video calls; while the intensity means they are having the sorts of conversations she might not normally at that stage, she\u2019s wondering how long things can progress without meeting in person. Another muses: \u201cIs talking on screens with potential partners just keeping us busy with unrealistic options and filling the void to keep us from feeling completely alone?\u201d And that\u2019s just the romantic side of things: there are grandparents missing birthdays, children not seeing their friends, cancelled family events.</p> <p>Some might argue there\u2019s nothing the state can do about something as nebulous as our relationships: it must keep focused on the public health response and providing a financial cushion. There\u2019s something in that, not least because economic hardship takes a massive emotional toll. But there are some areas where the government should be paying a bit more regard to our emotional wellbeing, such as in decisions about which lockdown restrictions get relaxed and when.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/show-care-lockdown-clap-transgressors-rontline-workers-pandemic\">We're all keen to show we care, but we've shaped a society that doesn\u2019t care at all | Sam Byers</a> </p> </aside>  <p> In England, ministers have decided to allow an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/can-i-meet-friends-and-family-uks-new-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained\">incremental increase</a> in the number of people we come into contact with, and appear to have prioritised economic over social contacts, encouraging people to return to work before allowing them to socialise in multi-household \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">bubbles</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s important to open up the economy to help secure people\u2019s incomes, but the government could, for now, encourage them to see friends and family rather than their bosses.

It also seems incredibly shortsighted not to be spending more on making mental health services and relationship counselling universally available.</p> <p>For me, the lockdown has served as a poignant reminder that what makes my life great is less a slavish devotion to excessive consumption and more spending time with those I cherish. Yet it feels like the pandemic response is set to prioritise our collective ability to consume stuff over nurturing loving relationships.

  "<p>Another week, another Zoom. On the morning after the 2019-20 Premier League was supposed to finish, its 20 clubs will once again gather in their virtual conference room to decide how it will actually finish. There, emboldened by the successful resumption of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/16/germany-borussia-dortmund-schalke\">Bundesliga over the weekend</a>, they will vote on the league\u2019s protocols for returning to training, before debating how they will play the season\u2019s 92 remaining fixtures, and what should happen if they cannot.</p> <p>If the first part should be simple enough \u2013 the clubs are overwhelmingly expected to vote through the new medical protocols, allowing players to return to formal training by Tuesday morning \u2013 then what follows promises to be a good deal more contentious. A potential restart date will be mooted, with 19 June seeming to be the frontrunner at present. At which point, the same people who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/20/arsene-wenger-offside-plans-sensible-var-armpit-remote-refereeing\">brought us the VAR armpit debacle</a> will try to convince us, with an entirely straight face, that they can run an impenetrable bio-secure league in the midst of a global pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/raheem-sterling-says-weeks-of-training-needed-before-premier-league-restart\">Raheem Sterling says 'weeks' of training needed before Premier League restart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along the way, we will hear plenty of noise about the importance of the Premier League to the health of the sport as a whole, perhaps even the health of Britain as a whole. \u201cMorale\u201d is one of those words that has been promiscuously coughed around of late: the idea that as during the two world wars, a grieving and fearful nation can be partially cheered by the sight of its favourite sport. The restoration of familiar rituals. The reassuring drawl of Danny Murphy: \u201cFor me, Gary, anywhere else on the pitch that\u2019s a straight red.\u201d</p> <p>All of which, allied to the government\u2019s sequential easing of lockdown, would appear to be an argument for resuming all levels of football when it is safe to do so, abetted by generous subsidies for clubs lower down the pyramid to ease the financial burden. But we are a demanding bunch these days, it seems. Only the very best and most lucrative football will sufficiently raise our spirits! So while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/league-two-clubs-agree-to-call-off-regular-season-but-want-play-offs\">League Two clubs vote to end the season</a>, while the lower levels of the pyramid saw their seasons voided at a stroke, the biggest clubs continue to accelerate towards restart, utterly convinced of their own insuperable necessity. </p> <p>There is another important point to be made here. The threat to top-level football \u2013 a terrifying spectre of Premier League giants toppling by the dozen \u2013 has been wildly exaggerated, largely by those with a clear interest in resuming the season as soon as possible. The majority of Premier League clubs have billionaire owners with access to plentiful lines of credit. Grassroots organisations, lower-league clubs, virtually the entire women\u2019s game: this is where the real threat lies, and it is both disingenuous and deeply offensive for the very biggest clubs to paint their own plight in similar terms. </p> <p>For in order to survive, the Premier League doesn\u2019t need to prosper. It simply needs to suffer less than its rivals: Ligue 1, or the Eredivisie, or the Championship, whose ailing corpses can then be picked apart like carrion. Cash-rich clubs with deep pockets will simply be able to harvest a devastated market for bargains. The pie as a whole may be smaller, but it will be divided even more grotesquely in favour of the richest. It\u2019s like the old joke about two hikers being chased through the woods by a ravenous bear.</p> <p>\u201cThis is hopeless,\u201d pants one of them desperately. \u201cThere\u2019s no way either of us can outrun a bear.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to outrun a bear,\u201d his companion points out. \u201cI only need to outrun you.\u201d </p> <p>Often you will hear it said that the prosperity of the Premier League is vital to the game as a whole. This is the sort of faddish pseudo-economics that was debunked in wider society some generations ago, and yet remains curiously persistent in football, which continues to operate by the maxim that what\u2019s good for the top is good for everyone. According to its most recent accounts the Premier League is sitting on cash reserves of \u00a31.5bn: enough money to guarantee the entire pyramid several times over if it so chose. If smaller clubs end up going to the wall during this crisis, remember: their fate will have been a conscious, ideological choice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/frank-lampard-hopes-out-of-contract-chelsea-players-sign-extensions\">Frank Lampard hopes out-of-contract Chelsea players sign extensions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are faint signs that the wider game is beginning to wake up to this reality: that the pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity to redistribute the game\u2019s obscene inequality, or to fortify it. The government\u2019s insistence that any Premier League resumption incorporate some element of free-to-air broadcast, and significant investment in the lower levels of the pyramid, feels like an acknowledgement of this. But without a game-wide consensus, any unilateral move to restart the season feels like a case of turning the money back on first, and asking questions later.</p> <p>And there are plenty of questions that need to be asked. What of the players, many of whom harbour grave doubts about a restart? What of their families? What of BAME athletes and staff, who the data suggest are more susceptible to Covid-19? What of the stadium security guard who hasn\u2019t earned a penny since March but lives with his elderly grandmother, and is thus faced with a despicable dilemma? What of the NHS workers still struggling to source PPE or get adequately tested, who are now watching Premier League clubs hungrily buying up equipment and augmenting their own testing programmes? </p> <p>The problem is, none of them get a vote on Monday.</p>",

It\u2019s worrisome that the latest round of crackdowns coincides with the Covid pandemic.

  "<p>The boss of Heathrow has urged the government to develop plans to restart travel between \u201clow-risk countries\u201d as global lockdown measures are eased.</p> <p>John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of the busiest airport in Britain, said the UK should adopt a risk-based approach to flights and warned that the UK economy will suffer if blanket travel restrictions continue. He also backed the idea of \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow people who have already had Covid-19 to travel more freely.</p> <p>Heathrow\u2019s passenger numbers plunged 97% in April, from an average of 250,000 a day to between 5,000 and 6,000 since lockdown. Holland-Kaye told Sky News: \u201cThis is a very minimal level of traffic, and I think that as long as the quarantine [travel ban] is in place, that will continue at those low levels.</p> <p>\u201cThe quarantine cannot be in place for more than a relatively short amount of time if we are going to get the economy moving again. This is where we are urging the government to have a common international standard, working with other countries so that traffic can start to flow in a normal way between low-risk countries.\u201d </p> <p>UK nationals are now banned from all but essential travel and borders are closed between many countries. The few flights that have landed have mainly been repatriation services to bring home Britons trapped abroad.</p> <p>Ministers are planning to tell entrants to the UK to quarantine for two weeks and download the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/nhs-preparing-to-roll-out-covid-19-contract-tracing-app-by-end-of-may\">new tracing app</a> being trialled on the Isle of Wight and soon to be rolled out across the country.</p> <p>Holland-Kaye suggested there should be a \u201cfree flow\u201d of passengers between the UK and countries that have low risks of transmission. He said: \u201cI think that if the UK government, with one of the biggest aviation sectors in the world, were to get together with the European Union and the United States, between them they have the heft and the global, diplomatic and economic power to set that international standard.</p> <p>\u201cI think the approach to take is the risk-based approach as we do with security, where if two countries are very low-risk or free of transmission, there should be a free flow of passengers between those countries.\u201d</p> <p>Holland-Kaye made the appeal as the airport prepared to screen passengers arriving at Heathrow\u2019s terminal 2 for high temperatures from the end of the week in a bid to identify travellers infected with coronavirus.</p> <p>Thermal imaging cameras will automatically scan everyone who touches down at the terminal, aiming to spot those who have signs of fever. This will allow it to capture data that will be forwarded to the government.</p> <p>The cameras form part of previously announced trials to combat the spread of coronavirus, which include procedures to reduce person-to-person contact, UV sanitation, and the efficient cleaning of trays at security. </p> <p>Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: \u201cIf flights are to restart, passengers need the confidence that if travel restrictions disrupt their trip, the airline will refund them within a reasonable timeframe or rebook their journey for free.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThe aviation sector is important to the UK economy and ministers are in regular contact with its senior representatives to discuss the challenges they are facing and ways we can support.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to look at the best ways to restart all forms of transport, while also ensuring we limit the risk of creating a second wave of cases.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Plans are being made to investigate the potential of nicotine patches to combat Covid-19 after the idea was raised by doctors at a hospital in Wales where the improvised treatment is being practised.</p> \n<p>France moved last week to prevent the stockpiling of nicotine products after its health minister took an interest in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/french-study-suggests-smokers-at-lower-risk-of-getting-coronavirus\"> a French study</a> that suggested smokers may be much less at risk of contracting the virus.</p> \n<p>However, doctors in Wales who <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m406/rr-25\">published their own suggestions </a>in January on the use of the stimulants in coronavirus treatment have been discussing the possibility of a formal trial.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe saw the pandemic coming from China and then the horrific stories from Italy, so we were doing our own research and looking at as many papers as we could,\u201d said Jonathan Davies, a consultant trauma surgeon at Royal Glamorgan hospital, where physicians have been routinely giving out nicotine patches to patients with coronavirus and who had been smokers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The result was a short paper published in the British Medical Journal which stated that, at least in chronic smokers, the lung injuries in those infected with Covid-19 were being exacerbated by nicotine withdrawal. The addictive stimulant could interfere with the production of elements that led to inflammation, according to its authors.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course, everyone should stop smoking. If you are a smoker then you are at risk of all the secondary complications if the virus does take hold,\u201d said Davies. But he suggested in such cases nicotine could be used as a supplement.</p> \n<p>The suggestion by Davies and colleagues led to conversations with Prof Judith Hall of Cardiff University, a medical innovator involved in global development who has said she will approach British funding bodies for support to trial the potential role of nicotine in managing Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The idea was an interesting one, she said, though its value would be difficult to prove.</p> \n<p>\u201cGetting trials under way is of course time-consuming and complicated business, but we must try and advance new ideas as quickly as possible in this crisis,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>In France, research<a href=\"https://www.qeios.com/read/article/571\"> at a major Paris hospital</a> suggested a substance in tobacco \u2013 possibly nicotine \u2013 may be stopping patients who smoke from catching Covid-19. Clinical trials of nicotine patches are awaiting the approval of the country\u2019s health authorities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the researchers insisted they were not encouraging the population to start smoking, which carries other potentially fatal health risks and kills 50% of those who take it up.</p> \n<p>While nicotine may protect smokers from the virus, those who have caught it often develop more serious symptoms because of the toxic effect of tobacco smoke on the lungs, they say.</p> \n<p>The team at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital questioned 480 patients who tested positive for the virus, 350 of whom were hospitalised while the rest with less serious symptoms were allowed home.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThe political moment is now\u201d to address the climate risks posed by the aviation industry, analysts, insiders and campaigners say, as governments across the world weigh up bailouts for airlines grounded by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Rescue packages need to come with green strings, such as reduced carbon footprints and frequent flyer levies, they warn, or the sector will return to the path that has made it the fastest rising source of climate-wrecking carbon emissions over the past decade.</p> <p>Old passenger jets also need to be rapidly retired or cheap oil prices will encourage budget airlines to run services almost empty, which could push up emissions even if passenger numbers stay low, they say.</p> <p>As did banks after the 2008-9 financial crisis, many aviation companies are appealing for government support to escape from a problem they partly caused. The expansion of flight networks, packed seating and a reluctance to accept quarantine measures have contributed to the rapid transmission of the Covid-19 virus across the globe.</p> <p>Until the pandemic, governments were so focused on keeping airlines globally competitive that they largely gave the sector a free ride in terms of emissions cuts and contributions to public revenues. Aviation fuel is completely untaxed in most countries.</p> <p>But the crisis has weakened airline claims that they should be treated as profit-seeking independent companies rather than public entities with social responsibilities.</p> <p>Thousands of planes have been grounded for two months. Even if the lockdown is lifted soon, the industry expects revenues to halve this year. Many airlines are now begging for taxpayer support.</p> <p>European governments have agreed \u20ac12.7bn (\u00a311.35bn) in bailouts, with another \u20ac17.1bn under discussion, according to a <a href=\"https://carbonmarketwatch.org/our-work/aviation-emissions/aviation-bailout-tracker/\">tracker</a> compiled by Carbon Market Watch, Greenpeace and Transport &amp; Environment. The US approved $25bn (\u00a320.6bn) support for the industry in April.</p> <p>If public funds are used to save companies, there is a growing argument that society should get something in return in terms of environmental improvements.</p> <p>Hopes were raised when the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Air France would have to become \u201cthe greenest airline in the world\u201d in return for a \u20ac7bn bailout. This meant reducing the carbon intensity of their overall operations by 50% by 2030, cutting absolute emissions within France by half by 2030, using 2% renewable jet fuel by 2024 and drastically reducing the number of flights of less than 2hr 30mins duration that compete with rail services.</p> <p>Although these conditions are currently non-binding, campaigners said they were hopeful they will be supported by new laws in the coming years.</p> <p>Andrew Murphy, an aviation policy officer at the NGO Transport &amp; Environment, said this could be a turning point after decades of inaction.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the Covid crisis, aviation emissions were going in the wrong direction. This is a moment that has shaken up the industry and raised questions about subsidies, tax breaks, and frequent flying. It is an opportunity for governments to think how they support the airline industry.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was also encouraged the UK has not yet committed public funds to bail out airlines, which would gives them the incentive to put planes back in the sky too soon. A more important step, he said, would be for government to include aviation emissions in their climate targets. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s very important,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout this, nations\u2019 climate calculations are based on dodgy accounting, as Greta [Thunberg] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/uks-creative-carbon-accounting-breaches-climate-deal-say-critics\">pointed out</a> when she was in the UK last year.\u201d</p> <p>Some environmentalists such as George Monbiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/airlines-oil-giants-government-economy\">argue</a> airlines should not be rescued. This is echoed by Extinction Rebellion. \u201cWith 90% of UK planes grounded, and knowing we need to halt polluting industries, there can be no justification for the government to financially support restarting flights. Let\u2019s embed this change rather than bail out this destructive industry and its tax-avoiding owners,\u201d the group\u2019s UK spokesperson, Sarah Lunnon, said.</p> <p>Other climate campaign organisations, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, say bailouts are only acceptable if they come with green conditions. They say airline companies should pay a fair share of taxes and not rely on offsets to reduce emissions, as they are currently doing.</p> <p>Among the measures they propose are fuel taxes on domestic flights (which are currently tax free) and the introduction of a frequent flier levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world\u2019s 7.6bn population flies frequently.</p> <p>\u201cIf governments want to address the twin challenges of Covid and climate change, the political moment is now,\u201d says Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. \u201cPolicies to curb frequent flying could benefit both public health and the global environment.\u201d</p> <p>He said passengers should also be given information about the carbon costs of their flights, which would allow them to support more efficient airlines. The difference between companies can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, the airline industry was feeling public pressure from \u201cthe Greta effect\u201d, direct action by Extinction Rebellion and the high court decision to block Heathrow expansion because it posed unacceptable climate risks.</p> <p>The Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said the UK should build back better after the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThe government can accelerate the decarbonisation of aviation, by helping to scale up new energy sources, such as sustainable aviation fuels, just as they did successfully for solar and wind. Any company that is bailed out by the government should commit to net-zero emissions well before 2050.\u201d</p> <p>Passenger numbers at the UK\u2019s largest airport fell by 97% in April, prompting hundreds of job losses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/may/01/heathrow-boss-ba-redundancies-john-holland-kaye-safety-air-travel\">fears of many more to follow</a>. British Airways and its parent company AIG did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for a comment about their willingness to accept tighter controls on emissions.</p> <p>The UK chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/24/uk-airlines-and-airports-told-not-to-expect-industry-wide-covid-19-bailout\">said</a> he will not treat the aviation industry as a special case, but might consider bailouts on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>Green party politicians say a clearer position is necessary to help workers in the sector to transition to other jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst a reduction in flying will have a tremendously positive impact on the environment, we need to ensure jobs are created elsewhere for those currently working in the aviation industry,\u201d the Brighton mayor, Alex Phillips, said. \u201cThis could mean, for example, that workers are either offered the opportunity to retire in dignity or to retrain in new sectors \u2013 whether they be in zero-emission transport or low carbon jobs that we are in need of both now and in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The issue is likely to linger long after the lockdown. The International Air Transport Association says <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/iata-passenger-demand-may-not-recover-until-2024/138357.article\">demand for air travel will not recover until 2023</a> at the earliest.</p> <h2>Eight steps towards a cleaner aviation sector</h2> <ul> <li><p>Reduce flights. Demand is unlikely to recover for at least three years so the simplest way to reduce aviation emissions is to have fewer planes in the air.</p></li> <li><p>Tax aviation fuel. Initially just for domestic flights so they do not have an unfair advantage against low-emission rail services. Air France has been told it cannot have a bailout unless it phases out flights that compete with train journeys of 2hr 30mins or less. This should later be widened to international flights, which are <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/state-aviation-ets\">responsible for 90%</a> of airline emissions in Europe..</p></li> <li><p>Introduce a <a href=\"http://afreeride.org/\">frequent flyer levy</a>. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world\u2019s 7.8bn population flies frequently. Increasing costs for them would make a bigger difference than asking people to end their annual overseas holiday.</p></li> <li><p>Provide transparent data on carbon emissions of flights so customers can avoid less efficient airlines. Few people are currently aware of the data, but the difference can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes.</p></li> <li><p>Incorporate the aviation sector into national climate targets. Currently the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act only mentions airlines rather than making them part of the country\u2019s emissions calculations, which Thunberg described last year as \u201cextremely creative accounting\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Reduce fleet sizes by scrapping old, gas-guzzling planes. This would also reduce the risk that low petrol prices will prompt budget airlines to rent cheap planes and run them almost empty, which would keep them in business but increase emissions per passenger.</p></li> <li><p>Halt airport expansion. Campaigners won an important victory in February when the high court ruled against Heathrow expansion due to the climate risks. But many other airports plan to open new terminals and runways in the UK and elsewhere in the world.</p></li> <li><p>Invest in green fuel and tech. The French government has said Air France must use alternatives to fossil fuels for at least 2% of flights by 2024. Norway is pioneering <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180814-norways-plan-for-a-fleet-of-electric-planes\">electric planes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-airplane-biofuels/airlines-get-ready-for-jet-biofuel-take-off-in-norway-idUSKBN1XV1TQ\">biofuel from waste products</a>.

The epidemic in Italy was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-italy-lombardy-province-at-centre-of-outbreak-offers-glimmer-of-hope\">disproportionately lethal in Lombardy</a> in the north, where excess mortality hit 300% by 27 March, four times what would be expected. But this hides extremely high excess deaths in three cities: Bergamo (754%), Lodi (489%) and Brescia (344%). In Milan, it reached 143%.</p> \n<p>Similarly in the US, the total excess mortality hides grim figures in some cities. On 11 April, total excess mortality for 15 states and New York City, where the data from the National Center for Health Statistics was at least 90% complete, was below 10% in the five weeks to 20 March, but it then rose rapidly to 60% in the three weeks to 11 April. The area includes 138 million people, representing 42% of the US population.</p> \n<p>But excess mortality reached 68% by 11 April in Massachusetts and 209% in New Jersey, more than three times the expected number of deaths. In New York City alone, with 11.8 million people, excess mortality rose steeply to reach 580% by 11 April, almost seven times the expected mortality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/excess_deaths_new_york/giv-3902K5W2fyhlOxUo/\" data-alt=\"New York City\u2019s mortality rate - graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/excess_deaths_new_york/giv-3902K5W2fyhlOxUo/\">New York City\u2019s mortality rate - graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Coleman is well versed in international data comparisons.

It was only when the figures for all deaths in care homes were released by the Office for National Statistics that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">the real impact</a> in England and Wales was understood.

  "<p>Up to a fifth of patients with Covid-19 in several hospitals contracted the disease over the course of the pandemic while already being treated there for another illness, NHS bosses have told senior doctors and nurses.</p> <p>Some of the infections were passed on by hospital staff who were unaware they had the virus and were displaying no symptoms, while patients with coronavirus were responsible for the others.</p> <p>The figures represent NHS England\u2019s first estimate of the size of the problem of hospital-acquired Covid-19, which Boris Johnson last week said was causing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of deaths. In a national briefing last month on infection control and Covid-19, NHS England told the medical directors and chief nurses of all acute hospitals in England that it had found that 10%-20% of people in hospital with the disease had got it while they were inpatients.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/14/nhs-patients-will-have-to-isolate-for-two-weeks-before-planned-surgery\">NHS patients will have to isolate for two weeks before planned surgery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Senior figures at several NHS trusts have confirmed to the Guardian that a senior official at NHS England said in the briefing, held by telephone conference in late April, that the rate of hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections was running at 10% to 20% and that asymptomatic staff had caused some of the cases.</p> <p>Senior doctors and hospital managers say that doctors, nurses and other staff have inadvertently passed on the virus to patients because they did not have adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) or could not get tested for the virus.</p> <p>Doctors say that hospital-acquired Covid-19 is a significant problem and that patients have died after becoming infected that way. One surgeon, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cMultiple patients my department treated who were inpatients pre lockdown got the bug and died. Obviously the timeline supports that they acquired it from staff and other patients.\u201d</p> <p>However NHS sources maintain that the true rate nationally is currently between 5% and 7%. Extensive swab testing at the trusts and analysis of how long patients had been in hospital revealed that between 10% and 20% had become infected during their stay. But the headline figure passed on in the national briefing was skewed because one trust was known to have poor infection control procedures in place.</p> <p>NHS chiefs remain concerned about the extent of a problem doctors call nosocomial infection. More recent research among staff in the hospitals run by a leading NHS trust in the north of England found that 7% had coronavirus but had no symptoms, and thus posed a risk to patients. Two weeks ago, hospitals began testing all new admissions upon their arrival. While it is also easier now for staff to get swabbed than earlier in the pandemic, problems of access remain.</p> <p>Johnson last week acknowledged that people had died after contracting Covid-19 in hospital and described the problem as an epidemic. In a parliamentary debate Laurence Robertson, the Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, told the prime minister that \u201cjust a few days ago my father Jim died of coronavirus in hospital. He did not catch the virus in the community; he caught it in the hospital when he went in for another illness.\u201d In <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-05-11/debates/D92692B5-165B-4ACB-BC97-4C3F25D726EE/Covid-19Strategy?highlight=%22these%20twin%20epidemics%22#contribution-2F899832-5D39-43F7-9A68-15FDC717550B\">a little-noticed reply</a> Johnson referred to the need to tackle \u201cthese twin epidemics\u201d of both care home residents and hospital patients dying after picking up the infection while being looked after.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Guardian reported on 24 March that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/woman-first-uk-victim-die-coronavirus-caught-hospital-marita-edwards\">Marita Edwards</a> had become the first person to die in the UK during the pandemic after contracting coronavirus in hospital. The otherwise-fit 80-year-old went into the Royal Gwent hospital in Newport on 28 February for a routine gallbladder operation but tested positive for Covid-19 on 19 March and died the next day.</p> <p>A week earlier consultant cardiologist Dr Mark Gallagher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/there-is-a-policy-of-surrender-doctor-on-uks-covid-19-failures\">told the Guardian</a> about a 79-year-old woman who was admitted to his hospital in London for a non-urgent operation. She was diagnosed with Covid-19, which \u201cshe almost certainly acquired on our wards\u201d and was put on a ventilator, but died. About 50 doctors and nurses had treated her, but none had been tested to see if they had the virus, he said.</p> <p>On 3 March NHS England acknowledged that hospital-acquired Covid-19 was a possibility when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/thousands-of-intensive-care-patients-to-be-tested-for-covid-19\">it announced</a> that thousands of patients in intensive care would be tested for Covid-19 to try and identify anyone who had caught it there after cases emerged in Europe.</p> <p>Dr Paul Donaldson, the general secretary of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, a doctors\u2019 trade union, said: \u201cIt seems to be a significant number of anecdotal cases that are reported to us that are nosocomial infection of Covid-19 by many doctors throughout the country. They comment that they are aware of cases in their hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>Donaldson, who is a microbiologist, added: \u201cThey are concerned that a greater number of patients are becoming infected than they would like. They and we at the HCSA worry that the inadequacy of PPE might be contributing to this increase in nosocomial infections.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, which represents intensive care specialist staff, said: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that the incidence of [hospital-acquired] infection has gone up during this pandemic. It\u2019s conceivable that asymptomatic staff may unintentionally infect some patients and that could be a mode of transmisison and help explain the rise in intra-hospital infection.\u201d</p> <p>Pittard said there had been cases of patients being who had been kept alive on a ventilator because of Covid-19 who were then diagnosed with a secondary infection called ventilator-associated pneumonia that they had acquired during their stay.</p> <p>It is understood that the NHS has no reliable figures for the extent of hospital-acquired Covid-19 but would be issuing guidance to hospitals to help them prevent such spread.</p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThis new global health pandemic meant the NHS has faced an unprecedented health challenge, but hospitals have very established and highly effective mechanisms for infection prevention and control, that clinicians are well trained in to care for desperately unwell patients. </p> <p>\u201cPHE is conducting a survey to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic healthcare workers that have detectable SARSars-CoVv-2 virus in their nose and throat to inform development of relevant guidance.\u201d</p> <p>A senior consultant said hospital-acquired Covid-19 could mean that it might not be safe for the growing number of patients who would be coming into hospital for a planned operation, as the NHS attempts to return to normal, pre-pandemic functioning.</p> <p>They said: \u201cWe know from the significant fall in hospital A&amp;E attendances and admissions, many for serious medical conditions, that many people are worried about coming into hospital and catching the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThis shows they are right to be worried; there is real risk. It mirrors the known risk for NHS frontline staff. NHS leadership now have early data to prove this hypothesis.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article\u2019s headline and subheading were amended on 18 May 2020 to clarify that up to 20% of hospital patients with Covid-19 caught the virus while in hospital for separate treatment; the figure does not relate to all hospital patients.</p>",
  "<p>A single mother has launched a legal challenge to overturn \u201cperverse\u201d benefit rules that have cancelled out the chancellor\u2019s \u00a390-a-month coronavirus living costs boost for thousands of low-income families on universal credit and left her \u00a3123 a month worse off than she was before the crisis.</p> <p>The full-time carer for her four young children, who does not wish to be named, was told that the chancellor\u2019s pandemic funds would increase her income by \u00a320 a week to help pay for the higher costs of food and energy during lockdown. However, the money pushed her over government benefit cap limits, wiping out the increase.</p> <p>Her plight was compounded when benefits officials insisted the chancellor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\">March handout</a> meant she could now afford higher repayments on her universal credit advance loan, and so increased monthly deductions from her benefits by almost 30% \u2013 even though the benefit cap meant she was no better off.</p> <p>As a result, the woman, who lives in the north-west of England, is now \u00a3123 a month worse off. She said that after rent and bills were paid she now had just \u00a3100 a month to live on and she had been forced to borrow from her mum and sister to make ends meet.</p> <p>\u201cI have only one meal a day, and it\u2019s been like this for ages.

It\u2019s been horrendous,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe changes to benefits in the pandemic have left me worse off when in fact they were supposed to help me during this difficult time. How can that be right?\u201d</p> <p>The woman was not previously benefit-capped, but her income had already been diminished when her youngest child was born after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/two-child-benefit-limit-pushes-families-further-into-poverty-study\">introduction of the two-child benefit limit</a> in 2017, meaning her universal credit claim restricted financial support to only three of her four children.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s solicitors, Leigh Day, who have filed pre-action papers with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), argue that the retention of both the benefit cap and benefit deductions in the current environment is perverse, irrational, discriminatory and unlawfully breaches the woman\u2019s human rights.</p> <p>The case will increase pressure on ministers to review the benefit cap, a notorious seven year-old policy intended to \u201cincentivise\u201d unemployed claimants to get a job by severely limiting their benefit payments.

Unless the cap is ended, we risk seeing many more people losing critical funds at a time when they need them most,\u201d said the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds.</p> <p>Carolin Ott, a Leigh Day solicitor, said: \u201cThe benefit cap is a measure intended to encourage benefit claimants into work but it is absurd for it to deprive individuals of much-needed support during a time when it is entirely unrealistic for them to enter into employment.\u201d</p> <p>Moving into work is the main way to escape the benefit cap, a task made harder during lockdown when job vacancies are scarce. Even before the crisis this was a challenge for many capped claimants: a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/05/docking-welfare-payments-is-not-incentive-to-work-report-claims\">DWP-backed study</a> found limiting an unemployed person\u2019s benefits made it less likely they would get a job.</p> <p>The benefit cap limits total household benefits to \u00a323,000 a year (\u00a3442 a week) in London and \u00a320,000 a year (\u00a3385 a week) outside the capital.</p> <p>A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cUniversal credit adapts to your personal circumstances and the vast majority of claimants are better off on it.

  "<p>A dinosaur relative of <em>T. rex</em> and <em>Velociraptor</em> with an unusually long neck, and which may have transitioned from predator to plant-eater as it reached adulthood, has been unearthed in Victoria.</p> <p>The elaphrosaur was a member of the theropod family of dinosaurs that included all of the predatory species.

Based on the elongate shape of the delicate bone, it was first thought to have been from a flying pterosaur, rather than a dinosaur.</p> <p>It was only several years later, when Pentland came to study the bone as part of her research on Australian pterosaurs, that the researchers realised it was something else entirely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29fab3cfebb11ec0c0fd670a2b8afff241517679\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29fab3cfebb11ec0c0fd670a2b8afff241517679/0_243_4192_2514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The unusual vertebra for the dinosaur is much longer than it is wide, a common shape seen in the necks of elaphrosaurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The unusual vertebra for the dinosaur is much longer than it is wide, a common shape seen in the necks of elaphrosaurs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Poropat/Museums Victoria</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019d heard about this beautiful-looking pterosaur vertebra in the collection.

They all have a ball at the head end, and a socket at the tail end. But this bone had sockets, or concave surfaces, at both ends, meaning it could not have belonged to a pterosaur.</p> <p>\u201cSo we went back to square one and started going through textbooks, trying to work out what kind of vertebra it was,\u201d Poropat said. After establishing that the bone was from a theropod, they eventually hit upon an African dinosaur from the Jurassic called <em>Elaphrosaurus</em>, which has neck vertebrae \u201cabout four times as long as they are tall, which is unusual for theropods\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of this neck vertebra is that it was particularly informative, just because elaphrosaur neck vertebra are so weird compared to other dinosaurs,\u201d Poropat said.</p> <p>While the Australian elaphrosaur is know from just a single bone, its Jurassic-era Chinese relative <em>Limusaurus</em> is know from a whole series of fossil skeletons from babies up to full adults.

I\u2019d speculate that it was primarily herbivorous [as an adult], but might have been an opportunistic predator of small animals.\u201d</p> <p>Brusatte said the new find was \u201ca great example of how one fossil bone can tell a huge story\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis discovery greatly expands the range of these animals \u2026 They were probably a widespread, and perhaps even global, group of dinosaurs, which we haven\u2019t yet appreciated because of the scanty clues they left behind.\u201d</p> <p>The new find shows they ranged even into southern polar environments.</p> <p>As Australia was much further south 110m years ago, these Victorian dinosaurs would have been living within the Antarctic Circle. While the world was much warmer during the Cretaceous, they would still have had to endure months of darkness during winter and temperatures that periodically dipped below freezing.</p> <p>Nevertheless, other fossils show there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/14/tiny-dinosaur-that-roamed-lost-world-between-australia-and-antarctica-identified\">great diversity of life</a> there. Forests of conifers similar to monkey puzzles and gingko trees had understories carpeted with cycads, ferns and horsetails. Animals included a variety of dinosaurs, as well as turtles, fish and marine reptiles.</p> <p>Further expeditions to the Eric the Red West site have been thwarted twice this year \u2013 first by the bushfire crisis and then Covid-19. But Poropat said many fossils awaited excavation and there was a \u201chigh chance\u201d there were more elaphrosaur bones to be found. </p>",

They predict government interventions and further World Rugby bailouts will be needed to prevent a titanic calamity. If there is a second peak of infections later this year, what then? Even in the event of some form of autumn Test programme taking place, is it really practicable \u2013 or desirable \u2013 for rugby teams to be criss-crossing the globe this autumn?</p> <p>And even if a mooted home unions tournament fills the gap, what are the chances of 81,000 fans, many of them elderly, attending?

  "<p>Visit Ulaanbaatar on Google Earth \u2013 the only way most of us are likely to get there for some time \u2013 and you will find that the Mongolian capital looks like no other city. Scattered around the Soviet-era urban centre are hundreds of thousands of tiny white dots. It is as if someone has emptied an enormous bag of confetti across the landscape, the white specks clustering in the folds of the valleys, extending outwards for miles in long, snaking tendrils.</p> <p>These dots \u2013 separated in their own plot and sometimes accompanied by the orange rectangle of a tin-roofed shack, visible when you zoom in close \u2013 are yurts (or <em><a href=\"http://www.mongoliagercamps.net/home/pages/about_mongolia_ger\">gers</a></em> in Mongolian). For thousands of years, these transportable tents, made of wooden latticework wrapped with insulating felt and canvas, have been the house type of choice for the Mongolian herders on the plains. But the nomadic tent-based mindset is not something easily given up when herders move to the city \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/05/mongolian-herders-moving-to-city-climate-change\">problematic results</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMongolia is the least densely populated country in the world,\u201d says Badruun Gardi, who grew up in Ulaanbaatar and in <a href=\"https://gerhub.org/\">2016 founded Ger</a><a href=\"https://gerhub.org/\">Hub</a>, a nonprofit social enterprise that helps people adjust to the challenges of urban life. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a herder, you can go for miles and miles without reaching another family. You don\u2019t have to think about what living in a confined space with hundreds or thousands of people means.

The 13th-century conqueror Genghis Khan ruled his vast empire from a nine-metre-wide yurt, while Ulaanbaatar itself used to be a nomadic settlement, formed by thousands of tents gathering around a movable monastery, following wherever the herds of livestock decided to travel. The Soviets attempted to formalise the capital in the 1920s, changing its name from Urga (Ulaanbaatar means \u201cRed Hero\u201d), building concrete blocks of flats and setting out an urban grid, which was consolidated in the postwar era. But, as thousands have flocked to the city in recent years, driven by the loss of livestock and promises of better education, healthcare and job prospects,<strong> </strong>the capital has expanded outwards in all directions as a sprawling ger-opolis. The adjustment from life on the open steppe to the hustle of the big city<strong> </strong>clearly takes some getting used to.</p> <p>For starters, the world outside the ger is no longer rolling grassland, but a small private plot, encircled by a two-metre-high fence. City residents must pay for water and fuel, rely on transportation and manage their waste. Their individual actions have an impact on others, sometimes for the first time in their lives; they encounter common problems that become the responsibility of a collective body of people. These social challenges are exacerbated by a host of practical issues: there is no running water in the ger districts, sewerage or central heating. In winter, when temperatures can plummet to -40C, each household burns around three to five tonnes of coal, making Ulaanbaatar <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/ulaanbaatar-growing-strong-and-sick/)\">one of the most polluted cities in the world</a>. And the scale of the challenge is only increasing.</p> <p>\u201cPeople tend to think of the ger districts as these fringe slum areas,\u201d says Gardi. \u201cBut they represent over 60% of the entire population of the city, and they\u2019re growing by 30,000 people every year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bce52d146b11437ef29e865a3b8ea3fb28f0949\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bce52d146b11437ef29e865a3b8ea3fb28f0949/0_0_4000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big city hustle \u2026 tents dot Ulaanbaatar\u2019s suburbs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big city hustle \u2026 tents dot Ulaanbaatar\u2019s suburbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rural Urban Framework</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gardi founded GerHub to help bring a sense of pride back to the ger districts. After a few years of working in whatever spaces it could find, the organisation\u2019s educational and social outreach programme has a new home, in the form of a contemporary take on the traditional ger, designed by the Hong Kong architecture studio <a href=\"http://www.rufwork.org/\">Rural Urban Framework</a> (RUF).</p> <p>Standing as a faceted polycarbonate pavilion in the midst of a muddled ger neighbourhood in the Songino Khairkhan district, the <a href=\"https://gerhub.org/ger-innovation-hub\">Ger Innovation Hub</a> is a striking arrival. Its shimmering plastic walls envelop a slender wooden framework, which itself wraps around an inner space defined by mud-brick walls. In summer, the entire thing can open up, the wall panels lifting to let activities spill out into the surrounding landscape, while in the harsh winter, the layered structure creates a sheltered buffer.</p> <p>\u201cWe were inspired by the structure of the ger itself,\u201d says Joshua Bolchover, cofounder of RUF, a research-led practice based in the University of Hong Kong, whose students helped to build the project. \u201cWe thought, what if we peel the layers of timber, insulation and waterproofing apart to create a room within a room, like a Russian doll?\u201d The resulting structure (judging from the photographs) creates a loosely defined series of spaces that can be adapted to all kinds of activities, from preschool playtime to innovation workshops for teenagers, training sessions for local businesses and drop-in meet-ups for the elderly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8cbbe51d51450da3e9a0b647e05c3ac7300dfcec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cbbe51d51450da3e9a0b647e05c3ac7300dfcec/0_0_3660_5380/680.jpg\" alt=\"Lively \u2026 spaces can be adapted for activities ranging from preschool playtime to innovation workshops.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lively \u2026 spaces can be adapted for activities ranging from preschool playtime to innovation workshops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rural Urban Framework</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The layered design means that, if it\u2019s -40C outside, it would be about 0C (32F) in the buffer zone (\u201cFine for kids to run around with their coats on,\u201d says Bolchover), thanks to solar gain trapped by the polycarbonate cladding, while the central space would only need to be heated to 15C, the warmth radiating from the thermal mass of the mud walls. A circular amphitheatre at the centre of the space has been sized so that a ger can be erected over it too, creating an even more insulated central core for more intimate gatherings.</p> <p>\u201cWe want it to be as lively a place as possible,\u201d says Gardi. \u201cIn winter it can be particularly arduous being stuck indoors for months on end, so we hope this will be a place for social life to happen and<strong> </strong>new community ties to be formed.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, the building only had the chance to host an opening workshop before the coronavirus lockdown halted all activities in the city<strong> \u2013 </strong>Mongolia took <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/covid-19-in-asia-a-country-by-country-guide/#!#Mongolia\">particularly prudent early action</a>, with few cases of Covid-19 and no deaths so far. Hopefully when the centre does reopen it will become a vital social hub to help this fledgling community form neighbourhood bonds and reap the benefits of their newly urban life.</p>",
  "<p>When Ben Longdon\u2019s son got too heavy for him and his wife, Laura, to manage on the back of their bikes on their hilly Cornish commute, it looked as if they might have to start using their car. Instead, they hit on another solution \u2013 an e-bike. In non-lockdown times, Ben and Laura work at the University of Exeter campus about three-and-a-half miles from their home in Falmouth, and their children \u2013 they now have another son \u2013 attend the on-site nursery.</p> <p>Most days, the family commute together. Ben rides a conventional bike, with Laura on the e-bike, pulling a trailer in which the two boys sit. \u201cI can just about keep up on the flat if there\u2019s not a headwind,\u201d he says. \u201cBut she beats me up the hills. She can beat people wearing Lycra up the hills, even with the kids on the back. She normally waits by the entrance to the campus so I can have a drink of water and catch my breath.\u201d</p> <p>The family still have a car, but drive it less than they used to, often using the e-bike for shopping. With their older son about to start school, they have ordered a second one. \u201cI was a little sceptical when we got the first one, but we\u2019ve used it loads,\u201d Ben says. \u201cYou can think of it more as a car replacement than as a bike.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5f41ae786e34ac5648dae9cc2a6e45b096ef6b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f41ae786e34ac5648dae9cc2a6e45b096ef6b7/0_0_640_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Longdon and his e-bike.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Longdon and his e-bike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Ben Longdon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the country, there are a lot of people who, in the coming weeks, are likely to start thinking along the same lines. With some people starting to tentatively return to work, but with physical distancing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/back-to-work-capacity-of-transport-network-will-be-down-by-90\">slashing capacity on public transport</a>, the idea of bikes for everyday transport is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/cycling-could-increase-five-fold-in-london-after-lockdown\">suddenly big news</a>.</p> <p>Many in the cycling world are wondering if this could be the moment when e-bikes, which are hugely popular in some other European countries (about 40% of bikes sold in the Netherlands are e-bikes), could take off in the UK as well.</p> <p>Manufacturers and shops say demand has rocketed. Halfords, the UK\u2019s biggest bike retailer, won\u2019t give details, but says e-bikes account for 11% of sales. Jonathan Cole, who runs a London-based mini-chain of bike stores, Velorution, says demand for e-bikes has been \u201coff the scale\u201d in recent weeks.</p> <p>So, could an e-bike be the answer for your post-lockdown commute? There are a few things to bear in mind, not least what exactly we\u2019re talking about. An e-bike <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/electric-bike-rules\">is a type of bicycle</a> that can be used without any licence, mandatory insurance or helmet, and taken on bike paths. To avoid being classified as a moped, it must fit very specific criteria. The electric motor, limited to 250w, can assist propulsion only when the rider pedals. The maximum powered speed is 15.5mph. And riders must be 14 or over.</p> <p>E-bikes in various forms have been around for decades, but early versions could be clunky, unappealing and oddly balanced. Now, they are generally smooth and easy to ride, with sufficient power to let you glide up even steep hills with ease.</p> <p>Particularly on higher-end models, the motors tend to be effective enough to help propel bikes laden with shopping and children. And there are three-wheeled cargo-type machines, which have large bays for baggage or children.</p> <p>The flexibility of e-bikes means they are seen as more likely to tempt some people away from using their cars. As well as the carrying capacity, the motor boost on hills allows you to wear work clothes and still arrive at work sweat-free. Improved battery technology means effective ranges of several dozen miles or more between charges. E-bikes are also appealing to a potentially broader group of riders, including older people or those working towards more fitness, as well as people with impairments or disabilities.</p> <p>I asked via Twitter for people to get in touch to say whether they used an e-bike, or were thinking about getting one, and a reasonable proportion of those who responded cited problematic knees, chronic conditions or other issues. But a lot simply said an e-bike meant they rode more often, or were happy to tackle a commute that previously they only did in a car. Laura, a 28-year-old project manager, used her car for a six-mile commute across north Sheffield, but now only does so when it rains.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019ve completely changed and I\u2019m never using the car, but I\u2019m using it less,\u201d she says. \u201cBut commuting on the e-bike is much less stressful. In the car, you get stuck in traffic, and parking around my work is very difficult most days. Instead, I can just glide through a lot of traffic.\u201d</p> <p>There is, however, a residual feeling among many British cyclists that e-bikes are somehow cheating. And with an estimated 100,000 deaths a year in the UK because of physically inactive lives, it is a valid worry. Commuting on a traditional bike has been proved to be astonishingly good for people\u2019s health, whereas e-bikes do a lot of the strenuous work. However, the good news is that studies have shown people do still exert themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55708a21cdd433d03e733d150c7e43675401d66d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55708a21cdd433d03e733d150c7e43675401d66d/0_134_5209_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is a residual feeling among many British cyclists that e-bikes are somehow cheating.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is a residual feeling among many British cyclists that e-bikes are somehow cheating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333682725_Physical_activity_of_electric_bicycle_users_compared_to_conventional_bicycle_users_and_non-_cyclists_Insights_based_on_health_and_transport_data_from_an_online_survey_in_seven_European_cities\">2019 research paper</a>, which tracked 10,000 people across seven European cities, found those who rode traditional bikes and e-bikes amassed roughly the same amount of physical activity, with the impact of the electric assist cancelled out by the fact that those on e-bikes tended to ride longer distances and more often.</p> <p>Ashley Cooper, a professor of public health at University of Bristol, says that in terms of helping people to be more active, e-bikes are \u201cprobably the best physical activity intervention I\u2019ve done\u201d. He led a project where a group of people with type 2 diabetes were loaned e-bikes, with their heart rates monitored. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s not a no-exercise option. It\u2019s a really great way of getting moderate-intensity activity.\u201d</p> <p>Because e-bikes go no faster than many cyclists, at 15mph, there is no indication that they are more dangerous than other bikes. The issues, where they arise, can be that other cyclists or drivers don\u2019t expect a clunky-looking bike to start off so fast. Which may be what has led to the phenomenon of the \u201ce-bike smile\u201d, when cyclists first try one \u2013 it\u2019s like having a permanent tailwind. Londoners can try out the e-bike share schemes, such as Lime and Jump, to see if they suit.</p> <p>But now for the downsides. The first is the cost. This can be as little as \u00a3400, but better models tend to be well over \u00a31,000, with cargo bike variants more than double this. E-bikes are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jun/11/could-the-cycle-to-work-scheme-start-an-ebike-revolution\">eligible for the</a> tax-saving cycle-to-work scheme, but are not included in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants\">system of government grants</a> of up to \u00a33,000 towards the costs of an electric car or moped.</p> <p>Among those who would like this changed is Sarah Storey, the multi-medal winning Paralympic athlete who <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/campaigning/article/20190329-Dame-Sarah-Storey-named-as-Sheffield-City-Region-Active-Travel-Commissioner-0\">is a campaigner</a> on everyday cycling for British Cycling and active travel commissioner for the Sheffield city region. Storey argues e-bikes should, if anything, be eligible for even bigger grants: \u201cWhy should an e-car attract a greater level of subsidy? It\u2019s still a very inefficient use of space. If you\u2019re giving up your car, you almost need a bonus \u2013 get it paid for and get \u00a3500 to say: \u2018Thank you very much, you\u2019ve made a massive difference here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The other issue is storage. For people living in flats, secure bike storage can be a problem, but the weight of e-bikes make them harder to carry up stairs, and their value means locking them on the street is risky. Foldable e-bikes do exist, with some manufacturers reporting particularly heavy demand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77049775ce8842c28bd47f44cfe108582566daf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77049775ce8842c28bd47f44cfe108582566daf0/0_213_6381_3829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Better models tend to be well over \u00a31,000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Better models tend to be well over \u00a31,000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest barrier in the UK is cyclists feeling unsafe on the roads. In places such as the Netherlands and Denmark, riders of e-bikes, as well as of any other bike, enjoy the fruits of decades of work to make roads safe for cyclists. Now such countries are braced for a further e-bike boom. The <a href=\"https://ecf.com/\">European Cycling Federation</a> says that, Europe-wide, e-bike sales grew 22% year on year in 2019, and are expected to rise much faster this year.</p> <p>Klaus Bondam, head of <a href=\"https://www.cyklistforbundet.dk/\">the Cyklistforbundet</a>, Denmark\u2019s main cycling campaign group, says the country is expecting an increase in ridership numbers as people are urged to avoid public transport \u2013 and seek exercise to shed what he calls \u201ccorona-kilos\u201d acquired in lockdown. \u201cThere\u2019s been an increase in sales of e-bikes in Denmark, and also e-cargo bikes, as a lot of families are using them as the primary means of transportation,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The same idea could be appealing to many Britons, but whether or not they go ahead could depend on how effectively councils use newly acquired powers to rapidly create cycle lanes.</p> <p>Storey says the one thing stopping her buying an e-bike as family transport for her two small children is safety: \u201cI would, absolutely, use an e-cargo bike to go to the supermarket, and I know my husband would. But only if there was segregated infrastructure and it was safe to do so.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Labour is drawing up ambitious proposals to rescue the post-coronavirus economy with a radical green recovery plan focused on helping young people who lose their jobs by retraining them in green industries.</p> <p>Seeking to seize the initiative on the country\u2019s future direction once the pandemic abates, Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, has called for the plans to include creating a \u201czero-carbon army of young people\u201d doing work such as planting trees, insulating buildings and working on green technologies.</p> <p>Miliband told the Guardian that the combination of the economic damage caused by the virus and the imperative to tackle issues such as the climate emergency and pollution required ambition on the scale of Clement Attlee\u2019s postwar Labour government.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a contemporary equivalent of what happened after 1945,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to start thinking about the future, to think about what kind of world we want to build as we emerge from this crisis. I think we owe it to have a sort of reassessment of what really matters in our society, and how we build something better for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Under a timetable coordinated by Miliband and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, Labour will this week start a rapid consultation with businesses, workers, unions and others on how a green recovery could happen. Proposals will then be put to the government.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should be aiming for the most ambitious climate recovery plan in the world,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cThat should be nothing less than the government\u2019s ambition. The old argument that you can have economic success or environmental care is just completely wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband predicted that such an approach would be welcomed by a population already living through a period of significant change, and where many people had welcomed side-effects of the lockdown such as better air quality.</p> <p>The fact that people had grown used to seeing ministers defer to scientists on coronavirus meant they might now expect the same approach on the climate emergency, Miliband argued.</p> <p>\u201cI do think that there\u2019s a public mood about this,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, people want to get out of lockdown as soon as it is safe to do so, but also, having been through what they\u2019ve been through, they want something better.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a new deal for our healthcare workers and essential workers, obviously. But we also need a new deal around the quality of people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d</p> <p>The plans would build on elements of Labour\u2019s \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d plan, put together under Jeremy Corbyn, which calls for a zero-carbon economy by 2030, but with an urgency and focus reflecting the post-Covid-19 economic situation.</p> <p>Citing <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/corona-crisis-could-increase-youth-unemployment-by-600000-this-year-and-scar-young-peoples-prospects-for-far-longer/\">forecasts from the Resolution Foundation</a> that more than 600,000 more young people could become unemployed this year because of coronavirus, Miliband said one policy should be a scheme in which the government would pay the wages of young workers in green industries for a period.</p> <p>This could also involve retraining older people, Miliband said, saying that there should be an ambition to \u201cleave no worker behind\u201d in any transition towards a different economy.</p> <p>He added: \u201cBut we know that the longer young people stay out of work, the more it blights their future prospects. We need a sort of zero-carbon army of young people doing the things that we know we need to do anyway.</p> <p>\u201cMy first priority would be to say to young people, \u2018We\u2019re going to find you fulfilling, decently paid work which is going to make a contribution to this absolutely vital cause that we face.\u2019 I think that\u2019s step one in the emergency.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of the plans could be adapted by particular regions, for example if there were areas such as the south-west of England where significant numbers of people had lost jobs in tourism and hospitality and needed retraining.</p> <p>There had been concern among some parts of the party that the shadow cabinet had failed to highlight the benefits of a radical green recovery \u2013 and its job-creating capacity \u2013 in the initial stages of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>However, Miliband said the initial focus had been on \u201cthe rescue phase\u201d of coronavirus on the economy, such as scrutinising the furlough scheme, with planning for a subsequent \u201crecovery and renewal phrase\u201d starting now.</p> <p>The Labour for a Green New Deal group welcomed Miliband\u2019s announcement, but said a just green transition must be at the heart of the party\u2019s economic policies. It called on Labour to push for public ownership of failing carbon-intensive industries.</p> <p>\u201cWith the oil and aviation industries in freefall, Labour should be pushing now for climate bailouts, using public ownership to wind down air routes and fossil fuel extraction,\u201d said the group\u2019s Lauren Townsend. \u201cKeir Starmer pledged to \u2018hardwire the Green New Deal into everything we do\u2019 \u2013 that has to mean taking on the big polluters.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>About a month ago, many people I know on the political left were brimming with the belief that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 crisis</a> opened the way for a watershed conversation about deep social change. Now, as the full horror of the UK\u2019s coronavirus experience becomes clearer and we begin to understand an all-enveloping crisis whose effects will be felt for years, that mood seems to have been supplanted by a pained mixture of anxiety and fatalism. On a bad day, our national nightmare now appears so deep and complex as to feel not just depressing, but insurmountable.</p> <p>But from a somewhat unlikely source, there was recently a note of hope. Around the time of the recent VE Day celebrations, the journalist and historian Max Hastings \u2013 something of a freethinker, but also someone with a classic establishment background \u2013 wrote a piece for <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-joy-of-ve-day-masked-a-hunger-for-change-xhkxvlrpx\">the Times</a>. His jumping-off point was the social revolution that began in 1945, but he quickly moved his focus to 2020. \u201cThe present crisis seems destined again to change the face of Britain, unleashing demands for social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories,\u201d said this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\">one-time editor</a> of the Daily Telegraph. To him, the immediate future was clear: \u201cThe polo season, figuratively speaking, is over.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The dysfunctional centralisation of power in England, a blind spot for both the left and right, needs to be reversed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But is it? Last week brought the awful symbolism of golf and tennis clubs reopening for business and the employers of nannies being given the green light to bring them back into their homes, just as many of the people told to return to work were grimly crowding on to public transport. On Wednesday, the Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\">published</a> details of internal Treasury documents proposing a two-year public sector pay freeze; the next day, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/14/councils-in-england-fear-they-will-have-to-make-cuts-of-20\">highlighted</a> the huge shortfalls now facing English councils. Boris Johnson may <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8HC5sOHzus\">have recently</a> held out the prospect of a post-crisis Britain that would be \u201cmore generous and sharing\u201d, but these auguries are hardly promising.</p> <p>And so, as always, attention turns to the Labour party. Judged by the criteria of the weekly political cycle and the ritual of prime minister\u2019s questions, Keir Starmer is so far doing very well indeed. For what such things are worth, his recent net approval rating <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/keir-starmer-approval-rating-boris-johnson-opinion-poll-labour-yougov-9511586\">exceeded Boris Johnson\u2019s</a>, which has seemingly encouraged the age-old Labour belief that the first prerequisite of serious politics is the appearance of measured statesmanship.</p> <p>That is true, as far as it goes. But Labour\u2019s history suggests that a fixation on respectability often blurs into a reluctance to embrace any thinking deemed too adventurous. This instinct may have returned in the wake of a historic election defeat centred on a campaign that presented political ambition as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/five-reasons-why-labour-lost-the-election\">incoherent splurge</a>, and the kind of radicalism that blurred into the obnoxious fringes of the ultra-left. It is still too early to tell, but the result may yet be a leadership clinging to safety, when the moment will sooner or later demand something much more thoroughgoing.</p> <p>The basics hardly involve a huge leap of imagination: to some extent, they mix what might be salvaged from recent Labour politics with ideas that have long been in circulation way beyond the traditional left. The lives of people at the bottom of most socio-economic hierarchies will soon need to be lastingly improved, perhaps via an initial <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy_and_business/2020-04-19/spains-guaranteed-minimum-income-scheme-will-come-with-55bn-price-tag.html\">minimum income guarantee</a> of the kind embraced by the coalition government in Spain. Given that we are unlikely to be able to revive a featherweight labour market based around retail and services, the time ought to be ripe for the economy to be pushed at last towards a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/nov/29/what-is-the-green-new-deal\">green </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/nov/29/what-is-the-green-new-deal\">new </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2019/nov/29/what-is-the-green-new-deal\">deal</a>, and the revival of manufacturing.</p> <p>The dysfunctional centralisation of power in England, a blind spot for both the left and right, needs to be reversed; austerity needs to be conclusively nailed as the dogma of self-harm it always is; and we need to deal, at last, with the deep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-black-people-ethnic-minority-deaths-pandemic-inequality-afua-hirsch\">structural racism</a> towards the people most severely affected by the virus. As crucial as all those issues focused on hospitals and care homes remain, the fundamentals of public health are always about much more: the way that institutions often reflect deep-seated prejudice, and basic matters of what some people call political economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/the-global-pandemic-has-spawned-new-forms-of-activism-and-theyre-flourishing\">The global pandemic has spawned new forms of activism \u2013 and they\u2019re flourishing | Erica Chenoweth, Austin, Choi-Fitzpatrick, Jeremy Pressman, Felipe G Santos and Jay Ulfelder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is rising noise about many of these things. In the last week or so, I have read promising thinking about the politics of the crisis from <a href=\"https://www.medact.org/\">Medact</a>, which gives a voice to health professionals focused on deep social and economic questions; and from <a href=\"https://www.everydoctor.org.uk/\">Every Doctor</a>, a campaign focused on the needs of the NHS. The Institute for Public Policy Research<em><strong> </strong></em>thinktank is doing strong work about how bailouts for companies should necessitate action on their social responsibilities, and thereby trying to open a conversation about a more moral economy. Green New Deal UK is now pouring its energy into a campaign titled <a href=\"https://www.buildbackbetteruk.org/\">Build Back Better</a>, aimed at a new political settlement that \u201cprioritises people, invests in our NHS and creates a robust, shockproof economy that is capable of tackling the climate crisis\u201d. From 25 May, players including the left pressure group <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a> and the <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/\">New Economics Foundation</a> will launch a new initiative aimed at maintaining the pluralism and spontaneity of all this activity, but somehow channelling its energy into a clear policy platform.</p> <p>Of course, there is still a yawning gap between these efforts and the places where this crisis is most vividly playing out. But in an age in which new political developments can ignite at speed, they ought to give us at least qualified hope. The ideal, perhaps, would be for a new agenda to acquire such momentum that it has to be taken seriously, even by the most cautious politicians, as a question that hangs over us finally demands an answer: if any return to the \u201cnormal\u201d that has so horrifically failed us is unthinkable, where does the future begin?</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>BP\u2019s new chief executive said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has deepened his commitment to shrinking the oil giant\u2019s carbon footprint to zero.</p> <p>Bernard Looney, who took the helm of the oil firm in February, said he was \u201cmore convinced than ever\u201d that BP must embrace the energy transition following the collapse of global oil markets.</p> <p>He told the Guardian that his commitment to steering BP towards its net-zero carbon ambitions, set out earlier this year, is \u201cdeeper\u201d due to the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 outbreak</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do, and we need to crack on with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil in the medium to long term.\u201d</p> <p>Some energy economists believe demand for oil may never recover to its levels before the pandemic if changes to business travel and commuting remain after the lockdown ends.

  "<p>The writer and activist Elie Wiesel once remarked that the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference. Superficially at least, we seem to have taken his admonition to heart \u2013 particularly now, as the Covid-19 pandemic forces us to find new ways of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/26/clap-for-carers-applauding-the-nhs-during-coronavirus-in-pictures\">balancing isolation with solidarity</a>. For perhaps the only time in our lives, we can mobilise and participate simply by remaining at home. The contribution of individual behavioural changes to the management of a global crisis \u2013 which ordinarily feels dispiritingly small \u2013 can now be graphed practically in real time. To isolate is, in a very real sense, to care.</p> <p>The problem, though, is that we\u2019ve been conditioned into publicly expressing our care. Coaxed through social media into a perpetual state of display, we seem<strong> </strong>to fear that silence and indifference are synonymous. The act of caring about something \u2013 a cause, a tragedy, a crisis \u2013 is intimately bound up with how we communicate that care. In isolation, no one can see our concern, and we can\u2019t gauge the commitment of others. As a result, our faith in each other becomes fragile.</p> <p>This fear that private concern might be read as indifference explains our growing taste for public performances of commitment: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/welsh-farmer-doing-91-laps-of-bungalow-on-91st-birthday-for-nhs-coronavirus\">fundraising laps</a> in restricted spaces; a weekly clap for the NHS. Even as these moments of shared sentiment are ritualised, they inflame an underlying discomfort: lockdown feels very much like captivity. What if, rather than choosing to stay home in the interests of the greater good, we have in fact been <em>kept</em> at home? When escape is a dangerous proposition, we take the easier route, flipping the role of prisoner by casting ourselves as its opposite: the cop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/what-are-your-new-rights-during-englands-lockdown\">What are your new rights during England's lockdown?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Playing cop solves all of our problems at once. Not only do we shake off captivity by assuming the authority of a guard, we also conveniently communicate to everyone around us just how much we care \u2013 about health workers, pensioners, the finer points of social distancing.</p> <p>A hierarchy of virtue and significance emerges. There are those who simply stay home; there are those who stay home but also join in with organised displays of support and solidarity; and there are those who care so much they post aggressive signs in parks and pap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/13/grant-shapps-would-not-get-on-crowed-bus-tube-coronavirus-lockdown-eased\">commuters on their way to work</a>. By being one of these latter people, we might think, we are surely among the least indifferent members of society. If we are the least indifferent then we must also be, by definition, the most loving.</p> <p>This is the tricky thing about love: it often manifests as fear. When we love someone, we fear their indifference. When we love a community, even a country, we fear that its decay or development will leave no place for us. With love, there is always a border, a place where what we love meets what is excluded. We soothe our fear by hardening our borders. We harden our borders by policing them. Compassion blurs with control. Soon, anything that addresses our fear \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-suspects-may-be-detained-under-uk-emergency-powers\">expanded police powers</a>, tougher punishments \u2013 sounds uncannily like the language of love.</p> <p>As we slowly begin to leave lockdown, our feelings about this period of our lives will change. We will emerge, those of us lucky enough to be safe where we were, into an altered and unstable world. What felt like confinement will feel, quite suddenly, like an embrace \u2013 a time when urgency and productivity were suspended; when there was little or no need to encounter strangers, with all their unpredictable, unmanageable behaviours. We were held in place, and it felt like being protected. As the familiar spaces of our world \u2013 our hair salons and train platforms, our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/gardening-helps-me-to-deal-with-things-englands-garden-centres-reopen-lockdown-coronavirus\">garden centres</a> and dreary offices \u2013 gradually repopulate, we will be forced once again to co-exist.</p> <p>Because we will be out of the habit, our contact with each other will feel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/lockdown-restrictions-solidarity-coronavirus-social-distancing\">messy, unpredictable, dangerous</a>. Far from rejoicing in our new-found freedoms, we may very well be terrified. Desperate for authority to reassure us with firm management, we find only conflicting messages, indecipherable infographics, empty exhortations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/stay-alert-coronavirus-blame\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/stay-alert-coronavirus-blame\">stay alert\u201d</a>. If the government can\u2019t control the virus, what are we to do but control each other?</p> <p>The success of post-lockdown life, then, will depend not so much on negotiating the baffling minutiae of social distancing than as on balancing and pacifying our own most troubling instinct. Otherwise, at the very moment a better world becomes possible, we risk creating a worse one: a world of petty resentments and roiling suspicions, where we not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-app-has-changed-the-way-the-isle-of-wight-sees-itself\">log into an app</a> to report our symptoms and movements, but to alert the authorities to the unmasked excursions and menacing coughs of our neighbours; where our social media feeds are just a rogue\u2019s gallery of strangers\u2019 transgressions; where we not only keep our distance, but demand, violently, that distance is kept from us.</p> <p>This narrowly interpersonal emphasis is a convenient distortion of reality. Our current state of failure hasn\u2019t sprung solely from minor infractions. We\u2019re not faced with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">worst death toll in Europe</a> because your neighbour went twice to the park instead of once, or because someone two doors down flouted the rules to pursue an affair.

Even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-detected-particles-air-pollution\">unchecked pollution in the air</a> we breathe may have served as a vehicle for the virus. Our most cruelly policed borders \u2013 between who is cared for and who is excluded; who is counted and who is forgotten \u2013 are now gaping wounds.</p> <p>As we reckon with grief on an unimaginable scale, tragedy must serve as revelation. It will be no good directing our fear and need for order towards our neighbours and colleagues. Punishment will not bring healing. We will need, instead, to confront the yawning irony at the heart of our modern lives: the fact that, though each of us cares, though each of us is at pains to <em>show</em> that we care, we have nonetheless shaped a society that doesn\u2019t care at all. What we have made together has failed us. We must mourn its failure, and then channel our grief into rage, not at each other, but at the callously indifferent systems whose power we mistook for love.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Byers is the author of Come Join our Disease, Perfidious Albion and Idiopathy</p>",
  "<p>Ministers and officials from every nation will meet via video link on Monday for the annual world health assembly, which is expected to be dominated by efforts to stop rich countries monopolising drugs and future vaccines against Covid-19.</p> \n<p>As some countries buy up drugs thought to be useful against the coronavirus, causing global shortages, and the Trump administration does deals with vaccine companies to supply America first, there is dismay among public health experts and campaigners who believe it is vital to pull together to end the pandemic.</p> \n<p>While the US and China face off, the EU has taken the lead. The leaders of Italy, France, Germany and Norway, together with the European commission and council, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/european-leaders-join-forces-to-combat-covid-19\">called earlier this month</a> for any innovative tools, therapeutics or vaccines to be shared equally and fairly.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,\u201d they said in a statement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The sole resolution before the assembly this year is an EU proposal for a voluntary patent pool.

Countries with major pharmaceutical companies argue they need patents to guarantee sufficiently high prices in wealthy nations to recoup their research and development costs.</p> \n<p>Even more fraught have been attempts to reinforce countries\u2019 existing rights to break drug and vaccine company patent monopolies if they need to for the sake of public health. A hard-fought battle over Aids drugs 20 years ago led to the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha declaration on trade-related intellectual property (Trips) in favour of access to medicines for all, but the US, which has some of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies, has strongly opposed wording that would encourage the use of Trips.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 a perilous and uncertain path</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Campaigners say the resolution expected to be passed by the world health assembly\u2019s 198 member states is along the right lines, but too weakly worded.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn general, it is a disappointment, appalling really.

  "<p>Recently, my wife has started walking towards me and bowing her head, as if in penitence. In fact, she\u2019s showing me the roots of her hair. \u201cHowdsit look?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Yesterday, she sent me an email from her \u201coffice\u201d in the kitchen to mine in the converted loft upstairs. This contained a web link, with no explanation. I clicked the link. It took me to a very long article in American <em>Vogue,</em> \u201cHow Hair Salons Will be Transformed by the Global Pandemic\u201d, about what hair salons might be like in the future: face masks, nobody getting too close, that kind of thing. It could have been summarised in a paragraph, but this being <em>Vogue</em> it went on and on and on. I\u2019m sure it was brilliant. Just not for me, and I didn\u2019t finish it.</p> <p>And yet I am being sucked into this hairy world. My wife has no access to her normal channels \u2013 she can\u2019t pop out to John Frieda to get her cut, colour and blow-dry. Do I care? Not a bit. But I care about my wife, and she cares about her hair a great deal indeed, so I get all tangled up in it, like a cheap brush in an amateur blow-dry.</p> <p>You may have the same thing going on, if not about hair then about something else. Because in every pair of human beings there is always a tiny difference of opinion that feels like a Grand Canyon. One can\u2019t understand why the other cares so little, and the other thinks the first is obsessed.</p> <p>When I told her I would be writing this article about her hair, my wife said: \u201cOK. Just don\u2019t make me seem too neurotic.\u201d What follows is an attempt to describe somebody just neurotic enough:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Soon after we first met, she stayed away from me for a whole month, because she felt that she had been given a bad haircut and didn\u2019t want to put me off.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> When our daughter was a baby, old enough to sit up in the bath but not yet speaking, I gave her (the daughter) a cheeky little trim. Alas, this occasioned wailing and gnashing of teeth from my wife, and I was not quickly forgiven.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> I did once try to blow-dry her hair, and did get my cheap brush tangled in her fringe. This time it wasn\u2019t wailing but howling.</p> <p>These painful memories have been flushed into the foreground by beastly lockdown. With every day that passes, her grey roots become more visible. Until now, this has been managed by the clever application of something contained in an expensive-looking box that she keeps in the cupboard in the downstairs loo. But at some point this remedy will cease to work. And then\u2026</p> <p>I have been informed that I will be required to colour my wife\u2019s hair, using some kind of kit she has acquired in the post and following instructions not merely pre-recorded on YouTube but administered live and in real-time by an actual, pro hair colourist (but what did you expect, given 1, 2 and 3 above?)</p> <p>Speaking entirely in the abstract, this kind of challenge appeals strongly to me. I like painting: I paint in oils, acrylic and watercolour. I am currently painting undercoat and emulsion, in that same downstairs loo, with both brush and roller. If somebody presented me with a wig on a stand, a brush and hair colour, I\u2019d fly at it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I hear her asking our daughter for help. \u2018No way, ask Dad\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But my wife is not a wig on a stand.

I overheard them conversing in the bathroom with the door open. It started well: daughter leapt at the chance, telling mother she\u2019d love to do it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, mother didn\u2019t stop speaking. Instead, she launched into a speech \u2013 a speech that promised to run as long as that <em>Vogue</em> article \u2013 about the need for daughter to get it exactly right. The kind of pressure you might put on somebody before brain surgery.</p> <p>Daughter interrupted: \u201cActually, no. I\u2019m not doing it. Ask Dad.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m so pleased to have a daughter who knows how to set boundaries, and say no. I just wish it didn\u2019t put me back in the spotlight. The options, as I see it, are these:</p> <p><strong>a.</strong> Encourage my wife to go grey. (Won\u2019t happen. The grey is patchy, won\u2019t look right, she says.)</p> <p><strong>b.</strong> Pray that British hair salons are permitted, like those in the American state of Georgia, as described in <em>Vogue</em>, to let customers in again before it\u2019s too late. (Can\u2019t see it happening soon.)</p> <p><strong>c.</strong> Do it, make a hash of it, take my bollocking. (Not the end of the world, but a painful experience that I\u2019d rather avoid.)</p> <p><strong>d.</strong> Do it, find I am not bad at it, win enduring praise and affection. (Ha!)</p> <p><strong>e.</strong> Procrastinate until she becomes desperate enough to say she won\u2019t mind if I make a mess of it. (Best shot.)</p> <p><em><strong>This is not really</strong></em> a story about hair, which many consider to be trivial. It\u2019s about control, responsibility and taking care of each other. Human beings need to feel at least a bit in control, responsible and looked after. By depriving her of access to John Frieda, lockdown has stripped away the illusion that my wife can control the unwanted appearance of grey hair.</p> <p>Compared with much else that is going on \u2013 people dying, losing jobs \u2013 this is certainly at the trivial end of how losing control makes us uncomfortable. But, as it happens, I don\u2019t think hairdos are trivial. It\u2019s true that, in order to avoid pointless conversation at the barber\u2019s, I sometimes sit through the entire procedure with my eyes closed. (If it\u2019s a good cut, great. If it\u2019s a bad one, so what? It will soon grow out.) And yet\u2026 a few years ago when a thin patch appeared at the top of my head I found it painful to contemplate. The uncertainty was terrible: was I about to go entirely bald? Would I lose it all? How long would it take: years, months, days? Would it fall out overnight? What would people think? Why was my body undermining me like this?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It might be trivial, but we need to feel at least a bit in control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over time, I came to see that I regularly meet people I know whose hair has grown bushy, fallen out or changed colour and that, after registering the change, I tend not to give it a second thought. Why should anybody care any more about my hair? I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t. By extension, I\u2019m sure most people couldn\u2019t care less if my wife\u2019s grey roots are visible. If they do care, they\u2019re not worth bothering about, surely?</p> <p>You can imagine how well this line of reasoning works on her \u2013 not at all.</p> <p>The other day, we were watching the news presented by a journalist friend. I told my wife I knew him. She said, \u201cSend him a message.\u201d I did. It read: \u201cMy wife wants to know if you TV people have access to secret grooming and haircuts\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Part of me felt sure he wouldn\u2019t reply to such trivia. But the answer flew back fast. \u201cSadly not! The makeup artists have been sent home and the women are in fear of their real hair colour coming through.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just the women who want to get their hair right. He continued: \u201cJust before lockdown I eschewed filling up the fridge for an emergency haircut. Priorities are important right now.\u201d</p> <p>And so we carry on.</p> <p>My wife bows her head for inspection, invites me to watch somebody on Instagram who just dyed their own hair successfully, or spectacularly badly. And, for most of the time, I pretend to be interested. I\u2019m sure that, in some part of my lockdown life that holds no interest for her, she is doing the same for me.</p>",
  "<p>Have the British turned to drink in the current crisis? When you\u2019re stuck in front of an online merchant\u2019s checkout page, waiting for an elusive and inevitably distant delivery slot, that feels like the logical conclusion.</p> <p>It\u2019s backed up by sales figures. According to market research firm IWSR, <a href=\"https://www.theiwsr.com/near-complete-loss-of-global-on-trade-has-yet-to-be-fully-offset-by-other-channels/\">sales of beer, wine and spirits</a> in supermarkets and off-licences were up by a fifth in the first week of lockdown at the end of March, while online sales of alcohol for the same period jumped an unprecedented 50%.</p> <p>That sounds suspiciously like a boom. The kind of boom that even alcohol sellers might want to be wary of celebrating too much, lest they\u2019re accused of profiteering or having too good a crisis.</p> <p>In reality, while some wine sellers \u2013 notably Majestic and the supermarkets, but a number of online-savvy independents, too \u2013 have struggled to keep up with the surge in demand, the wine business as a whole has been badly hit by the economic shutdown.</p> <p>The same IWSR report estimates that the drinks trade lost 40% of its sales at a stroke when the government closed pubs, bars and restaurants. The spike in home drinking (which, anecdotally, seems to be slowing down anyway, as money and health worries mount) could never hope to make up that fall. Given that most UK wine importers will supply both the on- and off-trade \u2013 and many specialist independent wine merchants double up as restaurant suppliers or as wine bars \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of lost sales in a very short time.</p> <p>The global lockdown has been a struggle for producers, too. The EU has seen the return of the wine lake, filled with unsold wine from producers whose sales to local restaurants and overseas have collapsed. In the southern hemisphere, Covid-19 struck in the middle of vintage \u2013 not the easiest work to carry out while practising social distancing. In South Africa, the government\u2019s strict lockdown conditions initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/03/david-williams-best-south-africa-wines-cinsault-chenin-blanc\">prevented the Cape\u2019s winegrowers from harvesting at all</a>. They\u2019ve since had a change of heart, but a potentially ruinous lockdown ban on exports remained in place for two weeks until the end of April.</p> <p>The wine world has also been mourning the complete loss of its preferred method of promoting and selling its wares: the tasting. From the Napa Valley cellar door shop to the London fine wine importer\u2019s new vintage launch and a vast Dusseldorf trade fair, in normal times there are, without exaggeration, thousands of wine tastings being hosted around the world every day.</p> <p>Enterprising producers, aided by wine merchants and importers, have set up video-link alternatives, where participants receive a case of wine and taste in the company of a winemaker. If the speaker is one of those rare people who can do charisma on Zoom, these webinars can be a fun way to pass an evening: better, certainly, than trading wine stories on social media.</p> <p>But even if the host avoids the occupational poor connection hazards, I find myself longing, as so often these days, for the real, messy, human thing \u2013 for tasting in a time when wine can be truly social again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67d161e903a14e7c52bceaa377ea6dc9830456ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67d161e903a14e7c52bceaa377ea6dc9830456ee/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"OFM Wines May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I find myself longing for a time when wine can be truly social again.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Composite PR handouts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Six wines for lockdown</h2> <p><strong>Ch\u00e2teau Argadens Rouge</strong> Bourdeaux Sup\u00e9rieur, France 2016 (from \u00a310.91, <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/shop/ProductDetail.aspx?pd=CB5891\">thewinesociety.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.davywine.co.uk/product/chateau-argadens/\">davywine.co.uk</a>)<br>The Bordeaux wine trade had to cancel en primeur week, the annual showcase of the new vintage, at the beginning of April.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain records lowest single-day death toll in two months</h2> <p>Spain has recorded its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec110e78f0886ce4f5d51b4#block-5ec110e78f0886ce4f5d51b4\">lowest single-day death toll</a> in two months. According to the latest figures from the health ministry, 87 people have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, down from 102 the day before. The country has confirmed 231,350 cases of the virus using PCR tests, and reported 27,650 deaths.</p> <h2>Brazil\u2019s outbreak now fourth largest in the world</h2> <p>Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced 14,919 new cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 233,142, ahead of Spain and Italy, making theirs the fourth largest outbreak in the world. Mainland China reported five new confirmed Covid-19 cases for 16 May, down from eight the previous day, the National Health Commission said in a statement. Two of the five confirmed cases were so-called imported infections, while three were locally transmitted in northeastern Chinese province of Jilin. Japan also confirmed five new cases.</p> <h2>Greece to announce restaurants reopening on 25 May</h2> <p>Greece is continuing to make headway in its return to normality with the government poised to announce that restaurants and other eateries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec0ee1d8f0864e579f126e8#block-5ec0ee1d8f0864e579f126e8\">can now open on 25 May</a>, one week ahead of schedule. Shopping malls and department stores will also be allowed to open tomorrow, two weeks ahead of schedule.

Seventy-nine per cent of stall-holders in Lima\u2019s wholesale fruit market tested positive for Covid-19, while spot tests at five other large fresh food markets in the city revealed at least half were carrying the virus.</p> <h2>China asks producers to boost food stocks</h2> <p>China has asked trading firms and food processors to boost inventories of grains and oilseeds as a possible second wave of coronavirus cases and worsening infection rates elsewhere raise concerns about global supply lines.

  "<p>As the data rolls in from the Covid-19 pandemic it is a bit like watching the football scores, but only for the teams at the wrong end of the table.</p> <p>The results for every country are poor: it\u2019s simply that some appear to be doing worse than others. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/15/germany-tips-into-recession-as-coronavirus-blights-eurozone-economies\">France saw bigger falls in output</a> than Germany, Spain or Italy in the first three months of 2020: the US has seen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">sharpest increase in unemployment</a>.</p> <p>In truth, it is too early to make international comparisons. The UK took a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/uk-economy-shrank-2-in-first-quarter-record-monthly-plunge-ons-cfovid-19-lockdown-gdp\">smaller hit to activity</a> than France in the first three months of the year but it went into lockdown later. There may be nothing more to it than that.</p> <p>Similarly, the jobless rate in the US is higher than in the UK for two reasons: the Americans get their unemployment figures out quicker and don\u2019t have a furloughing scheme to soften the blow to the labour market.</p> <p>Making assumptions now about which country has fared least badly from the pandemic is no different from making rash predictions about which team will be relegated three games into the season. If the history of the last recession is any guide, the US will bounce back faster than the UK or the eurozone.</p> <p>Governments are sensitive to international economic comparisons, but they are even more prickly when it comes to mortality league tables. You don\u2019t need to be a genius to understand why Boris Johnson has ceased to publish details of how well Britain is doing <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/13/keir-starmer-accuses-boris-cover-ditching-international-death-comparisons-12698049/\">compared to the rest of the Europe</a>. As Keir Starmer helpfully pointed out last week, you need to look no further than the fact that the UK has had more deaths than any other country.</p> <p>Ministers and health officials say that comparing the headline figures for deaths is misleading, and in one sense they are right. France has a lower death toll than Britain but that might be expected given that it has roughly the same number of people living in a country that is twice as big. Population density is clearly a factor when it comes to the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>There is, though, a way to refine the data so that more meaningful international comparisons can be made. This is done by comparing a country\u2019s excess deaths: the difference between the mortality rate this year with what happened in the past.</p> <p>This is what two Oxford University economists, Janine Aron and John Muellbauer, have done in a <a href=\"https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/files/6-May-20-Muellbauer-Aron-Excess-mortality-in-England-vs.-Europe-and-the-COVID-pandemic.pdf\">new paper</a>. It shows England\u2019s peak in excess deaths was not just higher than that in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland but the highest of 24 European countries.</p> <p>England also had the highest excess death rate for the over-65s and \u2013 perhaps even more worryingly \u2013 had far and away the worst record for excess deaths for those age between 15 and 64 as well. At its peak it was 2.8 times worse than the weekly peak in the next worst country, Spain, around four times worse than France and Belgium, and more than five times worse than in Italy.</p> <p>These are sobering findings, particularly in the light of England coming out of lockdown faster than Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.</p> <p>As Aron and Muellbauer note, there are plenty of reasons why England\u2019s excess death rate is so high. The first is the role of London as a major global hub, with a high population density and a transport system that makes social distancing difficult. London had the highest number of cases of Covid-19 in the early stages of the pandemic and it is not hard to see why.</p> <p>A second factor is that it took time for the government to decide a lockdown was necessary. By that time, the virus had taken hold and was being transmitted in London. By the time it reached less densely populated parts of the UK the lockdown had been enforced.</p> <p>Thirdly, the UK was in no fit state to deal with the crisis. The paper notes: \u201cGenerally, there was a collective failure in preparedness across the public health system, especially for testing capability and adequate supplies and distribution logistics of personal protection equipment for health workers.\u201d</p> <p>The findings for the 15-64 age group need to be looked at alongside the government\u2019s own data, which shows much higher Covid-19 related death rates in areas of economic deprivation. Underlying health tends to be worse in the poorer parts of the country, and they contain more low-paid employees who work in face-to-face sectors: care workers, bus drivers, supermarket cashiers.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics has helpfully broken down deaths for England and Wales from Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/files/6-May-20-Muellbauer-Aron-Excess-mortality-in-England-vs.-Europe-and-the-COVID-pandemic.pdf\">by occupational group.</a> Among men, security guards and care workers fare worst. Among women care workers have around 2.4 times the death rates of the average for working age women, suggesting they have been particularly let down by a lack of protective gear and by the failure to test, trace and isolate. The comparative ratio for nurses is 1.3 times the average for working age women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ministers don\u2019t like to be reminded of it, but Germany has done far, far better than the UK, and England in particular. Its decentralised model for testing was streets ahead of Britain\u2019s top-down centralised approach. It had more hospital beds, more intensive care units and more ventilators per head of population. It started testing more quickly, which facilitated effective tracing. Investment in PPE occurred earlier and Germany did better than other countries to keep the virus out of care homes.</p> <p>One of the favourite sayings of football managers is that the table never lies. This one doesn\u2019t either. The government\u2019s handling of Covid-19 has been poor from the start and it is about time it was held to account for it.</p>",

A few years ago, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines were expected to be the industry\u2019s biggest growth areas, but the pandemic, falling renewable prices and a growing divestment campaign have put several major coal projects on hold. The party of South Korean president Moon Jae-in has been re-elected on a pledge to phase out domestic coal use, and many in his ruling coalition are pushing to end financing of overseas projects. In Japan, the big three commercial lenders and the governor of the Japan Bank of International Cooperation have recently said they will <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/COVID-19-will-not-slow-Southeast-Asia-s-shift-from-coal-to-renewables\">no longer accept proposals for coal generation</a>.</p> <p>Other money taps are also being turned off, as investors and finance houses respond to scientific advice and campaigns by divestment activists and school strikers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/wind-and-solar-plants-will-soon-be-cheaper-than-coal-in-all-big-markets-around-world-analysis-finds\">Wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than coal in all big markets around world, analysis finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe economics of coal were already under structural pressure before the pandemic,\u201d said Mark Lewis, the head of sustainability research at the investment management arm of French bank BNP Paribas. \u201cAnd coming out of it these pressures will still be there \u2013 but now compounded by the impact of the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>BNP Paribas is one of a growing list of financial institutions which have chosen to sever ties with coal. The bank said last week that it would accelerate its planned exit from coal financing to 2030 to bring its portfolio in line with the Paris climate goals sooner.</p> <p>In the same week, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/14/norways-giant-oil-fund-ditches-stake-in-australias-agl-over-fossil-fuel-concerns\">ditched a host of coal mining and energy companies</a>, including Glencore, Anglo-American, Vale and AGL over climate concerns.

This is not the only economic squeeze. A near-30% fall in the price of thermal coal has made more than half of production unprofitable, prompting several firms to <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/coal-s-price-collapse-threatens-australian-mines-20200507-p54qyv\">warn of pit closures and layoffs.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5fc08fb6996c29b0db8a287b7e06113a8d1572b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5fc08fb6996c29b0db8a287b7e06113a8d1572b/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coal mine and processing facility in Liulin, Shanxi province, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coal mine and processing facility in Liulin, Shanxi province, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The elephant in the room is China, which burns half of the world\u2019s coal and is the biggest financier of mines and power plants in Asia and Africa \u2013 largely to provide an export market for its domestic manufacturing and engineering firms. A few years ago, domestic coal consumption fell, prompting hopes that president Xi Jinping was committed to a shift away from dirty, high-emitting power production. But after the lockdown, the political priority is to jumpstart the economy. Provincial governments are now working on a slew of new thermal plants. But they are running at less than half of capacity because <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/05/07/asia-pacific/china-alone-africa-dirty-coal/#.Xr1ndy-z2S4\">demand for coal has not returned </a>to its previous level.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 has made clear that China and India have built more than they need. Even before the crisis, they had overcapacity. Now with lower demand, you can see everything is a mess,\u201d said Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Alvarez, lead coal analyst at the International Energy Agency.</p> <p>Alvarez said coal had been hit hardest by the pandemic, but he cautioned the decline could be temporary unless governments invest in renewables to pull economies out of the lockdown. \u201cWe have to look at this structurally. If there is high energy demand again in the future, it will probably be coal that picks up the slack because it is the marginal supplier,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While nobody is expecting coal to disappear any time soon, Ted Nace, director of <a href=\"https://globalenergymonitor.org/\">Global Energy Monitor</a>, believes the balance has shifted for good. \u201cCoal is definitely on the downturn and this pandemic is going to accelerate that. Demand should come back to some degree next year. But there is a very strong argument that it is not going to just bounce back.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2020. The quote about \u201cstructural pressure\u201d was from Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at the investment management arm of BNP Paribas, not from Michael Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas, as an earlier version said.

  "<p>Travel writing has always been plagued with spurious facts, exaggerated claims and barefaced lies, from fantastical beasts geographer Pausanias\u2019s Guide to Greece in the second century AD to Louis de Rougement\u2019s serialised Australasian adventures for the Victorian Wide World Magazine, most of which he gleaned from the reading room of the British Museum.</p> <p>When it comes to accounts of exotic climes, however, none is quite so extraordinary \u2013 or enduring \u2013 as The Third Eye, written in 1956 by a person who called himself Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. This spiritual travelogue covers Rampa\u2019s early life in Lhasa, his years in a Tibetan monastery, encounters with yetis, yogic flying and other Buddhist mysteries. The book sold half a million copies in its first two years, making Rampa something of a celebrity.</p> <p>He did, however, have his detractors. Rampa\u2019s wild claims \u2013 not to mention his West Country burr \u2013 led Tibetologist Heinrich Harrer to hire a private detective. What this gumshoe uncovered surprised even his employer. Not only had Rampa never been to Tibet, he didn\u2019t even own a passport. He was a former plumber from Devon called Cyril Hoskin who damaged his back by falling out of a tree while owl-spotting. During convalescence he had, it seems, settled on a drastic career change.</p> <p>The media was scandalised; Hoskin was unrepentant. Cheerfully admitting that he\u2019d never been to Tibet, he now claimed that as he lay semi-conscious at the bottom of a tree that fateful afternoon, half-strangled by his binoculars, an elderly lama (monk) had floated by on the astral plane and the pair had agreed to swap bodies. (Whether, in 1950s Tibet, an elderly lama ever claimed to be a West Country plumber remains unverified.)</p> <p>Rampa nevertheless garnered a global following. His 20 books range from an interstellar travel memoir entitled My Visit to Venus to Living with the Lama, transmitted to him telepathically by his cat, Mrs Fifi Greywhiskers.</p> <p>History should not judge Rampa, who died in 1981, too harshly. Many leading Tibetologists admit that he set them on their paths, and the Dalai Lama has acknowledged Rampa\u2019s role in drawing attention to the plight of his country. \u201cThe farther one travels, the less one knows,\u201d sang George Harrison in 1968\u2019s The Inner Light.

  "<h2>United States</h2> <p>Foreign policy does not usually draw much attention in US election campaigns. It was given a few token minutes in the Democratic primary debates. But that was before coronavirus.</p> <p>Anti-China sentiment is now the primary fuel of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election effort, in the absence of a workable alternative. It will be increasingly hard to run on the economy, as the president had hoped, or on the administration\u2019s pandemic response, as the human cost of the debacle becomes clear. Sinophobia has proven all the more attractive an option as it claims to explain both failures.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, this is sometimes the tunnelling logic of democratic systems,\u201d Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. \u201cEven if it comes with pretty significant national collateral damage, when it comes down to political survival the bad drives out the good.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Trump supporters in the <a href=\"https://www.a1apac.org/news/new-ad-toast-of-china/\">America First Action</a> committee launched a new wave of attack ads in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, framing the Democratic challenger as \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d, using selective edits of the former vice-president\u2019s past remarks and Chinese-language commentary praising the \u201cToast of China\u201d.</p> <p>The Biden camp has aired some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251582266251243525?s=20\">similar ads</a> of its own, drawing on Trump\u2019s sometimes unctuous admiration for Xi Jinping, and his initially warm praise for China for its pandemic response.</p> <p>The record of the two candidates offers deep reservoirs of material. They have both been complimentary towards a powerful trading partner with an appalling human rights record \u2013 though Trump\u2019s fawning over Xi is in a different league \u2013 and both have children in business, Hunter Biden and Ivanka Trump, who have used their fathers\u2019 coat-tails to acquire preferential treatment from Beijing.</p> <p>The assumption \u2013 shared by both campaigns \u2013 that any association with China is electoral poison is supported by the figures. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/04/21/u-s-views-of-china-increasingly-negative-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\">Pew Research poll</a> published last month found that two-thirds of Americans had a negative view of China; that distrust is likely to have deepened since then, as the Trump administration has insisted on Chinese responsibility for the pandemic.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the campaign has become a bidding war for the most hawkish China policies, with the president instinctively heading last week straight for the extreme end of the argument.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The US-China relationship is probably the most interconnected relationship on the planet, in terms of investment and manufacturing</p> <footer> <cite>Kurt Campbell, the Asia Group</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/15/trump-we-could-cut-off-the-whole-relationship-with-china-video\">We could cut off the whole relationship</a>,\u201d Trump told Fox News, claiming \u2013 without any hint of an explanation \u2013 that such a drastic decoupling would save the US $500bn.</p> <p>As the incumbent, he will be expected to match his rhetoric with actions, so the heated battle of a bitter election is likely to have significant effects on US-China relations, which could in turn have a devastating impact on the global economy and on hopes for multilateral cooperation, while boosting the small but growing risks of conflict.</p> <p>\u201cAll the signs suggest that the administration will be willing to go quite a bit further than it already has to try to shift blame on China for the pandemic, and to pursue policies that will portray it as hard-edged on China. And the central reason for that is that the alternative is that the president accepts blame on himself for his own domestic and international governance failings,\u201d said Mira Rapp-Hooper, an expert on security in the Asia-Pacific region at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me how this ends up,\u201d Kurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said. \u201cI actually think right now that both the American and Chinese standing have been hurt on the global stage. And it feels like we\u2019re fighting while Rome burns.\u201d</p> <p>Several analysts have talked about a new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/15/is-us-china-cold-war-already-under-way/\">cold war</a>\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, but Campbell \u2013 who now runs a business consultancy and capital management firm called the Asia Group \u2013 argued that this great power rivalry will be even messier because they have become so integrated over the past three decades.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the framework of the cold war, because it suggests going back to something in the past. And the peculiarities of the US-Soviet relationship were such that we had very little connection, very little understanding with one another, very little travel, very little trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe US-China relationship is probably the most interconnected relationship on the planet, in terms of investment and manufacturing. So to do surgery on these conjoined twins would be incredibly difficult.\u201d</p> <p>That has not stopped the Trump administration from picking up a scalpel and making a start on \u201cdecoupling\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-global-risks-uk-inflation-business-live\">phase one</a>\u201d trade deal signed in January was a vague document that did little to resolve the trade tensions between the two countries. Now, its optimistic spirit, and the idea that there might be a \u201cphase two\u201d, is a fading memory.</p> <p>The Trump administration is contemplating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/donald-trump-bank-of-china-debt-report\">series of punitive measures</a> against China in retaliation for its failure to contain the pandemic.

But as China emerged from its virus hell, a particularly ugly strain of the ideology emerged. It has found expression in many ways, from a top diplomat peddling conspiracy theories that the US brought Covid-19 to Wuhan, to racist attacks on Africans in the streets of a major city.</p> <p>In Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/us-and-uk-condemn-arrest-of-hong-kong-democracy-activists\">15 activists were arrested</a> in the biggest crackdown on the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of mass protests last year. There have been bellicose editorials threatening Taiwan in state media.</p> <p>The malevolent triumphalism was summed up in a banner hung by one restaurant in the northern city of Shenyang. In March, diners at Mother Yang\u2019s \u2019\u2019were invited to \u201cEnthusiastically celebrate the coronavirus in America; wish the virus a long and successful journey in Japan\u201d.</p> <p>The message was quoted by Geremie Barm\u00e9, <a href=\"http://chinaheritage.net/journal/1900-2020-an-old-anxiety-in-a-new-era/\">in his translation of an essay</a> warning of an escalation in aggressively anti-western nationalism by the intellectual and former diplomat Zi Zhongyun.</p> <p>\u201cWho could have guessed that things would get exponentially worse during the coronavirus epidemic? Numerous absurd rumours have been doing the rounds, although they all feed into one overriding sentiment to \u2018bolster China and disparage the west\u2019,\u201d she wrote, comparing the current political climate with that of the Boxer rebellion, a disastrous wave of violent anti-western nationalism in 1900.</p> <p>More people have now died from the virus in the US than have been infected in China, at least going by official data.

Their fury at being stranded is a new, unexpected problem.</p> <p>But the narrative of unmatched Chinese success in disease control relies on ignoring the cover-ups and missteps that allowed the disease to spread so far, the death of the whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang and the chaos that engulfed Wuhan at the peak of its crisis. Public anger about these failings may have been silenced as the party reshapes the narrative but it has not totally vanished; and the economy was dealt a heavy blow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China\u2019s attacks on the US were to be expected.

After the economy started to slow down [in recent years], it became more nationalistic to help compensate for that,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cNow, with coronavirus, the legitimacy problem has become more serious, so they have doubled down on aggressive nationalism.\u201d</p> <p>Across the Pacific, Xi faces an increasingly belligerent Trump. Stirring up fears of an outside threat, an enemy against which to mobilise, is a time-honoured method of building political support. Trump has an election to contest in less than six months; and, while Xi does not face such a public test, he still seeks legitimacy to bolster his government.</p> <p>\u201cChina\u2019s attacks on the US were to be expected, given the geopolitical tension between the countries,\u201d Andrew Small <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_meaning_of_systemic_rivalry_europe_and_china_beyond_the_pandemic\">wrote in a recent paper for the </a><a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_meaning_of_systemic_rivalry_europe_and_china_beyond_the_pandemic\">European Council on Foreign Relations</a>. \u201cBut Beijing also appeared to have decided to instrumentalise Europe, at a moment of deep internal strain, in a broad information battle over the supposed inadequacies of western democracy. It was not enough to argue that the Chinese Communist Party had succeeded; others had to be seen to fail.\u201d</p> <p>Xi\u2019s triumph may not be all it seems, however, because although he has steered China out of the first stages of the coronavirus, he now has to lead the country through the economic wreckage left behind.</p> <p>And while the Chinese population can perhaps be protected from re-contagion by shutting the country\u2019s borders, its economy grew on the back of globalisation and cannot be so easily sealed off.</p> <p>Even before Covid-19 emerged, Xi was facing a cocktail of serious economic challenges, including high debt, low productivity and the fastest ageing population in the world. In the virus\u2019s wake, China has registered the slowest growth rate in more than four decades and unofficial estimates suggest that unemployment has climbed to 10% or more.</p> <p>In trying to solve these problems, China may find that its aggressive nationalism proves a costly tactic, even in a world where Trump has abdicated America\u2019s position of global leadership. \u201cChina will have a chance to displace US influence in many places, but it\u2019s a globalised world,\u201d Hung said. \u201cMy judgment is that China overreached and alienated too many people and, in the end, it will backfire on the economy when countries \u2026 try to find other places to invest or move their production facilities.\u201d</p> <p><em>Emma Graham-Harrison</em></p>",

  "<p>Stay alert! On Twitter, Tom Tugendhat, The Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, is talking. There! He is thanking the prime minister for his \u201cvery clear message\u201d. Tom Tugendhat! On Twitter! Now! He is enjoying the sheer coral sea clarity of the prime minister\u2019s Sunday statement, like sunlight shining through spring water in Waterford crystal! Tom Tugendhat! He says: \u201cThank you prime minister. That\u2019s leadership!\u201d</p> <p>Stay alert! This former intelligence officer is the nephew of a real man called Baron Tugendhat. Baron Tugendhat is not a character from a 19th-century German children\u2019s book about a baron with a weird hat, the end of which gets tugged. But what did Tom Tugendhat want? Why was he bothering us?</p> <p>Stay alert! Peasants! Get back to work! Over the top, boys! Gas! Gas! For God\u2019s sake, gas! Writing in the 2012 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">Britannia Unchained</a></em>, The secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, Dominic Skeletor Raab, said of British workers, they \u201cprefer a lie-in to hard work\u201d, \u201care among the worst idlers in the world\u201d, and expect to see laziness rewarded. If British workers were also serial liars, then our workforce would have been made in the image of our prime minister. Ha! I\u2019m here all week! Maybe all year! Try the fish! Don\u2019t forget to tip your healthcare worker!</p> <p>Stay alert! Here at home, my family nag me to mend the gate, fix the dimmer switch, hoe the avocado trench. But I am a lazy British worker for whom the pandemic is an excuse to skive off and home-school the year four syllabus. Precipitation, Shinto and Cnut. My family won\u2019t relent, so I have presented them with a simple graph. It shows that at some point I would do the things they wanted me to do, but it was impossible for me to say when that would be, or whether the things would be done well enough to remain done, or whether they would then have to be done again later at an unspecified date. And that seemed to satisfy them. The twats!</p> <p>Stay alert! On Sunday night the prime minister appeared on television and presented his own graph, explaining his immediately discredited and internationally ridiculed New Vision of Lockdown Britain \u2122 \u00ae. My 12-year-old, whose strongest subject is not maths, laughed openly at the graph, and said she would not have handed it in at school as neither the X or the Y axis contained any actual information, so it had no meaning. We are being guided by a graph that a schoolgirl would be ashamed to submit. All the prime minister\u2019s shoddy homework suggested was that if some time passed, eventually some things would happen. Some of them might involve stick men jumping about or riding bikes. And although a blue line is going downwards, there was at least twice as much shading-in in the area showing The Future as there was in the area showing The Past. This suggests Covid-19 deaths will triple to around 90,000. Beat that Belgium! But the tear-jerking stupidity of the prime minister\u2019s death-inducing graph did not deter the usual suspects from coming out in its defence, not least of all Tom Tugendhat, his fellow Tory MP Alan Abortionmaqaquesymptom being unavailable due to self-isolation. Because for loyal Tom Tugendhat, the prime minister\u2019s offensively stupid night soil bucket of obfuscation was \u201ca very clear message from @Borisjohnson and a welcome explanation of the situation. By explaining the uncertainty and complexity @10Downingstreet is allowing us all to think through the situation.\u201d Nonsense, Tugendhat, and youknowsit, clart!</p> <p>Stay alert! Something about the strange collision of unrelated words that form Tom Tugendhat\u2019s surname means that whenever Tom Tugendhat appears in my visionary satire-dreams it is as a territorial army lieutenant colonel forcibly pulling at an end, presumably his own, that has become trapped in a hat, or in an intelligence officer\u2019s wig of disguise. It\u2019s past midnight, and now Baron Tugendhat is in my drunken nightmares, working undercover for James Bond\u2019s great-grandfather, attending a lavish ceremonial dinner<strong> </strong>at Neuschwanstein castle. The future of Anglo-Bavarian trade relations depends on Baron Tugendhat also tugging his end free of a hat, on this occasion a Tyrolean Alpine bonnet, common to the region, a vagina dentata of felt and chamois leather.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Middle-class workers: text each other photographs of your Ocado deliveries and dream of Center Parcs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stay alert!

But Matt Handcock is unable to say whether other workers can refuse employers\u2019 demands to return. Over the top! Gas, boys, gas! It\u2019s the bonfire of rights Brexiters always dreamed of, delivered ahead of schedule by this coronavirus, a microscopic sleeper agent for the European Research Group.</p> <p>Stay alert! Lazy British working-class workers. Die at your posts for Dominic Raab. Die in your warehouses for Jacob Rees-Mogg. Die in your care homes for Dominic Cumming. Middle-class workers. Work safely from home at your laptops. Text each other photographs of your Ocado deliveries, and dream of Center Parcs and Forest Holidays. Once I found it funny that the prime minister\u2019s perfect storm of public desperation, manufactured xenophobia and ruthless dishonesty had seen this self-serving turd float to the toilet top. But now it\u2019s just frightening. I worry for my children, my country, my avocado trench. Sort yourself out, wazzock.

  "<p>The darkness was all-consuming as we reached the midpoint of our journey, blackness and confusion all around. It had already taken us two days to make it to the forest. At a certain point, we looked up and realised our child was no longer with us, lost amid the shimmering foliage. \u201cTeddy, where are you?\u201d my wife called. \u201cForget him, he was only slowing us down,\u201d I murmured, perceiving the dim shape of a branch through the leaves.</p> <p>But there is always a way through \u2013 if not the colour, then the shape will guide you. Backs aching, eyes narrowing, language stripped to pure function, we began to piece together the blackest sections of the puzzle. \u201cThis is a waste of life,\u201d my wife eventually concluded and returned to her novel. The glory would be mine alone. By midnight on the eighth day, the 500-piece Super-3D holographic jigsaw of the Hogwarts Express was complete.</p> <p>Yes, this was technically a sixth birthday present for our Harry Potter-mad son. Yes, we did most of it while he watched Netflix. Yes, I\u2019m aware 500 pieces is not that many. Yes, this was a decadent amount of time to work on something so pointless. But sometimes, pointlessness is precisely the point.</p> <p>At any rate, we are far from being the only household that has turned to jigsaws in lockdown. Decent 1,000- piecers are harder to find than yeast these days. Gibsons, one of the UK\u2019s leading jigsaw companies, reports a year-on-year sales increase of 132%. \u201cWe\u2019re doing Christmas-level sales,\u201d says marketing manager Samantha Goodburn. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our best to print out as many as we can and get them out to people who need them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e62f6a6a59ea0a885fe517e48a703a729c962ed7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e62f6a6a59ea0a885fe517e48a703a729c962ed7/0_0_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Cats are popular.

Jigsaws are a gateway drug to twee. You start out on a nice <em>New Yorker</em> cover. Soon, it\u2019s Teddy Bears &amp; Tricycles.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want<em><strong> </strong></em>masses of sky or sand,\u201d says my Granny Rose, 90, and a lifelong puzzler. \u201cYou want it to be interesting.\u201d She grew up on jigsaws \u2013 her father only let her and her sister look at the picture once \u2013 and usually has one on the go. She likes doing them with friends or family, but in lockdown, she is on her own, working on an image of Blackpool beach that a friend dropped round. \u201cIt\u2019s ghastly!\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut my other jigsaws are in a high cupboard and I don\u2019t want to risk climbing up on a chair.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not too hard to see why we\u2019re reaching for jigsaws. Margaret Drabble wrote a memoir inspired by puzzles, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/family-christmas-jigsaw-puzzle-history\" title=\"\">The Pattern </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/family-christmas-jigsaw-puzzle-history\" title=\"\">in </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/family-christmas-jigsaw-puzzle-history\" title=\"\">the Carpet: A Personal History With Jigsaws</a></em>. \u201cThey provide hours of painless social intercourse or moments of peaceful, solitary retreat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey give you an illusion of order and progress when all around is chaos.\u201d There is such a thing as competitive puzzling, but this is not the point, Drabble argued. Here is a \u201charmonious, constructive, co-operative activity, free of the rivalry that makes so many games contentious and so many children so cross.\u201d And if you want to do it on your own, while listening to a podcast or the birds singing, that\u2019s fine, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d5d8595b07eade9b09902c9a282c1b89d315fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d5d8595b07eade9b09902c9a282c1b89d315fd6/0_97_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some kittens explore a child\u2019s toy cupboard.

One concluded that the activity \u201crecruits multiple visuospatial cognitive abilities and is a protective factor for visuospatial cognitive aging\u201d. But it\u2019s possible to overthink this. <a href=\"http://drabigaelsan.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dr Abigael San</a> of the British Psychological Society sees it as a classic mindful activity. \u201cFocusing on detail, taking the time to relax, having an aim without pressure \u2013 all of those things are beneficial and a counter to the wider anxiety that people are feeling at the moment. It gives you a sense of control in a chaotic situation. The world is unpredictable, whereas a jigsaw puzzle is certain.\u201d As long as no one has lost a piece.</p> <p>The jigsaw is thought to have been invented in 1766 by John Spilsbury, an engraver and mapmaker whose \u201cdissected maps\u201d were used to teach. Jane Austen included a jigsaw in <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1814). The Bertram children laugh at poor cousin Fanny as she is not familiar with these fashionable toys. Adult puzzles emerged in the 20th century. At first all the pieces had straight edges. My granny remembers the \u201ctwo spinsters\u201d who lived next door to her had one like this \u2013 finally completed by the evacuee who came to stay during the war. She also remembers dedicated jigsaw libraries \u2013 of which I can find only one in England, based in a Baptist church in Exeter. Social distancing has forced it to close during lockdown. \u201cOur clientele is usually quite elderly \u2013 people with time on their hands,\u201d says its chairperson, Susan Hazemore. \u201cIt\u2019s good for their eye-hand co-ordination. We have a few people who suffer from dementia and also insomnia, too. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be open until at least September now, but I am hoping that when I can go out and about a bit, I can do some delivering to people who are on our books.\u201d</p> <p>For many, lockdown has been a foretaste of retirement. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t usually warrant a 1,000-piece jigsaw,\u201d says Liz Vater \u2013 who realised she would have to cancel her literary festival early on and so found herself with time on her hands. \u201cAt the beginning, I had so many plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to read all the books I have around the house. And I just wasn\u2019t able to read. It was horrible. I always have a book on the go. But then I started a jigsaw. It does a similar thing. I was focusing in. It was quite meditative. I was processing as I was going. I\u2019ve loved the endless hours just focusing on one task, searching for pieces defined by colour, perspective or shape.\u201d</p> <p>One thing we have learned is that global catastrophes don\u2019t introduce brand new ideas, what they do is accelerate ones that were already floating around the ether: universal basic income; modern monetary theory; jigsaw puzzles. When I interviewed Sir Patrick Stewart in Los Angeles three years ago, he was adamant that jigsaws were about to become the new \u201cadult colouring books\u201d. We were supposed to be talking about some superhero movie he was in, but he was more interested in telling me about the Picasso chair he was piecing together. \u201cAt first I was a little embarrassed about it, as it was something I\u2019d done as a kid,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut when I would occasionally mention it, people would whisper: \u2018Oh, you do jigsaw puzzles, too? What kind? How many pieces?\u2019 It\u2019s like a secret society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0ffe815bdbb727adb15e44d3a33f6e7c161c0ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0ffe815bdbb727adb15e44d3a33f6e7c161c0ed/0_0_5149_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A piece of history: a handcut wooden puzzle of golfers on the course at Prestwick dates from about 1914.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A piece of history: a handcut wooden puzzle of golfers on the course at Prestwick dates from about 1914.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goodburn of Gibsons says that jigsaws have been on a steady uptick since she joined the firm five years ago. There is a jigsaw emoji. Jigsaws were also added to the Consumer Price Index used to measure inflation in 2017 (alongside gin and almond milk). \u201cIt pre-dates coronavirus,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the trend of looking after yourself, being more mindful, taking a digital detox.\u201d Nostalgia is popular across age groups \u2013 one of their bestsellers is called 1980s Sweet Memories, a montage of Marathons, Opal Fruits and Jelly Tots \u2013 but they have also commissioned a new range of design-led jigsaws with a hipper audience in mind. \u201cWe have one called Avocado Park. It\u2019s just a load of cartoon avocados having a great time in a park.\u201d</p> <p>You can tell a lot about a nation by its jigsaw designs. Cats are popular. So are Spitfires. And the manically detailed, Union Jack-filled designs that Gibsons commissions often veer close to the sort of art you can imagine coming out of a Faragist dictatorship. Populist Realist Art? I ask the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s art critic Laura Cumming for her verdict on The Airshow, which shows gleeful picnickers beneath a sky heavy with warplanes. She professes herself a little baffled. \u201cThe vintage planes would scalp the day-trippers, the photo-real detail seems bizarrely mismatched with the graphic kitsch and it is very strange that the hardest part of a jigsaw \u2013 long stretches of barely differentiated colour, such as sand, sea or sky \u2013 are eliminated as if the artist wanted the experience to be quick and easy. Is the idea to get through them as fast as possible and buy the next?\u201d She reckons Pieter Bruegel the Elder is a good jigsaw artist as \u201cyou enter so intimately into his mind, piece by piece; but I think Seurat is the most beautiful to do, half a dot, a whole dot, etc, as you get a deep sense of his colour alchemies.

  "<p>The current crisis has revealed a sobering truth: the global economic shutdown, which has been achieved at a devastating social cost, has barely dented our carbon emissions. The latest analysis, by the International Renewable Energy Agency (<a href=\"https://www.irena.org/publications\">IRENA</a>), expects this year\u2019s annual emissions <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2020\">to be down by just 6-8%</a>. Such a small drop in emissions would have no measurable effect on the world\u2019s carbon concentration, or its warming potential. Indeed, 2020 is currently on track to be the hottest year ever recorded.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d need about a 10% drop to have a noticeable effect on the rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, but even then concentrations would still be rising,\u201d says Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office. \u201cThe rate of rise of CO<sub>2</sub> varies from year to year anyway, as the natural carbon sinks get stronger and weaker because of natural processes, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/what-is-el-nino\">El Ni\u00f1o</a>.\u201d During an El Ni\u00f1o event, tropical forests don\u2019t take up as much carbon, so the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rises a bit faster. And in La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite occurs. \u201cThat effect is probably more important than the small drop in emissions we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d</p> <p>Considering that emissions have to fall by at least <a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/\">7.6% </a><em><a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/\">every year</a></em><a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/\"> to 2050</a> in order to keep global warming below 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels), this internationally agreed target now feels alarmingly unachievable.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows that the challenge of avoiding dangerous climate change and getting to zero emissions is unbelievably hard,\u201d says Simon Evans of climate science website Carbon Brief. \u201cEven something which seems to be having seismic implications for the global economy, at least in the short term, like the current crisis, is something of a drop in the ocean compared to that challenge.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, the cleaner air, burgeoning urban wildlife, and our sudden, dramatic shift to a less carbon-intensive lifestyle reveal the scope of what we can achieve in just days. This is something to cling to as we navigate the twin storms of Covid-19 and climate. We know that the climate crisis will not wait for a more convenient time; we must deal with it and the pandemic crisis concurrently. It is, however, the killer disease that has provoked the strong and urgent response. Governments have been forced to step in and deal with the catastrophe in a way that is unprecedented, including supporting business and industry, and public and private infrastructure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Individual action \u2013 driving your car less, attending a meeting via Zoom, not taking a flight \u2013 is not going to be enough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across the world, government has never been bigger. Many experts argue that this provides us with a huge opportunity to also deal with the other crisis: to make a transformational leap towards a sustainable society that enables us to keep the world below dangerous warming. How we respond to this unique opportunity could set our climate trajectory for thousands of years to come.</p> <p>These behavioural changes we\u2019ve experienced \u2013 some of which may become ingrained permanently, meaning travel and consumption patterns become more responsible \u2013 are helpful in reducing pollution, just as hand-washing helps in the pandemic. But what the expected 8% emissions reduction figure shows us is that individual action \u2013 driving your car less, attending a meeting via Zoom rather than taking a business flight \u2013 is not going to be enough. Equally, it shows that moving to a no-growth economy is not the answer, as some have argued. Instead, systemic transformative action is required at international and state level to get the effective reductions in atmospheric carbon that will bring us to net zero.</p> <p>\u201cIt means we can\u2019t be fiddling around the edges,\u201d says Betts. \u201cIf we are going to have a substantial impact on long-term CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, we need huge, lasting changes in energy systems and other things that rely on fossil fuels.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that the IRENA analysis was based on the expectation that human activity will return to some approximation of \u201cnormal\u201d within months, so the shutdown period itself is likely to produce a far steeper drop in emissions \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\"> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China fell</a> by an estimated 25% during its February lockdown, for example. India, meanwhile, recorded its <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-indias-co2-emissions-fall-for-first-time-in-four-decades-amid-coronavirus\">first ever annual emissions fall</a> for the year ending March, and is expected to show a 30% drop in emissions for the month of April. \u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing at the moment is, for the most part, very temporary,\u201d Evans says. \u201cWhen we drive again, the car still burns petrol.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"883cee7b3a6af15294c907ea353649da73e41560\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883cee7b3a6af15294c907ea353649da73e41560/0_178_5322_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty motorways near Sydney in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empty motorways near Sydney in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, structural change could mean people swapping their combustion engines for electric vehicles. More fundamentally, Evans says, \u201cit would involve reimagining the way our cities are built and organised, so that going without a car becomes easier, through how roads are laid out, and how provision for walking and cycling and public transport is changed.\u201d</p> <p>All of those things go far beyond the individual choices we make in our everyday lives. \u201cOur choices are bounded by society,\u201d Evans says, \u201cso a shift towards a low-carbon society can\u2019t happen via individual action alone.\u201d</p> <p>Cities have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/city-leaders-aim-to-shape-green-recovery-from-coronavirus-crisis?CMP=share_btn_tw\">leading this transition</a> with innovative buildings and infrastructure projects. Some are already banning cars and trucks as a temporary measure. Others are going further: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution\">Milan is reallocating 35km of street space to cyclists and pedestrians</a>; Brussels is creating 40km of new cycle paths; and France is tempting cyclists out with subsidies. In the UK the government has announced a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking\">\u00a32bn infrastructure scheme</a> to encourage more walking and cycling and the mayor of London has unveiled measures to create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/15/transport-for-london-faces-3bn-funding-gap-despite-16bn-bailout-income-journeys-coronavirus\">car free bridges and streets</a>. Many cities are exploring some form of a circular economy, in which waste is minimised with resources kept in use as long as possible through recycling and reuse.</p> <p>The economist Kate Raworth says: \u201cWe live in a world that is complex, deeply interconnected, and human health and planetary health are woven into one. So governments need frameworks and ways of thinking that can hold that complexity \u2013 that can think about climate and health and jobs and financial stability and inequality in one space.\u201d </p> <p>For instance, quite apart from the pleasure of experiencing cleaner air, the coronavirus pandemic has revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/air-pollution-linked-to-far-higher-covid-19-death-rates-study-finds\">how deadly pollution is</a>. One recent study found that a tiny increase in particulates was associated with a 15% increase in the Covid-19 death rate, almost certainly contributing to the terrible rates seen in cities. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a>, the high death rates seen in the north of the country correlate with the highest levels of air pollution. Reducing air pollution would lower the general health burden and may also help prevent future pandemics from being so deadly.</p> <p>\u201cWe have created a framework, which invites a place to answer: how can our cities be home to thriving people in this thriving place, while respecting the wellbeing of all people and the health of the planet?\u201d Raworth says.

Momentum for environmental protection has been building over the past few years, and it may be that this crisis proves a tipping point in public consciousness, leading to a meaningful shift in policy. For one thing, the pandemic has shown us how valuable expertise is, and now we\u2019re all au fait with the role of infectious disease modellers in guiding public health policy, it should help us appreciate the role climate modellers could play in guiding economic policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a204deca14fd9e271a88c88f9233eb2c2b70819a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a204deca14fd9e271a88c88f9233eb2c2b70819a/0_450_6720_4030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stray cat has Taksim metro station, Istanbul, to itself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stray cat has Taksim metro station, Istanbul, to itself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJust as we have seen that early action to deter the spread of the virus was far more effective than trying to contain the damage after the virus already spread, transforming our energy system now to prevent the spread of excessive heat over our planet will be far more effective than trying to adapt to the consequences of this excessive heat later,\u201d says Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution for Science, which is based in Washington DC.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Government is not there just to fix the same system, but to shape the kind of economy and society we want to live in</p> <footer> <cite>Mariana Mazzucato</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>City initiatives can only go so far. Ultimately, this is the time for governments to forge a new relationship with the private sector, to produce a sustainable economy. As industry, businesses and individuals plead for state aid, government has never been in a stronger position to push a sustainable agenda, and it\u2019s vital this is not squandered on kneejerk bailouts. We\u2019ve already seen the US and UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/bank-of-england-failing-climate-with-covid-19-stimulus-programme-oil-firms-debt-bond-governor\">bailing out oil giants</a>, and the UK giving supermarket giant Tesco a business rates holiday, only for it to pay a dividend to shareholders. \u201cWhat the government should be doing is thinking about the interest of the public that it represents, that it was elected for, and not simply giving out money that benefits private interest,\u201d says economist Mariana Mazzucato at University College London. \u201cThis is not about helping business make money. It\u2019s about giving them that cashflow to survive, but also helping them transform themselves to be a more functioning part of society,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe government will never have the negotiating hand it has now. There\u2019s trillions being poured into the economy, given the tragedy. So, this can be used as a way to make sure that the \u201cpublic private partnerships\u201d actually become a symbiotic mutualistic partnership, not a parasitic one, as we\u2019ve had in the health sector for a long time,\u201d Mazzucato says.</p> <p>Governments, she says, must take the long view and use stimulus packages to actively mould a cleaner economy, something that South Korea has pledged, for instance. \u201cGovernment on its own cannot solve climate change, or create an equitable production system. It needs the private sector, and the private sector needs the public sector.\u201d</p> <p>Mazzucato and others argue that there\u2019s a danger otherwise that we will repeat the mistakes that were made in the aftermath of the 2008/9 financial crisis (during which emissions also fell), by not attaching conditions to the bailouts. \u201cGoldman Sachs was back making record profits after it was given a $10bn bailout,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd89f84a842349320f2b180f51ea888580716421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd89f84a842349320f2b180f51ea888580716421/0_2_6595_3955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grounded planes at Schiphol airport, the Netherlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grounded planes at Schiphol airport, the Netherlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need to learn that government is not there just to do bailouts to fix the same system, but to really co-create \u2013 to shape the kind of economy and society we want to live in. We know that\u2019s not a fossil fuel-driven economy; we know it\u2019s not a financialised one; we know it\u2019s not an unequal one. But that\u2019s not going to happen on its own. It needs to be embedded inside the policies,\u201d Mazzucato says. \u201cGovernments need to put strong conditions into bailout contracts, which require investment, innovation, transformation of industry, but also in society more broadly, to help us achieve these longer-term objectives.\u201d</p> <p>Ending state subsidies to fossil-fuel companies would be an easy win. The plunge in oil prices, rather than spurring a rush in fossil-fuel investment, as has happened in the past, now makes oil a volatile, uncertain commodity to invest in, especially when nations are worried about foreign dependency. The dip in oil prices may <a href=\"https://eciu.net/blog/2020/low-oil-price-could-be-a-boon-for-net-zero\">actually hasten the end</a> of domestic extraction of all fossil fuels. So it now makes sense to shore up local renewable infrastructure, especially as costs are getting cheaper and there\u2019s long-term certainty in the market. The scope for public sector jobs and growth in this decentralised industry could prove transformative as we stare down the tunnel of a long recession.</p> <p>The IRENA believes that renewable investment could power recovery with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/green-energy-could-drive-covid-19-recovery-international-renewable-energy-agency\">global GDP gains of almost $100 trillion (\u00a380tn)</a> between now and 2050. Meanwhile, the economic risks of not meeting the globally agreed greenhouse gas emissions targets could be severe, according to research published in <em>Nature</em>.</p> <p>There is a risk, though, that while we are so preoccupied with the pandemic, the environmental movement, which made significant progress over the past year through the activities of striking schoolchildren, Extinction Rebellion and the leadership of Greta Thunberg, falls off the agenda. The much-anticipated 2020 UN climate change conference, which sets out how nations will meet the UN climate emissions targets agreed in Paris in 2015, has been postponed from November to early 2021. In the meantime, we might forget the deadly wildfires that ravaged Australia mere months ago, or the extreme weather that displaced some 7 million people last year, or the near-record Arctic melting.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners are sanguine, though, preferring to wait until the world is less distracted by the pandemic. With the US presidential elections due this year, next year\u2019s climate talks could now get the chance to benefit from an enlightened leader ready to engage with the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAs environmentalists we have a role even during the lockdown, for instance in opposing the aviation bailout,\u201d says Alice Bell from Possible, an organisation campaigning for a zero-carbon society. \u201cFor now, we\u2019ve shifted to community action, people have made new relationships within their communities, and we\u2019ve been looking at, say, the debate around park closures. This pandemic is going to profoundly change the way we live and how we work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bbab8916099c1db3ca7610596ac9d057896bb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bbab8916099c1db3ca7610596ac9d057896bb31/0_389_5870_3524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goats roam the streets of Llandudno.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goats roam the streets of Llandudno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global problems require global collaboration, and despite the nationalistic responses of some states, the pandemic has revealed that its solutions are international: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/world/europe/coronavirus-science-research-cooperation.html\">scientists and medics have been sharing</a> data, resources and equipment, and have been advising and supporting each other as never before, united in the quest for effective treatments, tests and vaccines. This same spirit of international cooperation is essential in producing solutions for our energy and economic transitions, and the technology and pace of information sharing make it possible. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if wealthy nations collaborated with resource-rich (poor) nations in an inclusive global economic programme? Sustainable production of crops and minerals in the global south could help fuel the rich world\u2019s low-carbon transition. Instead of unsustainable industrial expansion, the post-pandemic economy could be steered in a way that protects people and the planet from the kind of <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/83/intelligence/the-superorganism-that-created-the-pandemic\">ecological destruction that produces new diseases</a>, and the climate disaster that threatens us all.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, for instance, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonhickel/status/1251146508709195780?s=20\">170 Dutch academics</a> have put together a radical five-point manifesto for economic change, which includes investment in critical public sector areas, clean energy, education and health, and radically scaling back the oil, gas, mining and advertising sectors; debt cancellation, especially for workers and small business owners and for countries in the global south; and redistribution, with universal basic income, reduced working hours and the recognition of care work.</p> <p>Perhaps because we\u2019ve experienced a cleaner, quieter and kinder alternative, most people don\u2019t actually want to get back to normal (<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-only-9-of-britons-want-life-to-return-to-normal-once-lockdown-is-over-11974459\">one poll found only 9% of Britons wanted to return to pre-pandemic </a>conditions).

  "<p>Abdallah Azzam is not exactly a household name \u2013 at least when compared with the far more notorious Osama bin Laden. But the militant Palestinian cleric who inspired and mobilised Arabs to come to Afghanistan to fight the Soviet Union in the 1980s is the most important jihadist figure before the birth of al-Qaida and the continuing consequences of the 9/11 attacks on the US.</p> <p>Azzam is still revered by many who believe that the Islamic <em>ummah</em> (community/nation) matters more and has greater legitimacy than individual authoritarian Arab and Muslim states. Mosques, fighting units, training camps and websites have been named after him since he was assassinated in Pakistan in 1989. Fans maintain Twitter and Telegram accounts. Uncritical and heroic accounts of his achievements abound \u2013 in Arabic and English.</p> <p>Thomas Hegghammer\u2019s meticulously researched story of the life, times and significance of Azzam is the opposite of a hagiography, as is to be expected from a renowned scholar. His main argument is that Azzam was responsible for internationalising jihad by interpreting it theologically as a duty. That was at odds with Muslim Brotherhood ideologues who preached domestic opposition to autocratic secular regimes like Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Libya. But it was the repressive character of those regimes, he also argues, that made jihad \u201cgo global\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Azzam was seen, in Hegghammer\u2019s spot-on if unacademic phrases, as a 'jihadi with balls' and an 'Islamist rock star'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Azzam was born in Palestine in 1941 and was a child when Israel was created and Palestinians experienced their <em>nakba</em> (catastrophe). Growing up in the Jordanian West Bank, he joined the Brotherhood and studied at Al-Azhar University in Cairo (where he was appalled by the secularism of Nasser\u2019s Egypt), and qualified as a cleric. In the wake of the 1967 war, which further delegitimised the Arab republics, he joined the <em>fedayee</em><em>n </em>\u2013 Palestinian guerrillas fighting Israel \u2013 but watched helplessly as they were driven from Jordan in \u201cBlack September\u201d, 1970. He moved to Saudi Arabia, lectured in sharia law and made valuable connections as the concept of Pan-Islamism became increasingly popular.</p> <p>Hegghammer identifies Azzam\u2019s early combat experience as the key to his influence, though he later spent far more time making speeches and writing books and articles than fighting the Soviets. He ran the Peshawar-based Services Bureau, which provided logistical support and training for around 7,000 \u201cArab Afghans\u201d who arrived from across the Middle East and north Africa to challenge the \u201cinfidels\u201d who had invaded in 1979, \u201ctheir \u2026 minds full of Sylvester Stallone and visions of paradise\u201d.</p> <p>Widely referred to as \u201cSheikh Abdallah,\u201d Azzam was seen, in Hegghammer\u2019s spot-on if strikingly unacademic phrases, as a \u201cjihadi with balls\u201d and an \u201cIslamist rock star\u201d. He met Bin Laden, the scion of a super-wealthy Saudi family, in the late 1970s, but contrary to previous studies, was never actually involved with al-Qaida, though he did not oppose it, \u201cand stayed on decent terms with Bin Laden till the end\u201d. On the basis of the story so far, the author speculates \u2013 in a section clearly labelled \u201ccounterfactuals\u201d \u2013 that had he lived, Azzam might well have come to support the war against the US.</p> <p>Palestine mattered hugely to Azzam, and his undying hostility to Israel extended to unquestionably antisemitic attitudes. He also loathed the PLO and other \u201cgodless leftist traitors\u201d. Supporters of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, which controls the blockaded Gaza Strip, often invoke his name. \u201cThe sheikh\u2019s body was in Afghanistan, but his spirit was suspended over Nablus and Jerusalem,\u201d one Arabic biographer wrote. Yet it was better to wage jihad in Afghanistan than not to wage jihad at all.</p> <p>Hegghammer convincingly debunks the myth \u2013 favoured on the left \u2013 that 9/11 represented a \u201cblowback\u201d against the US, which had promoted the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan for its own cold war interests. He shows that the CIA (with Britain\u2019s MI6) was largely indifferent to the Arab mujahideen, who were militarily insignificant, concentrating instead on supporting Afghans \u2013 though he notes that Azzam enjoyed unimpeded access to the US to fundraise and recruit.</p> <p>\u201cIn the Islamist victim narrative that developed from the late 1980s onward, western countries are cast as vicious Islamophobes bent on killing and humiliating Muslims,\u201d he writes. \u201cGone is any trace of recognition for the support the west lent to the Afghan resistance. This goes to show that historical realities can be twisted to the unrecognisable in ideologically motivated narratives.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Azzam enjoyed a formidable reputation as a charismatic preacher who brought stories of heroism (a favourite theme was the blood of martyrs smelling of musk) from the battlefield and inspired mujahideen with inimitable sermons. He was a consummate networker. This jihadi equivalent of Che Guevara attracted admiration from Muslims around the world, including the pop star Cat Stevens, AKA Yusuf Islam.</p> <p>Azzam\u2019s own death (\u201cthe biggest murder mystery in the history of jihadism\u201d) in a bombing in Peshawar, Hegghammer attributes to Pakistani or Afghan intelligence \u2013 rather than to al-Qaida, the CIA, the KGB or Israel\u2019s Mossad \u2013 the list of possible suspects proving the extent of Sheikh Abdallah\u2019s influence. <em>The Caravan</em> deals with a highly sensitive and controversial subject, but it is evidence-based, meticulous and full of carefully judged distinctions \u2013 recent history at its finest.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Caravan</em> by Thomas Hegghammer is published by Cambridge University Press (\u00a324.99).

  "<p>Frankly, I am having rather a good lockdown. Partly this is because I live very rurally \u2013 Dumfries and Galloway, in south-west Scotland, has an exceptionally low population density (about 60 people per square mile compared to the UK average of 727). Social distancing is a great deal easier and less stressful where there are so many fewer people. In addition, almost everyone who lives up my single track road works in agriculture and is therefore an essential worker and not in lockdown. Life is pretty \u201cnormal\u201d in a daily sense. And we have a strong sense of community cohesion and care. Within 24 hours of the lockdown our \u201cresilience hub\u201d had been established; because I am over 70 my shopping is done for me and delivered, my neighbours keep an eye out for me. I feel both safe and undisturbed.</p> <p>Moreover, after about the dreariest, wettest three months I can remember, we have been enjoying an extraordinary and glorious spring. The absence of traffic, both on the roads and in the sky, mean not just a wonderful quiet peacefulness but also a massive improvement in air quality. This combination of sunshine, hush and low pollution has increased birdsong \u2013 the other day I actually found myself irritated by the incessant repetitious carry-on of a cuckoo \u2013 and very possibly both wild flowers and butterflies. In addition we have had a good lambing and there can be few hearts not cheered by the enchanting gambolling of new black-faced hill lambs.</p> <p>However, the most important reason I am enjoying lockdown, I believe, is that I am used to being alone. I am practised in silence and solitude. I have lived on my own for nearly 30 years \u2013 12 of them in this upland glen where I built my own single-person home on the ruins of an ancient steading. And I can say with authority that it is simply not the case that solitude is inevitably bad for your mental health.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why is 'go to your room' always a punishment? How much better for the struggling parent to make it a reward</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every time I go online I encounter yet more panic about how lockdown is going to drive us all mad. Depression apparently lurks in solitude and we need to take unbelievable care of ourselves if we hope to emerge from all this with any sanity or wellbeing intact. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/17/choosing-to-be-on-your-own\">solitude and loneliness are two very different things</a>: the first example of the use of the word solitude given on my pre-pandemic online dictionary is \u201cshe savoured her hours of freedom and solitude\u201d. That does not sound too bad.</p> <p>What has happened to Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cbliss of solitude\u201d? To the cheerful, sane humour of the third-century desert hermits? To individuals like Bernard Moitessier, the solo yachtsman who, rounding Cape Horn in a strong position to win the first Golden Globe race in 1968, decided it would be more fun to sail on, back round the Cape of Good Hope a second time and into the Pacific again; or Tenzin Palmo, the UK-born Buddhist nun, who spent 12 years alone in a cave in the Himalayas? Why should being alone undermine mental health, wellbeing and contentment? There is I believe a strange cultural confusion here. Although we consider <em>Homo sapiens</em> to be an inherently \u201csocial species\u201d \u2013 our primary creation myth (The Book of Genesis) taught that \u201cit was not good for man to be alone\u201d \u2013 we nonetheless put in an extraordinary amount of time teaching children to be sociable. \u201cDon\u2019t bite\u201d, \u201cplay nicely\u201d, \u201cgames are more fun if you keep the rules\u201d. We send them to nursery partly so they can learn to interact with their peers; we are angry with them if they are rude and we supervise them with an almost bizarre degree of anxiety. \u201cStranger danger\u201d dictates their freedoms, although in fact, except for 1996 \u2013 the year of Dunblane, when the 16 murdered children were in school under the safest possible supervision \u2013 the number of children murdered or assaulted by strangers has been pretty much static since the 1950s. (And 80% of children who are murdered are killed in their own homes by a family member, usually a parent; the figures for sexual abuse are also highest in the home and most likely to be committed by someone the child knows.)</p> <p>Meanwhile we give them no training or support in the apparently difficult and \u201cunnatural\u201d skill of being alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43953b8faa19fb185417cb041c00f5d9d26913e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43953b8faa19fb185417cb041c00f5d9d26913e4/0_138_2000_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tarras Valley, Dumfries and Galloway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tarras Valley, Dumfries and Galloway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hutton/The Langholm Initiative/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How much better it would be for the struggling parent to make it a reward for virtue \u2013 \u201cYou have been so helpful/ good/ polite/whatever all afternoon, now you can go to your room and be alone for a bit as a treat\u201d \u2013 and never a punishment. The \u201cepidemic of loneliness\u201d we hear so much about in the early 21st century might well become a \u201cjoy of solitude\u201d if it was experienced as a positive and earned pleasure from early childhood.</p> <p>There is a good if odd little example of how our terror of children being alone is warping our sensitivity to their needs in Richard Louv\u2019s wonderful 2005 book <em> </em><em>Last Child in the Woods</em><em>.</em> He argues persuasively that \u201cnature deprivation\u201d is seriously damaging to young people and almost boasts that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/05/nature-deficit-disorder-richard-louv\">lets his children go into the woods without adults</a> \u2013 and then adds \u201cso long as they have their mobile phones with them\u201d. If we took this seriously it would suggest that almost everyone over about 50 had been placed at serious risk by their parents.</p> <p>My children\u2019s father did a sweet thing when they were very little. As we went to bed he used to place an unexpected toy in the cot with them so that when they woke up they would have a treat and something to do with and by themselves. Part of the hope of course was that we might get an extra minute or two of sleep, but it was also so that they could learn that being alone could be fun and exciting.</p> <p>The thing is that, quite apart from Covid-19, young people are increasingly going to need the skills of being alone happily; between 1999 and 2019 <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2019#in-2019-there-were-82-million-people-living-alone\">the number of adults living in single-person households</a> rose by nearly a quarter, from 6.8 million to 8.2 million and is projected to go on rising. It would be tragic if all these individuals were doomed to poor mental health and loneliness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"474d40e8e4ece8e67dfc3258c2d5c1212378a93c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/474d40e8e4ece8e67dfc3258c2d5c1212378a93c/0_145_4368_2622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Maitland at the Back Hill of Bush Bothy, Galloway Forest Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sara Maitland at the Back Hill of Bush Bothy, Galloway Forest Park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Lee/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What if, instead of a huge disadvantage, being alone were framed as an opportunity for developing the self? Solitude seems to be more or less a necessity for creativity, for instance, whether it is drawing, painting, writing, learning an instrument, cooking or any other kind of creative activity. It is also very useful for anyone wanting to deepen their spirituality \u2013 this is why both Christians and Buddhists encourage retreats: periods of chosen isolation and usually silence.</p> <p>I believe that in order to see well, and particularly to see wild nature, you need to be comfortable within your own solitude. Almost all good field naturalists would agree that both the silence and the patience needed are enhanced when you walk or sit by yourself; there is a particular quality of attentiveness (which may in fact be similar to that needed for creativity) which the presence of someone else can too easily dissipate.</p> <p>We know too that practised solitude increases self-knowledge and independence. And this makes us less vulnerable to emotional abuse and more able to remove ourselves from such situations. And this in itself may well make us a better, because less needy, friend when we do engage.</p> <p>Spending time alone is in fact spending time with the person you know best of all and who knows you better than anyone else does. Solitude deepens self-knowledge. Interestingly, the words \u201csolitude\u201d and \u201cloneliness\u201d ought to have similar meanings: \u201csolo\u201d and \u201calone\u201d do after all. But faced with courage and determination they do not.</p> <p>Loneliness is a negative, sad feeling. Solitude on the other hand is bliss. And practice makes perfect. So practise.</p> <p><em>Sara Maitland is the author of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/16/biography-book-silence-sara-maitland\"> A Book of Silence</a> (Granta, \u00a39.99) and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-be-alone-9780230768086.html\">How To Be Alone</a> (Macmillan \u00a38.99)</em></p>",
  "<p>Home to some 400 galleries and an estimated 8,000 artists, Berlin has long aspired to be what its politicians call the cultural capital of Europe.</p> <p>Yet in the coming year, thousands of works by artists including Joseph Beuys, Louise Bourgeois, Bruce Nauman and Gerhard Richter are set to vanish from its galleries, as the city debates what lengths it should go to to protect art collectors from the sharp edge of a property boom.</p> <p>Last month, the Hamburger Bahnhof museum for contemporary art announced that Switzerland-based Friedrich Christian Flick would <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/berlin-museums-announce-painful-end-to-flick-collection-loan\">withdraw his collection</a> of 2,500 modern artworks and take them back to Zurich by September 2021, following a dispute over the Rieckhallen, the hangar-like annex that houses his works.</p> <p>Last week, the me Collectors Room in the centre of Berlin, showcasing a private collection of works by Cindy Sherman, Marlene Dumas, Georg Baselitz and others, announced that <a href=\"https://www.artatberlin.com/en/me-collectors-room-berlin-closes-permanently/\">permanent closure</a> would follow a coronavirus-related shutdown. </p> <p>Its owner, Thomas Olbricht, the heir to the Wella hair-products company, said his decision to relocate back to his hometown of Essen was personal rather than political, though the building on Auguststrasse, housing luxury apartments as well as the gallery, will have been affected by the <a

<p>Berlin\u2019s ambition to match the artistic standing of New York, London or Los Angeles had already been tarnished last December when it was announced that Art Berlin, the city\u2019s foremost contemporary art fair, would be <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/art-berlin-fair-is-canceled-1728969\">discontinued</a> amid financial problems.</p> <p>Berlin\u2019s media apportion the blame for these losses to the indifference of the city\u2019s senate. \u201cBerlin can act as if it is so incredibly dumb,\u201d wrote the listings magazine <em>Tip Berlin</em>. \u201cSo dumb that three art

Stoschek let it be known that it wasn\u2019t so much the imminent rent increase that had frustrated her as the lack of an invitation to find creative solutions, for example by integrating her collection into one of the state\u2019s museums.</p> <p>\u201cNot being the competent authority doesn\u2019t excuse you from feeling responsible for something,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>For some administrators in Berlin\u2019s local coalition government, where the culture sector has since December 2016 been in the hands of leftwing party Die Linke, declining

the darkest chapter of German history. Flick\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich, was sentenced as a war criminal during the Nuremberg trials for the use of slave labour in his mines and factories. Stoschek\u2019s great-grandfather was a member of the Nazi party and his company played an important role in the production of war materials.</p> <p>In Berlin, which has a surplus of artists producing works but a shortage of collectors to buy them, even old money with a problematic past was once eagerly courted by Klaus Wowereit, the city\u2019s mayor from 2001 to 2014.</p> <p>Under the new leftwing Berlin culture senator, Klaus Lederer, the mood has changed, collectors complain. But can they legitimately expect the state to protect them from a property market that is also edging out other, less well-funded cultural institutions, especially as Covid-19 threatens livelihoods across the arts?</p> <p>The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which runs the Hamburger Bahnhof museum, has been eager to be diplomatic as it parts ways with Flick. But the manner in which the patron announced his departure, in the middle of a global pandemic, has left some in the city disappointed.</p> <p>The Rieckhallen annex to the museum that houses Flick\u2019s collection stretches across a plot owned by the Austrian real estate company CA Immo, which wants to expand its \u201cEuropacity\u201d complex of high-rise offices and residences and has ruled out selling the land back to the state.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2020 because an earlier version referred to Flick, Olbricht and Stoschek as \u201cheirs to industrial fortunes amassed in the south-western parts of the country\u201d. This has been changed to refer simply to \u201coutside Berlin\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>If Boris Johnson is mishandling the pandemic, he is not alone. Falsely claiming everything is under control, dodging responsibility, hiding from public view, exploiting the crisis for political gain, mounting artificial distractions and blaming the media: these are common behaviour patterns exhibited by some of the world\u2019s most powerful \u2013 and shifty \u2013 leaders.</p> <p>Will they pay a price for their lethal incompetence and cynicism? It\u2019s possible some will, though it may take a while. The pandemic is changing political calculations around the globe. Leaders who looked invulnerable suddenly appear less so. That in turn could shift the strategic calculus and alter the balance of power between countries in ways both unexpected and permanent.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s performance is a lesson in how not to handle an emergency. It may become a compulsory case study for future students of crisis management. Trump minimised the threat early on, offered phoney assurances, and failed to make a plan. He has since accused China of <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-13/coronavirus-donald-trump-accuses-china-of-unleashing-a-plague-upon-the-world/\">deliberately spreading \u201cplague\u201d</a> while weaponising the crisis to smear his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.</p> <p>The president\u2019s myriad character flaws need no rehearsal here. But it seems a desperate Trump will stop at nothing to re-boot his re-election prospects. If that means fomenting a cold war with China, or stoking racial divisions and anti-migrant, anti-Muslim bias, he\u2019s up for it. And if all that fails, he may try to delay November\u2019s election, a scenario <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/us/politics/kushner-election-november.html\">not ruled out</a> by his sycophantic son-in-law.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Putin\u2019s decision to shield himself from harm has badly dented his image as fearless tough-guy leader</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coronavirus has made a sort of leper of Trump.

In such ways does a leader\u2019s power erode and slip away.</p> <p>Other politicians are showing a degree of reckless insouciance that makes Boris Johnson look positively switched on by comparison. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro hit a new low for irresponsibility by ridiculing public protection measures. Brazil has the highest Covid death rate in Latin America.

A structurally fragile economy, a hollowed-out civil society and media, and a climate of fear created by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have not proved conducive to a unified national effort \u2013 leading analysts to suggest the sultan-president\u2019s reign may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/coronavirus-leaves-turkeys-president-with-nobody-else-to-blame\">drawing to a close</a>.</p> <p>Majority Kurdish areas in eastern Turkey, for example, the scene of frequent conflict with the central government, have reportedly been hard hit.

  "<p>The striking plot of one of Agatha Christie\u2019s best-known mysteries, <em>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</em>, surprises each new generation of readers. But now there is a further twist in the tale. Fresh evidence suggests Christie may have taken the idea from an acclaimed Norwegian author.</p> <p>Lucy Moffatt, a British translator living in Norway, has found a likely source for the famous solution to the murder in an early English magazine translation of Stein Riverton\u2019s story<em> Jernvognen</em> (<em>The Iron Chariot</em>).</p> <p>\u201cYou do have to wonder if her book was at least influenced by Riverton\u2019s mystery,\u201d said Moffatt.</p> <p>Christie\u2019s book, published in 1926, swiftly established itself as a classic of the genre.

It ran for just six months between 1923 and 1924 before it merged with the<em> Sovereign Magazine</em>, but Moffatt tracked down a rare copy in the British Library.</p> <p>\u201cThey obviously like a good mystery too,\u201d said Moffatt. \u201cMy contact there, Brian Sherwood, was able to tell me that the April 1924 edition of <em>Tip Top Stories </em>contained a translation of the Riverton story.\u201d</p> <p>Now Moffatt sees a clear chain of probability linking Christie with <em>The Iron Chariot</em>. \u201cWe do not claim this is conclusive proof that Christie \u2018borrowed\u2019 the idea for <em>Roger Ackroyd</em>,\u201d said a spokesperson from Lightning Books, the publisher of Moffatt\u2019s recent translation, adding that Christie herself was always suspicious of coincidences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9db7dc9d3426e1faf88c75064d8e7ca538ebe816\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9db7dc9d3426e1faf88c75064d8e7ca538ebe816/24_61_1053_1315/801.jpg\" alt=\"Sven Elvestad, who published crime fiction under the pen name of Stein Riverton.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sven Elvestad, who published crime fiction under the pen name of Stein Riverton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oslo Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are already two acknowledged sources of inspiration for <em>Roger Ackroyd</em>. In later life, Christie wrote to thank Lord Mountbatten for suggesting she make the storyteller the culprit in her next book. In the same letter, she said her brother-in-law, James, had come up with the same ruse.</p> <p>\u201cMight Christie have also read or been aware of the Riverton story?\u201d asked Moffatt. \u201cWell, the timing is extremely convenient, and she did publish a short story under the pen name of Mary Westmacott in the <em>Sovereign Magazine</em> in January 1926.\u201d</p> <p>Prichard is wary of any \u201cpatronising\u201d implication that his great-grandmother needed men to come up with plotlines for her. And anyway, he argues, it is not the idea that makes a good book, but the execution. \u201cIt is possible she read it, as she read a lot, but it is also possible she didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Riverton was the pen name of Kristoffer Elvestad Svendsen. In his youth, he changed his name to Sven Elvestad and became a journalist, before switching to writing crime fiction in 1904.</p> <p>For Moffatt, a Christie fan, the power of Riverton\u2019s book lies in its sinister handling of the environment, which mirrors the killer\u2019s disturbed state of mind. \u201cIt is more of a study of madness,\u201d she said, \u201cIt uses the landscape as metaphor, while Christie sticks to a smaller canvas.\u201d</p>",

These were government debt levels to be avoided rather than emulated. Italy saw its debts increase beyond 130% of GDP, and Greece suffered a sudden increase in sovereign debts to 183% of GDP.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even the architects of austerity agree almost-zero borrowing costs and low inflation give the Treasury an opportunity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, the panic is much closer to home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\" title=\"\">A Treasury memo</a> leaked last week showed that there is concern in some quarters at the escalating costs of fighting the coronavirus.</p> <p>The alarm raised by the document\u2019s anonymous authors was that, far from being a one-off financial hit, the coronavirus pandemic will cause the economy lasting harm and the debts built up during the crisis will, at least to some extent, recur in subsequent years.</p> <p>Taking this argument a step further, the authors reverted to a Treasury mindset \u2013 one dating back hundreds of years that stresses the need for prudence and repeats the calls that followed 2008 for spending cuts and tax rises to begin the process of balancing the books.</p> <p>The memo argued that a public sector wage freeze could save about \u00a36.5bn by 2023-24. The Conservative government\u2019s \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, made before the election, would need to be ditched, along with its promise to protect the state pension.</p> <p>There is another option though, one that George Osborne considered far too risky 10 years ago. That it is to live with a high level of government debt and focus on expanding the economy.</p> <p>Thankfully, we have a chancellor who has suggested he would prefer enlarging the economy as the primary means of cutting the deficit.</p> <p>Without hesitation, Sunak publicly rejected a return to austerity, telling parliament that the government\u2019s \u201clevelling-up\u201d agenda would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates\" title=\"\">take priority</a>. \u201cIndeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This will not be an easy task. In the short term, the government has to find a way to restart the economy without sparking a return of the disease. Then it must begin the task of identifying how public investment can support the industries that can accelerate quickly out of the crisis, and not just those that are in need of rescuing.</p> <p>There will be many challenges, not least from a health and social care crisis that is likely to persist, even as both sectors attempt to get back to normal.</p> <p>A levelling-up agenda that favours the regions and nations of the UK beyond London and south-east will take time, and will also need to focus on green growth so that the cuts in carbon emissions seen over the past few months are not thrown away.</p> <p>One advantage the chancellor has over his predecessors is a consensus among economists of all persuasions that this time is different and the level of debt he finds himself with next year will be irrelevant.</p> <p>Even the architects of post-2008 austerity agree that almost-zero borrowing costs and low inflation give the Treasury an opportunity to use the instruments of the state to drive growth while large parts of the private sector are fighting to recover.

  "<p>Did almost dying change Boris Johnson?

There was no way, surely, that Boris Johnson was going to wake up and find himself transformed, as in a horror film, into Boris Johnson.</p> <p> A few signs <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ten-zen-questions/202005/covid-19-near-death-experiences-and-boris-johnson\">suggested </a>that the prime minister might, like near-death cases cited by the psychologist, Susan Blackmore, really emerge with changed priorities, with something at least resembling empathy. In his first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">bulletin</a>, Johnson did appear, if not exactly the recovered Beethoven, then a bit more, some thought, like Coleridge\u2019s traumatised Wedding Guest, \u201ca sadder and a wiser man/ he rose the morrow morn\u201d.</p> <p>In a video he said the NHS was \u201cpowered by love\u201d. One reviewer thought this resurrection message the finest speech he\u2019d delivered: \u201cThe glibness and bluster had been replaced by a hard-earned sincerity.\u201d It was in his next speech that a recovering Johnson alluded to \u201cour apparent success\u201d, to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/muggers-and-invisible-enemies-how-boris-johnsons-metaphors-reveals-his-thinking\">an unexpected and invisible mugger</a>\u201d that, following his mighty example, we will \u201cwrestle to the floor\u201d.</p> <p>After pausing to add another child to his collection, Johnson could still convince a <em>Sun</em> <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11535369/boris-johnson-on-fight-against-coronavirus/\">interviewer </a>that he\u2019d become a different, \u201cmuch more complex figure\u201d. The face of the new Boris \u2013 \u201cBoris 2.0\u201d \u2013 betrayed, the paper\u2019s David Wooding said, \u201ca mixture of terror, exhaustion and joy. But most of all relief\u201d.</p> <p>Or was it indigestion? Supposing his hard-won improvements did happen, they had, by the time new improved Johnson recorded his \u201cstay alert\u201d address, and related routines, vanished \u2013 perhaps into the same black hole containing the daily briefing\u2019s international death comparisons.</p> <p>True, whether it\u2019s the result of some infernal deathbed bargain or emulation of Mao\u2019s <a href=\"http://100photos.time.com/photos/charman-mao-swims-yangtze\">swim in the Yangtze</a>, he has a new morning routine, processing around St James\u2019s Park with a coffee cup. But if the reborn Johnson no longer attempts virus gags like \u201csquashing the sombrero\u201d, his post-recovery sensitivity still allows him a regular reminder that is possibly more insulting to many thousands of bereaved people, and more revealing of his unmodified emotional illiteracy: that this could have been a proper, bona fide catastrophe. Imagine, goes this Villanelle-style reasoning, if he\u2019d done nothing. We\u2019re actually lucky so many of us are still alive!</p> <p>Perhaps buoyed by this happy thought, Johnson dumped, at last week\u2019s briefing, the expression of sympathy that conventionally separates the latest death toll from chart-strewn attempts to detach ministers from any conceivable responsibility.</p> <p>On his current form, then, it is hard to argue with the actress Miriam Margolyes\u2019 diagnosis, that when Johnson recovered, \u201che didn\u2019t get better as a human being\u201d. That her prefatory remark \u2013 she\u2019d managed to suppress a wish for him to die \u2013 provoked countless complaints, confirmed that the public likes to see, at least from her sex, a performance of compassion. Which in turn underlines Johnson\u2019s achievement in normalising a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/boris-johnson-accused-of-outrageous-lack-of-concern-about-floods\">long-evident empathy deficit</a>.</p> <p>He may have benefited, given his proud history of not giving a toss, from the scholarly backlash against depictions of empathy as a critical human quality. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review\">Against </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review\">Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion</a></em>, Paul Bloom argued that over-identification with other people\u2019s suffering could actually impair judgment. But it\u2019s notable that Johnson\u2019s predecessor was not forgiven \u2013 like Thatcher \u2013 an early diagnosis of coldness. As with so many of the prime minister\u2019s qualities, from greed to idleness, that would be impermissible in Doris Johnson \u2013 as I like to think of his female doppelg\u00e4nger \u2013 an empathy deficit was, in Theresa May, to be virtually her <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/knock-knock-who-was-that-prime-minister-g66x5xsbx\">epitaph</a>. \u201cThe same tests,\u201d she has mildly <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/15/theresa-may-says-women-either-seen-weak-robotic/\">pointed out</a>, \u201care not applied to men.\u201d What makes Luke Jennings\u2019 Villanelle extraordinary is not so much absence of empathy \u2013 Patricia Highsmith\u2019s Ripley went there a while back \u2013 but its absence in a woman.</p> <p>After May\u2019s historic difficulties at Grenfell, nobody protested, as they might reasonably have done, that an inadequately empathetic politician might have compensatory qualities including, say, decency, fairness, honesty, diligence, respect, an ability to compromise. But what if, even as a male leader, you possess none of those qualities either? Then empathy might be a saving grace.</p> <p>If Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit hubris, idiot exceptionalism, economic priorities and habitual negligence help account, as has been suggested, for his ignoring warnings and delaying action on the pandemic, his stunted awareness of others may have contributed to this initial inclination to do sod all to help them, and a subsequent struggle to communicate. Even as he <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020\">explained </a>the lockdown on 23 March, it was beyond him, or his aides, to convey anything resembling togetherness. Johnson: \u201cThe way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Compare <a href=\"https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/angelamerkelcoronavirusaddresstonation.htm\">Angela Merkel</a>: \u201cThese are not just abstract numbers in statistics, but this is about a father or grandfather, a mother or grandmother, a partner \u2013 this is about people.

Instead, presumably guided by Dominic Cummings (whose <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-ten-days-that-shook-britain-and-changed-the-nation-for-ever-spz6sc9vb\">reported</a> \u201cif that means some pensioners die, too bad\u201d has yet to be withdrawn by the <em>Sunday Times</em>), this struggling pathocracy <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/boris-johnson-explains-uks-core-17981539\">recited lines </a>it was assured sounded human: \u201cThe government is putting its arms around every single worker.\u201d</p> <p>In the Commons, Johnson does not just collapse intellectually under Keir Starmer\u2019s interrogations, he reveals, blustering back, the emotional void that accompanies his incompetence.

  "<p>The plan for children to start returning to school in England has caused much debate about safety. Understandably, parents and teachers are worried about what this will mean for risk to children, and teachers are justifiably concerned about risk to themselves. <br>I\u2019m a hospital paediatrician who has been looking after children and young people with Covid-19, and have seen children unwell with it (including the small group with the widely reported systematic inflammatory syndrome). I also have responsibility for the mental health of children, and work in child protection. Finally, I am a parent of three children.</p> <p>When the UK went into lockdown, closing schools made some sense, based on the concern that children might be key drivers of infection in the population, as for other viruses like influenza. We also didn\u2019t know how children might be affected by the infection. But even then, many professionals working with children were very worried about the relative risk of them <em>not</em> being in school.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t stay like that for ever. The challenge for everyone though is imprecision and uncertainty. When is it safe to go back, and what are the risks? It\u2019s likely no one is going to be able to give a firm answer for some time, so it is about balancing knowns and unknowns.</p> <p>What we know about COVID-19 infections in children and young people is a patch-work story. Studies from where there has been more mass population testing for coronavirus have reported smaller amounts of infections in children. On Friday however, the ONS published data on screening for coronavirus infection in 10,000 households in England using nose and throat swabs. They found no difference in numbers with positive tests between children (2-19 years) and other age groups. We should be cautious: of 10,705 people tested, only 33 people actually tested positive, and these numbers are quite small to compare between ages.</p> <p>Another key area of discussion has been how much children spread the infection. Some studies have found evidence for reduced passing on of the infection in children. But we should also be cautious about this. Children may still have the infection but show no signs of it which makes their infection and spread difficult to monitor. This all means that there is a need for more widespread testing, and this may well take a long time. There is no current evidence that children spread it more readily than adults.</p> <p>I find myself coming back to the same question. Are we thinking about this the wrong way round \u2013 is it not more risky instead to keep our children at home? We know that children get Covid. I\u2019ve seen it. But it is perhaps one of the observations of greatest certainties in the numbers from all of this that the vast majority of children who show signs of the infection have it mildly. Even the widely reported Covid syndrome of inflammation is rare. Unlike adults, deaths globally in children and young people with Covid have been rare, even in those with underlying health conditions like cancer.</p> <p>Contrast this with what we already know about the health of children and young people before this. Over a quarter of child deaths in children and young people in England have modifiable factors such as family environment and access to services involved. On average, one child under 15 is killed every week \u2013 most commonly by a parent and almost always by someone they know.</p> <p>Many children and their families are under significant pressure in their family environments during lockdown and we know that access to health and social care has dropped. Schools are a vital part of the provision of safeguarding children and families, after all around 20% of social service referrals come from schools. Then there is their mental health: 1 in 8 children has a mental health disorder. Rates are higher where families are struggling. A quarter of of young women aged 17-19 have a mental health disorder, and half of them have attempted suicide of self-harm. My colleagues and I have been seeing mental health crisis presentations linked to the effects of lock-down.</p> <p>Schools play such an important role in the wellbeing of all children and young people \u2013 so much so that new emphasis on early intervention and treatment of mental health in school was a key part of the NHS Long Term Plan.But the importance of school, and their teachers, is not just for vulnerable children. As much as they try, all parents \u2013 including my wife and I \u2013 cannot educate as well as schools. Whilst for a short period that might have small influence for some, for many children this is potentially a disaster. The negative effects of adverse social determinants of health in children, in particular education, is well established. Children carry the effects on their physical and mental health throughout their lives, and as such childhood and adolescence are key windows for many life outcomes Right now, that gap is almost certainly widening with effects for many years to come.</p> <p>There are of course myriad challenges to a return to school \u2013 like socially isolating children, and the risk of the adults who bring them to school interacting. The return has to be staged and monitored, and if necessary, pulled back. Those who are vulnerable from health conditions and those shielding should remain protected. One of the important stories of the pandemic in the UK will be those of the groups with quietest voices \u2013 and that includes very elderly and children. We find ourselves as individuals and as a society having to make decisions without exact certainty on what the best thing is for children. On balance, in my view, that is a structured return to school for children, and that goes for mine too.</p> <p><em>Lee Hudson is consultant paediatrician and chief of mental health at Great Ormond Street</em></p>",
  "<p>One effect of the unprecedented socioeconomic impact of Covid-19 has been to catapult the secretary of state for health and social care to the forefront of British politics. For the long month of April, with the prime minister either in intensive care with the disease or recuperating in isolation, there was no one with a more prominent government profile than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\">Matt Hancock</a>.</p> <p>It was, to say the least, an unusual predicament for a health secretary. Since the controversy around the target of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests and Boris Johnson\u2019s return to work, Hancock has taken a small step back from the limelight. But if, in the final analysis, he is adjudged to have had a good pandemic, he could well be seen as a leader in waiting.</p> <p>On the other hand, if the UK\u2019s death count ends up the highest in Europe, as it currently stands, and the reports continue to mount of shortages in protective clothing and problems with testing and tracing, then history\u2019s equivalent of a surgical waste bin may well await him.</p> <p>Glory or infamy \u2013 those are the grand stakes in this unparalleled peacetime civil operation. Yet any halfway ambitious politician would relish the chance to be in Hancock\u2019s shoes right now. And it\u2019s rare that that can be said about the occupant of his office.</p> <p>Come the casino hour of our parliamentary system \u2013 the cabinet reshuffle \u2013 very few politicians entering No 10 hope to be named health secretary. It\u2019s a post with no visible upside. When anything goes wrong in health, someone usually dies. And things always go wrong. On top of which, the terrain is knee-deep in well-organised interest groups, all demanding more of everything.</p> <p>A widespread wariness about the job was most memorably captured in the response of the pugnacious Labour politician John Reid when appointed in 2003 by Tony Blair. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d he\u2019s supposed to have said, \u201cnot health.\u201d</p> <p>Kenneth Clarke, who was health secretary in the last couple of years of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s premiership, says that over the years he has issued a warning to various successors, both Labour and Conservative: \u201cYou\u2019re going to a political graveyard. If you can survive it, then you\u2019re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke describes the role as one of constant bombardment, unrelenting demands to do what others say, ceaseless criticism in the press, from opposition and interest groups, repeated declarations of a crisis and almost universal unpopularity, including among your cabinet colleagues. It sounds, I say, like the job from hell.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was just immense fun,\u201d says Clarke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c05dbe61b279a45ad9ba40bcecf4fb74e43b8dbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c05dbe61b279a45ad9ba40bcecf4fb74e43b8dbf/0_115_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock giving the government\u2019s daily press briefing on 1 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A post with no visible upsides\u2019: Matt Hancock giving the government\u2019s daily press briefing on 1 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s not being ironic. He really did savour the challenge. The key thing, he says, is that you have to be prepared to \u201croll your sleeves up and defend yourself\u201d. If that conjures up an image of the health secretary working in a bare-knuckle boxing ring rather than a government department, then Norman Fowler makes a similar observation. \u201cIn my day,\u201d he says, \u201cthe most important quality [of a health secretary] was an ability to fight your corner in the public spending battles.\u201d</p> <p>As a belligerent spirit was the signature style of the first modern health secretary, Aneurin Bevan, perhaps it should be no surprise that, like ministerial red boxes, it has become part of the job description. The machismo might explain why the health ministry has been largely a male preserve. There have only been three female health secretaries, beginning in 1974 with Barbara Castle, who, it must be said, was no shrinking violet. (Virginia Bottomley and Patricia Hewitt were approached for this piece, but both declined to speak.)</p> <p>Although there has been some kind of minister for health dating back to the mid-19th century, it was not until a hundred years later, and the arrival in 1945 of Bevan, that the role we recognise today first took shape. A former miner who left school at 13, Bevan was a renowned political bruiser who drove through the National Health Service Act with unyielding determination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you can survive it, then you\u2019re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Kenneth Clarke</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He had to overcome opposition from his own Labour benches as well as from within the Conservative party and the British Medical Association (BMA), whose members disparaged him as the \u201cTito of Tonypandy\u201d. But facing down his opponents, Bevan created a free-at-the-point-of-delivery health service for all, one that opened its doors on 5 July 1948. By the time he died 12 years after the NHS\u2019s birth, Bevan had become a national hero.</p> <p>That can\u2019t be said of any of his often unloved successors, although each of them has played a part in developing an NHS that has grown far beyond what Bevan envisaged.</p> <p>\u201cThe budget was \u00a3200m the year Nye Bevan introduced the NHS,\u201d says Alan Johnson, health secretary under Gordon Brown. \u201cIt was \u00a3110 bn when I left the job.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d81087ac43f2219b2d87143c02597efc62fe1a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d81087ac43f2219b2d87143c02597efc62fe1a9/0_236_4051_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nye Bevan talks to constituents during the 1951 general election campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nye Bevan talks to constituents during the 1951 general election campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Konig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is currently <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/nhs-budget\">\u00a3140</a><a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/nhs-budget\">bn</a>. Even accounting for inflation, that\u2019s an extraordinary increase; yet whatever the figure, it\u2019s never enough. The NHS is the fifth-largest employer in the world. It\u2019s a gargantuan operation that necessarily contains large inefficiencies and daunting shortages. But we pay less per head of population for our health system than any other major western nation.</p> <p>That\u2019s one reason the NHS is perennially viewed as underfunded \u2013 even though health is about the only government department whose budget has never been cut. Nearly all governments are accused of shortchanging the NHS, but in particular Conservatives, who have traditionally been seen as, at best, reluctant supporters of the NHS, and more often as would-be privatisers.</p> <p>All the Conservative former health secretaries I spoke to think this accusation is unfair and inaccurate, and bemoan the fact that they had to spend rather too much time in office contesting a falsehood. Nonetheless, Margaret Thatcher was once keen to see the UK adopt a US-style private insurance-funded health service. And from time to time, a Conservative thinktank or backbench ideologue will revisit the proposal, to keep the dream alive.</p> <p>Fowler, who served as health secretary for six years under Thatcher, accepts these points. \u201cBut,\u201d he protests, \u201cthe significant thing is that those ideas have never got anywhere. And if they didn\u2019t get anywhere under Margaret Thatcher, they\u2019re not likely to get anywhere under any other prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Hancock\u2019s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, complains that whatever he did in the job, he always faced the same charge of having a secret agenda.</p> <p>\u201cI was accused of starving the NHS of funds as a way of persuading the public that the only option was privatisation,\u201d he says. \u201cI then secured a \u00a320bn rise in budget and the very same people said on Twitter: \u2018Ah, he\u2019s fattening the NHS up for privatisation.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Conservative spending on health was limited for most of Hunt\u2019s time in office and during that of his predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrewlansley\">Andrew Lansley</a>, at least by comparison with the boom times of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In large part this was due to the austerity measures that the Coalition and Conservative governments imposed, following the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>Some critics have suggested that the shortfall in protective clothing for NHS staff witnessed in this pandemic is in part a legacy of underfunding during Hunt\u2019s tenure. \u201cI felt throughout my time as health secretary that it did need more resources,\u201d Hunt concedes. \u201cThere is more you can do on efficiency, but in the end only so much, and it needed more resources.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, while Hunt was still in office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/what-was-exercise-cygnus-and-what-did-it-find\">Exercise Cygnus</a> was conducted to test how the UK would respond to a pandemic. According to leaked sections of the report, which has never been published, it was found that the country was not ready to cope, particularly in the area of social care.</p> <p>Hunt still maintains that austerity was the right policy to put the economy back on its feet, but he adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want to minimise the fact that this was a very tough period for the NHS.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Best practice for managing coronavirus has been in Asia. We could have looked at Korea, Taiwan, Singapore</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Jeremy Hunt</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hunt is now chair of the Health and Social Care select committee, in which position he has questioned some of Hancock\u2019s decisions during the pandemic, such as prematurely discontinuing community testing. He\u2019s reluctant to put Hancock on the spot, but says the key concern is to ask if we\u2019re following the most effective international policy. \u201cIt\u2019s been very clear that international best practice for managing coronavirus has been in Asia. I think because China\u2019s totalitarian it was thought there was not much point looking too closely at what was happening there, because they can do things we could never do in a free society. But I think we could have looked at [South] Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, which are all democracies.\u201d</p> <p>One fan of Hunt\u2019s work on the health select committee is Alan Johnson. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job as chair,\u201d he says, which is probably not the verdict he would give on Hunt\u2019s time in office. Like Hunt, Johnson emphasises the drive to improve patient care as his biggest motivating factor when he was health secretary. He therefore had little time for those who perceived any outsourcing of services as backdoor privatisation. \u201cYou talk to people on the left and the job of the NHS is to employ public service workers,\u201d he says, shaking his head in our FaceTime call. \u201cNot to improve disgraceful waiting times.\u201d</p> <p>For all his modernising zeal, Johnson says the NHS\u2019s greatest strength is its old-fashioned social solidarity, a quality, be argues, that Conservatives don\u2019t really understand. \u201cIt\u2019s against all the philosophy they\u2019ve imbibed.\u201d The irony, then, is that social solidarity has never been more loudly promoted among Tories than by this current government. The NHS has been rebranded \u201cOur NHS\u201d, its workers hailed as national heroes, invoked at every turn by politicians and applauded every Thursday evening by the public. Although the form of expression is new, the sentiment is not. The NHS invariably features at the top of the list of institutions of which Britons feel most proud. The problem for health secretaries is that this national pride can manifest as an over-protectiveness \u2013 \u201cHands off the NHS\u201d \u2013 that leaves them limited room for manoeuvre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e166cf5765ad4de0d2e3c3a39fe2d507feb1795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e166cf5765ad4de0d2e3c3a39fe2d507feb1795/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurses protesting outside 10 Downing Street last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurses protesting outside 10 Downing Street last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As such, they often find themselves caught between contradictory instructions: improve the service and leave it alone. Fowler knows the syndrome well. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d he says, \u201cone of the most serious bursts of applause I\u2019ve ever had was when I was introduced at a conference of medical experts as the only secretary of state who didn\u2019t try to reorganise the health service.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke is less familiar with that kind of resounding applause. He embarked on a major overhaul of management, creating an internal market inspired in part, he says, by a need to head off Thatcher\u2019s more radical proposals. It led to a series of massive rows between the prime minister and her health secretary. \u201cSomeone once told me we had 14 meetings about it,\u201d he says, both amazed and amused by the number. \u201cShe was even more combative than I am. It was basically a bureaucratic shambles,\u201d he says of the service he set about reforming, \u201cas there was no proper management or control of the system.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of his own restructuring of the NHS, which he says has stood the test of time because no one has reversed it, Clarke doesn\u2019t think constant organisational reform is a good thing. \u201cThat must sound off coming from me. But you can\u2019t have every secretary of state going in for an upheaval like that.\u201d</p> <p>In a highly competitive field, perhaps the greatest upheaval was wrought by Andrew Lansley, David Cameron\u2019s first health secretary. He is the exemplar of a longstanding NHS paradox \u2013 decentralisation from above. The more he argued for local empowerment, the more he micromanaged the transition, bolstering GPs, creating Public Health England, abolishing primary care trusts and much else besides. The consensus among his fellow health secretaries is that the reforms were misjudged, confusing and unnecessary.</p> <p>\u201cI think Cameron thinks of [the Lansley reforms] as the biggest mistake he made,\u201d says Johnson, cunningly<strong> </strong>recruiting the former prime minister to make his point. A little more diplomatically, Clarke says that he\u2019s not convinced the reforms were \u201cthe main thing the health service needed\u201d. Andy Burnham, who took over from Johnson and then shadowed Lansley,<strong> </strong>suggests that many of the changes have subsequently been abandoned or ignored.</p> <p>If reorganisational exhaustion in the wake of Lansley dampened the appetite for re-envisioning the NHS, Covid-19 has removed it from the agenda for the foreseeable future. For all its terrible toll of death and devastation, a major pandemic is a clarifying experience. Suddenly, discussions about rationalising regional management structures are beside the point. There is instead a unity of purpose and a galvanising sense of clear battle lines. It\u2019s no coincidence that the most common political metaphors employed in the Covid-19 debate are military ones. Just as every defence secretary works to avoid war, but only really comes into his or her own when war breaks out, no health secretary wants a pandemic, and yet it\u2019s their career-defining moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42adc2b44045a942e149fdaf8c68f573274ff536\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42adc2b44045a942e149fdaf8c68f573274ff536/0_18_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A government Aids awareness campaign billboard, 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A government Aids awareness campaign billboard, 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ltd/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Fowler is remembered by some clinicians for his executive light touch, he is better known for his performance during the Aids crisis in the mid-1980s. It\u2019s easy to forget, amid the relentless news coverage of Covid-19, but HIV was a killer virus for which there was no treatment when it first came to light. It has since <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/\">killed tens of millions around the world</a>, though in the UK today, HIV is seldom fatal. Initially, it sparked enormous fear and stigmatisation, particularly of the gay community, which suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. But it was a period that Fowler looks back on with most professional and political satisfaction. \u201cThe whole health service worked together; no question, no arguments,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when it acts together it really is a wonderful service.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Don't Die of Ignorance campaign was criticised for being over the top\u2026 but 90% of the public agreed with it</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Norman Fowler</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is also another feature of pandemics that can bring the best out in politicians. As few, if any, health secretaries come from medical backgrounds, they usually find themselves deferring to clinical expertise. This is especially true in a pandemic. The difference is that the art of communication \u2013 the politician\u2019s area of expertise \u2013 also becomes increasingly important. In Fowler\u2019s case, he had the job of informing the public and reforming its behaviour \u2013 primarily, encouraging the use of condoms. Hence the government\u2019s bold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/04/how-we-made-dont-die-of-ignorance-aids-campaign\">advertising campaign \u201cDon\u2019t Die of Ignorance\u201d</a>, which grabbed the nation\u2019s anxious attention in 1987.</p> <p>\u201cThe campaign was criticised for being over the top, but the follow-up survey showed that over 90% of the public agreed with it,\u201d says Fowler.</p> <p>He also had to do battle with Thatcher, and some of his cabinet colleagues, who were either squeamish or positively damning about issues of gay sexual practice and intravenous drug use \u2013 the main conduits of HIV transmission in this country.</p> <p>\u201cI got totally frustrated in 1986,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a national crisis and I didn\u2019t think we were making the progress we should be making in a national crisis. I remember being asked: \u2018Do we have to have this section on risky sex?\u2019 The whole point of the advertisement was to explain to people why they should avoid what they called risky sex!\u201d</p> <p>Given the prime ministerial scrutiny he was under, I ask him whether it\u2019s at all liberating for a health secretary if your boss is, as Johnson recently was, out of commission. \u201cI never had that luxury,\u201d he laments. \u201cTheoretically, it\u2019s not an ideal circumstance.\u201d</p> <p>Fowler is not the only health secretary in living memory who faced a pandemic in office.</p> <p>\u201cI was three days into the job when a global pandemic was declared with swine flu,\u201d says Burnham, adding as a humorous aside: \u201cAs he exited the door, Mr Alan Johnson proved again that he\u2019s a master of political timing.\u201d Interestingly, Johnson recalls the pandemic as something that happened on his shift. \u201cWhat took up most of my time?\u201d he asks. \u201cWell, there was the pandemic, of course.\u201d</p> <p>In the event, regardless of who was in the hot seat, the H1N1 swine flu was not nearly as life-threatening as first feared. Some critics consequently suggested that the Labour government and the two health secretaries overreacted. But both men highlight the fact that a pandemic was top of the government risk register and they were well prepared to deal with it. Just as a flawed or under-resourced plan can leave a health secretary on the defensive, the more successful a strategy is, the less people get to see how bad things might have been. In a political sense it\u2019s a lose-lose situation.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt was kind of a fraught terrain in those early days of swine flu,\u201d remembers Burnham. \u201cI made mistakes wrestling with these issues and sometimes came down on the wrong side.\u201d He regrets putting the worst-case scenario statistics in the public domain \u2013 60,000 deaths were predicted at the upper end, but there were actually fewer than 500. He also recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/11/swine-flu-tamiflu-andrew-castle\">a \u201ccar crash\u201d TV interview with Andrew Castle</a>, whose daughter had had a seriously adverse<strong> </strong>reaction to Tamiflu, the prophylactic issued to children. \u201cI came away thinking, I\u2019m not the person to be defending Tamiflu on national television,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody will privatise the NHS now. It\u2019s finally entered into that sort of sacred space</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Andy Burnham</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His advice for Hancock is to resist the temptation to front the message too much on TV. Hunt, however, has only praise for what he says has been a strong communications campaign with a clear message \u2013 we spoke before the much-criticised change from \u201cstay home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d. That said, he believes a longer-term strategy should be clearly outlined. \u201cPeople need to understand how we\u2019re going to exit the current situation.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke picks out Hancock as a good performer among some less impressive government ministers, but he offers a word of caution directly to the young health secretary. \u201cMy advice to you will be, don\u2019t start giving forecasts when we\u2019re dealing with a total unknown here, and don\u2019t start making forecasts on testing.\u201d</p> <p>Several of the former health secretaries thought that Hancock made himself a hostage to fortune with his promise of reaching 100,000 coronavirus tests by the end of April. But all agree that it won\u2019t be until an inquiry is held after the crisis has passed that any worthwhile or lasting judgments can be made on the government\u2019s and Hancock\u2019s handling of the pandemic. In the meantime, Burnham thinks the best thing to come out of the crisis is that the NHS will no longer be under any kind of existential threat, real or imagined. \u201cNobody will privatise it now; nobody will introduce different funding models. It\u2019s finally entered into that sort of sacred space.\u201d<strong> </strong>He argues that social care provision should be folded into the NHS. While he\u2019s long supported this option, he says the case is irrefutable now the limitations of the social care system have been thoroughly exposed by Covid-19. \u201cHow can someone who is so essential that they are caring for another human being not be paid the living wage?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d</p> <p>There seems little doubt that social care is the neglected side of the portfolio in the Department of Health and Social Care, the unloved child forever in the shadow of its revered sibling. It would amount to a massive undertaking and significant investment to bring social care under the NHS umbrella. Whether or not it\u2019s something Hancock will consider, it\u2019s hard to believe that what Johnson<strong> </strong>calls the \u201cscandalous crisis in adult social care\u201d can be allowed to continue after the viral dust has settled.</p> <p>There have been no shortage of predictions \u2013 some wildly optimistic, others darkly ominous \u2013 about the post-Covid-19 world. The first task, obviously, is to make it a post-Covid-19 world, and in that endeavour the health secretary has a vital role to play. It\u2019s far too early to know what the outcome will look like, or when it will arrive, but perhaps we can tentatively suggest that in the next cabinet reshuffle the word on the health job won\u2019t be a four-letter one.</p> <h2>In brief: how was it for them?</h2> <h2><strong>Norman Fowler,</strong> Conservative, in post 1981\u20131987</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5dbb25cdb15cab903fa73f838373fc1d94afbdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5dbb25cdb15cab903fa73f838373fc1d94afbdf/0_398_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Fowler in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Fowler in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Key issue </strong> How to mount an Aids public awareness campaign.</p> <p><strong>Initial view of the post? </strong> \u201cI knew all the problems.

  "<p>Many workers unable to do their jobs from home filed nervously back into workplaces last week after Boris Johnson insisted they should return, and the government issued back-to-work guidance for previously dormant, non-essential sectors of the economy.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> spoke to four workers in different sectors about their first days back in the midst of a still raging global pandemic, which is much more likely to claim the lives of low-paid or manual workers than middle-class professionals, according to new Office for National Statistics data.</p> <p><strong>The cleaner</strong></p> <p>Lotlot Sosorria\u2019s journey to clean her first home in nearly two months was a nerve-racking ordeal.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s histrionic threat last week to \u201ccut off the whole relationship\u201d with China produced a scornful response from Beijing. \u201cSuch lunacy is a clear byproduct of the anxiety the US has suffered since China began its global ascent,\u201d the <em>Global Times</em>, the Chinese government\u2019s mouthpiece, <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188451.shtml\">commented</a>. The \u201cWashington elites\u201d were in a panic over the pandemic, it claimed.</p> <p>While the tone was unfortunate, neither assertion wholly lacked truth. The US and its western allies do have concerns \u2013 some legitimate, some exaggerated \u2013 about China\u2019s rise to superpower status. And the mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis by Trump, who appears increasingly unbalanced, makes China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, look undeservedly competent by comparison.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s threat, as foolish as it is impractical, typified the irrational behaviour of the US leader. <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/14/china-us-pandemic-economy-tensions-trump-coronavirus-covid-new-cold-war-economics-the-great-decoupling/\">His target was no surprise</a>. Trump and his \u201cAmerica first\u201d acolytes have long contended that China is ripping off America by indulging in unfair trade practices, stealing its commercial secrets and destroying manufacturing jobs.</p> <p>In current jargon, they want to \u201cdecouple\u201d, and this process \u2013 the Chinese call it \u201csuppression\u201d \u2013 is now accelerating. Higher tariffs on Chinese imports, and controls on hi-tech US exports and Chinese inward investment, were extended last week to include <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/trump-admin-tightens-screws-huawei-chip-sale-rule-200515160938651.html\">new measures </a>targeting the telecoms giant, Huawei. A compromise trade deal agreed earlier this year is in jeopardy.</p> <p>Fear and hostility towards outsiders, economic grievance and entitlement, and a powerful sense of American exceptionalism \u2013 all sentiments feeding the confrontation with China \u2013 are the building blocks of the rightwing nationalist, populist, quasi-racist coalition that Trump assembled in 2016. Beating this coalition of hate is 2020\u2019s election challenge.</p> <p>Given this context, it was entirely predictable Trump would try to distract attention from his coronavirus fiasco by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/five-eyes-network-contradicts-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-lab\">accusing Beijing </a>of exacerbating the crisis. With the polarised, amoral state of domestic politics, it was predictable, too, that he would exploit this tragedy to attack his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.</p> <p>All that said, many actions taken by China\u2019s Communist party leadership, both during the Covid-19 crisis and before in relation to western democracies, are also a cause for genuine concern. Xi was unarguably late in alerting the world to the seriousness of the Wuhan outbreak. By initially trying to cover it up, and delaying WHO investigatory efforts, he did the world a great disservice.</p> <p>China\u2019s subsequent behaviour in trying to parlay this disaster into a soft-power triumph, using bad-mannered diplomats to assail its critics, harshly repressing internal dissent, and rejecting an independent, international inquiry into the causes and handling of the pandemic is unacceptable. It strengthens the hand of its detractors and <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/how-not-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-europe\">dismays its friends</a>.</p> <p>The Beijing government is also wrong to play, in effect, Trump\u2019s game by allowing global viral trauma to fuel a wider strategic, economic and potentially military confrontation \u2013 what some experts are calling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/using-the-virus-to-bash-beijing-could-trigger-a-new-cold-war\">new cold war</a>. Ominous parallels with the fatal deterioration in relations between Japan and the US during the 1930s Depression era are starting to emerge.</p> <p>At this moment of extreme stress, it is vital to keep matters in perspective. No, China has not become a liberal democracy, as some in the west hoped. Yes, human right abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong are egregious. And yes, China\u2019s cyber-snooping and bullying of neighbours in the South China Sea and Taiwan is wrong and should cease.</p> <p>Yet overall, China\u2019s opening to the world in the post-Tiananmen age has been beneficial all round. Maoism was set aside, millions were pulled out of poverty, and China, by and large, has come to support a prosperous, stable global order where disputes are settled peacefully. China is not the Soviet Union. It is a rival. It is a challenger. It sometimes plays dirty. But it is not an enemy \u2013 unless malefactors like Trump are allowed to make it so.</p>",

The number of people who have lost their lives is 307,001 according to official tolls, but the true number is likely to be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of deaths in the US</strong><strong> is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June,</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1261406011039993856\">according to the CDC director Robert Redfield</a>. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models; all of which predicted at least that number of deaths. Trump has oscillated, but has previously said the toll would be lower.</li> \n   <li><strong>Record increase in cases in Brazil. </strong>Brazil has confirmed 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Brazil has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Beijing increases pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion. </strong>China has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>.The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/governance/world-health-assembly\">World Health Assembly </a>is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace</strong>. Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK\u2019s reproduction rate still close to 1, bringing lockdown-easing steps into question. </strong>The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns. </strong>Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Second health minister resigns in Brazil after less than a month on the job. </strong>Brazil\u2019s health minister, Nelson Teich, handed in his resignation on Friday, his office said, after less than a month on the job as the country becomes a world hotspot for coronavirus. Teich is believed to have disagreed with the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France and had more than 200,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain hails large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus. </strong>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March. </strong>The country reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>"
