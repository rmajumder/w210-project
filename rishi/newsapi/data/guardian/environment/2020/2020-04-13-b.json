  "<p>The British primatologist Dame <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/jane-goodall\">Jane Goodall</a> believes the Duke of Sussex will give up hunting because of his wife\u2019s dislike for the sport, and thinks he has been finding life \u201ca bit challenging\u201d since the couple moved to North America.</p> <p>Goodall, 86, a friend of the pair who has been a guest at their Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor, said in an interview with the Radio Times that Harry and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, were champions of the natural world \u2013 \u201cexcept they hunt and shoot\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cBut I think Harry will stop because Meghan doesn\u2019t like hunting, so I suspect that is over for him.\u201d</p> <p>The conservationist was speaking about her latest documentary, The Hope, on National Geographic and National Geographic Wild, marking the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. It includes footage, previously released, of her mimicking an intimate ape greeting with Harry.</p> <p>Asked if she hoped he would remain a supporter and ally, Goodall said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how his career is going to map out, but yes, I\u2019ve been in touch, though I think he\u2019s finding life a bit challenging just now.\u201d</p> <p>Harry and William have faced criticism in the past over hunting. Both are opponents of the illegal wildlife trade and supporters of the campaign to protect endangered species.</p> <p>Critics have condemned their participation in Sandringham Boxing Day shoots at the Queen\u2019s Norfolk estates.

  "<p>It\u2019s come to something when Dominic Raab is quite clearly the best person available for the job. With Boris Johnson likely to be out of action at Chequers for the coming weeks, Robert Jenrick getting stuck in transit between any of his three houses, Michael Gove being unable to explain why his daughter is a higher priority for a coronavirus test than a frontline NHS worker \u2013 has any situation ever been improved by Mikey not staying at home? \u2013 and Priti Patel being Priti Patel, there are few obvious alternatives to Raab to front up the daily Downing Street press conference.</p> <p>Which isn\u2019t to say that Dom is by any means an ideal choice. Practice hasn\u2019t made perfect, but it has made him a bit less rubbish. He\u2019ll never be totally relaxed \u2013 his missing-person habit is hard to break \u2013 but he is a lot less sweaty and nervy than he was last week when he was visibly struggling. There\u2019s almost a swagger. Albeit one that barely disguises his low threshold for boredom. Because Dom is not dim \u2013 well, not compared with many of his colleagues \u2013 and the tedium of having nothing new to say has already got to him. He can\u2019t even bring himself to go through the charade of appearing interested. The briefing is just a half-hour ordeal to be endured.</p> <p>Stifling a yawn, the foreign secretary began by thanking NHS staff. Not just for saving Boris, but for all their efforts elsewhere. My guess is that most NHS workers were either too busy or too knackered to have paid much attention. If the government is sincere in its newfound gratitude for a health service that it has been happy to underfund and understaff for the past 10 years, it is going to have to be prepared to alienate its traditional low-tax Tory voters. Not to mention the Brexiters who want many of the immigrants who work in the NHS to sod off.</p> <p>Raab then moved on the daily figures. The death rate was down a bit, but then it always is at weekends, as for some reason the person whose job it is to do the counting doesn\u2019t work on Sundays. He was more indirectly straightforward \u2013 Dom can\u2019t do anything without having first out-thought himself \u2013 on why deaths in care homes weren\u2019t being included in the daily stats. Because if they were, then everyone would see that many more people were dying than he was prepared to admit.</p> <p>Visibly losing the will to live, Dom also failed to adequately explain why, halfway into the government\u2019s target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, we were still only managing about 18,000. It was like this: the coronavirus was a tricky bugger that spread exponentially. So the only way to combat it was to be even more cunning. Start by doing almost no tests and then take it by surprise by testing exponentially. The reason we were apparently so far behind was to lull the coronavirus into a false sense of security.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a national test,\u201d Raab concluded. Really? The whole thing is just an Ant Middleton SAS: Who Dares Wins TV show, where the first country to break the lockdown gets thrown off the course. Silly, silly me. There was I imagining that what we were really dealing with was a global pandemic that required proper scientific evidence, when in reality it was a psycho standoff between us and the virus to see who gives way first.</p> <p>Nor did the questions from the media produce much in the way of straight answers. The government doesn\u2019t yet seem to have even reached a point where there is a plan of what criteria might need to be met to end the lockdown or which groups might be allowed out first. Presumably Raab is still banking on using his black-belt martial arts skills to defeat the coronavirus with a straight ippon. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t really hear you,\u201d was as far as he got in offering an apology for Priti Patel\u2019s suggestion that most NHS staff were wasting PPE protection at fancy dress parties. So no. He wasn\u2019t sorry at all. Besides, no one was going to be seeing Patel again in the foreseeable future</p> <p>Inevitably \u2013 because these briefings always do \u2013 the questions turned to why, even without the care home and death-in-the-community figures, the UK was heading for the worst mortality rate in Europe. Was this part of the plan? Raab\u2019s face momentarily turned to panic. No one had ever called what the government had done up till now a plan. More like a \u201ctake it a day at a time and hope something turns up\u201d approach.</p> <p>Did the government regret not acting a bit quicker? A month ago, it was advising 250,000 people to get stuck in together at the Cheltenham festival when other countries were in lockdown. Dom was firmly of the \u201cJe ne regrette rien\u201d \u00e9cole. Never explain, never apologise. So what if the death toll was now over 11,000 and rising by hundreds per day?</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t read anything into South Korea\u2019s low mortality rates, he said, because they weren\u2019t comparing like with like. We were excluding many more Covid-19 deaths than them. We were just doing them a favour to make them look good. But you could be damned sure if it was the UK that was at the bottom of the death charts, the government would be shouting about it from the rooftops. And I, for one, would be applauding them.</p>",

However, if preventive measures are taken, and if orchards can be replanted with resistant strains of olive, the economic impact could be cut to as little as \u20ac10m a year in Italy, with proportionally similar benefits in Spain and Greece. The three countries represent 95% of European production.</p> <p>About 17% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/05/italy-may-depend-on-olive-imports-from-april-scientist-says\">Italy\u2019s olive producing areas</a> are currently estimated to be infected with the disease, olive quick decline syndrome, which has become colloquially known as olive leprosy and has also struck in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/09/deadly-olive-tree-disease-spreads-france\">France</a>, Spain and Portugal.

But the scientists noted that when these control measures were tried, they \u201cresulted in great societal unrest in the affected region\u201d.</p> <p>Preparing for plant diseases, even of vital crops, is \u201ca notoriously difficult problem\u201d, said Kevin Schneider, of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, lead author of the paper <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912206117\">published </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912206117\">in the </a><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912206117\">journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. \u201cThere are clear guidelines and protocols enacted to prepare as much as possible against the introduction of harmful plant diseases. [But] some species can change ecosystems, some have economic impact, and some do not establish successfully at all and in turn do not cause impact.\u201d</p> <p>He told the Guardian that farmers and governments in the affected regions should heed scientific advice. \u201cFarmers need to stay vigilant and adhere to the imposed mitigation measures.

They worry that workers at the laundry facility are handling hospital linen that is potentially contaminated with the virus.</p> <p>In the OCE break room, he said, inmates are \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d, and unable to socially distance.

  "<p>The Labour party is in turmoil. It has just elected a new leader, Keir Starmer, who campaigned on the basis of party unity and ending factionalism. There was a sense from this result that members wanted a period of calm. But a deeply controversial internal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/hostility-to-corbyn-curbed-labour-efforts-to-tackle-antisemitism-says-leaked-report\">report was leaked</a> over the weekend to journalists and then distributed on social media. The effect has been to escalate factional warfare and intensify the toxic relationships between different groups within Labour.</p> <p>The report is the result of an internal investigation into the work of Labour\u2019s governance and legal unit in relation to antisemitism. Created by party staff, it pulls together an estimated 10,000 emails, thousands of messages exchanged on work accounts, and the contents of two WhatsApp group chats apparently created by senior management in Labour headquarters. However, it will not be submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission that is currently investigating antisemitism within the party, as party lawyers have reportedly decided that it is not within the scope of the external probe.</p> <p>Some have assumed that the document, dated March 2020 and written by staff working in the era when Jeremy Corbyn was leader and his ally Jennie Formby the general secretary, provides evidence that Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem is fictitious. That is not the conclusion of the report. Instead, its primary claim is that disciplinary cases were indeed poorly handled by the party; that this was not a mishandling of antisemitism complaints in particular but of all complaints in general; and that the situation has improved under Formby.</p> <p>The parts of the document that have gained most attention are those focused on the \u201chyper-factional\u201d environment existing within party HQ between Corbyn\u2019s election in 2015 and previous general secretary Iain McNicol\u2019s departure in February 2018, according to the report. It paints a truly horrible picture of an atmosphere dominated by politically motivated cruelty. There will be party members who recognise the nastiness of comments from the heated debates in their own local parties. But the report is shocking because the messages are alleged to come from senior staffers. It says the comments made about colleagues include \u201ctotal mentalist\u201d, \u201cbitch face cow\u201d and \u201cpube head\u201d, while Diane Abbott is mocked for crying in a toilet. There is also evidence that purports to show a staffer hoping that a named young member with mental health issues \u201cdies in a fire\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/labour-leader-sir-kier-starmer-orders-urgent-review-leaked-antisemitism-report\">Keir Starmer orders urgent review into leaked antisemitism report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other aspect to the factionalism described in the report, putting aside the vitriol, is the hope apparently expressed by anti-Corbyn staffers that Labour would not be electorally successful. The document contends that those in charge of party operations wanted the Liberal Democrats to win the 2017 Manchester Gorton byelection, created a \u201csecret key seats team\u201d to prioritise general election spending in seats held by MPs on the right of the party even when they were \u201csafe\u201d, and were disappointed when Corbyn\u2019s Labour did better than expected in the 2017 general election. The messages in the report show discussion of a \u201cTrot hunt\u201d during the 2015 leadership election to prevent new party members voting for Corbyn.</p> <p>The reason given for exploring these examples of factional warfare at the very top of the party is two-fold. The report argues that anti-Corbyn staffers were more interested in work that would benefit their side of the internal war than in processing complaints. And it asserts that HQ\u2019s opposition to the leader\u2019s office \u201cdisproves allegations that Corbyn\u2019s office had influence over [the general legal unit\u2019s] work\u201d. This is key in light of the 2019 BBC Panorama programme on Labour antisemitism, in which staffers said Corbyn\u2019s office had asked to be directly involved in the complaints process.</p> <p>The rest of the report dives into the failings of Labour\u2019s disciplinary system, asserting that the unit \u201cdid not properly log complaints\u201d, that there was no record of action being taken on serious cases, and that \u201cwell-evidenced\u201d antisemitism complaints were dismissed as \u201cspam\u201d. It also sets out the details of particular cases \u2013 controversially so, due to the implications for data protection now that it has been leaked.</p> <p>If the Panorama documentary told one side of the Labour antisemitism story, as Corbynites say that it does, this internal report shows the other side. Its claims will undoubtedly also be questioned. An independent investigation into the contents and release of the report has already been announced by Starmer. What is undeniable is that complaints have been mishandled due to a toxic internal culture, and that this has caused deep hurt \u2013 to the Jewish community, and to party members who worked hard for the Labour party with little reward.</p> <p>Less than two weeks into his leadership,<strong> </strong>Keir Starmer has his work cut out. Difficult decisions that will have repercussions for Labour\u2019s future \u2013 from procedural changes in HQ to trying to bring about a fundamental shift in party culture \u2013 lie ahead.</p> <p>\u2022 Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList</p>",

Few commuters were visible at Madrid\u2019s usually bustling Atocha railway station.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/spanish-pm-survival-eu-rests-response-coronavirus-crisis\">prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez</a>, has insisted the country remains firmly in lockdown despite the easing of some restrictions. Shops, bars and public houses will remain closed until at least 26 April. The health ministry has called on those returning to work to stagger arrival times and to wear masks where physical distancing is not possible.</p> \n<p>Regional leaders have criticised the move amid fears that the hard-fought public health gains of recent days may be lost. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from the virus fell to 517 on Monday from 619 on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to 17,489, the health ministry said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Spain\" data-alt=\"Spain deaths graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Spain\">Spain deaths graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>It was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. Overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019. The health minister, Salvador Illa, said the epidemic had passed its peak. The challenge now was to consolidate the second stage of the struggle against the virus and to reduce new infections, he said.</p> \n<p>The trend across Europe appears to show a similar modest flattening of infection and death rates. Italy reported 566 deaths on Monday, 135 more than on Sunday. Almost half of the deaths \u2013 280 \u2013 were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates\">Coronavirus latest news: death toll in Italy passes 20,000; more than 1.87m cases reported worldwide</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The civil protection authority said the number of people who are currently infected rose by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, in a further sign that the curve is flattening. The number of intensive care beds in use continues to decline, as does the number of people hospitalised for the virus.</p> \n<p>European countries face the same dilemma as Spain: whether to ease some lockdown restrictions in order to salvage their battered economies, or to persevere with draconian measures until the decline in cases is conclusively achieved.</p> \n<p>Italy\u2019s government has set up a taskforce led by the former chief executive of Vodafone Vittorio Colao to navigate the country\u2019s exit from the coronavirus lockdown. The team of 17 will be responsible for devising a plan as part of \u201cphase two\u201d of the emergency.</p> \n<p>It includes Enrico Giovannini, a former labour minister and professor at Tor Vergata University of Rome, as well as other economists, businesspeople, lawyers, sociologists and psychologists.

It said schools should reopen as soon as possible, starting with primary and middle schools, followed by shops and restaurants. All government officials should return to work, it said.</p> \n<p>Austria is to allow small shops to reopen from Tuesday, and larger ones from 1 May. All restaurants and hotels are due to resume business from mid-May. Denmark will reopen schools and day care centres from Wednesday, although restrictions on public gatherings and on bars and restaurants remain.</p> \n<p> The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged caution over moves by countries to lift lockdown conditions.

But the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to accept that the government was behind schedule. He said that there were now 23 drive-through sites where people could be tested. \u201cNew capacity is coming on-stream all the time,\u201d he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The cabinet may not be involved in the decision on extending the lockdown, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman revealed.</strong> Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow. With Boris Johnson recovering at Chequers after his spell in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is deputising in his absence. <strong>The government has to take a decision about extending the lockdown by Thursday, which is when the regulations covering England need to be reviewed.</strong> The spokesman did not say exactly how or when this would be taken, but he said the main work coordinating the government\u2019s response to coronavirus was being taken by the morning No 10 meeting, which is chaired by Raab, and by the four coronavirus ministerial groups. The spokesman said that any decision to extend the lockdown would have to be reviewed again after three weeks. It is thought inevitable that the lockdown will be extended, and the spokesman told journalists that when the decision is formally announced, the government would \u201cset out the reasoning behind the decision as soon as it is taken\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson is not doing any government work in Chequers, the spokesman said.</strong> He told journalists: \u201cThe prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work.\u201d And the PM is not receiving red boxes containing government papers at the moment, the spokesman said. The spokesman said he did not receive any while he was in hospital. A briefing early last week suggesting that he would be getting red boxes turned out to be wrong, the spokesman said, because the PM\u2019s condition deteriorated.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman denied claims that No 10 had given misleading accounts of how ill the prime minister was.</strong> It was put to the spokesman that the PM\u2019s own account yesterday of how he might have died contrasted with reports that he was only admitted to hospital as a precaution and that he was \u201cin good spirits\u201d throughout his time there. The spokesman said all the information given to journalists \u201cwas provided by St Thomas\u2019 Hospital\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman defended the decision to test Michael Gove\u2019s daughter for coronavirus. </strong>After she developed coronavirus symptoms Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said he would be self-isolating with her and the rest of his family at home, in line with government guidelines, but today it emerged that Gove is no longer self-isolating because his daughter tested negative. The spokesman said this was done on the advice of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, because Gove is one of the figures leading the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. Asked why he could not work from home, the spokesman said Gove chairs one of the key ministerial groups dealing with coronavirus (the one covering the public sector as a whole) and it was \u201cbeneficial\u201d for him to be able to go into the office.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The spokesman said that the Department for Health and Social Care was committed to carrying out a full investigation into the death of every NHS worker from coronavirus.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T13:48:34.292Z\">at 2.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e945be38f081a236f192723\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:34:39.280Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson described how ill Boris Johnson was during his stay in hospital:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As we set out, his condition did worsen over the course of last Monday afternoon and he had to be moved to the intensive care unit.</p> \n   <p>Now, clearly, if a person is moved to intensive care, that means that they are requiring a significant level of specialist treatment.</p> \n   <p>So, I think it was clear from the moment the prime minister was moved to intensive care that his condition had worsened.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:51:58.503Z\">at 1.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e94592d8f08db3109f21889\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregory-robinson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:22:36.736Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good afternoon.

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The supply of clinical gowns in some NHS hospitals is \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d according to Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, which represents hospital trusts. </p> \n  <p>He said there are some concerns about a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in certain hospitals. </p> \n  <p>He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThere is a range of personal protective equipment that needs to be delivered at the front line ... nearly all of that material is flowing in the way that trusts would like. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe bit where there\u2019s a particular problem was gowns, where we know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNo trust, as far as I\u2019m aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very very low.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d. </p> \n  <p>He said the NHS ordered \u201ca whole load of stock\u201d weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the product sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. </p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cIf everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hopson said those trusts with a surplus were being asked to share their supplies with neighbouring trusts, while alternative gowns were being sourced from elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Emergency supplies had also been delivered to those most in demand, Hopson said.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italy\u2019s death toll passes 20,000</h2> <p>The number of fatalities from coronavirus in Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9498a08f082dfd549d5a8e#block-5e9498a08f082dfd549d5a8e\">rose by 566 on Monday</a>, 135 more than on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to over 20,000. Almost half of the deaths (280) were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus. The civil protection authority said the number of people who were currently infected had risen by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, a further sign that the curve there is flattening.</p> <h2>Confirmed global death toll passes 116,000</h2> <p>At least 1.8 million people have been infected and 116,098 have died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have been tracking official and media reports. The tallies are likely to be underestimates due to different testing regimes and suspected underreporting of figures.</p> <h2>UK hospital deaths top 11,000</h2> <p>A total of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958#block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958\">11,329 patients have died</a> in UK hospitals after testing positive, the UK\u2019s Department of Health said, up by 717 from 10,612 in 24 hours.</p> <h2>Belgium records 303 new deaths</h2> <p>Belgian health authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7#block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7\">reported 303 more deaths in 24 hours</a>, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,903. Its death toll is lower than those in other European countries and the US due to its smaller population, but proportionally, the outbreak is now more deadly than in Italy.</p> <h2>Singapore records biggest daily jump in infections</h2> <p>Health authorities in Singapore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b#block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b\">confirmed 386 more cases</a>, the city-state\u2019s biggest daily jump since the outbreak began there. That takes its total to 2,918 cases. A large number of the new cases are linked to outbreaks in migrant workers\u2019 dormitories.</p> <h2>German experts recommend easing of restrictions</h2> <p>As time runs out on emergency measures to limit the outbreak in Germany, the country\u2019s National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e947b688f081a236f192884#block-5e947b688f081a236f192884\">recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions</a>, as long as new infections stabilise and personal hygiene measures are maintained.</p> <h2>WHO urges lockdown caution</h2> <p>The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9485b78f08db3109f21a59#block-5e9485b78f08db3109f21a59\">urged caution over moves to lift some lockdown conditions</a>.

  "<p>A hidden poem found in dusty early 17th century legal parchments at the National Archives has shed fresh light on a colourful character who moved in the leading literary and legal circles of the day.</p> <p>Written by Robert Dover, a King\u2019s Bench attorney and friend of the poet Ben Jonson, the short piece laments the quality of his handwritten legal plea rolls due to a lack of gall apples from which to make his ink.</p> <p>It was penned in the margin of Dover\u2019s rolls \u2013 or accounts \u2013 of legal proceedings at the King\u2019s Bench, Westminster, where it was found last month by Dr Euan Roger, a principal records specialist at the National Archives, among numerous metre-long plea rolls, each containing up to 700 hand-scribed parchments.</p> <p>Dover, an attorney and legal clerk, described as \u201cgenerous, jovial and noble-minded\u201d, was the same man who in 1612 founded the Cotswolds Olimpick Games \u2013 an annual Whitsun sporting competition featuring horse racing, wrestling, jumping, tumbling, shin-kicking, rural dancing and much feasting and merriment. The games continue today, though the coronavirus pandemic has cancelled them this year.</p> <p>A frontispiece to Annalia Dubrensia, a 1636 published account of the games, depicts Dover on horseback as master of ceremonies. It contains 33 poems in his honour from poets including Ben Jonson and Michael Drayton, as well as one by Dover himself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/last-term-my-rolls-were-painted-very-ill-an-early-modern-poem-hidden-among-the-records-of-the-kings-bench/\">In a blog on the National Archives</a> website, Roger said: \u201cDover\u2019s short poem in the plea roll for Trinity [term] 1627 gives us a very different insight into his daily life, outside of the festivities of the Olimpicks and his courtly and literary connections.\u201d</p> <p>In the poem, Dover apologises for his rolls in the previous term, which were apparently \u201cpainted very ill\u201d because of a lack of gall apples used to make his ink. On a play with the word apples he goes on to state that his \u201cpainting\u201d this term is much better, as \u201cpells\u201d(a form of parchment skins) shows his skill, while preserving himself against future shortages, \u201cif my rolls be painted sometimes bad, think that apples is not always had\u201d.</p> <p>Roger said the plea rolls \u2013 the main records of the court \u2013 were \u201cmassive\u201d and covered in coal dust, as they were dried next to coal fires. The poem was written in a margin. \u201cFor me it is a real insight into how these documents came to be. It gives a very human side to that job of anonymous legal clerks,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you look at the word play in this poem, and the games he founded which are still running today, it is clear he is quite a fun character.\u201d</p> <p>Dover, born between 1575 and 1582, in Norfolk, studied at Cambridge University, was admitted to Gray\u2019s Inn in 1605, and called to the bar in 1611. He was known as a \u201cwit\u201d, a poet, and presided over the annual Cotswold Olimpick Games, held in the hills above Chipping Camden, for 40 years. The games were revived in 1965.</p> <p><strong>The poem:</strong><br><em>To Mr Ralph Gibson</em></p> <p><em>Last tearme my Rowles were painted very ill,</em></p> <p><em>Because Apelles then I could not find,</em></p> <p><em>But now behould As pelles shewes his skill,</em></p> <p><em>Only indeede to satisfy your mynd,</em></p> <p><em>And if my Rowles be painted sometymes bad,</em></p> <p><em>Think that Apelles is not allwayes had.</em></p>",

And Chequers, set at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, and 40 miles (65km) away from the hustle and bustle of the government base in Whitehall, is the perfect place to do so, with its views of fields of cattle and sheep. To aid his recuperation, he can swim gentle lengths in the heated indoor swimming pool housed in the orangery.</p> \n<p>While in Downing Street, the prime minster was confined in his sealed-off flat with his meals left at the door between Nos 10 and 11. Chequers has its own kitchens, led by a head chef well used to providing formal dinners for a rich variety of VIPs including the Queen, world leaders such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and celebrities including Sir Elton John, Bryan Adams and David Bowie.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Carol Thatcher once likened Chequers to a \u201cboutique hotel, albeit with top-level security\u201d and the \u201cperfect weekend retreat\u201d in complete contrast to the Downing Street terrace.

  "<p>I have lost something. I am in my house, and it has suddenly become huge. Every room opens on to another room into a chamber of unfamiliar spaces. I have misplaced my daughter and her baby. They are here somewhere, but I can\u2019t find them as I wander around forgetting what I am looking for.</p> <p>Upon waking, I note this Covid anxiety dream and text my children. The dream logic stays with me all day. Indeed I have misplaced them. We cannot be together. This is how life is now for most people. We comply to lockdown as rational beings, but the subconscious rebels. This is not all right.</p> <p>To be OK is to not have the virus \u2013 to complain about anything else feels self-indulgent, but this is a struggle. It is a struggle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">shot through with every pre-existing inequality</a>: the co-morbidities exacerbated by austerity; poor-quality high-density housing; basically a caste system whereby migrants work our land and clean up our various messes for less than the minimum wage. We did not need a pandemic to know this, did we? Anyone who has been near a hospital in the past 10 years will have seen how stretched it all is, as well as having witnessed immensely dedicated medical staff.</p> <p>There are political scores to be settled, always. The government\u2019s daily press briefings demonstrate the abject failure of lobby journalism. The wrong questions elicit not even answers, just mantras. The Berkeley professor Alexei Yurchak coined the term \u201chypernormalisation\u201d to describe the dying years of the Soviet system. Modern society was too complex and failing, so politicians created narratives that suggested the world was still simple and functional \u2013 they pretended that everything was normal \u2013 to hang on to power.</p> <p>So here we are pretending that this is a war to be waged and our resolve will beat this thing. The computation of loss cannot be measured on a graph. We attempt these computations daily. And fail. How do you imagine 10,000 deaths and how do you imagine more to come? How does one grieve this many people? How are we to suspend our lives waiting for more death, which we are told is inevitable?</p> <p>What is there to feel beyond powerlessness?</p> <p>As CS Lewis said, grief feels a lot like fear. For everyone who is cheerily spring cleaning their house, there are those of us who are paralysed, lethargic, unable to concentrate. As I have said before, the last thing we need in lockdown is more policing of emotion; we just need to get by.</p> <p>The atomised populace may well be angry at the ill-preparedness of our Tory leaders, but it is quite hard to know what to do with this anger day to day. The nearest experience of such mass loss for me was in the 80s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-aids-epidemic-san-francisco\">when Aids </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-aids-epidemic-san-francisco\">devastated an entire generation</a>. Then, I knew what to do. We organised, angry and defiant. We could still sit alongside the dying and their suffering.</p> <p>Now human touch is gone and student nurses are being taught how to help ease the distress of someone who cannot see their faces and who is drowning. Those who are shielded can also never be touched. As we stay in with our box sets and competitive crafting, I wonder a lot about the anticipation of grief.</p> <p>One grieves when someone is dying and yet when they do die, it\u2019s a shock, and the grieving begins again. The knowledge of what is going to happen doesn\u2019t lessen the intensity of what happens. Anticipatory grief is something that shrinks argue about. No one knows if it lessens the experience of grief, post-death.</p> <p>In this time of huge loss we might recognise what is happening. It is a trauma. \u201cTraumatic events are extraordinary not because they occur rarely, but rather because they overwhelm the ordinary adaptations to life,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/03/susie-orbach-books-to-understand-yourself\">Judith Herman in her great book Trauma and Recovery</a>.</p> <p>This pandemic is a global trauma. It has happened and and it will continue. This is the emotional truth of it. The tutting at the investment people have in the death of celebrities or Boris Johnson\u2019s recovery seem to me very unforgiving. We cling to these narratives in order to negotiate mortality and vulnerability. There are other narratives available that are more finessed and caveated, though they all come with lectures that support whatever political positions someone had pre-virus.</p> <p>As politicians scrabble around, desperate to appear in control, it is clear they are not. All this is acted out in this limbo of expected loss. Peaks on a graph mean the loss comes nearer. The man who has mended my shoes for 20 years and his father have died. Someone who was always there no longer is.</p> <p>This is real. \u201cFlattening the curve\u201d does not talk of our lost connections. We are dislocated. Dissociation, numbness, agitation, exhaustion, blunted affect. I cycle through these feelings. I recognise them: the reactions to trauma. They are what they are.</p> <p>The official discourses of certainty and invulnerability have never looked more of a charade. We cannot mourn what we cannot acknowledge. We grieve for those who have gone as well as those who will go. The accommodation of loss on such a scale feels impossible to live with. But we are all living with it. Somehow.</p>",

The advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is understood to be working on the campaign without payment and it is expected to be launched in the next few weeks.<br><br>Simon Ray,<strong> </strong>president of British Cardiovascular Society, said he welcomed a campaign to draw attention to the problem. \u201cThe biggest concern is that it seems there has been a uniform reduction in hospital attendances for heart attacks that has been noted in Italy, Spain and here. The magnitude looks the same everywhere: it\u2019s around 40% down in terms of callouts for emergency treatment for heart attacks.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThen there also seems to be substantial reduction in referrals in for with acute coronary syndrome, which is one step down from a heart attack, so people coming in with chest pain \u2013 those attendances also seem to have gone down a lot. That is harder to quantify, but the decrease in those is at least as large, and also seen across southern Europe and the US.\u201d<br><br>\u201dAnecdotally, and only anecdotally, a number of units have also reported people presenting late with complications due to having a heart attack that we don\u2019t normally see. The concern is people sitting out symptoms rather than calling help.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Davis, a spokesman for the College of Paramedics said: \u201cThe NHS is still open for business, thanks to the sacrifice that everyone is making by staying at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important that members of the public who are suffering with life-threatening emergencies like stroke, heart attack, severe bleeding or breathing difficulties still call 999. By having a long-lasting, nationwide lockdown it means that there are still paramedics available to provide emergency care.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The number of people attending A&amp;E with heart attack symptoms dropped from 300 per day at the beginning of March, to 150 by the end of March. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is extremely serious, but it\u2019s concerning if it also means people\u2019s fears about the virus are putting them off calling 999 when they suffer heart attack symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are uncertain times, and it\u2019s understandable that people might feel apprehensive about having to go to hospital or putting unnecessary strain on the NHS. But heart attacks don\u2019t stop for a global pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t delay because you think hospitals are too busy \u2013 the NHS still has systems in place to treat people for heart attacks and they are still a top priority \u2026 you should always dial 999 immediately if your chest pain is sudden, spreads to your arms, back, neck or jaw, and feels heavy or tight, or if you become short of breath or start to feel sick.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019re only going to see more death during this pandemic, so people are suddenly thinking about living wills, advanced care discussions and funeral planning.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hosts in the US describe a similar online effect, despite the physical restrictions of lockdown. \u201cPeople are being forced to face their own mortality every waking moment,\u201d reports Megan Sipe-Mooney, who organises cafes in Missouri. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge need right now and I\u2019m getting lots of requests on our Facebook page.

Underwood \u2013 a web developer and Buddhist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/30/jon-underwood-obituary\">who died suddenly in 2017</a> \u2013 had been inspired by the Swiss sociologist Bernard Crettaz, whose stated mission was to liberate death from an atmosphere of \u201ctyrannical secrecy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Conversations have become far more practical since the outbreak, explains Aly Dickinson, a death cafe host based in Exeter. \u201cPeople are realising that deaths during this pandemic won\u2019t be what they might have envisaged, or thought of as a so-called \u2018good death\u2019 \u2013 gently slipping away, surrounded by family and friends. So the conversations are about how death from Covid might look now \u2013 for example, people may decide they do not want to be hospitalised and receive invasive medical interventions or face restricted visiting from loved ones.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9448671425e26f906c8c5eadd8a09f44e76b7549\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9448671425e26f906c8c5eadd8a09f44e76b7549/21_838_6695_4018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Since taking off in the UK, death cafes have spread around the world.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Since taking off in the UK, death cafes have spread around the world.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dickinson has been involved with half a dozen cafes since the pandemic began, in her role as secretary of <a href=\"https://eol-doula.uk/\">End of Life Doula UK</a>, a membership organisation for death doulas, who provide non-medical support to those with a terminal diagnosis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey want to discuss the nitty-gritty, like: will I be able to get out to register the death, could we have a wake remotely, how do we share grief and memories when we\u2019re apart? People are wanting hard facts and information about what dying of Covid-19 is actually like. Maybe there\u2019s not quite so much laughter, as the mood is more serious.\u201d</p> \n<p>With cafes also planned in Australia, Canada, Japan, Denmark and beyond throughout April, some hosts suggest that the gradual embrace of online meetings will allow death cafes to extend their support even further.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked in the past about how nobody wants to discuss death and dying\u201d, Dickinson adds, \u201cand suddenly that conversation is right in front of us, in the media and also our own families and communities. So at the death cafes that have taken place since the pandemic, the biggest change is that people are talking about death in a here-and-now way, rather than as something distant.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In the global scramble for medical equipment and diagnostic kits to fight the coronavirus, Ireland has found an edge: Bono.</p> <p>The U2 singer has lobbied South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, and corporate titans including Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, to help find personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies for Ireland\u2019s health service.</p> <p>Moon\u2019s office tweeted on Sunday that it had received a letter from Bono and that the president\u2019s spokesman, Kang Min-suk, would respond in writing.

Regressive policies and enforcement procedures are being scaled back in surprising numbers. While sectors under federal control \u2013 immigration policy, higher education, healthcare, election reform \u2013 have had few Covid-related changes, those controlled by city and state governments \u2013 criminal justice, housing, transportation, utilities \u2013 have had many.</p> <p>These changes were put in place to slow viral transmission and stabilize the economy, not to benefit social welfare. But what\u2019s interesting is how much overlap there is between them. Sector by sector, the pandemic has unintentionally sparked changes pushed by reformers for decades. What couldn\u2019t be done in years has now happened in a matter of weeks. Policy changes that before Covid were dismissed as unreasonable are now seen not only as reasonable but as necessary.</p> <p>It shows us how <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-tsa-liquid-purell-paid-leave-rules.html\">absurd so many of our rules</a> were to begin with. But does it also show us how easy they\u2019ve been to change all along?</p> <p>Many of these changes still don\u2019t go far enough, come with caveats and fine print, are subject to absurd means-testing, or are only temporary. For those of us who believe that America needs serious change \u2013 and that this is the time to do it \u2013 what will it take to make many of these temporary changes permanent? These aren\u2019t necessarily the changes we want, but they give us a glimpse of what\u2019s possible.</p> <p>We are collecting more of these examples at <a href=\"https://pandemicpolicy.us/\">pandemicpolicy.us</a>.

Its passage, however, further demonstrates that the \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-stimulus-package-spending/\">how will you pay for it</a>\u201d question is more about stopping progressive policies than genuine concern.</p> <h2><strong>People with foreign medical degrees can provide hospital care</strong></h2> <p>As hospitals lack beds and equipment and millions of Americans lose their jobs \u2013 and thus their health insurance \u2013 the inadequacies and cruelty of the American healthcare system (if not already obvious) is now undeniable.

The expansion of remote work has been a long-denied <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/covid-19-is-proving-the-value-of-remote-work\">demand of disabled workers</a>, but only now are employers willing to consider it.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175538/amazon-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-all-employees-relief-fund\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/walmart-apple-olive-garden-are-among-major-employers-updating-sick-leave-policies-coronavirus-cases-spread/\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173287/instacart-coronavirus-sick-pay-workers-in-store-shoppers-covid19\">Instacart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/tech/uber-coronavirus-sick-leave/index.html\">Uber</a> have revised their sick leave policies to include employees who are typically denied such benefits. But in basically all cases, this sick leave is accessible only after testing positive for Covid-19 (a difficult requirement given the scarcity of tests) and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/\">in the absence of other necessities like protective equipment and hazard pay</a>.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-uber-still-call-drivers-contractors/\">Uber persistently resist classification of their drivers as proper employees</a>, and this very limited expansion of benefits is not really a substantial change away from that policy.

  "<p>About half of all Covid-19 deaths appear to be happening in care homes in some European countries, according to early figures gathered by UK-based academics who are warning that the same effort must be put into fighting the virus in care homes as in the NHS.</p> \n<p>Snapshot data from varying official sources shows that in Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium between 42% and 57% of deaths from the virus have been happening in homes, according to the report by academics based at the London School of Economics (LSE).</p> \n<p>Published official data for care homes in England and Wales are believed to significantly underestimate deaths in the sector, with the Office for National Statistics only recording 20 coronavirus-related deaths in all care homes in the week ending 27 March. New figures are due out on Tuesday, but are unlikely to be up to date.</p> \n<p>Last week the industry body Care England told the Guardian the total figure was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/covid-19-hundreds-of-uk-care-home-deaths-not-added-to-official-toll\">probably approaching 1,000</a>, with deaths reaching into double figures at numerous homes. Over the weekend details of more deaths emerged, including 13 residents who have died at the 71-capacity Stanley Park care home in County Durham, and there have reportedly been five deaths at Almond Court in Glasgow.</p> \n<p>On Monday Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said 13.5% of the UK\u2019s care homes had a confirmed case of coronavirus among their residents, up from 9% last week, with 92 more homes detecting cases in the previous 24 hours.</p> \n<p>But the spread of the virus and its lethality in care homes in five EU countries appears to be higher, according to academics who are calling for better UK data and a more urgent response to the crisis in care homes.</p> \n<p>In its <a href=\"https://ltccovid.org/2020/04/12/mortality-associated-with-covid-19-outbreaks-in-care-homes-early-international-evidence/?subscribe=success#blog_subscription-3\">first review of early international evidence</a>, researchers from the International Long Term Care Policy Network (LTCPN) found the most robust data was available in Ireland where, as of Saturday, 54% of deaths from coronavirus occurred in care homes, according to centralised government figures.</p> \n<p>In Italy, a government survey covering deaths in 10% of the nations\u2019 care homes suggested 45% of all deaths in that country could be in care homes, while central government data in France released at the weekend showed the same proportion of the 13,832 deaths in that country happened in care. In Belgium, health ministry figures showed 42% of Covid-19 deaths happened in care homes, and in Spain leaked regional government data suggested 57% of the country\u2019s death toll from 8 March to 8 April was from care homes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The figures came from different sources and the academics stressed that differences in testing availability and policies and approaches to recording deaths make international comparisons difficult.</p> \n<p>But one of the report\u2019s author\u2019s, Adelina Comas-Herrera, of the LSE\u2019s care policy and evaluation centre, said that given the fast-moving situation \u201cwe\u2019re trying to document it as it happens and share it\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we wait for perfect standards of evidence it will be too late to make any difference,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo me it shows we will have to give equal resourcing in dealing with Covid between the NHS and social care. Care homes are places where physical distancing is almost impossible. It\u2019s like a perfect storm: a susceptible population, not being able to implement the measures and the staff are not well supported and trained enough. Many of the staff are care assistants with very little medical knowledge.\u201d</p> \n<p>There have been three epidemiological studies of Covid-19 in care homes carried out by authorities in Seattle, one of which found that by 18 March, of 101 care home residents who contracted the virus in the preceding weeks, 34 died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said the LCTPN\u2019s summary of evidence \u201cclearly shows the lack of focus on the elderly in care homes, despite their conclusion that care home residents may account for around half of Covid deaths in five European countries. Our elderly populations deserve better than to be ignored and forgotten.\u201d</p> \n<p>He cautioned that it remains hard to draw conclusions on precise numbers of deaths of elderly people in nursing and residential care around Europe and said that given there are few tests available, very few suspects cases will end up as confirmed cases.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cDespite these limitations, we know that a range of infections can spread easily in vulnerable populations who live in nursing or residential care, for example norovirus, scabies, influenza, and here, the novel coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe are determined to give the social care sector the support it needs to respond to coronavirus and continue to work closely with Public Health England to monitor the impact on cares homes.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have published extensive guidance for care homes on admitting and caring for people during the outbreak, and have announced \u00a32.9bn to help local authorities respond to pressures in key services, such as adult social care, and enhance the NHS discharge service, allowing patients to return home safely.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>Covid-19 has changed everything. In particular, it has changed everything about travel. As a Lonely Planet writer you learn fast that change is the only constant on the road. Still, no one was expecting the changes announced last week: that Lonely Planet is to close its Melbourne production facility and London offices \u201calmost entirely\u201d, as well as its magazine and Trade and Reference division. The famous guidebooks will continue to be published through the company\u2019s Dublin and Tennessee offices, but they will also face some job cuts.</p> <p>As travel has outpaced the growth of the global economy for the last eight years, Lonely Planet has grown to become the world\u2019s largest travel publisher, accounting for 31.5% of the global guidebook market. But with planes grounded, borders closed and people quarantined, where travel is headed next is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201c[It\u2019s] a sad and difficult day for all of us in the Lonely Planet family,\u201d wrote managing director of publishing, Piers Pickard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f38f35343721fe1f6b7c2b1ea38eb572f818795a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f38f35343721fe1f6b7c2b1ea38eb572f818795a/0_0_5250_3500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reading the Lonely Planet guide to Malta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reading the Lonely Planet guide to Malta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Certainly, the closure of Lonely Planet\u2019s original headquarters in Melbourne is the end of an era. It was in Melbourne that co-founders Tony and Maureen Wheeler set up shop in 1973 after finishing their epic overland journey from London across Asia to Australia. They published an account of the journey in Across Asia on the Cheap, a stapled together volume featuring hand-drawn maps and the nowfamous logo, designed by Tony. It sold 1,500 copies. Encouraged by its success, the Wheelers followed with guides to Nepal, Africa, New Zealand and New Guinea.</p> <p>In 1977\u2019s Africa on the Cheap, readers were advised to enjoy the \u201cBonadir weavers and old mosques\u201d of Mogadishu, while a guide to the Middle East offered advice on hitch-hiking to Baghdad from Syria. But, it was the success of the 1981 India guide that put Lonely Planet in the backpacks of many young traveller hungry for foreign experiences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"20ff67900b590037eb636a603e0f860ec2b0ca68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20ff67900b590037eb636a603e0f860ec2b0ca68/12_2_766_1111/689.jpg\" alt=\"The success of the 1981 India guide was a game-changer for Lonely Planet.\" width=\"689\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The success of the 1981 India guide was a game-changer for Lonely Planet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI remain proud of what Lonely Planet achieved,\u201d says Tony Wheeler. \u201cI\u2019m always delighted when people say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have gone there if LP hadn\u2019t have given me a push, showed me the way.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ryan Ver Berkmoes, the veteran writer, one-time Lonely Plant publisher and author of 130 guidebooks, describes the company under Tony and Maureen, as \u201cthe friend you wanted next to you at the bar in the country you\u2019d just landed in. Full of smart, savvy advice so you could start having a great trip. It was a rollicking and amazing place where you made friends worldwide.\u201d</p> <p>I signed up in 1999 to research Ethiopia and \u2013 as with millions of other travellers \u2013 subsequent Lonely Planet trips provided foundational life experiences. I healed a broken heart researching the desert landscapes of Namibia. Years in Italy taught me to appreciate life\u2019s simple pleasures. When my mother died, my grieving father joined me in Sicily. A working-class man who never travelled for pleasure, he was consoled by the cavalcade of treasures we saw. Last week, a friend phoned from Benghazi, Libya, to enquire about my health and safety \u2013 a poignant irony given that he now lives in a city run by militias.</p> <p>While part of the company\u2019s mission was undoubtedly to introduce readers to offbeat or struggling nations, Ver Berkmoes emphasises the role Lonely Planet played in popularising travel in people\u2019s lives. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just places like Libya, Burma (Myanmar) or Timor-Leste, there were few mainstream, widely available guidebooks for much of the planet\u201d he explains. \u201cLonely Planet helped take the foreign out of foreign travel.\u201d</p> <p>The company has also been a technology pioneer. There was a Lonely Planet blog in 1994, five years before the word \u201cblog\u201d was coined. A website followed, along with CitySync guidebooks on PalmPilots. Most innovative of all was the online traveller\u2019s forum, <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/welcome\">Thorn Tree,</a> launched in 1996. According to Jane Rawson, one of its first moderators: \u201cA tiny web team was set up and told to figure out what the internet was and whether it was useful to travellers.\u201d In 2016, Lonely Planet\u2019s online community topped 10 million. Social media, it turns out, was kind of a big thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84992f553679ad63d47d49fc990c5b80940d5d06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84992f553679ad63d47d49fc990c5b80940d5d06/0_0_5616_3366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gagliano Castelferrato in Sicily: \u201cWhen my mother died, my grieving father joined me in Sicily \u2026 and was consoled by the cavalcade of treasures we saw.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gagliano Castelferrato in Sicily: \u201cWhen my mother died, my grieving father joined me in Sicily \u2026 and was consoled by the cavalcade of treasures we saw.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Wlodarczyk/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there has been upheaval and concern, too, including two company sales, first to the BBC in 2007 for \u00a3130m, then to US-based NC2 media in 2013 at the much-reduced price of \u00a351.5m. Challenged by tough market conditions (guidebook sales fell 40% between 2007 and 2012, but have since recovered 27%) and online firms, such as Expedia, TripAdvisor and Google, the company sought to diversify into a multimedia business with TV, magazines, mobile apps, a blogging platform and e-commerce partnerships. Yet, through all this, Lonely Planet continues to finance multi-week research trips to update its guidebooks, and is now the only publisher that does so.</p> <p>In many ways, the company\u2019s fortunes mirror the evolution of mass tourism. In 1973, the year Lonely Planet was founded, the US budget airline Southwest turned its first profit and showed the reliability of low-cost air travel. Since then, tourism has increased as travel has become more accessible. In 2017, the UN World Tourism Organization estimated that the world might see 1.8 billion travellers by 2030. That was before Covid-19. Now, even Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou of easyJet, the second largest budget airline in Europe, thinks his company will feel like a startup again once national lockdowns are lifted.</p> <p>Asked where travel will go now, Tony Wheeler says: \u201cI don\u2019t think the current crisis is going to end the role of the traditional guidebook \u2013 whether it\u2019s in print or digital. I\u2019ve already got the new LP guidebooks for travels I had intended to make later this year.\u201d</p> <p>Ver Berkmoes also believes guidebooks will endure: \u201cOnce we start travelling again \u2026 so many old faces and brands will be gone. People will need that friend next to them in the bar with loads of smart advice.\u201d</p> <p>He should know, as during his time at Lonely Planet he weathered two catastrophes that ravaged the travel industry \u2013 the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, which devastated large parts of Asia. \u201cThe 9/11 attacks had a profound effect on the company. People stopped travelling and bookshops returned all their guidebooks,\u201d says Ver Berkmoes. \u201cThe company lost dozens of talented people. It was wrenching for everyone. But travel did come back and so did Lonely Planet.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, the tsunami galvanised the company to help in a huge humanitarian effort. The Wheeler\u2019s donated relief funds and significant resources were deployed to assist where possible. \u201cWe had people on the ground in all the most affected areas and we scouted for projects that would make a difference,\u201d says Ver Berkmoes. \u201cThere was a comprehensive part of the website that answered practical questions such as: how can I help? where should I travel? how do I get home?\u201d</p> <p>They are the same questions that many people are asking now, which is why the company\u2019s commitment to its guidebooks is reassuring. If the future of travel looks more like the past \u2013 fewer trips with logistical challenges that are more carefully considered given new risks and uncertainty \u2013 then trustworthy travel information will be of great value. As I write, there are Lonely Planet writers emerging from lockdown in Beijing. They have a view of the road ahead.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain sees another fall in daily death toll</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s overnight death toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9434798f082dfd549d567d#block-5e9434798f082dfd549d567d\">from coronavirus fell to 517</a> on Monday from Sunday\u2019s 619, bringing the total death toll to 17,489, the health ministry said, adding that it was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. The ministry said in a statement that overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019. Meanwhile, restrictions have been lifted for some businesses after shutting down all non-essential operations nearly two weeks ago. This will allow businesses that cannot operate remotely, including construction and manufacturing, to reopen. The move has been criticised by some as risking a resurgence in the spread of the virus.</p> <h2>Major oil-producing nations agree historic 10% cut in output</h2> <p>The world\u2019s largest oil producers have agreed a historic deal to cut global oil production by almost 10% to protect the market against the impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/government-under-fire-over-ppe-and-testing-as-uk-death-toll-passes-10000\">coronavirus pandemic</a>. Members of the Opec oil cartel and its allies have agreed to withhold almost 10m barrels a day from next month after the outbreak of Covid-19 wiped out demand for fossil fuels and triggered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">collapse in global oil prices</a>.</p> <h2>Iran\u2019s death toll rises to 4,585 \u2013 up by 111</h2> <p>The country\u2019s death toll from the new coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9432b68f081a236f1925c2#block-5e9432b68f081a236f1925c2\">has risen to 4,585</a>, with 111 deaths overnight, a health ministry official said, adding the total number of infected cases had reached 73,303 in the most-affected Middle Eastern country. \u201cFortunately 45,983 of those infected with the virus have recovered ... There were 1,617 new infected cases in the past 24 hours,\u201d tweeted Alireza Vahabzadeh, an adviser to Iran\u2019s health minister.</p> <h2><strong>China</strong> <strong>reports 108 new virus cases</strong></h2> <p>According to reports, 98 of the 108 cases were imported from overseas, its highest figure since early March. The country where the disease first emerged has largely brought its domestic outbreak under control, but it faces a fresh battle against imported infections, mostly Chinese nationals returning home.</p> <h2><strong>Widespread testing needed in the US</strong></h2> <p>The US needs to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, health experts have said, as the White House considers when and how to lift stay-at-home restrictions and lockdowns triggered by the pandemic. Diagnostic testing determines if somebody is infected with the virus and antibody testing shows who has been infected and is therefore immune. Both will be important in getting people back into the workplace and containing the virus as that happens, the experts said.</p> <h2><strong>WHO looking at reports of patients testing positive again</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday that it was looking into reports of Covid-19 patients testing positive again after clinically recovering from the disease. South Korean officials had reported on Friday that 91 patients cleared of the new coronavirus had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus may have been \u201creactivated\u201d rather than the patients being re-infected.</p> <h2>Pop-up bike lanes help with coronavirus social distancing in Germany</h2> <p>German cities are redrawing road markings to create \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/pop-up-bike-lanes-help-with-coronavirus-social-distancing-in-germany\">pop-up cycle lanes</a>\u201d for the duration of the Covid-19 lockdown, as cyclists demand more space to socially distance on their commute to work. Local authorities in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg district trialled a temporary widening of two cycle lanes on 27 March, arguing it would help cyclists keep the required 1.5-metre distance apart while car traffic was down owing to Germany\u2019s current coronavirus restrictions.</p>",
  "<p>Fears of coronavirus-induced shortages have sparked a desire to grow our own food, but getting hold of supplies isn\u2019t easy when popping to the garden centre is out of the question. Here\u2019s how to overcome some of the common obstacles to harvesting your first crop.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got a clue</strong></h2> <p>Being on hand at home to care for your plants\u2019 needs means you will quickly learn what makes them thrive. But you must set out with the right mindset. Treat everything you grow as an experiment: if you manage a small harvest, that\u2019s a perk rather than the goal.</p> <p>Don\u2019t assume that you can plant seeds of 20 different veg now, and within a month be able to spurn supermarket produce. Although a few crops can be ready in just a few weeks, such as radishes and salad leaves, most take months to reach maturity, and even the most seasoned gardeners experience failures because of pests (slugs: I mean you), late frosts that kill fruit-tree blossom or a bad batch of seed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9/543_1_4396_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chillies need to be sown now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chillies need to be sown now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dla4/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the process of growing that is your reward: you\u2019ll soon become addicted to the thrill of spying your very first flash of green leaf against compost as your seeds sprout. If there are children in your household, get them involved. They are much more likely to eat something they helped to cultivate, and every aspect of growing involves some kind of home-schooling activity, from counting out seeds and writing labels for younger children to learning about photosynthesis and transpiration for older ones.</p> <p>Reach back in your mind to school biology lessons, and you will remember that all plants have the same basic needs: water and nutrients for the roots, and light, air and warmth for the leaves. Beyond that, every vegetable has its own ideal growing conditions. Some \u2013 such as tomatoes, chillies, courgettes and aubergines \u2013 need a long season to mature, so these need to be sown now if you want any chance of a crop. Others, such as lettuce, mature more quickly and can be sown in small amounts throughout the growing season.</p> <p>The internet is awash with advice, a great deal of it misleading \u2013 so ignore those viral videos about sowing herbs in glass jars; it won\u2019t work. However, you can\u2019t go far wrong starting with <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/,\">the Royal Horticultural Society website</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/growing-advice\">charity Garden Organic </a>has plenty of guides to growing organically. </p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any seeds</strong></h2> <p>If the panic-buying run on vegetable seeds has left your local shops lacking, and you can\u2019t face yet another online order, have a rummage. If you locate some packets, unopened or opened, at the back of a drawer, it\u2019s worth sowing them, as many seeds remain viable long after the \u201cbest before\u201d date.</p> <p>Even if you draw a blank on that, your kitchen is full of other possibilities: there\u2019s no harm in sowing seeds plucked from the inside of a pepper or strained from the pulp of a tomato, although the results may be less predictable than those from a packet. If you have whole seeds of coriander, dill, fennel or fenugreek, you can sprout them as microgreens (see \u201cNo outdoor space\u201d, below). You can also regrow the bases of celery, onions and lettuce by placing them in a shallow dish of water. And you can raise pea shoots from dried peas. Growers are discouraged from planting sprouted spuds from the veg rack \u2013 certified disease-free seed potatoes specially produced for the grow-your-own market are safer \u2013 but many people report great harvests from discarded potatoes. For more ideas, get hold of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Waste-Kitchen-Gardening-Regrow-Leftover/dp/0760361606\">No-Waste Kitchen Gardening by Katie Elzer-Peters</a>.</p> <p>If you have your own outside space, there may be things already thriving there that you can eat: some plants maligned as weeds are useful edibles, while there are ornamentals that are tasty, too. The young, tender leaves of the lime tree (<em>Tilia</em>) and the ice plant (<em>Hylotelephium spectabile</em>) can both be used in salads. But for safety\u2019s sake, make sure no one has been spraying weedkiller around, stick to your own space and remember many plants are highly toxic, such as giant hogweed and foxglove.</p> <p>Start with plants you can identify without a shadow of doubt, such as dandelions and nettles, and expand your knowledge using the <a href=\"https://pfaf.org/\">Plants for a Future</a> website or Adele Nozedar\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Garden-Forager-Edible-Delights-your/dp/0224098896\">The Garden Forager</a>. Stick a bucket over a patch of dandelions and within a few days you will have blanched bitter leaves with many uses in the kitchen, from salads and sauteed greens to soups and pasta dishes. Soaking greens in a large bowl of heavily salted water then rinsing thoroughly removes dirt and unwanted hitchhikers, such as aphids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1def6ba0f5278a278abe2be5a2f4fddc45f3d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1def6ba0f5278a278abe2be5a2f4fddc45f3d0e/307_578_4527_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plant up bare patches in the flowerbeds with kale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plant up bare patches in the flowerbeds with kale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><br>You haven\u2019t got any soil</strong></h2> <p>Like seeds, compost is harder to source right now. Many of the DIY sheds are offering click-and-collect services for compost, however, while some garden centres will deliver to your door; Dalefoot and Fertile Fibre, two high quality peat-free compost brands, offer a mail-order service. If none of these is an option for you, all is not lost.</p> <p>If you have some lawn, cut away the turf using a spade (stack it into black plastic sacks and it will rot down into crumbly soil in about a year) and prepare a veg bed. Those with compost heaps already on the go are at an advantage, as good compost takes a few months to make: scrape off the top layer of uncomposted material, and you may find treasure below \u2013 it\u2019s ready when the worms have moved on to leave black, crumbly compost the consistency of a wrung-out sponge behind. Homemade compost isn\u2019t suitable for seed sowing, but you can add it as a layer of mulch to the top of veg beds and pots or dig it into the soil to add vital nutrients and organic matter.</p> <p>If you have flowerbeds with perennials, plant up bare patches with perennial vegetables such as welsh onions, rhubarb, perennial kale and sorrel, as well as perennial herbs, such as rosemary, chives, sage and thyme. You can also sow nasturtium seeds direct \u2013 the leaves and flowers are edible \u2013 or, beyond the end of May, when all danger of frost is past, plant out tender veg, such as tomatoes and courgettes. Just make sure you provide these hungry plants with extra nutrients through a liquid or granular feed.</p> <p>Tempting though it may be, don\u2019t fill pots with garden soil, as it\u2019s almost always too heavy to drain properly, and may well be full of eggs of slugs and other pests. Pots containing compost used for growing in previous years can be reused: tip it out and remove any weeds and any white C-shaped grubs, which are the larvae of the vine weevil. Add slow-release fertiliser such as <a href=\"https://www.organiccatalogue.com/products/seaweed-meal_mh6782\">Chase Seaweed Meal</a> and your revived compost is ready to go.</p> <p>If you have regular compost, but no seed compost, run what you have through an old sieve to remove the lumpy bits \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter for larger seeds, such as courgettes and beans.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got a garden</strong></h2> <p>A balcony, a set of steps, a tiny patio or a couple of window boxes will still serve as growing spaces: just scale your range of crops accordingly. Watch where the sun rises to work out the aspect of your patch, as this will dictate what you can grow. South-facing sunny spots are ideal for growing most things, particularly tomatoes, herbs, chillies and french beans, while shady north-facing patches offer more limited options, including salad leaves, swiss chard, mint, sorrel and coriander. Don\u2019t forget to grow upwards: any vertical can be covered with trellis or wires to act as climbing frames for beans, peas, climbing squash or nasturtiums. Check out <a href=\"https://verticalveg.org.uk/\">Vertical Veg\u2019s website for</a> more tips and advice on small-space growing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"756ca5c9b913953efedce53c72280ec6f2ceee1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/756ca5c9b913953efedce53c72280ec6f2ceee1f/46_498_5060_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tender veg, such as courgettes, need to go out at the end of May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tender veg, such as courgettes, need to go out at the end of May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any outdoor space</strong></h2> <p>Windowsills and ledges won\u2019t produce a huge harvest, but you can have the satisfaction of watching your plants grow up close. Your main limitation is lack of light: scope out your sunniest windowsill and requisition it for growing. If you are an impatient type, sprouting seeds and microgreens are your answer: you can sprout dried lentils, chickpeas and many other pulses and seeds by soaking them overnight then placing in a glass jar with a piece of fine muslin secured across the opening so that you can regularly rinse them with water as they grow, but a <a href=\"https://www.realfoods.co.uk/product/1397/bean-and-seed-sprouter\">tray sprouter will allow you to up production</a>. Microgreens take sprouting one step further, allowing seeds such as mustard, coriander and fenugreek to grow to 3-5cm tall before they are snipped. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Speedy-Vegetable-Garden-Mark-Diacono/dp/1604693266\">Speedy Vegetable Garden</a> by Mark Diacono and Lia Leendertz explains both techniques in detail.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any pots</strong></h2> <p>Fashion containers out of whatever you have to hand: an old kitchen bin or builder\u2019s bucket makes a great container for potatoes or a single tomato or chilli plant. You\u2019ll need to add drainage holes to the bottom of any container, so that excess water can run out \u2013 without that, plants\u2019 roots will rot. Remember that plants in containers will need regular feeding and daily watering in hot weather.</p> <p>On a smaller scale, plastic food trays for fruit and meat \u2013 and yoghurt pots of all sizes \u2013 are perfect for growing microgreens and starting off vegetable seeds. </p>",

  "<p>We moved to Chilton village in the Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire, about 10 years ago and discovered this rather wonderful horse chestnut tree on a walk. It was standing on its own, casting a deep shadow across our path in the evening sunshine.</p> <p>As we looked up, it was difficult to grasp its size as the branches disappeared up into an ever more complex maze, with only the occasional dappling of sunlight through the gaps in the leaves to illuminate the way. The trunk had lots of small twig-like growths, which gave the impression that the tree had hairy legs, while the huge canopy resembled a vintage Kenner Tree Tots Treehouse playset.</p> <p>It looked very settled and ancient, and as we gazed up we were drawn into its calm. And that\u2019s the sense it brings to me whenever I\u2019m in its presence.

  "<p>When Covid-19 hits Africa, will we be ready? This was a distant thought just one month ago. Now, as cases climb, we are braced for impact.</p> <p>As the crisis deepens in the world\u2019s largest economies, taking up most of the media bandwidth, Africa hardly makes the headlines. In international news outlets, the idea of crisis in Africa is met with resignation, not outrage. It is almost as if the media perceives crisis as the status quo in Africa, something expected. Unavoidable.</p> <p>Kenya\u2019s cabinet secretary for health, Mutahi Kagwe, has <a href=\"https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2020-04-08-coronavirus-kenyans-told-to-prepare-for-bad-news/\">cautioned</a>: \u201cWe are praying and hoping for the best, but clearly we must also prepare for the worst.

We now know this is possible, and what it will take. So we must ask ourselves \u2013 what more can be done to strengthen prevention and readiness efforts where coronavirus has yet to take hold? We must do more as a global community to ensure the third wave is not the deadliest and most destructive.</p> <p>If we don\u2019t act now, communities such as mine are where Covid will cause the most destruction and even chaos. I grew up in Kibera, Africa\u2019s biggest slum, on the outskirts of Kenya\u2019s capital city. Like all cities, Nairobi is a fluid urban centre where people are interconnected through jobs, mass transit, daily life, but here approximately 60% of the population are living in an urban slum.</p> <p>Kibera, like all slums, is a transitory place where people come and go between their families\u2019 ancestral village and the promise of economic opportunity in urban centres. Raised in a 10-by-10 shanty room with seven siblings, we had no concept of personal space or time alone. Hygiene was poor, our toilet was shared by more than 50 households.</p> <p>Today, despite all our efforts, thousands of Kibera\u2019s families live in the same circumstances alongside poor sanitation. With up to <a href=\"https://www.kibera.org.uk/facts-info/\">250,000</a> of the world\u2019s poorest people living on 2.5 sq km of land, there is no way to practise \u201ctwo-metre social distancing\u201d. in Kibera and among the world\u2019s one billion slum dwellers, our best bet is to try to prevent an outbreak; we know this is virtually impossible but<strong> </strong>it\u2019s our only hope and we have to try.<em> </em>In a pandemic such as this, the fate of urban slums will impact the trajectory of the Covid-19 virus on a national scale.</p> <p>The head of the World Health Organization (WHO,) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that Africa must <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51960118\">wake up</a> to the coronavirus. Vulnerable communities like mine are heeding this call, working around the clock, scraping together resources to do everything they can to keep the virus out. It is time for international leaders to step in with support that can reinforce community-led efforts. Even modest investments such as cash payments to slum dwellers and improving awareness, testing efforts and food support would go a long way towards containing and slowing the spread. As I write, there have only been 197 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Kenya with eight deaths but where will we be in a month\u2019s time, if the virus spreads the way it has in the developed world?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0cf2c296e542735bc1e6140db54a62917e0c01c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0cf2c296e542735bc1e6140db54a62917e0c01c/0_122_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman sews masks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in the Shofco Women\u2019s Empowerment Project (SWEP) sews masks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anwar Sadat/Shofco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Kibera and other slums across Kenya, communities are taking matters into their own hands because when a community comes together even in the most fearful times there is hope. Community leaders are mobilising through <a href=\"https://www.shofco.org/\">Shofco</a>, an organisation I founded as a 15-year-old boy who believed in the potential for communities to change their destiny. Together we have set up handwashing stations at every entry point to the slum and are running door-to-door campaigns to raise awareness and distribute bleach, homemade soap and hand sanitiser while combating rumours and misinformation.</p> <p>In partnership with the government, ministry of health and other locally based organisations, we are doing all we can to prevent the outbreak from decimating some of our most vulnerable communities. We know that if and when we face the full force of the virus, our fate is intertwined with one another, our city and our nation as a whole. This is a fact that we will never forget.</p> <p>The fear in my community is palpable. Joan, a resident of Kibera, says: \u201cWhen I hear of corona I see death has come to Kibera, it\u2019s a disease that spreads quickly and hurts. Because of our living conditions, it will spread fast. Many of our people have underlying conditions like HIV, blood pressure, there are orphans without good nutrition and very poor families. They say corona kills those with poor immunity, so we will all be at risk of a quick, sudden death.\u201d </p> <p>We have seen the alarm bells sounding around the globe. It is my plea that the international community seizes this opportunity to strengthen a successful homegrown effort that can teach valuable lessons in preparedness, rather than waiting to mobilise only after massive devastation has taken place.</p> <p>From Kibera, from communities like mine, i hope the world learns that we are capable of keeping ourselves safe, clean, safe and protected. Community-led efforts must be allowed to start and to lead the way.</p> <p>\u2022 Kennedy Odede is CEO and founder of the charity Shining Hope for Communities (Shofco)</p>",
  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the main stories on Monday 13 April.</p> <h2>Flattened curve \u2018consolidated\u2019 as travel drops over Easter</h2> <p>The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was \u201cnow seeing consolidation of the flattening of the curve\u201d after new cases continued to grow less than 2% a day. He revealed data that Australians were travelling 13% less this year compared to last year\u2019s Easter holiday. That was over Thursday, Good Friday and Saturday \u2013 with Sunday\u2019s data still to come. \u201cWe said before this weekend that Easter could be the most important weekend in our fight against the coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralians have done what we had hoped \u2013 and more.\u201d However, he warned there could still be coming \u201coutbreaks and spikes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Five thousand people in Tasmania lockdown</h2> <p>In what premier Peter Gutwein described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, Tasmania has placed its northwest region under lockdown to stop the spread of a coronavirus cluster among doctors and medical staff. Of the state\u2019s total 144 cases, 60 are linked to the northwest cluster, and of those 60, 42 are healthcare workers. Of the 11 new cases on Monday, eight were healthcare workers. As a result, two hospitals were closed on Monday, and the Australian defence force brought in. Five thousand people will be immediately quarantined: 1,200 hospital staff and their families. Tasmanian health authorities also said at least 300 people had already had close contacts with confirmed coronavirus cases in the northwest.</p> <h2>Death toll rises from Ruby Princess</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s national death toll rose to 61 after two people in NSW, who were both passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, died. A 74-year-old woman died in John Hunter hospital and a 79-year-old man died in Northern Beaches hospital. NSW Health\u2019s acting director, Dr Christine Selvey, also said 66 crew members on the Ruby Princess have tested positive for Covid-19. Nationally, Australia now has 6,335 people diagnosed with Covid-19, 81 in intensive care and 35 on ventilators.</p> <h2>Queensland extends distance learning</h2> <p>Queensland has extended its school policies for at least the first five weeks of term two, as children prepare to return from school holidays. The same rules from the end of term one will apply \u2013 the schools will be open, but only for essential workers and those who have no other choice. This will be reviewed on 15 May. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria\">Victoria</a> has extended its state of emergency for another month. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">You can read a state by state guide to what\u2019s happening with schools next term here.</a></p> <h2>NSW announces rent relief</h2> <p>The NSW government announced early details of a $440m package to help renters and owners affected by job losses. Renters who have lost at least 25% of their income due to the coronavirus will be protected from immediate eviction if they fall behind in their rent. Instead, landlords and tenants will be required to \u201cnegotiate in good faith\u201d, and can only be evicted if the NSW civil and administrative tribunal is satisfied negotiations have concluded. Owners will then be given a land tax waiver or rebate up to 25% if they give tenants a rental reduction. However, the NSW Labor leader, Jodi McKay, said the plan was \u201cdisappointing\u201d because only 16% of landlords paid land tax. Further details are still to be announced.</p> <h2>Immunity study and treatment trial</h2> <p>Australian scientists will start a national study to determine whether contracting coronavirus gives a person immunity, and how common that is. Professor Sharon Lewin<strong> </strong>from the Apprise Centre of Research Excellence said it would \u201clead a national zero prevalence study to understand how many people really are immune to coronavirus\u201d. Thousands of people will be assessed through a blood test in the coming months. Lewin also said researchers were close to finishing a clinical trial of drugs that could treat Covid-19. She said she was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/australian-researchers-a-few-weeks-from-clinical-trial-results-for-coronavirus-treatment\">actually quite optimistic</a> we will have results at least \u2013 whether the results are good or not so good \u2013 from many clinical trials in the next few weeks\u201d.</p> <h2>Qantas staff consider class action</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/qantas\">Qantas</a> staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/13/qantas-staff-consider-class-action-alleging-airline-failed-to-protect-them-against-covid-19\">have begun exploring legal action </a>after 59 employees and family members contracted Covid-19. The Flight Attendants\u2019 Association of Australia said it was looking at a potential class action against the airline, accusing it of failing to protect staff from the disease. Qantas is about to restart limited international flights to Los Angeles, London, Auckland and Hong Kong.</p> <h2>Sydney swimmers call for beach restrictions to be lifted</h2> <p>Nearly 5,000 residents of Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/sydneys-eastern-suburbs-residents-call-for-coronavirus-beach-restrictions-to-be-relaxed-for-swimmers\">have signed a petition</a> calling for beach bans to be lifted and allow swimming for exercise.

Staff also requested showers be installed so they could wash before going home to their families, but the portable showers did not have heaters \u2013 and Tasmania is cold in April.</p> <p>Staff were also initially working across wards, going from wards that housed people with Covid-19 to wards with no known cases.</p> <p>Veitch said epidemiologists were working to trace the spread from the 60 known cases.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lesser possibility of it spreading from the inanimate environment to people, but we\u2019ll be looking particularly at how it could have passed from person to person through the hospital community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Reports began circulating that the virus may have spread at a party allegedly held by hospital workers, which Shepherd said was an \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and hurtful rumour.</p> <p>\u201cThey feel a sense of failure, like they have been shut down,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cTo have those unsubstantiated rumours on top of that is very upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-three people who were in hospitals in Burnie were transferred to the Mersey Community hospital in Devonport, 46km down the coast, on Monday.</p> <p>Tasmania\u2019s health minister, Sarah Courtney, said Mersey hospital \u201chas the PPE it needs\u201d but had also been advised to ensure \u201cgeographical separation of patients who are Covid positive as well as patients who are not Covid positive\u201d.</p> <p>The defence force was called in to thoroughly clean and disinfect both North West hospitals, with the aim of getting the emergency department running again.

At least one aged care home has told staff they would only provide masks to residents who have symptoms and are in isolation, and recommended staff forgo PPE in other circumstances.</p> <p>Jacobson said those reports were \u201calarming\u201d and there was no reason for aged care homes, which have been given priority access to the national medical stockpile, not to have access to adequate PPE.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/the-coronavirus-response-has-created-a-more-accessible-society-but-how-long-will-it-last\">The coronavirus response has created a more accessible society \u2013 but how long will it last?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Challenging community ambivalence</h2> <p>Before this weekend, it was sometimes difficult to convince locals to take the threat of coronavirus seriously, said Burnie mayor Steve Kons.</p> <p>\u201cThe attitude certainly changed in the last week or so,\u201d Kons said. \u201cBeing an isolated place you don\u2019t have the expectation that you will be impacted as much as other areas.

  "<p>In this moment of global crisis \u2013 when all future plans have seemingly been upended and the fragility of life illuminated with terrible clarity \u2013 there is much solace to be found in focusing on the present moment; meeting each day, each hour, each meal as it comes. Yet, in Brian Greene\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549600/until-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene/\">Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter and </a><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549600/until-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene/\">Our Search</a><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549600/until-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene/\"> for Meaning in an Evolving Universe</a>, the theoretical physicist and author proposes that there is also a type of inner peace to be found by zooming out beyond this moment, this century, this millennium, back to the beginning of time and forward to the death of the universe.</p> <p>As well as offering lucid, detailed accounts of the science behind the big bang, the development of the cosmos, the emergence of life and human consciousness, and the inevitable extinction of the cosmos, Greene\u2019s treatise is motivated by a personal search for equanimity. I recently spoke with the Columbia University professor about the consolations of a scientific perspective when confronting existential angst.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=false&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F04%2F06%2F9781524731670.jpg&amp;title=Until%20the%20End%20of%20Time&amp;author=Brian%20Greene&amp;publisher=Penguin%20Random%20House&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com%2Fbooks%2F549600%2Funtil-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene%2F\" data-alt=\"book\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&is-extract=false&image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F04%2F06%2F9781524731670.jpg&title=Until%20the%20End%20of%20Time&author=Brian%20Greene&publisher=Penguin%20Random%20House&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penguinrandomhouse.com%2Fbooks%2F549600%2Funtil-the-end-of-time-by-brian-greene%2F\">book</a> </figure>  <p><strong>You begin Until the End of Time by letting us into a desire that motivated you for a long time, which you describe as wanting to \u201ccatch a glimpse of the transcendent</strong><strong>\u201d. Was this search with you from childhood?</strong></p> <p>Yes. And it came from an early recognition that we are not permanent, that we lead these finite lives, that we will all one day die. I think this realization hits kids in different ways. For me, it hit me in a sense where I wanted to be part of something that would be lasting, that would have a chance of being permanent.</p> <p><strong>Why did you turn to math to find the answer?</strong></p> <p>When I began to have this love of mathematics, it began to feel like this was the one thing in the world that you could really count on. Because once you prove a mathematical statement, it just is true forever, or so I thought.</p> <p><strong>If much of your life was characterized by a desire to find permanence and meaning in math and physics, you describe in this book a moment of realization that everything, including math, is impermanent. Was this a difficult realization?</strong></p> <p>Yes, absolutely. When I started using my understanding of physics to think about what the far future will be like, I began to realize everything, even mathematical truths, would at some level go away if there was no conscious being to reflect on them. And so that was a descent into darkness for me.</p> <p><strong>But then you turned a corner while writing this book?</strong></p> <p>Yes. In the very, very early stages of writing this book I just had this moment of clarity. Ultimately, I turned a sharp corner into a terrain that is very bright and very hopeful, which is the recognition of how utterly miraculous it is that we\u2019re here at all. How utterly stunning it is that collections of particles can coalesce into things that think and feel and can create wonder and beauty and figure out deep mysteries. It was a real emotional shift.\ufeff</p> <p><strong>A question you pose in the book is: what is the best way to describe existence and reality? As a physicist, you say it is ultimately with reference to the physical laws of our universe. Does that mean you\u2019re a reductionist?</strong></p> <p>I am, but that term needs to be defined appropriately. My view is that reductionism gives you the undergirding for the fundamental ingredients and laws that underlie every process in the universe. But that doesn\u2019t mean a reductionist framing is the right language for gaining insights into love and grief and aspiration and anxiety. Do I believe that those emotions and feelings reside upon the laws and the particles? I do. Do I think that the laws and particles provide the right language for deeply understanding those human qualities? I do not. We need to use the language that\u2019s relevant to the kinds of questions that interest us.</p> <p><strong>I enjoyed the chapter on the emergence of consciousness. As you make clear, the verdict is still out on what consciousness is, exactly. Do you have a preferred theory?</strong></p> <p>The one that really seems most convincing to me at the moment comes from Michael Graziano at Princeton. He basically says whenever we engage with the world, our brain makes a schematic model of what\u2019s happening in the world because it would burst at the seams if it had to include every single detail of everything that we encountered. So, we have these rough schematic models of everything that we encounter, including a rough schematic model of our own brain. Consciousness, he says, is nothing but the schematic representation that our brain holds of our own awareness.</p> <p><strong>A fascinating and equally terrifying idea in the book is that consciousness and thought itself will eventually become physically impossible. What does this mean, exactly?</strong></p> <p>The rough idea is that thought is itself a physical process that involves particles coursing through our brains. We know from the second law of thermodynamics that any physical process always generates a certain amount of heat, a certain amount of entropy, a certain amount of disorder. In the far future, the universe will not be able to absorb the heat produced by the very process of thought. So in that environment, any being that thinks one more thought will burn up in the entropic waste produced by the very process of thought itself. And at that point, thought will no longer be able to take place.</p> <p><strong>It is this idea that brings you, at the end of the book, to consider human life, and indeed all life, as something that will end. I\u2019m wondering how much room for doubt you leave, whether despite everything that human intelligence or any type of intelligence will prevail, nonetheless?</strong></p> <p>Do I have some doubt? I have doubt about everything. In order for me to make headway on understanding the far future, I rely upon today\u2019s laws of physics framed in the equations that we currently have at our disposal, and I allow for the possibility that in the far future those laws will change, and the math will change. And if things change sufficiently, then of course, I have left the possibility that the conclusions that I draw in the book would be affected.</p> <p>\ufeff</p> <p><strong>So obviously, we\u2019re in a time of discord and confusion and anxiety. What solace can people find in dwelling on these questions of eternity and the universe at a moment like this?</strong></p> <p>Watching the news and hearing what\u2019s happening and speaking to friends, I have that deep foreboding, I have that deep sense of tragedy that\u2019s looming and growing by the hour and it is deeply painful. At the same time, I find it useful to take a big step back and see all that we encounter within this larger cosmological story that does go from the big bang and sweeps through today and on to what we could call eternity. And within that larger sweep, I do gain a certain kind of calmness, I do gain a certain kind of a footing that I have difficulty achieving when I\u2019m solely focused on the moment to moment, the day to day.</p>",

Of course, the usefulness of this slightly hidebound allergy to compilation albums crumbles the further one travels from the core of the rock canon. Certainly, if you want to hear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grace-jones\">Grace Jones</a>, a singer who rose to international prominence in discotheques, soaring at the height of her powers, you need to understand how she ruled over discerning dance floors. It makes complete sense then, that a well-curated anthology (including extended, nightclub-facing mixes) would beat any studio record.</p> <p>This double album, complete with outtakes and hard-to-find single versions, provides an unbeatable introduction to the work she recorded during an imperial phase spanning 1980 to 1982, when she made the albums Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing and Living My Life. The title takes its name from the Compass Point studios in the Bahamas, set up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2009/may/22/island-record-chris-blackwell\">Chris Blackwell of Island Records</a> in 1977, which had a solid reputation from hosting such heavyweights as AC/DC, Judas Priest and U2. Beyond rock, it developed a fearsome parallel reputation for producing killer reggae-influenced pop and disco albums thanks to the incredible house band, the Compass Point All Stars, formed round the stellar core of Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, Mikey Chung and Uziah \u201cSticky\u201d Thompson. Out of the many acts who worked with them, including Tom Tom Club and Black Uhuru, their work with Jones remains the peak achievement.</p> <p>Of course the real revelation on this compilation is Jones herself. Her initial tendency as a singer to drift slightly flat is replaced by a sublimely powerful voice that has accrued an incredible grain to complement and contrast her obvious polish. As great as the cherry-pickings of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grace-Jones-Portfolio-Disco-Years/dp/B00RYGDNPM\">her disco trilogy</a> are, no one needs to hear her half-heartedly attending to Send in the Clowns or, God forbid, Tomorrow. Yet her covers of Warm Leatherette, She\u2019s Lost Control and Nightclubbing are desert island discs that mark her out as an incredible conceptualist as well as a performer.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Hurricane (2008)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc61C-VsTko\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cc61C-VsTko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Cc61C-VsTko\">Grace Jones: Corporate Cannibal \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Few musicians celebrate their 60th birthday by making one of their best albums after almost two decades away from recording, but that\u2019s what Jones did with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/24/popandrock2\">Hurricane</a> in 2008. It\u2019s a vital piece of work that engaged with the post-trip-hop end of dubstep, the not inconsiderable legacy of Massive Attack and a hitherto unexplored familial connection with evangelical gospel song. Her radiation of a timeless vigour was reflected in the release of the reworked and remixed Hurricane Dub in 2011. Crucially, however, Hurricane displayed a clear link back to Warm Leatherette, not just in terms of sonic texture and groove, but also in the luxurious presence of the Compass Point All Stars.</p> <p><strong>Slave to the Rhythm (1985)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0XLzIswI2s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z0XLzIswI2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Z0XLzIswI2s\">Grace Jones: Slave to the Rhythm \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>After finishing the Compass Point trilogy in 1982, Jones took a break from recording to concentrate on her acting career.

A concept album of sorts, Slave to the Rhythm, is a collection of wildly different versions of the same song. As befits a project devised by Trevor Horn at the height of his pomp (initially for Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who rejected it), the album is a delightful synthesis of the sublime and the ridiculous. For example, opening track, Jones the Rhythm, features <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/10/ian-mcshane-american-gods-interview-neil-gaiman-adaptation\">Ian McShane</a> (AKA TV\u2019s Lovejoy) giving a sonorous reading from Jungle Fever, the autobiography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/01/jean-paul-goude-best-photograph-grace-jones-nightclubbing\">Jean-Paul Goude</a>, the French photographer and designer.

The booming chassis of gated reverb drums married to pristine, trebly rhythm funk guitar may have been slightly behind the curve when it landed in 1986, but now, decades after the fact, it just sounds superb. Jones had already proved herself a great songwriter on tracks such as Nipple to the Bottle, but here she got to push herself across the full album, ranging from the rampantly pumping I\u2019m Not Perfect (But I\u2019m Perfect for You) to the considered Victor Should Have Been a Jazz Musician.</p> <h2>One for the heads</h2> <p><strong>The Balearic Sound of Grace Jones</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Jw6VvOh_8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8Jw6VvOh_8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Jw6VvOh_8\">Grace Jones: La Vie en Rose (Tom Moulton mix) \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2018/may/17/grace-joness-greatest-looks-a-70th-birthday-celebration-in-pictures\">Grace Jones's greatest looks: a 70th-birthday celebration - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As befits someone with such deep roots in disco, Jones\u2019s back catalogue is studded with nuggets of DJ gold.

The selection is bookended by the equally brilliant Larry Levan garage mix of Pull Up to the Bumper, which effortlessly introduces the wide open avenues and heat haze of high summer in New York City to any environment with a big pair of speakers.</p> <h2>The primer playlist</h2> <p>For Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/listeners-digest-where-to-start-with-grace-jones/pl.u-KVXBBJWsZRxk1VN\">click here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/30hn94T49Pfut2qvvvkav3\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/30hn94T49Pfut2qvvvkav3\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/12/grace-jones-hurricane\">State of Grace, by Miranda Sawyer</a><br></strong>After a bottle of wine and several shots of sambuca, Sawyer, who delivers a typically brilliant profile, gets much more than she bargained for from Jones.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ill-Never-Write-My-Memoirs/Grace-Jones/9781476765082\">I\u2019ll Never Write My Memoirs, by Grace Jones and Paul Morley</a><br></strong>\u201cI was born.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global cases pass 1.85m</strong></h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases worldwide has topped 1.85m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been more than 114,000 deaths globally. The US has the most confirmed cases at more than 557,000, with 22,108 deaths. In the UK, there are more than 85,000 cases and more than 10,600 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>China reports highest daily infections in five weeks</strong></h2> <p>Mainland China reported 108 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, up from 99 a day earlier and 46 reported on Friday. Chinese authorities are increasing restrictions and monitoring in the northern regions bordering Russia, after a rise in people with Covid-19 crossing the border.</p> <h2>France expected to continue lockdown for several weeks</h2> <p>French president Emmanuel Macron is expected to warn on Monday that the country\u2019s lockdown will continue for several more weeks at least. On Sunday, France reported a lower number of Covid-19 fatalities over the past 24 hours, with 315 deaths in hospital over the past day, compared with 345 the previous day.</p> <h2><strong>Spain readying to reopen parts of economy</strong></h2> <p>Some companies are set to resume operations at the end of a two-week halt of all non-essential activity. Spain\u2019s death toll has fallen over recent days, but as a small bump in deaths was reported on Sunday, the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, warned said: \u201cWe are all keen to go back out on the streets ... but our desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Germany has third day of lower cases</strong></h2> <p>Germany\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen by 2,537 to 123,016. That was lower than a 2,821 increase reported on Sunday and marked the third decline after four days of increases.</p> <h2><strong>Top oil-producing countries agree to \u2018historic\u2019 output cuts</strong></h2> <p>The move comes in response to the coronavirus crisis and a Russia-Saudi price war, and with hopes to boost plummeting oil prices. The agreement between the Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners foresees deep output cuts in May and June followed by a gradual reduction in cuts until April 2022.</p> <h2><strong>Judge rules Alabama cannot block abortions during coronavirus crisis</strong></h2> <p>The ruling came after efforts in Texas, Ohio, Alabama and other US states to prohibit abortion services during the Covid-19 outbreak. States have argued they need to conserve medical equipment and potential hospital beds during the pandemic and that abortions are elective medical procedures.</p>",
  "<p>We\u2019ve become used to the images of western cities around quarantine. In the empty streets of industrial and post-industrial societies tightly connected by globalisation, absence has become one of the most powerful metaphors of the coronavirus.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very different story in countries where inequality and poverty are much more acute; where access to a safe and distanced space in which to isolate is limited by poverty, social status and economics, and intimate social connections have a different importance.</p> <p>As part of a series on photographing coronavirus in these places, we have spoken to photographers or asked them to submit their impressions of the images they\u2019re capturing, and the challenges that they face in documenting the pandemic among the world\u2019s impoverished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7f8e3d17448f0b865e5245bcbb1bcb0471d0ba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7f8e3d17448f0b865e5245bcbb1bcb0471d0ba7/0_0_6960_4640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AP photographer Jerome Delay in Johannesburg during the lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AP photographer Jerome Delay in Johannesburg during the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jerome Delay, who is based in South Africa for the Associated Press, is a veteran of covering war, social conflicts and outbreaks of disease.

It\u2019s beginning to sink in.\u201d</p> <p>While South Africa has been quick to introduce tough movement and isolation restrictions to control the spread of the disease, the prism through which that is viewed, in a country with a strong memory of the apartheid era, has been very different.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6eb56b26da62886b3277f72479fbe8f5bc82ed5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eb56b26da62886b3277f72479fbe8f5bc82ed5d/0_0_7462_4977/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A woman pleads with a police officer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman pleads with a police officer to let taxi drivers work in central Johannesburg.

Where this was manageable for the Labor Party, with its history of centralised control and party discipline, it could be a disaster for a truly grassroots party like the Greens. Our Party is our members. 50:50 disenfranchises members on whom we rely entirely for our campaign capacity. The party room outvoting the members on a matter as important as leadership effectively renders them silent and could jeopardise our ability to campaign.</p> <p>On the other hand, an open, inspiring contest of ideas between future leaders will excite our existing members, bring new people into the party, and create space for deeper public debate about politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/adam-bandt-is-well-placed-to-boost-the-greens-electoral-fortunes\">Adam Bandt is well-placed to boost the Greens\u2019 electoral fortunes | Paddy Manning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A genuinely democratic process of one member one vote is one where we all have the same power in determining the leadership.

After being cooped up indoors for months, might we all take a renewed interest in the value of parks and urban green space, as well as the public infrastructure of toilets, drinking fountains and, crucially, hand-washing facilities?</p> <p>Much 19th-century public health theory may have been misguided, based on the evils of imaginary fumes, but it had beneficial outcomes nonetheless. Since the times of ancient Greece, it was widely thought that disease emanated from the earth and was spread through noxious vapours, or miasmas, that came from the soil.</p> <p>\u201cMiasma theory had a huge influence on cities, specifically building materials,\u201d says Christos Lynteris, a medical anthropologist at the University of St Andrews and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Plague-and-the-City-1st-Edition/Engelmann-Henderson-Lynteris/p/book/9781138326125\">Plague and the City</a>. \u201cThe craze for paving streets with flagstones was largely driven by sanitarian logic and a desire to seal in the earth\u2019s poisonous gases.\u201d</p> <p>It was thought that disease could permeate through any structure in direct contact with the earth, so walls were sealed at the surface and buildings were increasingly coated, clad, plastered and varnished, forming an impregnable shield against this invisible enemy. Cracks were great causes of alarm \u2013 not only did they suggest structural fatigue, but also the possibility that deadly fumes might be released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34b1356bcf874a58cf2fba17dd24726aeaf6f2db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34b1356bcf874a58cf2fba17dd24726aeaf6f2db/0_129_1783_1070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drastic measures \u2026 the botched attempt to burn Honolulu\u2019s stricken Chinatown in 1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drastic measures \u2026 the botched attempt to burn Honolulu\u2019s stricken Chinatown in 1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FLHC 26/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lynteris\u2019s study of the third plague pandemic \u2013 outbreaks of which recurred around the world for several decades, killing more than 12 million people in all \u2013 reveals how the disease spawned drastic urban measures. \u201cBurning down parts of the city was one of the most popular solutions,\u201d he says, citing one extreme attempt in Honolulu in 1900. The plan was to raze an infected part of the city\u2019s Chinatown (a plan imbued with racial overtones), <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/history-of-the-cordon-sanitaire-honolulu-hawaii-bubonic-plague-in-1899.html\">but the fire ended up destroying most of the city</a> when the wind changed direction.</p> <p>Other countries experimented with burning down urban blocks to create <em>cordons sanitaires</em>, but once the rat was identified as the main carrier, all attention turned to safeguarding buildings against rodents. \u201cEvery city in the world suddenly had committees of engineers trying to devise ways of rat-proofing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a global craze, spawning thousands of patents in the 1910s and 20s, from drainpipe guards to concrete barriers.\u201d</p> <p>Lynteris is sceptical about how much coronavirus will actually change anything. \u201cEpidemics and pandemics have their own temporality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are very condensed times, then panic dissipates very quickly and people rarely follow up.\u201d He points to the 2003 Sars outbreak, when it was discovered that one residential block in Hong Kong became a site of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d because of the way <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539564/\">contaminated droplets from sewage pipes could enter people\u2019s bathrooms through dried-up U-bends in the drains</a>. Afterwards, there was no overhaul or mass-inspection of plumbing and ventilation systems to stop this happening again. \u201cA one-off pandemic usually has no impact at all,\u201d says Lynteris. \u201cIt has to keep coming back for us to take any notice.\u201d</p> <p>Some are using the current crisis to take a step back and reassess fundamental assumptions about how cities are structured. \u201cThis is the best time ever to think of a walkable city,\u201d says Wouter Vanstiphout, professor of design as politics at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. \u201cCould coronavirus be a catalyst for decentralisation? We have these enormous hospitals and people living on top of each other, but still having to travel long distances across the city to get to them. The pandemic suggests we should distribute smaller units such as hospitals and schools across more of the urban tissue and strengthen local centres.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c/0_800_4123_2474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lester Lefkowitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With travel limited, the local high street has come into its own: corner shops and bodegas are generally proving much better stocked than supermarkets. The pandemic has also made visible other changes that have been happening under our noses. Vanstiphout says his friends who live in central Amsterdam have had a rude awakening. \u201cNow that tourism has stopped and the Airbnbs are empty,\u201d he says, \u201cthey have discovered they have no neighbours. There is no neighbourhood. There is no city. If you subtract the tourists, there is nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has exposed the effects of tourism and migration on cities across the world in different ways. In Delhi, the decree to stay at home has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/india-wracked-by-greatest-exodus-since-partition-due-to-coronavirus\">thousands of migrant workers walk hundreds of miles back to their rural villages</a>, with cancelled work leaving them unable to pay rent.</p> <p>\u201cI think that \u2018global cities\u2019 boosterism will take some blows,\u201d says Vanstiphout. \u201cMuch has been made of this fluid network of metropolitan areas, but there is now more of a sense of the city as a place of safety, a place of home and continuity. This whole thing could be taken as warning against migration, but to me it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s a warning against tourism and the inequality that causes labour migration on a temporary basis; a warning against the gig economy and the devastation of public services. There is something really clarifying about a pandemic: you can see the absolute necessity of a public health service and a proper social welfare system. It creates a very clear picture of what is good.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve been watching the rain outside my bedroom window for several hours. An eerie, familiar feeling haunts me as I observe the outside world from inside four walls.

Parole mandated that I wear a GPS ankle monitor for the first year of my so-called freedom. I would have to make weekly schedules and would only be permitted to go to locations approved for the day.

Some people might wonder whether I find it irritating that people call this house arrest. I don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter how either of us got here or what you call it, it\u2019s painfully difficult just the same.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>At least living under house arrest and two 10-year stints in prison prophetically prepared me for worldwide lockdown</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In prison, I found myself believing that walls were all that existed. They stood unsympathetic to my suffering and closed in a little bit more each day. I simply refused to make peace with them. I resisted, pounding and screaming into their flat, cold, cement faces. I often thought that I would lose my mind from the feeling of slowly being entombed and cut off from the world, but then something happened.</p> <p>As the outside world disappeared, a new one took shape. The inner world within myself surfaced, as if it had always been waiting to do so. The most important lesson I learned during this time was that I had to accept my circumstances as they were, then change my perspective about them. To my surprise when I did this, those once menacing walls, with their obscene graffiti and chipped paint, transformed. They were no longer holding me hostage but offering refuge.</p> <p>Restrictions and stay-at-home orders are the reality, but if we can shift our perspective, our homes become sanctuaries, not prisons. We are not locked in but rather the threat of disease, and hundreds of other harmful things are locked out, distractions and misaligned priorities among them.</p> <p>Solitude challenges you to look at things differently. Before prison, my worldview had been rather limited and selfish. I was known to throw terrible tantrums as I tried to bend reality to my will, but peace depended on my bending to reality. Life wasn\u2019t all about me. I had to learn what was within my control and what wasn\u2019t. I also discovered that time exists in relation to an emotion or experience, and it slowed or sped according to my ability to be present. So, I learned how to flow with it, not rushing nor procrastinating, but fully engaged in whatever was before me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Freedom was finally within my reach when the walls threatened to close in on me again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What did that look like? It was as simple as just paying attention. I read books carefully. I listened to others deeply. I stopped mindlessly flipping through the channels of my mind. I gave my full attention to every activity, no matter how small it might be. Full engagement strengthened my gratitude, and gratitude strengthened my will.</p> <p>Just a few weeks ago I was told that the parole board had approved the removal of my GPS ankle monitor. After hearing the news, I celebrated by making plans to visit friends in Dallas and Austin. I allowed myself to dream again about better jobs, better places to live and a thriving social life. Freedom was finally within my reach when the walls threatened to close in on me again.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m staring out the window and dreading another confinement. Earlier in the week I had spoken to my brother about the unfairness of it all. \u201cWhy is this happening now?! Just when I\u2019m free of the monitor, just when I got my life back together, the whole world goes on lockdown.\u201d He laughed: \u201cBaby sister, the whole world isn\u2019t conspiring against you. A pandemic is not happening just to interrupt your plans.\u201d I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, life isn\u2019t all about me.\u201d After we hung up, I paced the floor as I often would in my cell. I ran my hands over the walls of my small apartment and knew they would either transform into a prison cell or a refuge. I decided that a refuge sounds nice right about now.</p>",
  "<p>The public debate about personal protection equipment (PPE) for health and care workers is in danger of getting stuck in an unhelpful, seemingly irreconcilable, rut. The government is publicly quoting ever-growing figures of how many millions of pieces of PPE are being delivered to the frontline. Frontline staff, and those representing them, are pointing with increasing frustration to multiple instances of PPE not being available when required. The reality is that both are right.</p> \n<p>There is a huge NHS effort to supply PPE to the frontline, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/one-in-three-uk-surgeons-lacks-enough-protective-kit-survey-finds\">gaps remain</a>. It would help if those gaps were publicly acknowledged and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-ministers-must-get-ppe-to-nhs-frontline-says-business-secretary\">reasons for them</a> more clearly set out. It would also help if the work the NHS is doing to fill the gaps, overcoming major constraints along the way, was better understood.</p> \n<p>The NHS hospital, ambulance, community and mental health trust leaders that we represent are responsible for 800,000 of the NHS\u2019s 1.2 million staff. They are crystal clear. Nothing could be more important than every member of their staff having the right PPE when they need it. They will do everything they possibly can to ensure this happens.</p> \n<p>Was the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/revealed-value-of-uk-pandemic-stockpile-fell-by-40-in-six-years\">as prepared as it should have been</a> for coronavirus, including holding the appropriate levels of the right PPE equipment? It will be vital, when the time is right, to explore this question and learn lessons for the future. But given the urgency of the immediate challenges facing national NHS and trust leaders, it\u2019s important to focus on today\u2019s reality.</p> \n<p>The UK has a national pandemic stockpile of PPE which, with the exception of gowns and visors, is well stocked. The issue has been the logistics of getting that equipment to frontline staff. Like every sector of the economy over the past decade, the NHS has centralised the buying and distribution of its core supplies, significantly increasing efficiency. That central supply chain, with its stable and predictable pattern of demand, has served the NHS well in normal times. But as soon as the pandemic hit, with demand for certain items of PPE increasing 5,000% overnight, that supply chain was overwhelmed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"605e4e3b-270c-4c79-9e82-f63377c4bebf\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4LthQbAPKrs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>National NHS leaders reacted with commendable speed and, with the help of the army and the logistics industry, created an emergency distribution system to proactively deliver pallets of PPE from the national stockpile to trusts. Trust leaders tell us that, after an understandable time lag, the majority of their PPE needs are now being consistently met.</p> \n<p>But gaps still remain. There has been a shortage of face visors. Trust leaders know that their job is to do their best with the resources they have. So they have been working with frontline staff to reuse visors and a burgeoning cottage industry of 3D visor printing has grown up overnight.</p> \n<p>The shortage of clinical gowns over the past week has been more difficult to address as, to protect staff, the gowns have to meet a high technical specification. The constraints around securing gowns are a good example of the problems national NHS leaders are currently grappling with.</p> \n<p>China is the only immediate high-volume source of clinical gowns. Specialised fluid-repellent treatment is needed, very high volume manufacturing capacity is required and other smaller source manufacturing countries are placing export bans on gowns. There is massive global competition for gowns, all concentrated on China. National NHS leaders started buying stocks many weeks ago but the delivery is still erratic despite daily freight flights. The Chinese have apparently been delaying consignments to conduct local testing before releasing stocks. There have been instances of stock being mislabelled with gowns seemingly arriving only to find, on opening, that the boxes contained masks. Once actual stocks have arrived, they have to meet stringent safety tests with no guarantee that these will be passed.</p> \n<p>From our conversations, it is clear that national leaders, working closely with the Foreign Office and the Department for International Trade, are leaving no stone unturned to overcome these constraints. But the reality is that, for some trusts, stocks of gowns have started to run critically low.</p> \n<p>National and NHS trust leaders have been working extremely hard to address these shortages. Talking to trusts over the weekend, many, but not all, of those facing shortages received vital overnight emergency deliveries of most of the last remaining national reserve stock of gowns. For some, this was literally just in time.</p> \n<p>Public Health England has now approved the use of coveralls in place of gowns and we understand that a consignment of 200,000 is due for release shortly.</p> \n<p>Trusts are also helping neighbouring providers to ensure gown stock is shared wherever possible. This mutual aid is a key benefit of being in a National Health Service.</p> \n<p>But these are last-minute actions to prevent gown stock from running out, and the stock position for a number of trusts still looks precarious. We understand that more gowns are scheduled to arrive shortly but further emergency measures are being rapidly pursued.</p> \n<p>The shortage of gowns is a specific, current, well-defined and well-known, gap. There is one other key PPE gap \u2013 the delivery of aprons, gloves, surgical masks and appropriate eyewear for the rest of the health and care workforce beyond trusts.</p> \n<p>NHS Providers does not represent GPs, care homes and hospices. But it\u2019s clear that the shortages of PPE have been more extensive, serious and difficult to overcome in these places. That\u2019s due, to a large extent, to the logistics of trying to deliver to more than 50,000 different providers, compared with the 217 trusts we represent, all of which have 24/7 central storage facilities. National leaders are working as hard and fast as they can to solve these problems but it\u2019s taking time. Trusts are helping by sharing as much PPE stock as they can.</p> \n<p>What is the best way forward? National NHS leaders will continue their massive efforts to fill PPE gaps. But trust leaders believe they should be included earlier in helping to find solutions. For example, if there is going to be a shortage of a particular item, then far better to know about it well in advance. </p> \n<p>There is always a risk to sharing potentially difficult information more widely, especially if it reaches the public domain and can be weaponised to attack. But fully enlisting the skill, commitment and ingenuity of trusts to solve PPE challenges is key. And then all those who want the NHS to succeed can join together in ensuring this happens.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 </em>Chris Hopson is chief executive of NHS Providers, the membership organisation for all of England\u2019s 217 ambulance, community, hospital and mental health trusts</p>",
  "<p>Last week, I spoke to Anna Rogers, a Polish-born Londoner who lives in Brixton. She works for a charity called <a href=\"https://www.moneyaande.co.uk/\">Money A+E</a>, which operates across the south of the capital. It offers advice about debt, benefits and other financial issues to people who are often facing extreme hardship. It is a small set-up, with only four dedicated advisers. Since the coronavirus crisis began, the number of people getting in touch has tripled and is rising all the time.</p> \n<p>Rogers spoke matter-of-factly about the defining feature of many who now need her help. \u201cThey are people without any income,\u201d she said. Many are migrant workers who have been sacked by small businesses or had cash-in-hand work \u2013 in, say, the building trade \u2013 suddenly withdrawn. In desperation, some say they would like to return to their countries of origin to be with their families, but that option is cut off right now.</p> \n<p>A lot of them have no experience of the British benefits system, and few of the language skills and insider knowledge needed to navigate it. \u201cThe universal credit system never worked terribly well,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cBut now people are saying that the system crashes, or they can\u2019t upload documents.\u201d Not everyone has internet access, and the sudden closure of public libraries has meant that even fewer people can get online. Even if they manage to do so, there is now an ominous sense that with the system under such pressure, the standard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/almost-500000-people-in-uk-apply-for-universal-credit-in-nine-days\">five-week wait</a> for universal credit is bound to increase.</p> \n<p>So, for now, Rogers and her colleagues have to introduce people to the most basic kinds of help. One fairly reliable source of food assistance, she said, was the array of new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">mutual aid groups</a> that have sprung up at the most local level: \u201cFingers crossed, they can get people some food parcels.\u201d When she spoke about the details of her work, her words had a palpable sense not just of sadness, but of urgency and a clear sense that things were only going to get worse, and quickly.</p> \n<p>The fact that we now rarely leave our homes means few people are aware of what is actually going on all over the country. Our field of vision is replete with statistics, and broad-brush warnings about the near future: from the daily death toll to the warnings from big banks of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/world-economy-faces-5-trillion-hit-that-is-like-losing-japan\">$5.5 trillion</a> in lost global output, to the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/world-economy-faces-5-trillion-hit-that-is-like-losing-japan\">million</a> or so people said to have newly applied for benefits in the UK. A very human crisis caused by Covid-19 is already here, beyond the illness itself, and it demands our attention.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a01c98ee-1da8-4dbb-b816-af3dabe22d9b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6j_jHXV8LMs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To a large extent, it is the result of what many of our politicians have been extolling for years: labour market \u201cflexibility\u201d; a benefits system designed to deter people from using it; and a public sector so underfunded that charities have had to step into the breach. Now, even last-ditch safety nets are fraying fast. The day after my conversation with Rogers, I spoke to Robin Burgess at the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-04-09/hope-is-fragile-demand-is-great-the-challenge-for-charities-during-the-pandemic/\">Northampton Hope Centre</a>, a project that runs one of the comparatively rare food banks that deals not only with \u201cambient\u201d items (cans, pasta and other dried goods) but also fresh food. We had briefly spoken a few days before, when he sent me an image of a box of doughnuts covered in mould, sent by one of the big supermarkets \u2013 a particularly vivid example, he said, of how low his organisation\u2019s supplies were running, and how useless some of the \u201chelp\u201d they received sometimes proved to be.</p> \n<p>Donations from the public, Burgess explained, had largely dried up. A lot of fresh food used to come from cafes and restaurants, but they were now shuttered up. Aside from Morrisons, the big supermarkets tended to only directly donate food that was either past or very close to its sell by date, and often of poor nutritional value. And need was inexorably increasing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about two weeks of supplies, or more like 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have nothing left.\u201d To some extent, he said, what he was facing reflected the growing crisis for charities and voluntary organisations \u2013 who, over the next 12 weeks, are reckoned to face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/rishi-sunak-heeds-calls-to-help-charities-with-750m-extra-funding\">shortfall of \u00a33.7bn</a>. Last Wednesday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, gave them only \u00a3750m. And all the time, the social wounds they somehow have to put plasters over are only increasing.</p> \n<p>When people draw cliched analogies between the Covid-19 crisis and the second world war, they seem to forget some very obvious things. That conflict was characterised by mass mobilisation. Anyone who could work simply had to: the great upsurge in production that necessarily underpins all-out war demanded it. The coronavirus crisis brings the polar opposite: a new world of confinement, silence, closures, lay-offs and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/fraudsters-likely-to-target-furlough-scheme-says-hmrc-chief\">furloughing</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>If you are able to work from home, relatively free of anxiety about your job and so far untouched by either illness or death, isolation might come with compensations: you may, indeed, be living the Sunday-supplement lockdown dream of craft projects with the kids and demolishing your backlog of novels. But that is the experience of a tiny minority, even if it is informing some of the media\u2019s apparent neglect of what so-called lockdown actually means for millions of people.</p> \n<p>Not everyone who instinctively wants the lockdown to be eased as soon as possible is guilty of putting profit before life. It is surely not irresponsible to wonder whether the suspension of everyday existence is not already proving unsustainable, and whether there might come a point when the risks of the virus are outweighed by damage to people\u2019s lives that may prove irreparable. As deaths here and abroad continue to increase, any honest view of our current circumstances must surely be ambivalent \u2013 acknowledging that lockdown is necessary, and it is a miracle that the health service has not already buckled, but also that it is exacting a toll that for many people is already unbearable.</p> \n<p>That applies not just to those who are falling between the cracks, but to many others who will soon be receiving significant help from the government. Ten days ago, for example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jStGMYRSXO0\">I spoke</a> to a single mother who works for McDonald\u2019s, is paid \u00a39.45 an hour, and has been furloughed. Even if Sunak\u2019s job retention scheme ensures that she receives 80% of her average wages over the previous year, the loss of a fifth of her money will have dire consequences.</p> \n<p>She budgets penny by penny and lives month to month. She is already faced with deciding between cooking or heating. Her 13-year-old son has asthma; if the radiators are not switched on in cold or wet weather it gets worse. She spoke with a fierce clarity, and a keen awareness of something she knew far too well: that she is one small part of a social catastrophe so far given far too little attention.</p> \n<p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Look up, we\u2019re told. When confined by walls, fences, buildings, when confounded by civilisation, look up and feel your heart lift.</p> <p>The other day I looked up and saw an air ambulance in descent overhead, sunlit and cowslip-yellow, its downdraughts hammering the roofs of our mill town. I held my binoculars on it for a while \u2013 then noticed, beyond it, like a tiny smut on the lens, a buzzard, working a wide curve on the brink of sight.</p> <p>Our house has no garden, but it came with a lot of sky. Usually the regulars have it to themselves \u2013 black-headed gulls elbow languidly along, pigeons perform cryptic soap operas of flight, antsy jackdaws always seem to need to be somewhere else \u2013 but every now and then we have sparrowhawks, too. Kestrels nest at the foot of the disused mill chimney. Once or twice, a peregrine has sailed in, all burly charisma, show-offy strut. And buzzards \u2013 more than ever, this spring.</p> <p>Today\u2019s buzzard is as low in the sky as I\u2019ve seen one here. I\u2019m out on my walk. I wasn\u2019t looking up until it drifted into my periphery; now I am. I can make out its long-fingered wings and tightly ruddering tail, its maculate underside. As common as anything, these days, buzzards \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere they\u2019re not in Britain \u2013 but a big raptor, up close, will always stop you in the street. This one rides its winding thermal across the double track of a plane\u2019s contrail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/14/winter-scene-through-eyes-buzzard-country-diary\">Winter woods seen through the eyes of a buzzard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of the buzzards I see here come drifting in from the north, over the brink of the great gritstone hummock that separates us from the Wharfe valley. They nose their way warily into our airspace, mentally mapping out the cricket fields, football pitches, wooded parkland below. They are insistently territorial, so I suppose they reckon that in, too \u2013 <em>this is mine now, this is mine now, and this, and this\u2026</em></p> <p>Today\u2019s seems quite at home just a cherrypicker\u2019s height above our sandstone gables. It\u2019s silly, but at this time of human withdrawal I can\u2019t help wondering if the birds are growing bolder. Later, I watch a magpie stroll slowly across a neighbour\u2019s shed roof.

years sub-Saharan Africa is about to go into recession, according to World Bank estimates.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s two biggest economies, South Africa and Nigeria are heading for deep recessions, it said, as demand drops from developed nations for raw materials such as oil and precious metals.</p> <p>The same goes for Angola, Africa\u2019s second biggest oil exporter.</p> <p>Oil prices have fallen to between $20 and $30 a barrel, nearing the cost of production in Nigeria.</p> <p>Following 2.4% growth last year, the estimate for sub-Saharan Africa 2020 is between -2.1 and -5.1 % as the economy contracts.</p> <p>This is in part a knock-on effect from the economic hits being taken by Africa\u2019s main trading partners: China, the EU and the United States.</p> <p>Add to that the slump in the key markets of raw materials and tourism as well as the effect of measures to confine populations at home and you have the perfect economic storm for the continent.</p> <p>The African Development Bank remains less pessimistic but still sees a fall into recession of between -0.7 and -2.8 %.</p> <p>The African Union estimates that around 20m jobs, in formal and informal sectors, are under threat.<br></p> <p>The United Nations puts the figure much higher, at up to 50m.</p> <p>High unemployment and economic slowdown are also hitting African workers abroad, and therefore their money transfers back home, which are often a vital part of the economy.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e92b7668f08db3109f20f8a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p

British aid minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said assisting the poorest nations now would help prevent the virus returning to the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Britain has reported almost 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus so far, the fifth highest national number globally. </p> <p>\u201cWhile our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we\u2019re deploying British expertise and funding
