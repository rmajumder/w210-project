They advised people to avoid international travel and groups of more than 100 people, as well as other measures.</p> <h2>All 50 US states now have infections</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-live-news-updates-uk-us-australia-europe-france-italy-who-self-isolation-travel-bans-borders-latest-update?page=with:block-5e71596e8f085c6327bc1e65#block-5e71596e8f085c6327bc1e65\">The virus reached West Virginia, which had been the last infection-free state</a>.

Ministers announced a plan to relax planning rules amid concerns many will struggle to survive the near-lockdown conditions being encouraged by the government.</p>",
  "<p>The porous Myanmar-China border stretches more than 1,400 miles but coronavirus cases have only been reported on one side.</p> <p>In China, more than 80,800 people have been infected, but according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader, the country has not yet seen a single confirmed case.</p> <p>\u201cUntil now, <a href=\"https://www.mmtimes.com/news/state-counsellor-says-myanmar-still-free-covid-19.html\">no one in our country is infected with Covid</a><a href=\"https://www.mmtimes.com/news/state-counsellor-says-myanmar-still-free-covid-19.html\">-19</a>,\u201d said the country\u2019s civilian leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, in a televised address on Monday.</p> <p>To the country\u2019s west, 114 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in India and five in Bangladesh. Myanmar\u2019s southern neighbour, Thailand, has reported 114 cases.</p> <p>Attempting to explain the anomaly, a spokesperson for Myanmar\u2019s government has claimed that people\u2019s \u201clifestyle and diet\u201d protected them from the disease \u2013 stoking concerns the country is downplaying the impact of the respiratory illness.</p> <p>Zaw Htay, a government spokesperson, also said the common use of cash instead of credit cards, helped curb the spread of the illness. There is no evidence to show that diet or banknotes can stop the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cSuch irresponsible statements clash with everything known about the coronavirus outbreak, defy reality, and only serve to give a false sense of security to the country\u2019s people about the disease and their risks of infection,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/17/myanmar-denials-define-covid-19-response#\">in a blog post.</a></p> <p>Ten patients in Myanmar are currently in quarantine awaiting test results, according to the government.</p> <p>Globally, there are more than 161,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in 150 countries or territories. The World Health Organization said the global threat from the respiratory illness is high.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s public lack of concern has sparked rumours and speculation about the government\u2019s response, leaving many distrustful and unable to make informed decisions for their families,\u201d Robertson said.</p> <p>Aung Aung, a surgeon at Mandalay general hospital in Myanmar, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus-philippines-thailand.html\">told the New York Times</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t think Myanmar has the modern techniques to know whether the virus is here.\u201d</p> <p>Facing questions from reporters, Zaw Htay acknowledged scepticism about the government\u2019s claim there are no coronavirus cases in the country, but insisted it was accurate.</p> <p>Even without any reported cases, the government has banned festivals and entertainment events in April, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2009/apr/14/burma-thingayan-new-year-water-festival\">Thingyan festival</a>, the biggest annual holiday in the country.</p> <p>The government has also started a fund to raise money from the public to support its response to the illness.</p> <p>\u201cI urge those of you who would like to donate to give as much as you can,\u201d said Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>",
  "<p>The owner of the high-end eateries Le Pont de La Tour, Quaglino\u2019s and Coq d\u2019Argent is closing all 38 of its UK restaurants with immediate effect after the government advised against dining out because of coronavirus.</p> <p>The move by D&amp;D London came as the Carluccio\u2019s chain warned it was only days away from major restaurant closures and catering group Compass issued a profit warning after the outbreak forced it to close almost half its business.</p> <p>Des Gunewardena, chairman of D&amp;D London, said it had already closed its restaurants in Paris and New York. \u201cWe fully understand the need to play our part in defeating the spread of coronavirus and the safety of our staff and customers is of course of paramount importance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless it is a desperately sad day for us and for other UK restaurants who also face closure. Our number one priority now is to work closely with government bodies to ensure that the welfare of our staff and their families is managed through this period of uncertainty. We hope the government steps up to the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>His comments came after Carluccio\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51923804\">Mark Jones, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme</a> on Radio 4 that the restaurant chain \u201cwas days away from large-scale closures\u201d without state aid and called for immediate help for the industry from the government.</p> <p>Footfall has been declining \u201con a daily basis\u201d and the government restrictions announced on Monday meant \u201cwe\u2019ll be in a situation where sales start to decline even more rapidly from today onwards\u201d, he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-business-leaders-call-for-dramatic-rise-in-emergency-support\">Coronavirus poses existential threat, says hospitality industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">Boris Johnson has urged the public</a> to stay away from pubs, clubs and restaurants in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. Jones said: \u201cWe understand the role we have to play in public health, so I won\u2019t question the government\u2019s advice on that. But to do that to an industry without any fiscal support whatsoever condemns us to death, effectively.\u201d</p> <p>He urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to stage an \u201cenormous state intervention\u201d, pointing to measures for business announced by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">Sunak did later announce a \u00a3350bn package of state aid including measures targeted at the hospitality sector.</a></p> <p>The Italian chain of 73 restaurants across the UK and Ireland said its sites in London had suffered the biggest declines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Compass, which provides meals for schoolchildren and office workers, said the pandemic had forced it to shut the vast majority of its sports and leisure, and education operations in continental Europe and North America. The division that provides catering to businesses has also been \u201cseverely impacted\u201d because many people are now working from home.</p> <p>Compass recorded 6% growth in revenues in the five months to 29 February but a sharp drop in March will all but wipe that out. It is expecting zero to 2% growth in revenues for the first half, which will translate into a 25% to 30% fall in profits.</p> <p>Half-year operating profits will be \u00a3125m to \u00a3225m lower than expected, the group warned. A year ago, Compass made a first-half operating profit of \u00a3951m. Analysts had pencilled in \u00a31.95bn for the full year but had not produced a half-year forecast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Compass shares were the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index on Tuesday morning, tumbling 20% to 896p.</p> <p>Over the weekend the French and Austrian governments decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/france-closes-non-essential-public-spaces-due-to-coronavirus\">close all nonessential places</a> used by the public, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">Spain declared a two-week state of emergency</a>. </p> <p>Compass, which employs 600,000 people worldwide, provides catering for Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea football clubs as well as the Wimbledon tennis championships and football and baseball stadiums in the US.</p> <p>The group had already warned in November that hundreds of jobs could be at risk from cost cuts because of the weakening global economy.</p>",

It has also led to a sharp decline in business in sectors ranging from airlines to hospitality.</p> <p>Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has already agreed two smaller pieces of legislation to help the US confront the coronavirus crisis with Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives. The $800bn-$850bn package, however, could be more contentious.</p> <p>The Trump administration has proposed a cut to payroll taxes, which fund government pensions and healthcare programmes, and stimulus to stricken sectors of the economy.

  "<p>We are living through a global emergency. There are no easy solutions. Soundbites will not turn the situation around. And all of us have a duty to act in the public interest.</p> <p>So far, the government has, understandably, focused on a public health approach. But we must have confidence in the advice that is being given. This confidence requires full transparency from the government about the evidence and the modelling being relied upon. The last few days of confused messaging and policy-making has exacerbated uncertainty and cannot continue.</p> <p>We need a clear and accessible public safety campaign, along with up-to-date information and clear guidance to the public about the steps required of them. It is good the prime minister has accepted the need for daily press conferences, but it is no use people waiting by their television for advice that is incomplete and incoherent.</p> <p>In addition, the sheer scale of the challenge ahead requires a coordinated national response going well beyond a public health approach. It is no good telling older people to stay at home without an accompanying plan to guarantee their wellbeing. Ministers and departments cannot act in isolation.</p> <p>There should be a coordinated resilience plan on a huge scale, anticipating problems wherever possible and flexible enough to adapt to swiftly changing circumstances.</p> <p>How we provide core public services \u2013 police, transport, childcare, housing, social care \u2013 and ensure a supply of basic goods during a prolonged period of uncertainty is critical. In the absence of clear cross-departmental planning, urgently needed resources will not be allocated quickly enough or put to best use.</p> <p>What is needed is a national plan of action, which the government should draw up as a matter of urgency and publish. This plan should then be coordinated and rolled out through the civil contingency secretariat, the agency responsible for emergency planning.</p> <p>Alongside public health and the provision of core public services, safeguarding our economy is vital. The government\u2019s fragmented, incomplete and insufficient announcements caused huge concern and anxiety, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-business-leaders-call-for-dramatic-rise-in-emergency-support\">especially for those working in the hospitality, arts and entertainment sectors</a>. In future, any new social distancing measures should be announced alongside a comprehensive financial package to help businesses, families and employees.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">The extra fiscal stimulus announced by the chancellor is overdue</a>, but we have to be honest that it is does not go far enough. The chancellor announced no new support for renters, no new money for social care, insufficient clarity for employment support and no new money for public services and local authorities. And for industries most at risk, the government has yet to provide concrete solutions for how it will protect these businesses and the people who depend on them.</p> <p>If the government fails to appreciate that what is now a health crisis will soon be a fully-blown social-economic crisis, then they will have failed to grasp the severity of the situation.</p> <p>The chancellor should commit to making regular financial statements, with updated economic forecasts. That way, Parliament will be able to subject the government\u2019s approach to effective scrutiny and test what further intervention may be necessary to protect jobs and the economy.</p> <p>The scale of this crisis we face means things cannot simply be left to Whitehall. The government should convene an economic taskforce involving councils and devolved nations, representatives of key sectors of the economy, businesses (large and small), trade unions and economists to thrash out the economic implications of the crisis and the stimulus required to maintain investment and jobs for the future.</p> <p>Finally, we need an international response to the crisis. So far, the default position of most national governments has been to take unilateral action. Yet, this is a global threat that demands a global response. If countries with weaker health systems are overwhelmed, we will never defeat the virus. Any geopolitical conflict over this issue must be resisted. It is our duty to be leaders on the world stage helping to coordinate international efforts and an international response.</p> <p>For the Labour party, this crisis will straddle a period of change as we elect a new leader and deputy leader. Whoever wins will not get to choose the circumstances they will inherit. But he or she must rise to the challenge.</p> <p>That is why, if I am elected leader, I am determined that the Labour party will act with the responsibility and care needed to put the best interests of the public first. We will ensure that we are in a position to speak for the country over the practical measures the UK needs by using the expertise from local and devolved governments, the trade union movement, businesses, economists and other key sectors.</p> <p>The role of the opposition is vital in this period. We must be constructive and forensic. We should ask searching and difficult questions; not to score party political points but to give voice to the concerns of the public and because scrutiny and challenge improves decision-making.</p> <p>When ministers are doing the right thing, we should have the courage to say so. When they are not, we should have the courage to call them out. The public interest must come first.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Keir Starmer is the MP for Holborn and St Pancras and a Labour leadership candidate</em></p>",
  "<p>Rishi Sunak last week called his \u00a312bn package to buttress the economy amid the spread of coronavirus \u201ctemporary, timely and targeted\u201d. He was applauded \u2013 for a day. The measures, which included \u00a35bn for the NHS, quickly looked peashooter-sized when, in the current jargon of financial markets, a big bazooka was required.</p> \n<p>The chancellor\u2019s headline policy definitely qualifies as big \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-promises-to-guarantee-330bn-loans-to-business\">\u00a3330bn of loans and loan guarantees for business</a> hit by the coronavirus is equivalent to 15% of GDP. The UK has never seen anything like it, even if similar policies are already being launched across Europe.</p> \n<p>Some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-spending-coronavirus\">last week\u2019s budget measures</a> were also scaled up. Business rates have been scrapped for a year for a large swathe of the economy, covering retailers, pubs, clubs, theatres and restaurants. Cash grants of up to \u00a325,000 for small and medium-sized businesses in affected sectors have also been boosted. Sunak called it a \u00a320bn handout, on top of the budget moves. Householders also get a three-month mortgage holiday if required.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Is it enough? Almost certainly not. Last week\u2019s experience shows that the definition of \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d shifts by the day. And Sunak, to be fair, hinted at more to come in coming days \u2013 specifically for airlines and airports and generally for employees and individuals.</p> \n<p>The latter may be the crucial part in establishing a sense of medium-term confidence in the economy. The US is publicly contemplating sending $1,000 cheques to millions of Americans, a policy that is close to being \u201chelicopter money\u201d. Sunak did not deny the UK could do the same. The technical work, one can assume, is being done in the Treasury.</p> \n<p>The \u00a3330bn loan package can also be viewed another way \u2013 as merely a large sticking-plaster. Loans can alleviate cashflow crises where companies are confident demand will return, but a loan is not a handout. Some employers may decide it\u2019s better for them to shed staff or shut up shop, the behaviour Sunak is trying to discourage. The threat of mass redundancies looks large, with effects that could last years.</p> \n<p>The next logical step \u2013 highly expensive for the public purse \u2013 would be for the government to underwrite a chunk of companies\u2019 payroll costs, an approach that has already been adopted by some Scandinavian countries and France.</p> \n<p>Supporting half of Britain\u2019s wage bill would cost the government approximately \u00a340bn a month, according to estimates by Close Brothers Asset Management, a funding firm. \u201cThis is the sort of protection that might be required to ensure that when we come out the other side, consumer demand returns to pre-crisis levels and the economy isn\u2019t damaged beyond repair,\u201d said Robert Alster, the group\u2019s investment chief.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Adding \u00a340bn a month to government spending would clearly bust current deficit projections but the deficit is not the worry. Bond markets show no alarm at the prospect of governments writing large cheques. The yield of 10-year UK government IOUs is just 0.5%. Indeed, a backlash from the bond market is more likely to occur if the government is judged to be spending too little to protect the economy, not too much.</p> \n<p>Economic orthodoxies, in other words, are being overturned, and we should not be surprised. A global recession is now almost certain to happen in 2020 and some economists are talking a potential hit to economy in the April to June quarter, covering the predicted peak of the virus, of 15%. Again, that is unheard of during peacetime.</p> \n<p>So the outpouring of war-like \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d rhetoric is legitimate. The initial reaction from business groups was favourable, but don\u2019t read too much into that. These policies were \u201cfirst steps\u201d, said Sunak, and they are usually the easiest to take.</p>",

Eight years on The Euros of Everywhere occupies a neat but sickly position, bookended by two global crises.</p> \n<p>There is something extra poignant in their failure. The European Championship was conjured initially out of a spirit of hope, and of internationalism. Henri Delaunay, the first general secretary of Uefa, was hugely enthused by the ideals of the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor to the EU. His championship, the first edition of which eventually kicked off two years after his death, was in some small part a force for integration and progress.</p> \n<p>That skein of idealism has of course been consumed by the urge to expand and monetise this wildly successful arm of the entertainment industry.</p> \n<p>At the end of which Uefa has ended up bringing us this ludicrously distended version, with matches staged 3,200 miles apart, and one quarter-final due to take place at a point east of Riyadh.</p> \n<p>Even before the current crisis this has not been a story of endless growth.

  "<p>Coronavirus threatens the world\u2019s economic life, and current proposals from governments around the globe are failing to match the scale of the crisis. Today, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced \u00a3330bn of loans and that some companies would not have to pay business rates for the next 12 months. While loans help businesses in the short term, they do not compensate for losses and only allow companies to smooth costs over a longer period. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Workers should immediately start receiving special unemployment benefits so they are no longer a cost to their employers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the US, the Trump administration has suggested <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/17/white-house-looking-at-direct-payments-to-americans-for-coronavirus-relief/\">direct cash payments to individuals</a>. Such measures (such as $1,000 given to each US household) help to alleviate temporary economic hardship but are poorly targeted: it\u2019s too little for those who lose their jobs, and it is not needed by those who don\u2019t. During social distancing, the goal should not be to increase demand, since people can no longer spend on many goods and services.</p> <p>Unemployment insurance, or benefits, and paid sick leave policies come closest to helping laid off workers and those unable to work, but they do not prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/uk-employment-hit-record-high-before-coronvirus-struck-ons\">redundancies</a> and do not help businesses. Tax relief, such as the business rate holiday offered by the UK to sectors most affected by the recession, such as hospitality and retail, will help. But there\u2019s no guarantee this relief will be enough to prevent bankruptcies and job losses.</p> <p>There is, however, a radical and targeted solution to the specific causes of the coronavirus global recession: governments should step in as payers of last resort, which means they would cover wage and maintenance costs for businesses facing shutdown. In the context of this pandemic, we need a new form of social insurance, one that directly helps both workers and businesses.</p> <p>So, how does this work in practice? The drop in demand caused by social distancing measures, and a following decrease in output and therefore GDP, is expected to be short, probably for a few months. Governments cannot undo this direct output loss, but they can prevent a very sharp but short recession becoming a long-lasting depression.</p> <p>Absent government actions, and many businesses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/service-workers-coronavirus-us-wages-tips-restaurants-bars\">workers do not have enough liquidity</a> to weather dramatic shortfalls in demand causing mass redundancies. Keeping businesses alive through this crisis and making sure workers continue to receive their wages is essential.</p> <p>The most direct way to provide this insurance is to have governments act as payers of last resort, so that hibernating businesses can keep paying their workers (known in economic terms as idle workers) instead of laying them off, and can keep paying their necessary bills such as rent, utilities and interest instead of going bankrupt.</p> <p>In practice, in the US, the unemployment insurance system is already up and running, making it possible to compute and deliver compensation to idle workers. Workers should immediately start receiving special unemployment insurance benefits so they are no longer a cost to their employers \u2013 even though they stay formally employed \u2013 and no re-hiring process is needed once they can come back to work.</p> <p>Self-employed individuals (such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/the-government-has-abandoned-us-gig-economy-workers-struggle-to-cope\">gig workers</a>) could report themselves as idle and be eligible for this special unemployment insurance. In case of partial idling \u2013 if someone\u2019s working hours have been cut \u2013 unemployment insurance benefits would be prorated.</p> <p>These benefits would be progressive if they replaced a higher fraction of earnings for low-paid workers. This is a desirable feature, as low-paid workers are more likely to be affected by the lockdown (ie less likely to be able to work from home) and less likely to have savings to replace a temporary loss in earnings.</p> <p>In the payer-of-last-resort programme we envision, businesses on lockdown would report their monthly necessary costs of maintenance and receive payment from the government. Necessary costs are rent, utility payments, interest on debt, health insurance (in the US) and national insurance contributions (in the UK) of idle workers, and other costs that are vital for the maintenance of businesses. For partially shut down sectors, governments would pay a fraction of the maintenance costs. The amounts don\u2019t need to be exact; verification and correction can take place once the lockdown is over. Any excess government payment could be transformed into an interest-free loan that could be recouped over several years.</p> <p>There are two reasons why such a policy would work in the case of the coronavirus pandemic. First, it is clear what is driving the shock: a health crisis that has nothing to do with any business\u2019s decision and will be temporary. Second, different industries are affected differently. That\u2019s in contrast to normal recessions, where the drop in demand is widely spread and has no clear timeline.</p> <p>How much would such a payer-of-last-resort programme cost? Based on national account statistics by industry, we estimate that with a nationwide lockdown up to 30% of aggregate demand could evaporate in the US over the next three months, leading to a 7.5% drop in annual GDP.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/pandemic-coronavirus-economy-benefit-payment-workers\">Tear up the economic rule book. This pandemic calls for radical intervention | Ed Miliband</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Compensating idle workers and necessary business maintenance costs would involve government payments of around half of this total. Unemployment insurance replaces about 50-60% of wages, and essential maintenance costs of businesses are probably less than half of their normal operating costs (for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-uk-airports-warn-may-have-to-close-unless-government-intervenes\">non-flying planes</a> do not burn fuel). The total cost for the government would be around 3.75% points of GDP, financed via an increase in public debt. The direct output loss from social distancing measures would in effect be put on the government\u2019s tab, ie socialised. A payer-of-last-resort programme will work if it is limited in time (eg three months), so the cost remains manageable and business decisions are not affected.</p> <p>It would not fully offset the economic cost of coronavirus. No matter what governments do, there will be real output losses. Even if airline workers are paid, the plane rides won\u2019t happen. For other sectors, supply-chain distortions will happen no matter what, due, for example, to quarantine measures.</p> <p>But a payer-of-last-resort programme would alleviate the hardship on workers and businesses. It would maintain the cash flow for families and businesses so the coronavirus shock has no secondary impacts on demand \u2013 such as laid-off workers cutting down on consumption \u2013 and a quick rebound can take place once demand comes back. Business activity is on hold today, but with an intravenous cash flow it can be kept alive until the health crisis is over.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman are economics professors at the University of California, Berkeley</p>",
  "<p>There is only one thing as alarming as the steadily rising tally of cases of coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">around the world</a>: the low numbers reported in places that it could devastate. They may have less interaction with the worst-hit nations than more developed countries. But it may also be that the countries most at risk are least equipped to monitor its spread. Afghanistan, which has reported 22 cases, has only <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/war-ravaged-afghanistan-battles-threat-coronavirus-200316135224827.html\" title=\"\">one hospital</a> which can diagnose the disease, and Covid-19 is ravaging neighbouring Iran.

But poorer countries will suffer more than richer ones. Inevitably people are more susceptible when they are malnourished or already in poor health. Infections spread fast in cramped conditions. Health services which are already failing to meet basic needs will quickly be overwhelmed. \u201cWash your hands\u201d is great advice, but of limited use to the two-fifths of the world\u2019s population who lack access to soap and clean water at home. Unicef says one in six healthcare sites have no functional toilets or hand-washing facilities where patients are treated.</p> <p>The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 shows how widely outcomes can diverge. Worldwide, between 50 million and 100 million people died. But 13 million to 15 million of those may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/22/pale-rider-laura-spinney-review\" title=\"\">been in India alone</a>, according to the book Pale Rider by Laura Spinney. People in parts of Asia were 30 times more likely to die than those in parts of Europe. Leadership and quick reactions still make a difference. Mongolia \u2013 where 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and health services are extremely variable \u2013 moved fast to close its border with China and halt all public gatherings, stopping all flights and closing schools not long after. It has reported four cases to date. An <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/somalia-confirms-first-case-coronavirus\" title=\"\">outbreak in Somalia</a>, struggling to emerge from dictatorship, civil war and terrorism, could be catastrophic.

Treasury officials \u2014 like the rest of government \u2014 were completely blindsided by yesterday\u2019s dramatic clampdown, and were last night hastily considering a range of options that might keep small businesses afloat. One well-placed source told Playbook to expect a \u201cbig economic package,\u201d but admitted full details were unlikely to be ready by this afternoon. \u201cWe will continue to engage with business and are working rapidly to provide more support,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said.</p> \n   <p><strong>Caught on the hop</strong>: The truth is that Downing Street itself was not really ready for this rapid escalation, with events moving at a breakneck speed throughout the past few days.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Initially when we came up with these sort of estimates they were viewed as what\u2019s called a reasonable worst case, but as information has been gathered in recent weeks from, particularly Italy, but other countries, it\u2019s become increasingly clear it\u2019s not the reasonable worst case, it\u2019s the most likely scenario [assuming no change in policy].</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Labour has said the economic rescue measures being announced today must be \u201con a scale sufficient to meet this crisis\u201d. </strong>This is from <strong>John McDonnell,</strong> the shadow chancellor.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP/status/1239821027615653888\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We need unequivocal statement from Chancellor today that people\u2019s incomes will be protected businesses will be fully supported to prevent any going out of business as result of the virus, and it has to be on a scale sufficient to meet this crisis.

The chancellor himself said this was merely the first step, but with many people facing an immediate collapse in their incomes, help cannot come soon enough.</p> \n<p>The British economy is heading towards critical condition: as more and more people start to self-isolate, economic activity is grinding to a halt. Despite knowing about the coronavirus since December, the government has been complacent and sluggish in its public health response. It now needs to act with purpose and pace to put the economy on to life support.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/national-emergencies-britain-government-health-covid-19-1940s-and-50s\">When it comes to national emergencies, Britain has a tradition of cold calculation | David Edgerton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The traditional tools of economic policy are severely blunted. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-bank-of-england-makes-emergency-interest-rate-cut\">emergency cuts</a> in interest rates made by the Bank of England are welcome but insufficient. A fiscal stimulus is likely to be of limited help in the face of collapsing demand as a result of large swathes of the population self-isolating and all households cutting back on expenditure on non-essential items.</p> \n<p>There is no economic orthodoxy that anticipates events of this nature: the nearest analogy is the wartime economy, though even that has its conceptual limitations. So this is a time for economic orthodoxy to be junked. Just as when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">global financial crisis</a> hit in 2008, there is an urgent need for policy innovation. That requires a return to first principles in thinking through the response.</p> \n<p>The twin objectives of economic policy should be to sustain household living standards and to ensure business survival, so that the economy is able to recover once the crisis passes. This can only be achieved with government action on a massive scale. \u201cFiscal rules\u201d are entirely meaningless in such a scenario; there will need to be an expansion in national debt to levels last seen during the second world war. If the economy is put on life support for the rest of 2020, it seems plausible that debt could rise to 150% of national income.</p> \n<p>The first step must be to sustain household incomes where possible. The Tories\u2019 long assault on workers\u2019 rights has left millions of workers and their families exposed to this crisis. About 5 million people are now self-employed and nearly a <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/record-figures-reveal-almost-one-million-workers-on-zerohour-contracts\">million</a> are on zero-hours contracts. In places such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden, governments have acted swiftly to provide income protection; the UK needs to follow where others have led.</p> \n<p>It may be that entirely new methods for sustaining incomes are required. One option would be \u201chelicopter money\u201d where the government directly deposits money into individual bank accounts. This would be akin to a universal income for the period of the crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the same time, the government has many options: it could act to reduce household outgoings. It could introduce a council tax holiday, cut student loan interest to zero and suspend collection, or directly pay utility bills. More radical measures could include suspending all mortgage payments and requiring landlords to reduce rents by 50% for the remainder of the year.</p> \n<p>If the economy is to have any prospect of revival after the crisis, it will be essential to ensure that businesses are able to survive. The immediate steps could include a business tax holiday \u2013 or, indeed, suspending any form of tax collection \u2013 to reduce outgoings. Other measures could include reducing or suspending rents. The government has already said that it will provide a facility for companies to access emergency working capital on \u201cattractive terms\u201d, yet to be explained. </p> \n<p>But with the economy in a nosedive, more radical steps may become necessary. One option would be for the government to provide capital to enable businesses to cover their fixed costs for the duration of the crisis, perhaps in return for equity. With shareholders facing wipeout, dilution of equity in this way is a small price to pay. It would have the added advantage that after the crisis, the government could progressively sell its stake in firms, enabling the national debt to be paid down.</p> \n<p>The nature of the coronavirus crisis demands a collective response in this country and across all countries. Successful suppression in one place can be undermined by an uncontrolled outbreak elsewhere in the world. This moment is a sobering reminder that we have a shared humanity and that the rules of capitalism are merely of human design. The rules didn\u2019t come down from the mountain top. They aren\u2019t carved in stone. We can, and we must, be prepared for a radical response fit for these extraordinary times.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics</p>",

He too is a key figure in the Laver Cup\u2019s Team Europe, along with Alexander Zverev \u2013 a client of Federer\u2019s promotional company who chose to miss the ATP Cup in January to play exhibitions with the Swiss \u2013 Dominic Thiem and Stefanos Tsitsipas. But it is the Spaniard who is the king of Roland Garros.

The FFT said: \u201cWhile no one today can predict what the health situation will be like on 18 May [the scheduled start of qualification], the lockdown measures in force make it impossible to prepare for it and therefore to organise it on the dates initially planned.\u201d The FFT president, Bernard Giudicelli, added: \u201cWe have made a difficult yet brave decision in this unprecedented situation, which has evolved greatly since last weekend.

  "<p>One day, when my daughter was eight, I asked her to help me unload the dishwasher. She moaned, dragged her feet and pleaded for Haribo in exchange for this simple task. I asked her if she knew how lucky she was and told her that, in many homes in Nigeria, girls as young as her were forced to do chores all day, every day. They were not allowed to go to school, or eat at the table, or watch TV. She was amazed. Looking into her face, the horror of what was considered so normal during my childhood really hit me. It was child slavery \u2013 and it continues today. It was for these forgotten girls, trapped in domestic slavery, that I wrote my debut novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-girl-with-the-louding-voice-9781529359237.html\" title=\"\">The Girl </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-girl-with-the-louding-voice-9781529359237.html\" title=\"\">With the Louding Voice</a>.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/children_1935.html\" title=\"\">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO), the number of working children under the age of 14 in Nigeria is estimated to be as high as 15 million, but due to the nature of the problem it is almost impossible to land on an accurate number. A large proportion of these children are young girls, who work as \u201chouse girls\u201d: domestic servants who are often underage and forced against their will into this kind of work. Many of them never see their \u201cwages\u201d, as they are paid directly to agents or family members.</p> <p>I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. I lived in a smart, middle-class neighbourhood, in a house that sat in the middle of a row of terraced houses. Our neighbourhood wanted for nothing. Nearby, there was a well-equipped primary and secondary school, a church with stained-glass windows and stunning green surrounds, a supermarket that sold the best vanilla ice-cream I have ever tasted, paved driveways filled with good cars, a local beach where you could buy the best grilled meat. Pretty much all of the families who lived around us employed domestic servants, who in some cases were girls as young as eight.</p> <p>I remember two girls in particular. Mariam, a maid to our neighbour, and Edna, who worked for another neighbour. It was easy to spot a house girl. Many of them had unkempt hair and were dressed in tattered, dirty clothes. They would stand behind a family of well-dressed, well-fed, well-spoken children, their heads bent, silent.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHRR9i0MhmU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IHRR9i0MhmU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Heart-breaking ... the trailer for the documentary House Girls.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mariam arrived in our neighbourhood one summer when I was 13. She was 11 and small, with a shaved head. When she laughed, which was often, the house would seem to vibrate with her laughter. I had no sister, so I found a sister in Mariam. But Mariam was not like me. While I played and spent the summer visiting amusement parks and hanging out with friends in their palatial homes, she worked every day. I watched as a girl younger than me tirelessly cooked, cleaned and, even though she was not employed by my family, washed my clothes and tended to me. I attended an all-girls boarding school in Lagos, but Mariam did not go to school. She spoke in Yoruba and broken English. She was intelligent and brilliant, and we would play together until the woman who employed her (her \u201cmadam\u201d) would return.</p> <p>Edna was older than Mariam, maybe 19 or 20. Whenever they could, Edna and Mariam would hang out together, stealing moments during a shared chore or on a trip to the local supermarket. When I returned to school at the end of that summer, I remember watching as Mariam stood behind her madam, with tears running down her face.</p> <p>It was the last time I ever saw her. When I came back about six weeks later, Mariam had disappeared. Edna was dead.</p> <p>There were so many rumours about what had happened to them. We heard that Edna had lost her life trying to get rid of a pregnancy. We also heard, many years later, that maybe Edna did not die; maybe she ran away. We also heard that maybe she killed herself. No one knew where Mariam went. It was said that her uncle turned up one day and took her away to work for another family. But there were also whispers that she ran away after Edna died. We heard so many things, but nobody really knows \u2013 and like so many of the underage house girls living and working in Nigeria, Mariam and Edna simply disappeared without a trace. I lost a friend that year, and ever since I have found myself wondering what happened to her, and to Edna.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/the-girl-with-the-louding-voice-review\">The Girl With the Louding Voice by Abi Dar\u00e9 review \u2013 a tale to spark change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Nigeria, many of these house girls have no power, no voice of their own. In their silence, many of them suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse. There have been numerous reports of house girls being routinely raped, starved, beaten and disfigured by the families that employ them. I was haunted by an article about a 13-year-old girl who had been scalded with boiling water by her madam. Not only were her injuries horrific, but in the news story this young girl\u2019s face was blurred out. This was presumably for privacy reasons, but it felt to me almost like a deliberate act to disconnect her from the world, as if to say: here is a nobody, just another statistic to report. This is what fuelled my desire to start writing my novel, the protagonist of which is a 14-year-old house girl called Adunni. I needed to see this girl\u2019s face. I wanted the world to understand the lives of girls like her, and like Mariam and Edna.</p> <p>Domestic slavery is big business. A <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/publications/books/WCMS_575479/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">2017 report</a> by the ILO estimates that slavery generates annual profits of $150bn (\u00a3117bn) worldwide, with $18bn of this coming out of Africa. The employers of these girls argue that they are fuelling the economy, providing a job, feeding a child. Some defend themselves by saying these girls are better off working in homes, rather than on the street.</p> <p>In 2004, the Nigerian government created <a href=\"https://www.naptip.gov.ng/\" title=\"\">Naptip</a>, an anti-trafficking agency set up to tackle trafficking of people across the border. Despite this, and despite the increasing outcry by those Nigerians who are documenting this abuse and sharing on social media, the issue persists. There is a lack of clarity around the minimum age requirement for hiring domestic workers and, as a practice that is deeply ingrained in Nigerian culture, it is often difficult to challenge. In an environment that is steeped in patriarchy, where most of the burden of housework and, in more recent times, financial responsibility falls on the woman, this precipitates the need for the services of a domestic worker.</p> <p>Modern-day slavery is not just a Nigerian problem; it is a global one. In London, a city I have lived and worked in for close to two decades, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/30/number-of-slavery-victims-in-london-up-tenfold-in-five-years\" title=\"\">a tenfold increase</a> in the number of victims of modern-day slavery between 2013 and 2018. As many as 136,000 people may be living in slavery in the UK, with the Modern Slavery Helpline receiving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/25/uk-modern-slavery-helpline-receives-over-7000-calls-in-a-year\" title=\"\">more than 7,000 calls</a> in a year. In 2018, an <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/12/1027271\" title=\"\">estimated 40 million</a> people were trapped in slavery globally. Approximately 70% of these are female; children account for about 25% of this number. There is a clear and desperate need to tackle these global issues.</p> <p>In 2019, a Nigerian television production company, Salt &amp; Truth, released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHRR9i0MhmU\" title=\"\">heart-breaking trailer</a> for an upcoming documentary called House Girls, which highlights the experiences and abuse of house girls in some Nigerian homes. The clip was watched and shared by millions, pushing the conversation to an even wider audience and provoking discussion. This is one thing that gives me hope: the rage of the people who watched the clip, and their recognition that, in Nigeria, this is an issue that needs urgent review and resolution. It is too late for Mariam and Edna, but there are some encouraging signs that the mood in Nigeria is changing, and that girls like them may one day have a voice.</p> <p><em>The Girl </em><em>With the Louding Voice by Abi Dar\u00e9 is published by Sceptre</em><em> (\u00a312.99).

  "<p>TikTok moderators were told to suppress videos from users who appeared too ugly, poor or disabled, as part of the company\u2019s efforts to curate an aspirational air in the videos it promotes, according to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/\">new documents published by the Intercept</a>.</p> <p>The documents detail how moderators for the social video app were instructed to select content for the influential \u201cFor You\u201d feed, an algorithmic timeline that is most users\u2019 first port of call when they open the app. As a result, being selected for For You can drive huge numbers of views to a given video, but the selection criteria have always remained a secret, with little understanding as to the amount of automation involved.</p> <p>TikTok\u2019s moderators were instructed to exclude videos from the For You feed if they failed on any one of a number of categories, the documents show. Users with an \u201cabnormal body shape (not limited to: dwarf, acromegaly),\u201d who are \u201cchubby \u2026 obese or too thin\u201d or who have \u201cugly facial looks or facial deformities\u201d should be removed, one document says, since \u201cif the character\u2019s appearance is not good, the video will be much less attractive, not worthing [sic] to be recommended to new users.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, the documents show, videos were to be removed from the feed if \u201cthe shooting environment is shabby and dilapidated\u201d, since \u201cthis kind of environment is \u2026 less fancy and appealing\u201d.</p> <p>A TikTok spokesperson said the goal was to prevent bullying on the platform, tying the document to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/03/tiktok-owns-up-to-censoring-some-users-videos-to-stop-bullying\">a report from December</a> that showed that the company was suppressing vulnerable users\u2019 videos in a misguided effort to prevent them from becoming the centre of attention that could turn sour. The categories of video suppressed in the latest document are far broader than those revealed in December, however, nor is any mention of bullying, a discrepancy the company attributes to a local interpretation of the wider policy.</p> <p>Other documents published by the Intercept show the extent of TikTok\u2019s former rules requiring moderators to enforce Chinese foreign policy overseas. The site published the company\u2019s livestreaming policies, which instruct moderators to take down \u201ccontroversial content\u201d that promotes Taiwanese independence or is \u201cuglification\u201d of history, such as the Tiananmen Square \u201cincidents\u201d.</p> <p>The language is identical to that used in documents first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing\">reported by the Guardian in September 2019</a>. At the time, TikTok said the documents were old, and had been out of use since May that year, but the Intercept cites a source who indicated that the policies \u201cwere in use through at least late 2019\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, TikTok said:</p> <p>\u201cThe livestream guidelines in question appear to be largely the same or similar to the guidelines the Guardian already reported on last year, which were removed both before the Guardian\u2019s reporting and also prior to when the Intercept says the document was accessed. Over the past year, we have established trust and safety hubs in California, Dublin and Singapore, which oversee development and execution of our moderation policies and are headed by industry experts with extensive experience in these areas. Local teams apply the updated community guidelines that we published in January, all aimed at keeping TikTok a place of open self-expression and a safe environment for users and creators alike.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the guidelines the Intercept presented are either no longer in use, or in some cases appear to have never been in place, but it is correct that for live streaming TikTok is particularly vigilant about keeping sexualised content off the platform.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech unicorn Bytedance, has been trying to separate its international efforts from its Chinese home for at least a year. But many staff, including moderators, are still based in China.</p> <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, the last of those China-based moderators will be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-to-stop-using-china-based-moderators-to-monitor-overseas-content-11584300597\">shifted to other work inside the company</a> shortly, with locally-based moderators picking up the slack. TikTok had already succeeded in moderating all US content from outside China, but relied on China-based moderators for many other countries, in particular to provide 24-hour cover for much of Europe.</p>",
  "<p>Sainsbury\u2019s is closing its cafes as well as meat, fish and pizza service counters to free up its staff and delivery network for essentials as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets\">supermarkets</a> struggle with unprecedented demand during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>In a letter to customers, Mike Coupe, chief executive of the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket chain, said the counters would close on Thursday. From Wednesday, Sainsbury\u2019s will also be restricting shoppers to buying a maximum of three items of any grocery product and two packets of popular items such as toilet paper, soap and UHT milk. Previously Sainsbury\u2019s had limited customers to five items of the most popular products.</p> <p>Coupe said: \u201cWe have enough food coming into the system, but are limiting sales so that it stays on shelves for longer and can be bought by a larger number of customers.\u201d</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s tighter restrictions are expected to be followed by other supermarket chains as many shelves lie empty across the UK. Over the weekend, shortages extended beyond toilet roll, canned food and pasta to fresh meat, flour, frozen vegetables, eggs, sugar and teabags.</p> <p>Aldi has introduced a four items per shopper limit on all products, and Tesco cut its limit from five to two items over the weekend on products including toilet roll, long-life milk, pasta and tissues. </p> <p>Industry insiders said all supermarkets were likely to extend these limits to more products and potentially reduce the maximum number of items each shopper can buy.</p> <p>The restrictions will not be centrally coordinated by the industry as doing so would breach competition regulations. Insiders said government-backed restrictions would take too long to implement and not be sufficiently responsive.</p> <p>One industry source said there was not complete agreement on whether restrictions would help. They said: \u201cThere can be a problem of people going to shops more often, swapping one big shop for several small shops.\u201d</p> <p>As they try to keep up with demand, supermarkets are also expected to reduce the range of products on offer, with options such as wholemeal organic pasta disappearing and potential reductions in options such as single pints of milk instead of two- or four-pint bottles.</p> <p>Waitrose, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco have also called on hundreds of head office staff to help out in stores as they struggle to tackle queues. About 600 John Lewis and head office staff have been drafted into Waitrose outlets, and Morrisons said 500 head office workers were now working in its distribution centres and stores.</p> <p>Waitrose is also asking store workers in 40 outlets to recommend friends and family who can help out for about a month.</p> <p>In a call with the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, George Eustice, on Tuesday, retail bosses are also understood to have discussed ways to protect elderly and vulnerable shoppers.</p> <p>Some chains, including Iceland, have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-supermarkets-banks-early-slots-older-customers\">set aside a couple of hours</a> for older and more vulnerable shoppers to use their stores exclusively. Sainsbury\u2019s said it would set aside the first hour of trading in all stores on Thursday this week for the elderly and vulnerable and would be giving priority to online orders from those over 70 and the disabled. </p> <p>From next week Morrisons is introducing three food parcel options, which can be ordered by phone for home delivery. The Bradford-based chain is recruiting about 2,500 pickers and drivers to meet demand for home delivery via its online store and Amazon.</p> <p>The grocery industry is preparing for a busy period \u2013 which could last months \u2013 after the shift towards home working this week, and the government\u2019s advice to avoid restaurants, cafes and bars has also led to a rise in home catering.</p> <p>In recent days, demand for fresh produce has surged as people shift from takeaway sandwiches or lunch in the staff canteen to eating at home. In usual circumstances, dining out or takeaways make up about a third of what we eat.</p> <p>Fresh produce companies said there was currently no problem with supplies from Spain, where much of the UK\u2019s fresh salad and vegetables come from at this time of year.</p> <p>But there have been some delays in deliveries to the UK as drivers are not keen to leave their home countries, while border crossings have taken longer because of restrictions on movement. </p>",
  "<p>Even as Broadway shows were shuttered and Disneyland was closed due to the Covid-19, most US national parks were open for business on Tuesday, confounding public health officials and worrying park staff who did not want to be exposed to the virus.</p> <p>National parks have become a haven over the past week as the public seeks places to go during spring break. One park employee reported on Facebook that a visitor center at Big Bend national park was full on Monday with hundreds of people. Another shared a photo of shoulder to shoulder crowds at Zion national park waiting to board shuttle buses. (The park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/news/zion-national-park-to-temporarily-suspend-shuttle-operation-to-comply-with-coronovirus-protective-guidelines.htm\">closed</a> its shuttle bus system later in the day.)</p> <p>The only units in the system that have closed in response to Covid-19 are Golden Gate national recreation area, the National Mall and the Statue of Liberty.</p> <p>National park staff who were interviewed for this story but requested anonymity for fear of retribution reported that superintendents in charge of at least two parks had requested permission from the Department of the Interior to close their units but so far no approvals have been granted. The Department of Interior did not respond to a request for comment on its park closure policy. </p> <p>\u201cOur focus is on ensuring park employees are safe,\u201d said Grand Canyon national park public information officer Lily Daniels.</p> <p>Grand Canyon tourists milled around inside the park visitor center yesterday, rode shuttle buses and ate at restaurants.</p> <p>Daniels said that social distancing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/grand-canyon-national-park-public-health-update.htm\">measures</a> taken by the park include limiting shuttles to passengers who can find a seat, paying entrance fees at kiosks rather than at counters, and closing the theater inside the visitor center. \u201cWe are working in close consultation with the Centers for Disease Control,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked about the CDC guidelines on preventing large gatherings of people, Daniels said she was not sure how many people were in the Grand Canyon visitor center yesterday. Grand Canyon is one of the most popular parks in the system with nearly 6 million visitors a year.</p> <p>Many national parks offer wide open spaces that are ideal for social distancing and are not inherently risky environments during the coronavirus pandemic. However, park infrastructure such as restrooms and trash cans require regular upkeep from staff in order to prevent the kind of rapid deterioration that occurred during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.</p> <p>Park employees from units across the country vented on social media about fears for themselves and their community. Many staff live in dorm-like quarters.</p> <p>One low-level park employee who cleans public restrooms wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if I get sick but when.\u201d While park employees in management positions are allowed to work from home, many minimum wage-level workers are forced to come in contact with visitors from all over the world in order to earn their paycheck.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians never go to the frontlines themselves but they often decide to put others in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Tom Myers, who has worked as a physician at Grand Canyon national park\u2019s clinic for 30 years. \u201cIn this case it\u2019s the park\u2019s working poor, all in the name of maintaining the economy. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that southern Utah\u2019s national parks and other popular federal lands are still open prompted the Southeast Utah health department to declare a \u201clocal public health emergency\u201d on Sunday in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus to a remote area where no cases had been reported to date.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned people will come and get sick,\u201d the mayor of Moab, Emily Niehaus, <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2020/03/17/amid-coronavirus-threat\">told</a> the Salt Lake Tribune. While Moab is internationally famous for its proximity to iconic national parks like Arches and Canyonlands, its hospital only has 17 beds. \u201cBeing a rural community, we don\u2019t have the capacity to deal with a pandemic,\u201d Niehaus added.</p> <p>It may be private concessions operators that finally push the Department of Interior to close parks as coronavirus spreads. On Monday, Eastern National, which runs retail stores in 170 national parks, announced it would no longer provide staffing at those facilities. \u201cOur store staff are unable to maintain the social distancing that the CDC recommends in our store while serving visitors,\u201d wrote Eastern National\u2019s CEO, Kevin Kissling, in a memo sent to national park managers.</p> <p>In the Grand Canyon, private outfitters are also taking matters into their own hands.</p> <p>\u201cWe proactively canceled all our trips,\u201d said Dave Logan, owner of Flagstaff, Arizona-based Four Season Guides. \u201cWe decided to do it not only for the health of our guests but also for the health of our guides. We don\u2019t want them getting sick and then spreading the virus around in our community.\u201d</p> <p>The decision is a big financial hit for Logan who depends on the popular spring break hiking season for a large chunk of his revenue. \u201cWe refunded every penny,\u201d he said. \u201cMy company has a sense of personal responsibility in dealing with this crisis. I think everybody should.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has dramatically stepped up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/17/trump-coronavirus-florida-ohio-illinois-arizona-democrtaic-primaries-biden-sanders-live-updates\">US government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak</a> by announcing plans to send cheques directly to American citizens to give them emergency financial aid, while agreeing to purchase up to $1tn (\u00a3830bn) of corporate bonds.</p> <p>The White House said it was preparing to send the payments to Americans within two weeks as part of a vast stimulus package to shore-up confidence in the world\u2019s largest economy as the efforts to contain the disease<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\"> threaten a global recession</a>.</p> <p>At a special briefing in Washington, the the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said: \u201cThis is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me, this is no fault to American workers, for medical reasons we\u2019re shutting down.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking after the Republican senator, Mitt Romney, proposed sending $1,000 cheques, Mnuchin said the value of the payments would be \u201cbigger than what\u2019s in the press\u201d.</p> <p>The handouts are part of a wider $850bn stimulus package the Trump administration is negotiating with Congress. The bank bailout package agreed at the time of the financial crisis \u2013 known as Tarp \u2013 was worth $700bn.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve will also invest $10bn to a special purpose vehicle to provide guarantees that the central bank would purchase up to $1tn of US corporate bonds if required, aiming to smooth the financial markets after weeks of turmoil.</p> <p>Mnuchin also said the White House planned to allow individual taxpayers to defer payments of up to $1m and for companies of up to $10m, in steps that could cost the government as much as $300bn.</p> <p>Speaking alongside Mnuchin at the press conference, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going big. We want to get it done and have a big infusion as opposed to going through little meetings every couple of days. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to go big \u2013 we want to go solid. The country\u2019s strong. With this invisible enemy, we don\u2019t want airlines going out of business or people not having jobs and being able to live, when they were doing OK four weeks ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have ways of getting out money in many ways, very quickly and very actively.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is a rich, complex landscape, a mosaic of heaths, woods, mires, reed beds, salt marsh and dunes that are home to a myriad of flora and fauna from rare birds, butterflies and bats to carnivorous plants.</p> <p>Seven landowners have now joined forces to created what is being billed as the UK\u2019s first \u201csuper national nature reserve\u201d (NNR) on <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/studland-bay/features/lowland-heaths-in-purbeck\">Purbeck Heaths in Dorset</a>. </p> <p>The idea is that by combining the disparate chunks of land, a more dynamic landscape easier to manage in a more natural way \u2013 and much simpler for wildlife to navigate through \u2013 will be created.</p> <p>A stonechat, a bird the size of a robin with a call like two pebbles being hit together, provided the backing track as experts from the National Trust, RSPB and Natural England pointed out the features of the new super reserve from a vantage point high above the heathland on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cIt really is a very special place,\u201d said David Brown, a National Trust ecologist. He pointed out an area of bright gorse that is one of the few homes in this part of the world for the small pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly. \u201cAt the last count there were only 15 of them there.

The concept is not about preserving the landscape as it is but to create the conditions in which it will change dynamically. It is as the changes are happening that some of the most interesting and rare species can flourish.</p> <p>Some of the developments that will be made at <a href=\"https://www.dorsetaonb.org.uk/project/wild-purbeck/\">Purbeck </a>will be obvious such as removing non-native Scots pine. But other improvements will be much more subtle including simply encouraging bare patches that plants liked by the nationally scarce yellow centaury.</p> <p>Brown is keen on the carnivorous plants that can do well here including the sundews. \u201cYou can sometimes see dragon fly wings floating on the surface of the boggy pools.The sundews digest their bodies and spit out the hard bits like the wings.\u201d</p> <p>Birds that do better here than in most places include the Dartford warbler, which dines on spiders that live in the gorse and the woodlark, another lover of tree-cleared ground.</p> <p>The new Purbeck Heaths NNR knits together 11 types of priority habitat to enable wildlife to move more easily across the landscape. This will give wildlife, including the sand lizard and the Dartford warbler a better chance of adapting and thriving in light of the current climate crisis.</p> <p>It combines three existing NNRs at Stoborough Heath, <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/purbeck-countryside/features/hartland-moor\">Hartland Moor,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/purbeck-countryside/features/studland-and-godlingston-heath\">Studland and Godlingston Heath.</a> They will be linked with other nature reserves, conservation areas and a golf course, which manages its rough to encourage wildlife and plant life.

  "<p>Alex Salmond told a court that numerous charges of sexual and indecent assault, and a charge of attempted rape against him were deliberate fabrications or exaggerated.</p> <p>The former first minister of Scotland, who denies the charges against him, told the high court in Edinburgh the 13 charges he faces of attempted rape, sexual assaults and indecent assaults on nine women were false or based on misinterpretation. </p> <p>Originally indicted on 14 charges, he was formally acquitted of one sexual assault after the charge was dropped by the prosecution on Monday.</p> <p>Speaking for the first time in his defence, Salmond told his lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, with hindsight he wished he had been \u201cmore careful with people\u2019s personal space\u201d, but added that many incidents were \u201cbeing reinterpreted and exaggerated out of any possible proportion\u201d.</p> <p>Asked by Jackson why some charges were exaggerations, the former Scottish National party leader said: \u201cSome, not all, are fabrications. They\u2019re deliberate fabrications for political purposes.</p> <p>\u201cSome are exaggerations that are taken out of proportion and I think that the impact of some of the publicity of the last 18 months might have led some people quite innocently to revise their opinions and say: \u2018Oh well something happened to me\u2019 and it gets presented in a totally different way.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond is accused of sexual assault with intent to rape against one complainer, the Scottish legal term for complainant, known as F, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Salmond told the jury the incident at Bute House, the first minister\u2019s official residence in Edinburgh, was based on \u201ca legitimate grievance even if it isn\u2019t what happened\u201d.</p> <p>Salmond denied F\u2019s allegations that in December 2013 in one of Bute House\u2019s bedrooms he had ordered the complainer to lie on the bed, sexually assaulted her by touching her across her body over her clothing, pulling up her dress and kissing her repeatedly after getting drunk on a potent Chinese spirit.</p> <p>Salmond admitted he and F drank the spirit, known as Maotai, but claimed they shared the bottle during a long work session on government papers. One box of papers involved documents from a recent visit to China and Hong Kong and he told the court: \u201cI thought it would be appropriate to toast the correspondence with Maotai.\u201d</p> <p>He claimed they became tipsy, and as F prepared to leave he kissed her on the cheek before they fell on to the bed in a \u201csleepy cuddle\u201d, fully dressed, \u201cfor no more than a few seconds\u201d. They both immediately realised they had made a mistake, he added, and he said she later accepted his apology after she reported the encounter to a senior civil servant.</p> <p>\u201cI have never attempted to have non-consensual sexual relations with anyone in my entire life,\u201d Salmond said.</p> <p>He also made a counter-allegation against complainer H, a former Scottish government official, who has accused him of attempting to rape her during a violent encounter at Bute House in June 2014 and of a sexual assault in the same building the previous month.</p> <p>H alleged Salmond had insisted they drank Maotai together. The former first minister told the court H had made both incidents up. He told the court they had had \u201ca consensual sexual liaison\u201d which took place in August 2013, which H had initiated.</p> <p>They had kissed and caressed each other, he said, but without undressing. \u201cWe both realised it wasn\u2019t a good idea and we parted good friends, with no damage done,\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>He said allegations by one senior Scottish government official, known as complainer A, that in 2008 he had touched her buttocks and the side of her breasts, as well as kissing her on the mouth, are \u201ca fabrication from start to finish\u201d.</p> <p>A\u2019s allegation he had assaulted her while they danced in a nightclub in 2010 was \u201cludicrous\u201d, he said. He would never have assaulted her but this was also a very public venue, and they did not dance together. \u201cIt\u2019s a fabrication, just as she has encouraged at least five other people to exaggerate or make claims against me,\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>He was asked five times by the prosecutor, Alex Prentice QC, whether he considered the feelings of another civil servant, B, who accused him of trying to force her to reenact a Jack Vettriano painting of two people kissing by pulling her towards him.</p> <p>Salmond replied: \u201cI assumed she would find the circumstances as funny [as] I did.\u201d He had earlier told Jackson: \u201cIt was a joke, high jinks, it was a bit of fun,\u201d he said. B had \u201cmisremembered\u201d the event, he added.</p> <p>Salmond told jurors there was frequently \u201cblurring of the normal professional-social boundaries\u201d between him and staff in his private office, because they worked together round the clock, in a high pressure working environment.</p> <p>During his cross-examination, Prentice repeatedly asked Salmond, now 65, whether he had considered the large age gap between himself and the female officials he has been accused of assaulting, who were in their 20s and 30s at the time.</p> <p>Salmond said the age gap was irrelevant as any familiar conduct was \u201cnon-sexual\u201d. Salmond insisted he respected women and repeatedly denied the prosecutor\u2019s assertions that the allegations against him were correct.</p> <p>He admitted stroking the face of complainer D, a civil servant, several times as she slept beside him in a car during a visit to Hong Kong; he did so because he was trying to gently wake her up. He said he pulled D\u2019s curly hair several times too, as a friendly gesture, and had tapped another complainer, J, a former Scottish National party employee, on the nose.</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>Universities and colleges need to prepare their students for a new world of work. Workplaces are becoming more collaborative, data-driven and agile. Employers are looking for staff who are flexible and have soft skills such as problem-solving and team working.</p> <p>Educational institutions are increasingly looking to embed these new ways of working into their curriculums, to give graduates a head start in the jobs market.</p> <p>\u201cOrganisations are having to become more agile and rapid in the way they design, develop and deliver new products and services,\u201d says Andy Powell, cloud chief technology officer at Jisc, which promotes the use of digital technology in higher and further education. \u201cClearly, universities have a role to play in readying students for that new kind of workplace,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Higher and further education institutions are in the early stages of modernising their approach to studying as they look to equip students with the tools needed to thrive in the modern workplace.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://tedi-london.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TEDI-London</a>, a new university of engineering that opens to undergraduates in 2021, learning will be turned on its head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"952a610c725ec8333839646b428e774f2c5669cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/952a610c725ec8333839646b428e774f2c5669cf/211_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SUPPORTING Andy Powell-hi-res (1)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Powell, cloud chief technology officer at Jisc.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Thomas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There will be no lectures and students will pursue their own coursework using an online service called a learning tree. They will connect with subject experts for any queries, but the onus will be on the students to work collaboratively to drive their learning.</p> <p>The traditional academic programme is being reimagined at the university \u2013 a collaboration between King\u2019s College London, UNSW Sydney and Arizona State University \u2013 in its quest to turn out a new type of engineering graduate.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a particular shortage of engineers who have broad skills, who can integrate and who are socially aware. So what we\u2019re trying to do is develop that type of graduate,\u201d says TEDI-London dean and CEO Judy Raper.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that pedagogy will influence how professionals get those essential skills, such as teamwork, leadership, collaboration and being aware of society and how it behaves. And so we\u2019ve turned the pedagogy upside down,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Students will learn primarily through designing and making products rather than theoretically. The campus is based at London\u2019s Canada Water and students will build products to help the area\u2019s goal of becoming a tech-enabled smart city.</p> <p>TEDI-London\u2019s revolutionary approach is a response to the demands of industry, where employers are seeking graduates who can quickly fit into the new ways of working, she says.</p> <p>Employers are particularly concerned about a lack of relevant skills and experience among new employees. Only 18% of executives interviewed in a <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/consultancy/deloitte-uk-digital-disruption-index-2019.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey</a> by Deloitte thought that UK school leavers and graduates have the right digital skills.</p> <p>In light of this, universities are giving students experience of using the latest workplace collaboration tools, such as Microsoft Teams, Google G Suite, Slack and Zoom. These are being widely adopted in workplaces. They allow staff to collaborate on documents and files in real time and hold virtual meetings through video conferencing. Microsoft Teams \u2013 which is free for students \u2013 is being introduced into many colleges as a tool to allow groups of students to collaborate on tasks from different locations.</p> <p>\u201cMicrosoft Teams is a gamechanger for us,\u201d says Vicky Gosling, head of digital experience at Falmouth University, which runs specialist courses for the creative industries. A pilot scheme is running in the university\u2019s games academy, using Microsoft Teams to bring students together to work on designing computer games. The Teams software will be introduced more widely across the university\u2019s courses in September.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a pioneering approach to learning is being taken at the University of the West of England\u2019s faculty of business and law in Bristol. Its \u00a355m state-of-the-art building that opened in 2017 aims to showcase the types of work settings students will encounter once they graduate. The building includes social and learning spaces that allow staff, students and business people to work together.</p> <p>The centre has a number of technology-enabled active learning (Teal) classrooms. These have a screen at the front of the room and six desks around its edges, each with a connected computer so students can work in groups then showcase their work to those on other tables via the main screen.</p> <p>On entering the building, there is a ground-floor cafe and an atrium that shows off the professional workspaces on the centre\u2019s seven floors. There\u2019s a Bloomberg financial trading room, showcase law courts where students can act out court cases and a team entrepreneurship space where students set up and run their own businesses. This is one of the standout examples of how colleges are preparing students for the workplace of today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/transforming-the-student-experience/2020/feb/19/robot-markers-and-online-submissions-what-will-exam-assessments-look-like-in-the-future\">Robot markers and online submissions: what will exam assessments look like in the future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the most critical factor for success in today\u2019s workplaces are the people, says John Sumpter, a subject specialist in digital leadership for Jisc.

Technology simply enables people to achieve their desired outcomes more effectively.

This must change, she argues.</p> <p>\u201cDigital is no longer an optional add to education.

Generations of journalists heard the story from rickshaw drivers, fixers, tea-sellers. The story was that in the forest in the city limits of Delhi, cut off from the world, lived a prince, a princess and a queen. They were said to be the last of a distinguished Shia Muslim royal line. Before moving to the crumbling forest palace, they had taken up residence in the first-class waiting room of the Delhi railway station.

  "<p>A ball is yet to be kicked, but already this AFL premiership season is unlike any other. The sport of Australian football has weathered world wars, recessions and disease in its near 160-year history. And it will survive Covid-19. But the road to liberation will be a rocky one littered with disruption, insecurity and financial hardship. The 2020 season will forever have an accompanying asterisk in the annals of the game.</p> <p>The AFL, like all entities mired in this global health crisis, is doing its level best to navigate waters hitherto uncharted. What we do know is that the AFL season is being reduced to 17 rounds, with each club playing each other club once. Round one, at this stage, will kick off as scheduled at the MCG on Thursday night. Until further notice all matches will be played with no supporters in attendance, as will the remainder of the AFLW season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/aflw-community-rallies-in-face-of-coronavirus-impacted-season\">AFLW community rallies in face of coronavirus-impacted season | Kasey Symons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What we don\u2019t know is what will happen next. The landscape is fluid to the point that it changes not daily but by the hour. It\u2019s conceivable that round one could start but not finish. It\u2019s also possible round one will be delayed indefinitely. Steps have already been taken to postpone state leagues and talent programs around Australia until 31 May. In the AFL there is a resolve to get the show on the road \u2013 in response to a questionnaire put to players by the AFLPA this week, over 80% voted in favour of playing this weekend \u2013 but the only certainty right now is that nothing is certain. If one player tests positive to the coronavirus, the entire AFL competition will go into mandatory lockdown for 14 days. The impact of further positive cases might depend on the efficacy and compliance with hygiene and containment protocols.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got 40 weeks to get a 17-week season away,\u201d AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said. \u201cIf it\u2019s done by the end of September, fabulous. But if we need more time, we\u2019ll do that. That\u2019s our commitment to the industry. This unprecedented community challenge requires unprecedented community response.\u201d</p> <p>In cutting the season to 17 rounds and intending to start the season on schedule, the AFL is anticipating the need to be flexible; it knows it must factor in inevitable downtime. Match-ups in the first four rounds will remain as fixtured, but the remaining 13 rounds will be \u201crecalibrated\u201d in response to challenges that will come. To get the season away, almost anything is on the table. Games could be shortened to cater for clubs playing multiple games in a week. Matches might be played on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. There might be a mini-draft to help clubs replace players laid low by the coronavirus. The grand final might not be played on the last Saturday in September, but in October or even November. How a late-running AFL season will impact on summer sports such as cricket, which in October and November is due to host the men\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup at Australia\u2019s biggest stadiums, including the MCG, remains to be seen.</p> <p>The majority of the sport\u2019s revenue comes from its broadcast deal, so while fewer games and empty stadiums will hurt the AFL and its clubs financially, the focus of administrators is to deliver on their plan for a 17-match season that features finals and produces a premiership-winning club. Even with this, the best-case scenario, the bottom line of all concerned will be hit hard. While the Australian Rugby League is seeking financial assistance from the government for its 16 NRL clubs, the indication is that the AFL will attempt to shoulder its own load.</p> <p>\u201cSome clubs are stronger than others financially but no club could anticipate the way in which this virus is going to reduce our revenues and therefore put out viability at risk,\u201d Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett said on Melbourne radio this week. \u201cThis is an extraordinary circumstance. We\u2019ve been through GFCs, we\u2019ve been through small recessions. I\u2019ve never seen anything as universal as this. Our job is to ensure that this code is able to survive in order that once this coronavirus passes we can resume normal activities. That will place a lot of strain on a lot of component parts in the AFL.\u201d</p> <p>McLachlan, along with other high-earning administrators, is taking a pay cut. AFLPA boss Paul Marsh wants the AFL to be open to a 22-round season if time and opportunity permits, but as things stand the players will also suffer a pay reduction to the tune of around 20%. \u201cIt would be silly of me not to realise that if I\u2019m playing 17 games rather than 22 and in front of no fans, then of course players are going to have to take a pay cut,\u201d Essendon midfielder David Zaharakis said. \u201cThe whole community is affected by this. It\u2019s bigger than us just in football. Everyone is suffering and we are a part of that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-and-australian-sport-a-list-of-the-major-cancellations\">Coronavirus and Australian sport \u2013 a list of the major cancellations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The degree of suffering is yet to be seen. Nobody could have predicted, nor planned for, the way Covid-19 would disrupt and dismantle our everyday lives. But lessons learned from this may alter the way sporting bodies such as the AFL conduct their governance to be better prepared for future crises. Right now, however, we are in it up to our ears. When asked earlier this week how long it would take the AFL to free itself from the effects of the coronavirus, McLachlan answered: \u201cIf I knew that, I should probably be advising Canberra rather than the other way around. This is so uncertain, it\u2019s moving all the time. Even the experts don\u2019t know. You might have a rule book today. It won\u2019t apply tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Tomorrow, anything could happen. For many Australians, AFL and sport itself is a way of life. But in these extreme times we are learning that public freedoms are the first thing to go. For the sake of something far greater, for sports fans around the world 2020 might be about taking one for the team.</p>",

But don\u2019t panic | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The more we read, the more anxious we become.</p> <p>Stoicism is an ancient tool for remaining calm in adversity. Often dumbed down to refer to having a stiff upper lip, or emotional reserve, Stoicism is actually a deep philosophical framework, useful in providing an ethical scaffold for both everyday life and in times of difficulty.</p> <p>Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that was founded by Zeno of Citium, in Athens, in the early 3rd century BC.</p> <p>Stoics welcomed hard times \u2013 they saw their life as training for moments such as the one we are in now, where character, resilience and courage are tested. Stoic philosopher Epictetus said: \u201cThe greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skilful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.\u201d</p> <p>He saw crisis as a way of unmasking who you really are: \u201cCircumstances don\u2019t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Keeping calm</strong></h2> <p>In times like this it\u2019s easy to spiral into anxiety. The Stoics strived for tranquility and believed that our minds are powerful and create their own heaven or hell. Stoics such as the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius lived through the Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD, an ancient pandemic that wiped out a third of the population. Philosopher and playwright Seneca had to deal at close range with despots such as Caligula and Nero (who eventually ordered his death), and both Marcus Aurelius and Seneca had to carry on after the death of their children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They were calm, focused and courageous in the face of carnage. Seneca said: \u201cWe are often more frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in the imagination than reality.\u201d</p> <p>Stoics prized rational thinking, acting on good information and contemplating the situation fully rather than acting rashly or from a place of panic and anxiety. Marcus Aurelius coped by not allowing his thoughts to be overrun by negativity. \u201cThe universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make of it,\u201d he wrote in his nightly diary. Those in quarantine in Wuhan also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/write-a-diary-take-action-hubei-residents-on-fighting-coronavirus-anxiety\">kept a diary</a> as a way of coping.</p> <p>A Stoic would recommend you to be careful of what media and opinions you consume during the virus. Counselled Epictetus<strong>: </strong>\u201cOther people\u2019s views and troubles can be contagious. Don\u2019t sabotage yourself by unwittingly adopting negative, unproductive attitudes through your associations with others.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Ethics</strong></h2> <p>The Stoics believed that humans as social animals were created to support each other. Marcus Aurelius devoted himself to \u201cdo good to my fellow creatures and bear with them.\u201d</p> <p>No plague or injury can do more damage than you do to yourself through acts of bad character. Character is key for the Stoics. They believed that your health and your money can be taken away from you at any time \u2013 but no one can take your character from you. So you need to nurture it. It\u2019s particularly important at times of global emergency where we need to pull together.</p> <p>Demonstrating good character might involve not hoarding scarce goods such as toilet paper. It might mean not taking all the pasta and rice for yourself and leaving none for others. It might mean self-isolating not just for your own protection but to protect others. </p> <p>\u201cWherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness,\u201d said Seneca.</p> <h2><strong>We are all connected</strong></h2> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/leaked-coronavirus-plan-to-quarantine-16m-sparks-chaos-in-italy\">people in northern Italy escaped</a> quarantine despite being ordered to do so, they spread the virus across the country, imperilling other communities. They acted out of fear and didn\u2019t consider the wider good when taking action. </p> <p>Ancient Stoics recognised humans are highly social animals, and we exist and find meaning within our communities. Their philosophy reflected our deep and profound interconnectedness. According to Seneca, \u201cwe are waves of the same sea, leaves of the same tree, flowers of the same garden.\u201d</p> <p>It was no coincidence that when the Chinese sent boxes of medical supplies and face masks to Italy last week, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/chinese-company-donates-tens-thousands-masks-coronavirus-striken-italy-says-we-are-waves-1491233\">the crates were all stamped</a> with this quote.</p> <h2><strong>Quarantine and home isolation</strong></h2> <p>As many of us lock down and go into social isolation to try to contain the spread of the virus, we are fearful about how we might cope for an indefinite period of time away from our friend, pleasures, routines and social life.</p> <p>The Stoics have a lot to teach us about surviving quarantine \u2013 after all, a lot of them were exiled by angry rulers, and faced years trapped in a place and situation not of their choosing.</p> <p>One of the most important Stoic teachers from ancient Rome, Gaius Musonius Rufus, was exiled to the small and desert-like island of Gyaros (in 65, the same year Nero ordered Seneca to commit suicide). Seneca previously was exiled by Claudius to Corsica for eight years, just when his star was on the rise in ancient Rome.</p> <p>Rather than being bitter at his fall from grace, Seneca used his time in exile to enjoy the natural world and think about the nature of life.</p> <p>\u201cNothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man\u2019s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/11/my-week-living-as-a-stoic-like-a-buddhist-with-attitude-but-hard-to-do-hungover\">My week living as a stoic: like a Buddhist with attitude, but hard to do hungover | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also taught him that a bit of deprivation can be an excellent corrective \u2013 as you realise in good times you often become habituated to living a soft, decadent life.</p> <p>In letters to his friend Lucilius, he wrote: \u201cUntil we have begun to go without them, we fail to realise how unnecessary many things are.

It might range from losing a precious piece of jewellery right through to imagining someone you love dying \u2013 in this case, dying from the virus.</p> <p>Negative visualisation was practised by Stoics for a couple of reasons. This includes not only inoculating us to inevitable loss in life, but also enabling us to appreciate the people and things we love. Stoics believed that we are less likely to take someone for granted if we are aware that they may not be in our life forever. We might all be quarantined for quite a while.

However, it is thought that the government will pay for finished ventilators.</p> <p>The combined effort is being coordinated by PA Consulting, a global consultancy has that previously worked on Sir Richard Branson\u2019s high-speed transport project Virgin Hyperloop One and has also helped the UK Space Agency design a regulator for space travel.</p> <p>Firms including Rolls-Royce and the UK\u2019s largest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, have already said they are ready to assist the push to make ventilators in any way they can.</p> <p>The aerospace multinational Airbus asked its engineering and technology teams this week to look at how to help the government equip the NHS for a surge in patient numbers, with options understood to include the 3D-printing of parts.</p> <p>Breas UK, a specialist firm that makes ventilators, said it had increased staffing levels and was moving to a seven-day working week to cope with the demand.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have issued an urgent call to protect health workers in hospitals after finding \u201cextensive\u201d levels of coronavirus contamination in specialist wards and intensive-care units and on equipment ranging from keyboards to gel hand sanitisers.</p> \n<p>The widespread contamination was revealed by more than 600 swabs taken throughout a major hospital in Wuhan, China, as the outbreak swept through the city in February, with patients and visitors filling the wards and nearby waiting areas.</p> \n<p>Despite extra cleaning procedures that were introduced at the 3,000-bed Zhongnan medical centre at Wuhan University, researchers found significant contamination in intensive care units and obstetric wards caring for people with the virus, where nearly one-third of swabs tested positive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A fifth of swabs from wards used to isolate coronavirus patients were also contaminated, along with 17% of swabs from the outpatient lobby. More than a 10th of the swabs from the emergency department and clinical labs bore traces of the virus.</p> \n<p>The scientists found substantial contamination on common hospital equipment too. Tests on swabs taken from hand sanitisers and self-service printers that patients use to print out copies of their medical reports found that 20% tested positive. Keyboards, doorknobs and desktops also harboured the virus, with 16% to 17% of swabs containing traces of the germ. One in eight telephone swabs also tested positive.</p> \n<p>The researchers, led by Xinghuan Wang at the hospital, describe the findings as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034546v1\">an urgent call</a>\u201d to protect healthcare workers. \u201cThese findings suggest that the hospital environment could potentially be a source of virus spread, including among healthcare workers, patients and visitors,\u201d their report states, adding that the results emphasised the pressing need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning and infection prevention training among healthcare workers during the outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-pandemic-visualising-the-global-crisis\">The coronavirus pandemic: visualising the global crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Coronavirus is spread primarily by droplets that are coughed or sneezed into the air by people who have the infection. But the global movement that is under way to encourage regular and effective handwashing aims to reduce infections that are spread by touching contaminated surfaces.</p> \n<p>According to the study, the highest levels of contamination found in Zhongnan should inform others about the most effective cleaning and disinfection procedures.</p> \n<p>Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said there was no reason for hospitals to be contaminated if they had enough staff and resources. But in many cases they did not, she added.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are starting on the back foot. We are not in a good place because of the austerity measures.

  "<p>What\u2019s the best way to respond to a global health emergency? For countries like Italy, Spain, South Korea and Denmark, the answer is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/italy-orders-closure-of-schools-and-universities-due-to-coronavirus\">closing schools and public spaces</a> to limit infection.

Everyone will have to muck in | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The British state has always been good at making shrewd utilitarian calculations. In two crucial moments during the 20th century, the government thought that it wasn\u2019t worth attempting to protect the population in any serious way because the damage wrought by drastic policy interventions would be too great. Both <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/1939-was-britain-ready-for-war/\">Neville Chamberlain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/in-the-event-of-a-russian-nuclear-attack-call-the-aa-710672.html\">Harold Macmillan\u2019s governments</a> made minimal preparations for anticipated disasters: bombing in the 1930s, and nuclear war in the 1950s. In both cases, the government aimed to do the minimum necessary to allay fears.</p> <p>In a roundabout way, they thought the future wellbeing of British citizens would depend on the government\u2019s parsimonious decision to not overinvest in defensive infrastructure. Both governments hoped to avoid war by deterring an attack and by keeping the economy strong. Far better to spend on methods of attacking Germany and the Soviet Union than on buttressing the island against attacks from the air.</p> <p>The Chamberlain government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/62/a3818162.shtml\">foresaw deadly raids</a> \u2013 on a scale far worse than the blitz.<strong> </strong>As enthusiasts for bombing, his government overestimated the damage that the German Luftwaffe<strong> </strong>would be able to inflict. Chamberlain and his advisers assumed that many hundreds of thousands would be dead within weeks of the war commencing; they planned for the mass evacuation of children, widespread blackouts, and anti-aircraft defences.</p> <p>Despite these efforts, the resources sunk into building air raid shelters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/26/air-raid-shelters-were-means-tested-at-the-beginning-of-the-war\">were negligible</a>. Indeed, there were loud complaints from scientist-activists, notably the biologist JBS Haldane,<strong> </strong>that proper subterranean shelters weren\u2019t being built. Rather than building shelters, the government focused on building munitions factories and growing the armed forces. For Chamberlain\u2019s government,<strong> </strong>this was a far more important aim than protecting the majority of the population.</p> <p>The most famous prewar structure was the flimsy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/how-britains-abandoned-anderson-shelters-are-being-brought-back-to-life\">Anderson </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/how-britains-abandoned-anderson-shelters-are-being-brought-back-to-life\">shelter</a>, a set of corrugated iron sheets erected in people\u2019s gardens. It remains an emblematic image of the late 1930s. The shelter was named after the minister responsible for air raid precautions, Sir John Anderson, who had a PhD in chemistry.<strong> </strong></p> <p>One sometimes gets the impression that these shelters were for everyone. But Anderson shelters intentionally reached only a tiny minority of the population. They were supplied to working-class people who had gardens, not to the population as a whole; anybody earning more than \u00a35 per week (around \u00a3300 today) had to pay for one themselves. Likewise, the later <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30082790\">Morrison shelter</a>, which was designed in 1940, was supplied free to the working classes, but most people had no shelter at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be25eccc1e8a5839c231d96e6c672cc81a77e8bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be25eccc1e8a5839c231d96e6c672cc81a77e8bd/0_0_1728_2675/646.jpg\" alt=\"1980 Protect and Survive pamphlet\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In 1980, the government\u2019s Protect and Survive pamphlet was widely ridiculed and criticised as a ludicrously inadequate response to the threat of nuclear war.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IWM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And although <a href=\"https://www.objectlessons.org/conflict-and-protest-20th-century-to-present/adult-s-gas-mask-world-war-ii-original/s74/a933/\">everybody received a gas mask</a>, the civilian gas mask that arrived in a cardboard box was a different beast from those carried by the military and ARP wardens. Their sturdier gas masks came with a separate respirator that was carried in a robust shoulder bag.</p> <p>In hindsight, these preparations might be regarded as shockingly negligent, but what is really remarkable is that the UK, indeed the British empire, declared war on Germany expecting massive civilian casualties. Britain was lucky. There were no gas attacks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/jul/10/the-blitz-rare-colour-photographs-in-pictures\">The blitz</a>, when it came, was much less severe than anticipated, and highly concentrated in parts of London and port cities.</p> <p>This same dilemma arose again during the 1950s, but this time it was about hydrogen bombs: was it worth defending the British population, which was highly vulnerable to attack, by building expensive shelters?</p> <p>Harold Macmillan\u2019s government decided it wasn\u2019t. By the time Britain\u2019s enemies began to develop hydrogen bombs, many of the civil defences from the second world war had been demolished or run down. Macmillan thought the only serious defence against enemy hydrogen bombs was for Britain to develop its own hydrogen bombs to deter nuclear war. As with the second world war, the UK endured the cold war without building mass shelters for the population. New atomic bunkers were built only for carrying on the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170103-the-secret-nuclear-bunker-built-as-the-uks-last-hope\">limited business of government</a>, not for the people.</p> <p>In 1980, responding to mounting political pressure, the government published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/16/protect-survive-nuclear-war-republished-pamphlet\">Protect and Survive</a><em>, </em>a booklet about civil defence that informed citizens about how to protect themselves during a nuclear attack. The booklet suggested things such as painting windows to reflect radiation<strong>, </strong>staying at home and finding the safest place in the house to shelter. It was both ridiculed and criticised by the CND and others as a ludicrously inadequate response to the threat of nuclear war. Rightly so. Yet these criticisms rather missed the point. The pamphlet wasn\u2019t a serious response to the nuclear threat, but a PR exercise in light of the real policy: no shelters would be built.</p> <p>Although the calculation seems cynical in retrospect, the government\u2019s decision was surely correct. We are better off today because millions of tonnes of concrete went into building homes and roads rather than redundant nuclear shelters. In the event of a nuclear attack, shelters may well have kept people alive for months \u2013 only for them to succumb later to a lack of food.</p> <p>Britain has a tradition of cold calculation. Previous governments have displayed a willingness to preside over catastrophic losses of life, and an unwillingness to over-invest in expensive (and potentially unnecessary) defences. Public relations stunts \u2013 whether the publication of booklets on keeping yourself safe, or the Anderson shelters \u2013 hid the real decision-making. These decisions were symptomatic of the government\u2019s long view: it was taking a gamble in the present, based on a belief about the future.</p> <p>How does this relate to British planning for Covid-19? The government\u2019s initial willingness to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">millions be infected</a> and thousands die seemed to echo the callous streak evident in planning for civil defence. But the other side of the government\u2019s response, and its decision not to stop travel and close schools, restaurants and other public spaces, shows its rational unwillingness to crash the economy and bankrupt airlines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/pandemic-coronavirus-economy-benefit-payment-workers\">Tear up the economic rule book.

Some states, like Washington and Oregon, conduct their elections entirely by mail.

Catherine Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the Delaware department of elections, said the state accepts absentee ballots from voters who list one of six pre-approved excuses that do not include a public health crisis.

  "<p>I am a food and drink journalist, but last night I felt more like a grief counsellor. After Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement that the public should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-business-leaders-call-for-dramatic-rise-in-emergency-support\">avoid pubs and restaurants</a>, their owners were bewildered, stricken, livid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/how-best-to-fight-the-economic-impact-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">How best to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn our industry that\u2019s the worst thing he could have done,\u201d said one \u201cblindsided\u201d bar owner who had expected a total shutdown \u2013 an involuntary closure that would have potentially allowed venues to trigger their business interruption insurance.</p> <p>Instead, restaurateurs were left hanging. No insurance. No rescue package. No customers. With the added PR disaster that, as one put it: \u201cIf you stay open you\u2019re seen as someone who doesn\u2019t care about your community or staff.\u201d Hospitality is not alone. Theatres, cinemas, clubs and music venues are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-prompts-more-cultural-institutions-to-shut-doors\">in the same bind</a>. As one friend who works across several of those fields messaged: \u201cFucking hell!\u201d</p> <p>Even while Twitter vented its anger and defiance (Belfast\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mourneseafood/status/1239611869255565314\">Mourne Seafood</a> pointed out it had paid \u00a33.8m in taxes, the majority VAT: \u201cAmount of assistance offered to our staff when we close? \u00a30\u201d), venues and businesses were busy formulating survival plans: to sell meal vouchers, turn bars into bottle-shops, run no-contact delivery services. But be in no doubt, <em>none of this will save these businesses</em> in significant numbers.</p> <p>Last week, I spoke to a national operator with over 15 sites and healthy cash reserves who could ride out a four-week shutdown. Most small independents would go under in a week or two. A few big bland global brands may emerge, battered but functioning. Britain\u2019s independent bars and restaurants are currently doomed.</p> <p>The contrast between the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/europe/coronavirus-france-macron-travel-ban.html\">French government\u2019s response</a> \u2013 \u20ac300bn of state-guaranteed bank loans with the promise: \u201cNo business will fail\u2019\u2019 \u2013 and that of our own government could not be more stark. The piecemeal efforts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-budget-speech\">last week\u2019s budget</a> to protect hospitality and the arts were pathetic. Business rate holidays for smaller operators and statutory sick-pay refunds for businesses that employ less than 250 was a fraction of the action needed. To survive this, such businesses need immediate permission to waive-not-defer (any deferral is simply accruing debt), rent and business loan repayments, utility bills, all tax and NI obligations. Instead, they are left at the mercy of an imploding market. One operator I spoke to, who had contacted HMRC to spread his corporation tax payments, was simply told this was not possible.</p> <p>A few sensible, far-sighted landlords may hold off on chasing arrears. Note: after three months, landlords are liable for the business rates on empty properties, hence the number of charity shops on our high streets. Other bigger landlords and pubcos are no doubt relishing this opportunity to rid themselves of various \u201ctroublesome\u201d tenants. Disaster capitalism will already be planning a bright, shiny post-coronavirus future, looking ahead in a way government finds impossible.</p> <p>National crises are not defined solely by how governments react in the moment but how they plan for future recovery. The priority seems to be to protect the financial sector, presumably in the hope that by late 2021 Tory ministers will be able to tell the nation that, despite harsh sacrifices <em>blah blah blah</em> \u2026 Britain has emerged from coronavirus in a stronger economic position than its European neighbours. A foundational Brexit myth for the ages.</p> <p>But what will that country feel like? In the midst of a national health crisis, when the government is asking engineering firms to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-uk-manufacturers-urged-to-consider-switching-to-making-ventilators\">pivot to ventilators</a>, it is a hard sell asking anyone to care about new Nordic cuisine, craft beer, contemporary dance or techno. But it is not either/ or. As in the 2008 financial crisis, we have the money to fund both. Any prioritisation of need is a political as much as an economic decision. Tanking a huge sector (UK hospitality and nightlife <a href=\"https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2018/10/09/Hospitality-leaders-urge-Government-action-on-unprecedented-pressures\">employs 3.2m people</a>) and its ancillary industries (breweries, food manufacturers, sound and lighting companies, security firms, talent bookers, associated PR and media) will be a deliberate act.</p> <p>We will be left with a gaping hole where Britain\u2019s once world-class food and drink, arts and culture activity thrived. We will be left with only corporate chains of bars, restaurants, gig venues and cinemas, in a world less vibrant, less diverse, less innovative. Dissenting voices will be more fringe than ever. The coronavirus crisis has become a desperate life and death situation for everyone. However the next few weeks and months play out, we also face losing the very things that, for many of us, make life worth living.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Naylor is a Manchester-based food writer</p>",

For those of us lucky enough to be able to go back home our thoughts pass to our exams.</p> <p>Coming from a current finalist like me, a plea for our exams to be cancelled might sound like someone looking for an easy way out. But universities are the ones that have to face up to reality in the middle of a life-changing global emergency. It\u2019s the fairest option we have left.</p> <p>Having devoted a staggering amount of the last four years to my studies, to lose out on the satisfaction of completing them properly would be beyond demoralising. The ideal scenario would have been for exams simply to be relocated to smaller centres or postponed until after the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised\">with this outbreak predicted to peak during exam season</a>, using venues of any size seems implausible, while rearranging exams for as late as the autumn would be equally unrealistic for students expecting to graduate in June.</p> <p>By frantically drawing up plans to test us remotely, universities like mine are desperate to avoid devaluing degrees that we have worked extremely hard to get through. But moving exams online would still put entire groups of students at a huge disadvantage, as well as probably distorting the results. It means that cancelling exams would be the only way of guaranteeing the integrity of our degrees without reducing their accessibility to many students and, most importantly, without harming students\u2019 mental and physical health.</p> <p>Traditional exams, for all their flaws, just about work because everyone knows what we signed up to. Students will have had some say over what share of their marks is taken from exams compared to coursework. To impose a different system on us at this late stage, under these difficult circumstances, would be to tear up any notion of a level playing field.</p> <p>Online exams rely on a false assumption that we all have a stable home with a place to study and the same access to technology. If the libraries and coffee shops all closed, many of us wouldn\u2019t have the resources or the peace and quiet we needed. </p> <p>Likewise, students with disabilities have had to fine-tune how they take exams over many years in order to hold their own within the constraints of the traditional format. They need the discretion of invigilators by their side during exams to help them with any problems that they may have on the day.</p> <p>In subjects such as law, medicine and, as in my case, foreign languages, where a relatively large number of candidates come from families or social circles with backgrounds in those areas, privileged students will surely get a helping hand. How could you prevent a would-be lawyer from asking their solicitor auntie to call in with some advice? Or who\u2019s to stop me from checking over my translations with my French friends?</p> <p>Even if there were a magic solution to each one of these logistical problems, this doesn\u2019t begin to take into account the direct impact of coronavirus.</p> <p>Universities would have to be abundantly clear about the special consideration that would be given to the very many candidates who might be ill, in isolation or have family members in hospital during the revision or exam period.</p> <p>I am especially worried for the students I know, most of them international, who have been affected by this crisis since the start of the calendar year. They have often felt torn between their lives at university and at home, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/chinese-in-uk-report-shocking-levels-of-racism-after-coronavirus-outbreak\">racist incidents and microaggressions</a> adding to their ordeal.</p> <p>What I fear will be true for us all is that it would be irrational and insensitive to imply that how students fare in these exams, faced with these pressures, would in any way be a reflection of how we would ordinarily perform. It shouldn\u2019t have to be spelled out: these are no longer ordinary circumstances. </p> <p>Examiners will do their best to be considerate in their planning and marking but, particularly after limited contact with students, they will find it impossible to allow for the full range of our experiences over the coming weeks and to judge us based on biased essay marathons run in our rooms.</p> <p>In any case, students deserve the chance to focus on looking after ourselves and our loved ones. Young people may be less susceptible to the symptoms of this virus, but we are not immune to the effects of the pandemic on our lives and our learning.</p> <ul> <li><p>Daniel Wittenberg is a languages student at the University of Cambridge</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Few destinations in the world are as closely tied to tourism as Venice.

The financial repercussions of the flood reminded everyone that tourism of some kind is still vital to keep this unique city afloat. Then the coronavirus crisis arrived, initially cutting short the February Carnival, which traditionally kicks off the tourist season. Now, along with the rest of Italy, the entire city is in lockdown, with restaurants and bars shuttered, hotels closed, flights and international trains suspended.

Planning art shows always begins months in advance anyway, and with the important heritage Venice has as an artistic and cultural city, I do not think we will be abandoned by people.\u201d</p> <p>For independent tour guide Stacy Gibboni, there are more immediate problems, like paying the rent on 1 April. \u201cVenice for me was always the perfect city, a place where I can earn sufficient money to live as a tour guide, leaving me plenty of free time to follow my real passion of being a painter,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now my work has disappeared, with no future bookings to take tourists round, especially with the travel ban, as I work a great deal with American visitors. For sure, tourists will return to Venice in the long term, but I cannot count on when that will happen, so I am having to look at other means of earning my livelihood.\u201d</p> <p>The future seems even more uncertain for Gloria Astolfo, who creates handmade jewellery using Murano glass. \u201cI initially closed my workshop and boutique, both right by Piazza San Marco, for the health concerns of my employees, who come into work by bus from Mestre and were terrified about the coronavirus,\u201d she recounted. \u201cBecause we are registered as artisans, there is a special fund that will pay most of their wages for three months but, frankly, I may well be out of business by then with all the bills and rent I have to pay. So I have told them to already start thinking about other employment. I am pretty sure this crisis will last a lot longer than people think, and that afterwards people will simply not want to travel again for a long time. And my business, like all of Venice, relies wholly on tourism, so it is nothing less than a catastrophe.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The peak could be as late as mid-May here, and as other countries are being affected later, it makes the outlook worse</p> <footer> <cite>Francesca Perkhoffer, hotelier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those running restaurants and hotels are trying to remain positive.

Together with our restaurants in Paris and Morocco, we employ 220 people, and we are determined not to lose any of them, but it is difficult to know what to think when each country is reacting differently to this crisis.

So all our clients know we will not reopen for some time,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we have now had to suspend the renovations because of the coronavirus restrictions, I continue to have faith in the future of tourism in Venice. For companies operating in the tourism sector, the outlook is clearly very tough. We have government forms to fill in asking to postpone payments for rents, bank loans, refuse collection\u2013 to give everyone some time to breathe. But the season is lost, and we do not know how long it will last. The peak could be as late as mid-May for Italy, and the fact that other European countries like Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands are being affected later than us makes the outlook for tourism even worse.</p> <p>\u201cEven if we get investment loans, they have to be repaid,\u201d said Perkhofer. \u201cI am curious to see how the situation will improve after corona. It will take a while before trust in safe travelling returns. Will everybody rush to recover lost turnover at all costs? Or will we all think and learn\u2013 how we can improve the quality of worldwide tourism and cut down excessive travelling? For Venice, I am more than confident that we will get back to normal very soon. This unique city is so beautiful, so special, that tourists will come back quite soon, and we are already working on marketing programmes to protect the future for Venice.\u201d</p> <p>That will all be too late for Roberto Meneghetti, a retired <em>osteria</em> owner who supplements his income by renting out a holiday home to tourists. \u201cWith no tourists and no future bookings, I have simply closed up the apartment,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cAnd once all this blows over, I will have to put it on the market to recoup my investment.

  "<p>Early detection and early response. In an ideal world, this will contain an outbreak of infectious disease and prevent it from establishing in a population and becoming an epidemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/we-are-at-war-coronavirus-pandemic\">We are at war with coronavirus. Everyone will have to muck in | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Containment typically involves isolating and testing suspected cases, tracing their contacts, and quarantine in case any of these people are infected. The more thorough the testing and contact tracing early on, the better the chance of containment. These measures work well, especially for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/coronavirus-sars-preparedness-investment-wuhan\">diseases like </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/coronavirus-sars-preparedness-investment-wuhan\">Sars</a>, where symptoms coincide with infectiousness \u2013 it is easy to recognise people who are infected.</p> <p>In the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a>, detection is much harder because some transmission is possible before people show obvious symptoms, in this case a fever and cough. If there are no symptoms, it is impossible to identify people who are infected unless they are tested and their infection is confirmed in a laboratory, which is why <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/visualisations/traveller-screening\">airport screening at arrival</a> is not very effective for Covid-19. This makes the virus much harder to control. Sooner or later, an infected case escapes detection and starts a chain of transmission, and quickly leads to a growing number of cases, which can become impossible to contain. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/how-do-coronavirus-containment-measures-vary-across-europe\">containment</a> has failed in a number of countries and the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic that is here to stay for months, if not longer.</p> <p>So how does an epidemic spread through a population \u2013 and how do we control it? In outbreak analysis, we measure transmission using the reproduction number (otherwise known as <em>R</em>), which tells us how many other people a typical Covid-19 case will infect on average. If one person is expected to infect more than one other person, the infection will grow and create an outbreak; if a person infects less than one other, the infection will peter out.</p> <p>The larger the value of <em>R</em>, the easier the virus spreads through a population and the higher the number of infections. For seasonal flu, one infection leads on average to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404\">1.4 new infections</a>. For Covid-19, one infection leads to 2-3 others in the <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/current-patterns-transmission/global-time-varying-transmission.html\">early stages of an outbreak</a>. How many other people we end up infecting depends on several things: how many susceptible people there are in the population, how long we are infected for (the longer we are infected the more chances there are to pass on the infection), the number of people we come into contact with, and the probability of passing on the infection to those contacts.</p> <p>In order to control the epidemic, we need to reduce <em>R</em> below 1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/05/measles-vaccinations-social-responsibility\">For diseases such as measles</a>, we can achieve this by vaccinating a large enough proportion of the population so that the disease can no longer spread. Exactly what proportion we need to vaccinate to reach community immunity depends again on <em>R</em>. For <em>R</em> of 2, we need to immunise half of the population to interrupt transmission; for <em>R</em> of 3 we need to immunise two thirds of the population to get <em>R</em> below 1.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8e202231034f27dbd07269af48a6660cdb0e40c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8e202231034f27dbd07269af48a6660cdb0e40c/0_149_5304_3182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Covid-19 test kit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In order for tests to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">effective vaccine for </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">Covid-19</a> is unlikely to be available for another 12-18 months at best.</p> <p>Shortening the duration of infection could also reduce transmission, and for some infections, such as influenza, this can be achieved with antiviral therapy. There are currently more than a hundred clinical studies in progress, which could produce therapies that reduce the duration of infection or infectivity. However, both of these control options are not yet available.</p> <p>Another option to reduce the duration of infection is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-government-vows-accelerate-testing\">continued testing</a>; this is a measure that can be effective throughout the epidemic. Finding infected people and advising them to self-isolate for the duration of the infection minimises the risk of them passing on the infection, which therefore slows down the spread. This is again a basic intervention method that we know works well, but in order for it to be most effective, results need to be processed quickly (in the UK it takes 2-4 days to get the results, in Wuhan it is under 4 hours).</p> <p>If we can\u2019t easily reduce susceptibility or duration, we are left with two things: the probability of transmitting the infection upon contact and the number of different people we come into contact with. Both of these are things we as individuals can change by modifying our behaviour. Washing hands frequently for 20 seconds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants\">with hot water and soap</a>, not touching our faces, covering our coughs and sneezes, staying at home if we are sick \u2013 all of these reduce the risk of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"724796f560a194c5e166fa78bae58c05351b83e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/724796f560a194c5e166fa78bae58c05351b83e4/0_214_5448_3269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nearly empty tube carriage during rush hour in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population.\u2019 A nearly empty tube carriage during rush hour in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">Cancelling large gatherings</a>, working from home and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/shutting-schools-would-reduce-coronavirus-transmission-expert\">school closures</a> are all social distancing measures aimed at reducing the number of contacts between people, each of which is an opportunity for passing on an infection. But this will not be a simple case of just cancelling events and closing schools for a couple of weeks. More severe measures will be necessary to bring the infections to low enough levels to keep the pressure off the health-system long-term. As individuals, we must all reduce the number of different people we come into contact with on a daily basis, and be prepared to do so for a prolonged period of time.</p> <p>But what sorts of contacts are most important for transmission? Together with Adam Kucharski, also from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have recently collaborated with the BBC on a massive citizen science project, led by Professor Julia Gog from Cambridge University. Called <a href=\"https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/features/cambridge-perspectives-julia-gog-and-bbc-pandemic-project\">BBC Pandemic</a>, the project collected information on how people of different ages interact with one another in different contexts (home, work, school, other) from over 35,000 volunteers. We have recently been fast-tracking the release of contact data to help inform UK Covid-19 modelling efforts and potential intervention strategies.</p> <p>What we have found in this data is that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces. If those of us who can work remotely start doing so now, it will contribute to lowering overall transmission in the population. Another important finding is that people over 65 \u2013 who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-covid-19-q-and-a-protect-ourselves-vaccine\">particularly at risk</a> from severe Covid-19 illness \u2013 make over half of their contacts in other settings (not home, school or work), such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres. By avoiding these interactions, people who are most at risk from the new coronavirus could halve their risk of infection. By changing our behaviour now, and sustaining these changes throughout the outbreak, we can significantly reduce our own risk of infection, and the risk to others, and by doing so help protect those most vulnerable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/new-data-uk-government-coronavirus-pandemic-measures\">Stark new data made the UK government's U-turn on coronavirus inevitable | Jennifer Rohn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sustainability is key here; these measures may reduce the reproduction number <em>R</em>, but as soon as they are lifted we could see transmission again, and another outbreak.</p> <p>We must all take individual action to reduce Covid-19 transmission and slow down its spread, limit the number of infections and reduce the pressure on the health system so that everyone who needs medical care can get it.

Companies that produce completed medications also keep extra ingredients to ensure they can make their products. After that, the forecast is less clear.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe vulnerability of supply for drugs that people take every day is an issue,\u201d said Rena Conti, a health economist at Boston University. \u201cAnd as China, Korea, Japan and Italy reduce exports of products, either because of facility problems in manufacturing or of staffing their facilities, or for their own national security purposes \u2026 we should expect there to be potential supply shortfalls, which might lead to shortages.</p> \n<p>But, she emphasized: \u201cYou can have a supply shortfall that doesn\u2019t ultimately lead to a shortage.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the US does have a strategic stockpile of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, it contains things like respirators and antibiotics, not blood pressure medications or birth control pills.</p> \n<p>One drug company, Merck, said it was not aware of any significant near-term impacts on the availability of its medicines and vaccines.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have also assessed potential longer-term impacts,\u201d said spokesman Patrick Ryan. \u201cThe situation is fluid, but at this point we do not anticipate impacts to our supply chain unless disruption due to the Covid-19 outbreak is sustained over the next several months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ryan added that for clinical trials, which are often the last option for critically ill people to seeking treatment, \u201cthe situation is evolving\u201d, but the effects have been minor and manageable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/us-states-improvise-coronavirus-trump-federal-leadership-absent\">US states improvise rules to combat coronavirus in absence of federal leadership</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cAt this point, we do not believe that any of our global studies are at risk,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert and senior pharmacy director at the University of Chicago, said the situation is \u201chighlighting how fragile our direct supply chain can be\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US has long faced drug shortages, but mostly in hospitals, where doctors cannot always find drugs in their preferred dosage or have to use substitutes that serve the same purpose, she said. That is time-consuming and difficult.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the main concern is are we going to pile on a whole bunch of new shortages on top of what we already have,\u201d Fox said.</p> \n<p>Drug experts say the FDA has far too little information about the percentage of drugs in use in the US that are reliant on facilities abroad.</p> \n<p>Medicines are manufactured in three steps. First, raw biochemical ingredients are made and turned into \u2018intermediaries\u2019. Second, the intermediaries are then turned into an active form that is not readily consumable by patients. Last, those active ingredients are converted into consumable forms. Each step can happen in a different country.</p> \n<p>US regulators know what facilities are licensed to produce medications, but they do not know how much of a given ingredient or drug they are making in a particular month.</p> \n<p>The US has only about 14% of the sites that turn ingredients into their active forms, and India and China have nearly half, according to a study on generic drugs \u2013 which are the vast majority of what Americans take \u2013 that Conti and other researchers presented to the FDA earlier this month.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only way that we know where specific products are made is to go and ask the companies themselves who are making them,\u201d Conti said. \u201cHistorically, pharmaceutical companies have viewed the location of manufacturing of their individual products as being a trade secret and the FDA has generally agreed with them.\u201d</p> \n<p>US lawmakers have for years been aware of the regulatory system\u2019s knowledge gaps about drug supplies. They highlighted the problems as recently as October in a House committee hearing. Several legislators earlier this month proposed measures aimed at preventing shortages.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated how susceptible our nation\u2019s drug supply chain is to disruptions that could have devastating impacts on our public health because of our overreliance on China for generic drugs \u2026\u201d said sponsor Anna Eshoo, a California congresswoman. \u201cThis legislation takes some first steps to increase what information the federal government needs to receive from drug manufacturers about ongoing shortages and requires manufacturers to have risk management plans to mitigate the impact of drug shortages that affect the American people.\u201d</p>",

Her parents didn\u2019t plan to stay long, but like other Koreans working for companies such as Samsung or Hyundai, once her younger brother was born and the children were in school, they changed their minds. The family moved to New Malden, a corner of south west London now commonly known as Korea Town, thanks to a large proportion of the UK\u2019s small Korean community \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">numbering </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">45,000</a> \u2013 settling there.</p> <p>It was a comfortable childhood, but her mother\u2019s poor English meant Kwon had to deal with things like council tax and doctors.

She now lives in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, works in the media and has a diverse range of friends across the capital and in Korea. Yet ask her today if she feels more British or Korean, and she says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t split the two. It would be like chopping off a hand.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago Kwon decided to run as a local councillor, having coming late to politics. She joined the Labour party in 2014, and the following year became an active member of her local branch in Hammersmith and Fulham, where she had lived for six years.</p> <p>She says it took her so long to get into politics partly because she couldn\u2019t vote until her mid 20s, when she became a British citizen. Until 2010, she didn\u2019t feel she needed to do anything as she thought that the right people where in charge. Then, she says, things changed. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m finally grown up, I pay my taxes and I\u2019m very upset about austerity\u2019 (although it didn\u2019t really affect me). I was also worried about the local Charing Cross hospital, which was threatened with being closed or downgraded. I knew a Labour leadership election was coming up and I didn\u2019t think they had the right leader at the time.\u201d She backed Liz Kendall in the leadership contest that saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn sweep to victory</a>.</p> <p>Locally, the Labour party was very welcoming, she adds. \u201cThey had just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/jun/01/hammersmith-and-fulham-tories-reveal-true-colours-as-labour-prepares-to-take-their-place\" title=\"\">won back control of Hammersmith and Fulham</a>, which had been David Cameron\u2019s flagship Tory council, so there was lots of enthusiam and hope.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b594535c87ef91c51732a4d16a1ecda6c414c4e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b594535c87ef91c51732a4d16a1ecda6c414c4e1/0_167_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Keir Starmer is the leader the Labour party needs at the moment.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kwon threw herself into campaigning for the local hospital and against a third runway at Heathrow and when the party was looking for new ward councillors she put herself forward, although she assumed someone as new to politics as herself didn\u2019t stand a chance. \u201cTurns out they liked the fact I was an active member of the party, Korean and a woman,\u201d she says. She was selected for her own Ravenscourt Park ward to stand in the 2018 local elections. The ward had been Conservative for 12 years, but <a href=\"https://www.andyslaughter.co.uk/blog/2019/10/21/hammersmith-brexit-survey-results-and-johnsons-deal/\" title=\"\">had voted 80% remain</a><a href=\"https://www.andyslaughter.co.uk/blog/2019/10/21/hammersmith-brexit-survey-results-and-johnsons-deal/\" title=\"\"> in the 2016 EU referendum,</a> so was a target for both Labour and the Lib Dems.</p> <p>\u201cI took my mother to the count in the town hall. We heard at 2am that we\u2019d won. It was very dramatic. All three Labour candidates were elected. I cried when the results were read out,\u201d she recalls. Kwon holds the title of the first British Korean councillor by 12 hours; shortly after her victory, Jaesung Ha was elected as a Lib Dem councillor in New Malden.</p> <p>Kwon says it never occurred to her to stand in the ward where she\u2019d grown up with a predominantly Korean population. But a letter she received from a Korean women living in another borough who was having problems with her benefits made Kwon aware that she is a Korean councillor as well as a Ravenscourt Park one. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help her because I\u2019m not her councillor, so I passed it on to her local Labour MP. But if there are things I can do to help the Korean community, I will. I\u2019m afraid that many older Koreans don\u2019t ask for help. It\u2019s an ageing population, but most don\u2019t want to make a fuss and will try and sort out issues within the community,\u201d she says. </p> <p>The last few weeks have been difficult for those with friends and family in Korea with the spread of the coronavirus. Kwon\u2019s brother, who lives there and presents a daily radio show, has had to postpone his wedding, but no one she knows in the country \u2013 which has been testing 20,000 people a day \u2013 has tested positive. It now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/european-countries-take-radical-steps-to-combat-coronavirus\" title=\"\">more recoveries than new infections</a>.</p> <p>Are there any lessons for the UK? \u201cThe Korean response is best summed up as \u2018panic and act fast\u2019. Korea took the virus incredibly seriously from the start. The country is very agile and dynamic in the way that it responds to events. The British government looks slow in comparison, but I\u2019m not an expert,\u201d she replies.</p> <p>Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago, Kwon has an interest in lifestyle and health and sits on the council\u2019s health and social care committee. She has enrolled on a pilot for a year-long weight loss and diet restriction programme, and hopes to be medication-free by the end of it.

I want us to be a really good opposition. I don\u2019t want any legislation to go without forensic scrutiny.\u201d Asked if she hopes to be a cabinet member, or an MP one day, she replies: \u201cI don\u2019t have a grand master plan. I\u2019d like to get re-elected as a councillor in 2022 and then see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>As for a Korean role model \u2013 maybe a Parasite actor or a K-pop star? \u201cI\u2019ve been mistaken for the US-Korean comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/29/margaret-cho-review-comedy-box-bristol\" title=\"\">Margaret Cho</a>, but it has to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jun/14/ban-ki-moon-united-nations-world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul\" title=\"\">Ban Ki-moon</a>, the former UN secretary general.

  "<p>A United Nations agency has voiced alarm after a migrant boat stranded in Maltese waters carrying 49 people was returned to Libya, where hundreds have gone missing since the start of the year.</p> <p>The International Organization for Migration said it was \u201calarmed by this apparent breach of international law\u201d, after the wooden boat was sent back to Libya on Sunday.

Two-thirds said they did not have gloves, masks, soap, goggles or scrubs.</p> <p>At the University Hospital of Caracas 80% of health workers are without protective equipment to treat patients who could be contagious. \u201cThe stretcher bearer should wear a face mask, a disposable gown and gloves; the orderly who collects the waste must wear glasses and gloves \u2013 but none of that exists at the moment,\u201d said Mauro Zambrano, a representative of the Union of Hospital and Clinic Workers.</p> <p>On Monday workers in at least two hospitals in Caracas were resorting to making their own masks from items that had been donated. \u201cWe are looking for solutions,\u201d Zambrano said. Hospitals across the country have started online campaigns to bring in supplies.</p> <p>Few know for certain how broken the health system is, owing to the opacity of the administration of the embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.

It is unclear how the international community will respond to the outbreak in Venezuela, or which leader it would be prepared to work with.</p> <p>Maduro, announcing flight bans in response to the pandemic, said US sanctions were hurting his administration\u2019s ability to buy medicines and foodstuffs.</p> <p>Feliciano Reyna, who runs an NGO in Caracas that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/09/venezuela-aid-drugs-healthcare-aid-maduro\">distributes medications to those who cannot get them otherwise</a>, predicts that the isolation measures announced by the Maduro government will also be hampered by the crisis. \u201cWhen trash isn\u2019t collected, or there is no water to wash your hands, isolation at home can become unsanitary,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cWe are not at all well prepared.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Forget your Zoflora-scented flat or the freshly bleached kitchen table that is now your office, or even the sealed-off hospital rooms accessible only by medical professionals in hazmat suits: the two safest places in the world to hide from the coronavirus are officially the German and Canadian Big Brother houses.</p> <p>The German version of the show started on 6 February, and the contestants currently have no idea that the rest of the world is living through a pandemic because, as per the rules of the show, they are not allowed any contact with the outside world. When they went into the house, no cases of coronavirus had been confirmed outside China. And, incredibly, even though new people are entering the show all the time, they are not allowed to tell the current housemates anything.</p> <p>What a secret to keep! Imagine: the contestants are trying to talk them into revealing the latest football score or find out who the viewer\u2019s favourite housemates are, and, inside, these poor reality stars-to-be are probably screaming that people are dying, and won\u2019t they please, please wash their hands more often? The housemates will find out about the coronavirus at 7pm tonight in a special episode, where they can ask Big Brother questions such as \u201cAre my parents OK?\u201d and get video messages from their family. It is due to be broadcast live because, well, why would you waste the TV gold that is contestants\u2019 hysterical tears?</p> <p>The Canadian Big Brother started on 6 March \u2013 so before mass gatherings were banned in the country \u2013 and the confused housemates can\u2019t work out why they cannot hear the audience booing them during evictions. \u201cMaybe the house is \u2026 suddenly soundproof?\u201d offered one contestant in a clip that has gone viral on Twitter. Which sounds stupid, until you realise that randomly guessing: \u201cUh, maybe a global pandemic broke out and it\u2019s unsafe to gather in crowds,\u201d would be even weirder. It is understood they have finally been told since the clip was released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88265e9d1a1f8e7673338c18d0bda00a5a6c7be1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88265e9d1a1f8e7673338c18d0bda00a5a6c7be1/74_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ignorance is bliss? ... the Big Brother Germany contestants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ignorance is bliss? ... the Big Brother Germany contestants</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Big Brother Brazil\u2019s cast are also completely unaware of coronavirus \u2013 since they entered the house on 21 January, producers have refused to update them on the outside world.</p> <p>It is not like the show hasn\u2019t been preparing for this moment. In 2013, the UK Big Brother house had a fake \u201cviral outbreak\u201d, in which housemates had to decide which of them got the only six gas masks or go into quarantine. The task was inspired by Charlie Brooker\u2019s 2008 horror series <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70229514\">Dead Set</a>, in which Big Brother\u2019s production staff and contestants are trapped inside the house during a zombie apocalypse. Spoiler alert: it does not end well for Davina McCall.</p> <p>Clearly, it is an ethical and moral nightmare withholding information from reality show participants. On the one hand, the ignorant bliss sounds incredible. Imagine waking up every day having slept, worry-free, through the night, and then having to constantly remind yourself the reason you have to take in every breath with a gasp is merely the tight pain of anxiety in your chest, not a superbug that has killed thousands of people. Unlike the rest of the population, you don\u2019t have to live with the dual fears of running out of loo roll or accidentally infecting the people you love the most leading to their deaths. Lovely.</p> <p>But then again: if UK Big Brother is anything to go by, the house will be a hotbed of unsanitary practices; career-ruining Jacuzzi sex, fumbles under the covers lit up by night vision cameras, and long snogs in the loo because that is the only place without cameras. Yes, it is clean now, but once the house is infected \u2013 remember those new contestants sworn to secrecy? \u2013 it\u2019ll kick off quicker than a row over the washing up.</p> <p>And by not telling them, isn\u2019t it just saying that their safety is less of a priority than ratings? It\u2019s not like the latest series of Love Island, where contestants were not told about former host Caroline Flack\u2019s death until after they left the villa, which made for strangely disquieting viewing.</p> <p>There is a fourth Big Brother house \u2013 who knew the show was still so popular? \u2013 where the cast had no idea about the coronavirus pandemic until yesterday, when producers on Big Brother Australia made the decision to tell the housemates about the \u201csituation\u201d. Personally, if a killer virus was sweeping the world, I would probably want to leave and speak to my family, just in case the worst happened, instead of riding it out on live TV, eyes firmly fixed on the cash prize and Instagram followers. That\u2019s just me, though. I\u2019m weird like that.</p> <p>But, at time of going to press, nobody has walked out of the Australian Big Brother house. Is it worth ignoring the fact that your family are at risk from a global pandemic just to have access to a house full of toilet roll and pasta? Hard to say at this time \u2013 ask us again in three weeks\u2019 time.</p>",

There is no evidence whatsoever that somehow the political changes nearly two generations later, in 1989, had any effect upon that legal reality as it existed in and after 1949.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The judges summarised the petitioner\u2019s argument as a claim that Frydenberg had a \u201cshell\u201d citizenship passed to him at birth \u201ccapable of revivification into full Hungarian citizenship by the political transformation of Hungary with the end of Communist rule\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Nice try, they said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we may say so, the argument as to the revivification of a \u201cshell\u201d of citizenship is an imaginative one, displaying a creative fineness of distinction, which may be, or may have been, seen as appropriate in some legal contexts. Such an approach is inappropriate here.

Even if Covid-19 just went on its irksome way as a granny-killing hyperflu, we\u2019d have to take extreme measures. Each scenario is possible, and the evidence suggests a couple of them are likely.

The German MEP with Scottish roots even puts milk in his tea and says he would rather have a slice of British white bread than traditional German <em>schwarzbrot.</em></p> \n<p>Appointed the chair of the European parliament\u2019s EU-UK coordination committee in January, McAllister will steer 705 MEPs through the upcoming talks on the future relationship. EU and UK negotiators are examining whether they can talk via video link, after face-to-face meetings in London due to start on Wednesday were abandoned because of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The Brexit job comes after a meteoric rise in German politics, when he became the youngest leader of a German region, as minister-president of Lower Saxony from 2010 to 2013. Long seen as a favourite of Angela Merkel, McAllister was elected to the European parliament in 2014, where he soon landed one of the biggest MEP jobs: chair of the foreign affairs committee.</p> \n<p>The role, which he retains, involves having to deal with one of the EU\u2019s most tricky foreign policy problems: reconstructing relations with a former member state after a painful, three-and-half year divorce.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/12/uk-and-eu-agree-to-dial-down-rhetoric-in-brexit-talks\">UK and EU agree to 'dial down rhetoric' in Brexit talks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cBrexit is a very sad event and I will always be of the opinion that the UK is in a better position as a member state of the European Union, but I am not sad to do this job,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want us to have the best possible relationship with the UK, and the European parliament will play an important role in shaping our future relations.

Verhofstadt, who became a pantomime villain for British tabloids, called Theresa May \u201creckless\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/eu-dismay-boris-johnson-compares-himself-to-hulk\">Boris Johnson \u201cinfantile\u201d</a> and recently said the UK was approaching the talks as if the two sides were \u201cliving on two different planets\u201d.</p> \n<p>His successor says he does not want to become a public figure in the UK debate.</p> \n<p>That means he will not make any comment on whether an independent Scotland could one day rejoin the EU. The MEP, who got married in a kilt and enjoys drinking sugar-free Irn-Bru, would only say that Scottish independence was \u201can inner British issue\u201d for Edinburgh and London.</p> \n<p>He also advises the 447 million-consumer trading bloc to tread carefully when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/13/brexit-eu-demands-uk-negotiations-draft-treaty\">negotiating</a> with its smaller neighbour: \u201cThe EU always is well-advised to treat negotiating partners with respect no matter which size they are.\u201d</p> \n<p>He rejects simple labels for the deal, whether Canada-plus or EU- , saying the future agreement will be unprecedented in its depth and breadth. \u201cWhat we need is a unique agreement with the UK, but there is no country which will match 100% the demands of the British. So what we are going for is a cooperation agreement, which will of course have an important part on trade, but it\u2019s more than trade. There are many other issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last month, the European parliament endorsed a resolution, drafted by his committee, calling on EU negotiators to keep the UK in line with the bloc\u2019s standards on environment, workers\u2019 rights and industrial state subsidies, in exchange for maintaining free trade in goods. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/key-mep-group-to-demand-level-playing-field-with-uk-in-return-for-free-trade\">The MEPs approved the maximalist position of \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d</a>, meaning the UK would have to match the EU\u2019s rising standards in these areas. However, other parts of the text suggested the parliament could accept a less demanding agreement not to retreat from existing standards (non-regression). The ambiguity is a sign of a compromise text stitched together to meet the expectations of MEPs spanning conservative right to radical left.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"532df0a3-11ca-4d4e-8f76-d04fd6d181ce\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1961)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brefusal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1973)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Brentry</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With Sir Edward Heath having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/the-highs-and-lows-of-britains-47-years-in-the-eec-and-eu\">signed the accession treaty</a> the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(January 31, 1975)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Referendum</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\".

Because at the moment we are a global payer,\u201d he said, a reference to the EU\u2019s aid budget, the largest in the world. In this, he is aligned with the \u201cgeopolitical\u201d ambition of the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, another CDU politician from Lower Saxony.</p> \n<p>Can the EU\u2019s geopolitical hopes thrive without one of the continent\u2019s biggest military and diplomatic players?</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to, we can\u2019t revoke the UK decision.

  "<p>Bang Face, a dance music festival held at Southport holiday park Pontins, is known for a particularly hell-for-leather approach to jackhammering dance music, gallows humour and airborne inflatables. Held over the weekend before Downing Street decided to advise against all gatherings of this kind, it will likely be the last major dance music event in the UK for some time. Nightclubs including London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fabriclondon.com/blog/view/newsflash-were-temporarily-closing-the-club-due-to-the-global-coronavirus-outbreak\">Fabric</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ministryofsound.com/posts/articles/2020/march/ministry-of-sound-london-is-temporarily-closed/\">Ministry of Sound</a> announced its temporary closure yesterday, and festivals such as Re-Textured have been cancelled.</p> <p>Jokes circulated in the run-up to Bang Face about the irony that rave duo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/cult-heroes-altern-8-rave-music-old-skool\">Altern-8</a>, the weekender\u2019s de facto house band, are not only known for wearing boilersuits and face masks, but would be playing mostly hits from their 1992 album Full On \u2026 Mask Hysteria, casting them as unlikely oracles.

Europe began a self-enforced shutdown. The UK government hinted at a U-turn in the days ahead. Managers scrambled to get their artists home from DJ tours before borders were locked down. Bang Face reacted on the ground: surplus hand washing stations were set up, staff wore gloves and stocked free soap by the tills, and the in-house TV station was used to display cancellation messages. Some artists were unable to travel, some stayed away of their own volition.</p> <p>As the urgency of social distancing took hold, the tenor of online conversations in music circles darkened: if an industry as typically bloated as football could unilaterally hit the pause button, shouldn\u2019t live music? The nature of having fun to thunderously loud acid techno felt increasingly like being a scab crossing the picket line.</p> <p>Bang Face organisers have defended their decision to let the show go on, with the same reasoning other venues and touring artists facing flak have used: the government said it was OK. A statement from the festival\u2019s management reads: \u201cWe took the decision to go ahead with the event in line with government guidelines and have been closely monitoring the situation while taking professional advice to ensure safety and minimise impact on local services.\u201d</p> <p>They were left with an unenviable decision to mitigate in real time. Do you risk asymptomatic people spreading the virus? Do you send workers home, from performing artists to lighting technicians to security to bar staff, who might desperately rely on that last paycheck before work in events is vaporised? With insurance policies unclear on cancellation policy due to Covid-19, and no emergency fund from the government in place for nightlife industries, a string of bankruptcies are a very real possibility, too \u2013 although this was looked upon dimly by European counterparts who enacted compulsory closure much sooner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4f4fcb38663e1c889b5efccb7064c5912b6a6b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4f4fcb38663e1c889b5efccb7064c5912b6a6b3/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The crowd at Bang Face weekender.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pre-apocalyptic knees-up ... the crowd at Bang Face weekender.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bang Face</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This nightmare scenario has played out for innumerable people in the music business over the past few days. <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/ashlauryn\">Ash Lauryn</a>, an Atlanta-based, Detroit-rooted promoter and radio host, was caught in limbo at the outset of an extensive European tour. \u201cWhen I left the US on 11 March, all of my gigs in Europe were still scheduled to move forward,\u201d the DJ said. \u201cWithin 24 hours of arriving in Berlin, cancellations started to come in.

Trump\u2019s surprise announcement of a travel ban on Europe has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-europe-wakes-chaos-confusion-trump-restricts-travel-n1156286\">angered</a> America\u2019s transatlantic allies. South Korea has criticized Japan for a supposedly lax response to the pandemic, fueling tensions in a relationship between two key US allies that is already strained. And as friction between the United States and China grows, the Chinese Communist party\u2019s botched initial response to the disease has fueled anti-China rhetoric and conspiracies in the US, with some members of the Congress calling the disease \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1237165063565447168?s=20\">Chinese coronavirus</a>\u201d and one senator even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">suggesting</a> the disease could be a Chinese bioweapon. China\u2019s slow and secretive response to the initial outbreak was dangerous, and there are many substantive criticisms of how China handled the response \u2013 but xenophobic and racist attacks are dangerous and wrong.</p> <p>As officials are consumed by the coronavirus response, there are numerous ongoing conflicts \u2013 including wars in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria \u2013 that the US and other countries now will have far less time and energy to attempt to resolve.</p> <p>In addition to adding complexity to current threats, the measures governments take to try to stop the coronavirus will create new challenges. US military readiness is already being affected, as US navy ships in Asia have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/navy-coronavirus-pacific-self-quarantine/index.html\">quarantined</a>, US-South Korea military exercises have been cancelled, and US soldiers around the world are just as susceptible to the disease as everyone else. The disruption in global supply chains will mean difficulty getting resources necessary for a national security emergency, whether it\u2019s an attack or a humanitarian disaster. And there are always countries looking to take advantage of a crisis: Iranian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/iraq-rocket-attack-americans-uk-soldier-dead\">attacks</a> that killed US and British soldiers in Iraq, North Korean missile tests and a Russian fighter jet that was intercepted near Alaska were recent reminders that national security threats don\u2019t disappear when countries are focused elsewhere.</p> <p>In countries hardest hit by the disease, political stability could even be at risk. While China is attempting to spin its response to the virus as a success, it has been censoring and hiding information about how it allowed the crisis to spread in the first place. If the crisis in China spikes again, widespread dissatisfaction could terrify the CCP, which is already perpetually anxious about its grip on power. The same goes for Iran and Italy \u2013 both of which are in full-blown crisis mode \u2013 and any country that experiences the pandemic in similar proportions. This could also upend politics in democracies that go to the polls in the coming weeks and months, as voters judge how their government has responded \u2013 and as governments attempt to ensure that elections can safely take place.</p> <p>This pandemic also poses a danger to the basic functions of government. With a number of members of Congress already self-quarantining \u2013 some of whom Trump has been in contact with \u2013 and senior officials in other governments already infected, all levels of government will have to ensure they have in place clear guidelines for continuity of government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The longer and more devastating the pandemic is, the more threats to national security will grow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The way in which the United States and others respond to coronavirus will also have an impact on geopolitics. Despite its early disastrous actions that allowed the disease to spread, China is now attempting to portray its subsequent response as a success at the same time that America flails. And the contrast of the US banning travel from Europe while China <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akwage/china-is-now-sending-doctors-masks-and-hazmat-suits-to-help-italy-with-its-coronavirus-outbreak\">sends</a> medical assistance to Italy has not gone unnoticed. Like after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis, new perceptions of power could emerge based on how countries act now.</p> <p>While relevant officials must spend their time responding to the health aspects of the coronavirus first and foremost, others must begin preparing for national security contingencies. This is just the beginning of a massive global health crisis that could become far worse, and governments must learn the lessons quickly and begin changing policies that can help mitigate this pandemic as well as prevent the next one. To name just a few, governments should enhance multilateral coordination through the World Health Organization, ensure transparency with publics, establish pandemic prevention and response capabilities and boost assistance for health systems in developing countries.</p> <p>The longer and more devastating the pandemic is, the more threats to national security will grow. And so, stopping the spread of the pandemic as swiftly and effectively as possible will be essential to safeguarding national security, as well as saving lives and the economy.</p>",
  "<p>The health damage inflicted on people by long-standing air pollution in cities is likely to increase the death rate from coronavirus infections, experts have said.</p> \n<p>Dirty air is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/may/17/air-pollution-may-be-damaging-every-organ-and-cell-in-the-body-finds-global-review\">known to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/may/17/air-pollution-may-be-damaging-every-organ-and-cell-in-the-body-finds-global-review\">cause lung and heart damage</a> and is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/38/9592\">at least 8m early deaths a year</a>. This underlying health damage means respiratory infections, such as coronavirus, may well have a more serious impact on city dwellers and those exposed to toxic fumes, than on others.</p> \n<p>However, strict confinement measures in China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and in Italy, Europe\u2019s most affected nation, have led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/01/dramatic-fall-in-china-pollution-levels-partly-related-to-coronavirus\">falls in air pollution</a> as fewer vehicles are driven and industrial emissions fall. A preliminary calculation by a US expert suggests that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution may have been avoided by the cleaner air in China, far higher than the 3,208 coronavirus deaths.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The experts stressed, however, that no one is claiming the pandemic can be seen as good for health and it is too early for conclusive studies to have been done. In particular, they said, other indirect health impacts of the coronavirus, via lost income and lack of treatment for other illnesses, will also be large.</p> \n<p>While urban air pollution has declined in developed countries, the understanding of the widespread damage it causes to health has increased, and toxic air has risen to extreme levels in developing countries, such as India.</p> \n<p>\u201cPatients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die. This is likely also the case for Covid-19,\u201d said Sara De Matteis, at Cagliari University, Italy, and a member of the environmental health committee of the European Respiratory Society. \u201cBy lowering air pollution levels we can help the most vulnerable in their fight against this and any possible future pandemics.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks that those exposed to dirty air are more at risk of dying. Scientists who <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-2-15\">analysed the S</a><a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-2-15\">ars coronavirus outbreak in China in 2003</a> found that infected people who lived in areas with more air pollution were twice as likely to die as those in less polluted places.</p> \n<p>Research on the Mers coronavirus outbreak, first seen in Saudi Arabia in 2012, showed that tobacco smokers were <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0422763815301199\">more likely to get the disease</a> and were more likely to die. <a href=\"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0408/v1\">Early research on Covid-19</a> suggests smokers and former smokers are more susceptible to the virus. But one difference is that Covid-19 appears to have a lower overall mortality rate than Sars or Mers.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven what we know now, it is very likely that people who are exposed to more air pollution and who are smoking tobacco products are going to fare worse if infected with [Covid-19] than those who are breathing cleaner air, and who don\u2019t smoke,\u201d Aaron Bernstein, at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/03/15/smoking-air-pollution-coronavirus/\">told </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/03/15/smoking-air-pollution-coronavirus/\">the Washington Post</a>.</p> \n<p>Reductions in air pollution have been recorded over northern Italy, the centre of that nation\u2019s outbreak. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CREACleanAir/status/1238370147611656192\">Air pollution also fell sharply across China</a> in the four weeks after 25 January, when regions shut down in response to the outbreak. The level of PM2.5, dangerous small pollution particles, fell by 25%, while nitrogen dioxide, produced mainly by diesel vehicles, dropped by 40%.</p> \n<p>The link between such pollutants and early deaths are well known and Marshall Burke, at Stanford University in the US, <a href=\"http://www.g-feed.com/2020/03/covid-19-reduces-economic-activity.html\">used the data to estimate the impacts on air pollution mortality</a>. The young and old are worst affected by dirty air and, using conservative assumptions, Burke calculated the cleaner air may have prevented 1,400 early deaths in children under five and 51,700 early deaths in people over 70.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems clearly incorrect and foolhardy to conclude that pandemics are good for health,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the calculation is perhaps a useful reminder of the often-hidden health consequences of the status quo, ie, the substantial costs that our current way of doing things exacts on our health and livelihoods.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said that indirect impacts of Covid-19 are probably much higher than currently known. \u201cIt seems likely that any \u2018benefits\u2019 from reduced air pollution are going to be dominated by the direct and, especially, the indirect costs of the virus, [such as] the health effects of lost income and the morbidity/mortality costs of non-Covid health problems going untreated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sascha Marschang, the acting secretary general of the European Public Health Alliance, said: \u201cOnce this crisis is over, policymakers should speed up measures to get dirty vehicles off our roads. Science tells us that epidemics like Covid-19 will occur with increasing frequency. So cleaning up the streets is a basic investment for a healthier future.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",
  "<p>This is a long watch of a poem, a tormented vigil. You want to ask, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \u2013 a question you might, like the guard in <em>Hamlet</em>\u2019s opening scene, call out in the dark. If loss is the subject, who is the loser? And what \u2013 or who \u2013 has been lost? These questions are not easily answered.</p> <p>This is the latest volume in an extraordinarily rich period for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-harsent\" title=\"\">David Harsent</a>. In 2011, in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/13/night-david-harsent-review-poetry\" title=\"\">Night</a></em>, he made darkness visible. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/02/fire-songs-david-harsent-review\" title=\"\">Fire Songs</a></em> (2014) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/salt-david-harsent-review\" title=\"\">Salt</a></em> (2017) flared into apocalyptic view soon after. The subtitle of <em>Loss</em> is \u201cwhite nights\u201d, but do not expect any atoning dawns. The form of the new volume is painstaking: stretches of italics describe a figure looking through a window, writing on misty glass. He is a \u201cman in waiting\u201d. Sonnets alternate with trochaics and lead back to the frightening consciousness from which this fragmented narrative poem comes.</p> <p>It is the permeability of Harsent\u2019s writing that astonishes: global catastrophe, violent incident, mechanical threat \u2013 all absorbed into the text. Yet the paradox is that he seems to be on the wrong side of the membrane of what matters to him. \u201cWomen of the house \u2013 he lay in the dark and listened to their voices\u2026 Their talk was a constant, soft, overlapping,/under and over music, soft questions, soft laughter, diminuendo.\u201d It is their music \u2013 not his. Repeatedly, women\u2019s hands appear, but their soft caresses do not soothe. Lovers are seen through a glass, darkly. Femininity and domesticity continue like a play on an unreachable stage, as though taking place in another world.</p> <p>There are several references to \u201chidden theatre\u201d, as if the stage should be sought (loss can, after all, be about what you never found). The poem is full of sinister commedia dell\u2019arte figures, and we even have a brush with a \u201cdramaturge of mood-swings\u201d. The wakeful man describes himself as a pilgrim \u2013 a sinner. But this is no pilgrim\u2019s progress, more a pilgrim\u2019s stasis \u2013 written at a febrile standstill. And there is a violence about the way Harsent makes apocalypse telegraphic:</p> <p>the worst already with us</p> <p>dogfight politics barrel-bombs</p> <p>children scorched faceless</p> <p>deluge and wildfire.</p> <p>At one point, the man says: \u201cyou feel you might/have outlived yourself\u201d. Harsent\u2019s poem pulls off a strange feat, exploring the posthumous while staying painfully alive. It becomes an experiment with absence \u2013 an exploration of what happens when you go missing to yourself.</p> <p>He asks how it would be to be without what makes life worth living. Cityscapes and dreamscapes might release him but the city proves feral \u2013 clashing bin lids, bold foxes, toxic streetlights. And his dreams taunt him, too. Art offers perspective, but he tests its limits, and poetry\u2019s too (there is a tension about the unspoken and its relationship to the unspeakable). He notes, \u201cwrite it down\u201d, a reminder of the small, plucky scale of artistic enterprise. The painters he returns to are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\" title=\"\">Francis Bacon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/pierre-bonnard-781\" title=\"\">Pierre Bonnard</a>, as if to consider the distance and, less obviously, closeness between them.</p> <p>He says \u201cforgiveness is waste\u201d and it is impossible to imagine less forgiving writing. It makes this volume a challenge to read. It is a compliment to its power that I longed to break free. The man in these poems is a figure in a landscape I fear might be ours. And while we might hanker after what Robert Lowell described as \u201cthe sanity of self-deception, pricked and kicked by reckless caution\u201d, Harsent detects \u201ca sudden rise/in willing blindness among the best of us\u201d.</p> <p>It is this blindness that <em>Loss</em>, with steadfast virtuosity, addresses.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Loss </em>by David Harsent is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

  "<p>March was supposed to be big for Alice Stanford.</p> <p>As a banquet server at two ritzy Los Angeles hotels, she knows her business is \u201cfeast or famine\u201d, depending on the time of year. In summers, when conventions and conferences dry up, Stanford and her colleagues don\u2019t work very much at all. But they bring in huge hauls during awards and conference seasons, and it\u2019s then that they budget and save.</p> <p>March was scheduled as the highest-revenue month for this entire year, Stanford said.

At 19, she said, she couldn\u2019t support a baby, and the father had stopped answering his phone after she told him. Desperate, she had asked an older friend, who said she knew someone who could help.</p> <p>She took all three pills at once and the bleeding started soon after. Her lower abdomen hurt so badly that she didn\u2019t sleep all night.</p> <p>\u201cThat was when I knew I\u2019d gone wrong,\u201d Joy said, relating her story from Kenyatta National hospital a few days later. Her surname has been withheld to protect her identity.</p> <p>The bleeding continued for two days, soaking a sanitary pad every few minutes.

Dozens of women with complications from unsafe abortions pass through it each month. Consultant Dr Allan Ikol Adungo said the patients range from young teenagers to married women in their mid-30s. They are usually from poor backgrounds.</p> <p>In Kenya, where abortion is illegal in most cases, and not all women have<a href=\"http://www.health.go.ke/kenya-contraceptive-prevalence-increase-nairobi-kenya-october-3-2019/\"> access</a> to contraception, unregulated \u2013 and unsafe \u2013 abortions like Joy\u2019s are common.</p> <p>More than 40% of pregnancies in Kenya are not planned, according to a<a href=\"https://aphrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Incidence-and-Complications-of-Unsafe-Abortion-in-Kenya-Key-Findings-of-a-National-Study.pdf\"> study</a> from 2012, the latest year for which data is available, by the health ministry and the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC). And while the Kenyan constitution permits abortion only when a woman\u2019s life or health is in danger and emergency treatment is necessary, the study found in the same year that nearly half a million abortions were carried out. This translates to one in every 21 Kenyan women of childbearing age having an abortion in that year alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44e77f707c7d78c4cb2801e5405a547069eecccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e77f707c7d78c4cb2801e5405a547069eecccd/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edita Ochieng holds up the abortion pills she has bought\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edita Ochieng, a women\u2019s rights activist, holds up the abortion pills she has bought from a chemist in Kibera slum in Nairobi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of these abortions were unsafe and resulted in various complications such as organ failure, sepsis and shock, a subsequent <a href=\"https://aphrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Costs-of-Treating-Unsafe-Abortion-Complications-in-Public-Health-Facilities-in-Kenya_Final.pdf\">study</a> concluded.

A step towards this was taken last year when Kenya\u2019s high court<a href=\"https://news.trust.org/item/20190612183718-i5lj0/\"> ruled</a> that some rape survivors can terminate their pregnancies.</p> <p>Esther Passaris, a Nairobi MP, wants the government to go further, and legalise abortion on demand. \u201cWomen and girls have the right to make decisions about their bodies,\u201d she said. \u201c[And] whether we legalise it or not, it\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>Passaris is a local leader for <a href=\"https://www.shedecides.com/\">SheDecides</a>, an international movement advocating for female empowerment in reproductive healthcare. It was formed in 2017 in response to Donald Trump\u2019s reinstatement of the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d, under which international NGOs cannot receive funding from the US government if they provide access to or information about abortions.</p> <p>Kenyan groups were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/24/how-the-us-trump-global-gag-rule-threatens-health-clinics-across-kenya-and-uganda\"> hit hard</a> by the policy. \u201cWe lost 100% of our funding,\u201d said Nelly Munyasia, from Reproductive Health Network Kenya (RHNK).

  "<p>If the coronavirus pandemic is fuelling any political hope, it is that this crisis is a robust <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/05/the-coronavirus-is-exposing-the-limits-of-populism/\">nail in the coffin of populist politics</a>. Surely, some argue, in the face of an entirely indiscriminate, unforeseen and formidable plague, for which no one can be blamed (unlike, say, greedy bankers and unscrupulous lenders in the global financial crisis, or the terrorists of 9/11) people will turn to the truth, to science and to expert-led government.</p> <p>And, true, populist leaders seem to have lost their voice, for now: the attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-outbreak-migrants-blamed-italy-matteo-salvini-marine-le-pen\">blame migrants</a>, porous borders and the forces of globalisation for the coronavirus have received short shrift. Fear and deference have, momentarily at least, rendered citizens less inclined to question mainstream governments and turn to populism\u2019s snake oil vendors. Better still: it looks as though governments led by populists or populists-lite, such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, are set for a rough ride, too, unless they change their ways.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/life-lockdown-parma-italy-coronavirus\">Orderly, dour, cowed: how my beloved Italy is changed by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one expected many Chinese citizens to question their government\u2019s robust coronavirus response, but Italian attitudes, so far, add to the sense of populism\u2019s \u2013 probably greatly exaggerated \u2013 demise. If Italy can be counted on to listen to the orders of a government that only a few weeks ago was viewed as accidental and temporary, perhaps the tide has turned on the populist Lega party leader Matteo Salvini.</p> <p>And, if it has turned on Salvini, why should it not have turned on all populists? True, there is something quite remarkable about Italy\u2019s forbearance in the face of this shock. But a couple of caveats. First, whereas these certainly are extraordinary times, Italy has always been resilient to shocks. Terrorism, migration, corruption, the financial crisis and regular, devastating earthquakes have not brought it to its knees. Indeed, the earthquakes have a lot to do with the manner in which health, police, army and emergency services are reacting now, and why Italy does a fine line in civil contingency, and its citizens an even finer line in social solidarity.</p> <p>Powerful cities; strong regions; an excellent \u2013 if decentralised \u2013 healthcare system; hi-tech industry; a web of resilient firms and civil society organisations; its own, local food production, creativity and expertise in spades (including in the highest echelons of its civil service), all despite significant regional variations, account for its capacity to respond to crises. These qualities are in evidence today \u2013 as always. But they have not been enough in the past to ward off populism, a force that can be reignited at a stroke in tumultuous times. Think already of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3bc25ea-652c-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\">the reaction</a>, including on the Italian far right, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\">remarks made by Christine Lagarde</a>, the president of the European Central Bank, that suggested that Italy would have to cope alone.</p> <p>Another caveat: it is early days \u2013 for every nation. I, too, want to believe that there will be a significant turn against populist politics, but I have worries. The first is that much depends on whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/15/europe-empties-its-streets-to-slow-coronavirus-in-pictures\">the draconian measures</a> taken in Italy, France and Spain, and elsewhere in Europe, are seen to make a big difference. Even if the various closures and lockdowns are effective at containing the spread of the virus, it will be very difficult to assert counterfactuals: \u201cit could have been so much worse\u201d never quite cuts it, because it sounds too politically convenient.</p> <p>My second worry is what if this is only wave one of a number of coronavirus epidemics? If the virus mutates, if it is seasonal, if the different timelines of different countries create different waves of contagion and crisis, then governments will have to admit that different measures might have been needed and that we are all still learning. Such incrementalism and humility will be a difficult political message to manage. And over time will governments actually find themselves confronting populations that are grief stricken and economically poorer (that is inevitable) but also frustrated and angry \u2013 ready to acquiesce to, or even demand, more authoritarianism?</p> <p>Salvini\u2019s Lega may be haemorrhaging support, but that support is flowing mainly to the party to the (far) right of them, <a href=\"https://www.termometropolitico.it/1514947_sondaggi-elettorali-tp-coronavirus-3.html\">the Brothers of Italy</a>. The point is that crises such as this don\u2019t necessarily show populist politics up for the fraud it is. They can also have reverse results. Genuine scientific disagreements can be weaponised as conspiracy theories; legitimate hesitation dressed up as incompetence; and failures used to justify increasingly authoritarian measures and positions. Could the severity of the Covid-19 crisis serve as justification for the postponement or annulment of a major national election? Unlikely still, but not unthinkable.</p> <p>The assumption we tend to make is that if this shock encourages people to turn away from populism, it will mark a <em>return</em> to governments of the late 20th century. But this is to fundamentally misunderstand the path that we have all been on for the past few decades.</p> <p>And this is the third, and most important, worry: we continue to think we can \u201cgo back\u201d but those waters have closed behind us. We need to move into something new that associates expertise, knowledge and information. A combination of digital technology and populist politics has led us to an era of what I call populocracy. And while we need urgently to reassert truth, science and reason, how we source this expertise and ensure legitimacy for it will be a fundamental challenge.</p> <p>What will eventually rid us of populism in our time of cholera is the capacity of pluralists and true democrats to win back trust in objective facts and expertise in ways that make sense to the public. This will be in part measured by the success of the measures taken against the pandemic, of course. But, in a crisis that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-a-disease-that-thrives-on-human-error\">promises to initially overwhelm our systems</a>, and record nothing but loss of life and defeat, success will also be about demonstrating that whatever was done, was done with people\u2019s needs in mind, especially those of the least well off and the most vulnerable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-outbreak-migrants-blamed-italy-matteo-salvini-marine-le-pen\">Migrants aren\u2019t spreading the coronavirus \u2013 but nationalists are blaming them anyway | Daniel Trilling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Governments must also demonstrate that they can use digital technology and its promise of shared information and expertise for the greater good and with the greatest flexibility.

They are bound to, because many will suffer great losses.</p> <p>In this respect, the coronavirus crisis is a test of progressive politics \u2014 a test of solidarity, but also a test of transparency. It is an opportunity to show that a new diffused technocracy can be to the benefit of the greater good. It is an opportunity to show that to grow trust in government you trust the citizen.

Ronaldinho, whose last professional game came in 2015 for Fluminese, scored five goals this weekend and set up another six. Admittedly he did this from a Paraguayan jail, but such details are trivial during a global crisis.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.lanacion.com.py/destacado_edicion_impresa/2020/03/07/ronaldinho-y-su-hermano-fueron-detenidos-anoche-por-la-policia/\">As first reported</a> by the Paraguayan newspaper La Naci\u00f3n, Ronaldinho was taken into custody in the country\u2019s capital, Asunci\u00f3n, on 6 March. He and his brother had allegedly used <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MinPublicoPy/status/1235406578779672576\">fake Paraguayan passports and IDs</a>, although his lawyer maintains that his client did not know the documents were falsified, as they were given to him by a local sponsor.</p> \n<p>Ronaldinho is now in a maximum-security prison. There, he shares a cell, which \u201clooks more like a hotel\u201d, according to Paraguay\u2019s home secretary, with his brother Roberto de Assis Moreira. In the same cell block is a former president of Paraguay\u2019s football association, who was jailed for money laundering.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c9b20c45-fe7e-40fc-bc93-679d828e8f24\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>South American and Spanish media flocked to the story like tourists to Camp Nou, reporting every possible detail of the former Barcelona star\u2019s life in jail. On a local radio show the warden let a few details slip: Prisoner No194 wakes up at eight most mornings, has had visits from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Cuevas\">former Paraguay star Nelson Cuevas</a> and is \u201cjust how you might see him on television, always smiling\u201d.</p> \n<p>The warden would not go into details on the most important issue though: Ronaldinho\u2019s football career in prison. Still, the rumours flew, especially after authorities denied his request for house arrest and a bond of $1.6m. Local outlets reported that the 39-year-old had been asked to play by several teams in prison but initially declined because he lacked boots. Others said he was asked to play under <a href=\"https://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/ronaldinho-revivira-su-magia-en-el-torneo-de-la-agrupacion-reos-le-habrian-pedido-no-meter-goles\">the stipulation that he would not be allowed to score</a> in the tournament, in which the trophy was a 16kg roast pig.</p> \n<p>Just days later though we had the truth.

Kitted out in a vest, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edgar_cantero/status/1238607184780550146\">black boots and swimming trunks</a>, Ronaldinho played a part in every goal of his team\u2019s 11-2 win (the match was actually futsal rather than football) and treated his fellow inmates to a casual <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FutbolBible/status/1238751722895335424\">no-look backheeled assist</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FutbolBible/status/1238751722895335424\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 Ronaldinho is playing football in jail and he's running the show by doing some tricks and flicks.

  "<p>If there were any doubts as to how seriously European officials are treating the Covid-19 emergency, the Italian prime minister <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e5ee68e-6200-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\" title=\"\">Giuseppe Conte</a>\u2019s reference to this being his country\u2019s \u201cdarkest hour\u201d should help dispel them. Italy is the European country currently most affected by the virus, with the highest number of cases and fatalities. It might be the first in the region to be badly hit, but it almost certainly won\u2019t be the last.</p> <p>Whether even more aggressive or creative action may be required in the coming weeks or months, no one knows. The initial reaction to the measures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\" title=\"\">announced by the European Central Bank</a> was mixed. But unlike the sovereign debt crisis \u2013 which first affected Greece and then Italy, Spain and Portugal \u2013 there is no political or economic divide between the needs of the core and the periphery of Europe in the face of the coronavirus challenge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>GDP declines for both Q1 and Q2 could prove to be twice as bad as anything seen during the 2008 financial crisis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Italy\u2019s expenditure on healthcare as a share of GDP is in line with most of its European neighbours, it stands apart from the rest of the euro area on its poor economic fundamentals. Italy\u2019s GDP is only 5% higher than it was in 2000; in France it is 29%. Unemployment and government debt are also high relative to the rest of the euro area, while levels of government investment \u2013 a decade ago on par with the rest of the euro area and the UK \u2013 are now significantly lower.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, therefore, on a number of market-relevant variables the Italian banking system registers toward the weak end of the European spectrum: adversely hit by a high proportion of non-performing loans (7.2% against a European average of 2.9%, according to the <a href=\"https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/Risk%20dashboard/Q3%202019/EBA%20Dashboard%20-%20Q3%202019%20final.pdf\" title=\"\">European Banking Authority</a>), little demand for new business and historically low interest rates and margins.</p> <p>As Italy and much of the region probably now faces a technical recession, all eyes are on whether the fiscal and monetary measures being introduced will prevent a health emergency from becoming an economic emergency, with companies and households unable to pay their debts.</p> <p>Precisely how bad the Italian and euro area economic data will turn out to be over the first half of this year is hard to estimate. But if Italian output declined by, say, 20% this month, flatlined next month, and then the economy started to bounce back over the course of May and June, GDP declines for both the first and second quarters will prove to be twice as bad as anything seen during even the lowest points of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>With other parts of Europe now seeing school closures, parents staying at home to look after their children, restaurants and other retailers shutting their doors and consumer spending on non-essential goods and services being put on hold, other countries will undoubtedly see a similar situation unfold. The only question is one of timing.</p> <p>Another concern is that even if the immediate crisis ends up being contained over the coming months, the aftershocks could linger well beyond that, as the summer tourism season is wiped out and businesses lose a huge portion of their annual revenues. In southern Europe, that could mean the banks face another wave of loan defaults, national governments take in much lower than anticipated tax revenues, and the markets then question the sustainability of government finances and whether the weakest banks across Europe can get by without having to raise additional capital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/how-do-coronavirus-containment-measures-vary-across-europe\">How do coronavirus containment measures vary across Europe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Faced with these risks, European policymakers are stepping up their response. Fiscal policy, as expected, is leading the way, with the governments looking at a variety of measures, including postponing tax collection, allowing households and businesses to delay mortgage and loan repayments, giving banks the regulatory leeway to allow customers to postpone debt interest payments, helping the self-employed with cash payments, and governments underwriting emergency loans to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p> <p>Similarly, the ECB responded last week by expanding the size of its <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/show-me/html/app_infographic.en.html\" title=\"\">quantitative easing</a> programme and by providing banks with the ability to borrow money at even lower rates. The hope is that these actions are transmitted into the real economy, lowering borrowing costs for governments, households and companies, and will lay the foundations for a stronger recovery once the worst of the epidemic is behind us and economies start to claw back whatever output will be lost over the coming months.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/08/take-a-bow-mario-draghi-has-ecb-chief-saved-eurozone\" title=\"\">\u201cWhatever it takes\u201d</a> was Mario Draghi\u2019s powerful but highly controversial rallying cry in 2012, despised by many across the region who thought the ECB was overstepping its mark in keeping the euro area economies afloat.

  "<p>In June 2010, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spies broke into the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Moscow office. This was a regular thing. Whenever I wrote a story that displeased the Kremlin, the FSB spy agency paid a nocturnal visit. On this occasion, the goons removed the office phone from its cradle and laid it demonstratively on the table. Apparently, they didn\u2019t like my coverage of big news from America.</p> <p>That week, the FBI had exposed a ring of deep-cover Russian sleeper agents. The undercover spies had been living in Boston, New York and Washington, in leafy suburban homes. Their task was to ferret out information from US officials and thinktanks. The agents had fake American names. Some had been there for decades, sent at the end of the cold war on a lonely mission, like satellites blasted into space.</p> <p>Since 2000, the FBI had been secretly watching the group. The bureau had a mole: a disillusioned Russian foreign intelligence officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/russian-double-agent-tried-absence\" title=\"\">Alexander Poteyev</a>. Poteyev gave the CIA details of Moscow\u2019s \u201cillegals\u201d, working under non-diplomatic cover. Some were husband and wife. Their children grew up in the US and Canada, speaking English and knowing nothing of their parents\u2019 real nationalities or furtive occupation.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s security editor, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/correspondents/gordoncorera\" title=\"\">Gordon Corera,</a> has written a lively and engrossing account of the FBI\u2019s decade-long counterintelligence operation against the illegals, <em>Russians Among Us</em>. He talked to special agents whose job it was to watch them 24/7. The FBI placed bugs and broke into their homes. It monitored secret communications with Moscow, marital rows, even lovemaking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corera correctly notes that the US and UK were slow to appreciate Russia\u2019s malign intent once Putin became president</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the SVR, ran its agents along classic cold war lines, it turned out. From time to time, a courier codenamed Christopher Metsos flew to the US to meet individual members of his secret team. Money to fund their activities was hidden next to a semi-buried beer bottle. On another occasion, Metsos picked up cash from a Russian official, swapping bags in the New York subway.</p> <p>The FBI made interesting discoveries about how the illegals spoke to Moscow. The oldest tapped out coded radio messages. The youngest, the glamorous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/31/fbi-russian-spy-ring-anna-chapman\" title=\"\">Anna Chapman</a>, used a laptop to access a private wireless network, while meeting a handler in a Manhattan coffee bar. There was also steganography: encrypted text files magically hidden among innocent-looking photos of colourful flowers.</p> <p>This tradecraft was certainly ingenious, but what exactly did the spies achieve? None of them succeeded in learning US secrets. The FBI was able to warn off potential targets. Corera takes the view that the illegals were a genuine threat, on a par with the Cambridge spies who devastated British intelligence. The 21st-century Russians could have recruited a new generation of American double agents, he thinks.</p> <p>The counter-view is that the illegals were a throwback to a bygone era, by a regime that chucked Marxism-Leninism but kept the old KGB playbook. A prestigious SVR programme costing $50m ended in failure and embarrassment. The Kremlin was clearly furious. The 2010 break-in at the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s office happened after I poked fun at the \u201camateurish and bungling\u201d behaviour of Moscow\u2019s ghost spies abroad, who used the identities of dead children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa8e1e2ceed2ac28d195399f1c45c22464362155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8e1e2ceed2ac28d195399f1c45c22464362155/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian agent Anna Chapman in New York, June 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian agent Anna Chapman in New York, June 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corera draws a link between the extraordinary events of that summer and Putin\u2019s subsequent revenge. The Obama administration decided to swap the illegals for four jailed Russians who had allegedly spied for the west. The exchange took place on the tarmac of Vienna airport. Watching from the Russian side was Alexander Zhomov, a veteran spymaster whom Corera likens to Karla, John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s fictional KGB super-chief.</p> <p>One of those traded by Moscow was an ex-officer from GRU military intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/10/sergei-skripal-salisbury-poisoning-putin\" title=\"\">Sergei Skripal</a>. Skripal had spied for MI6. In 2018 the GRU sent two assassins to his home in Salisbury, where he lived under his own name. There, they poisoned him and his daughter, Yulia, in an operation redolent of the 2006 teapot murder of another Russian-born MI6 asset, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\" title=\"\">Alexander Litvinenko</a>.</p> <p>Corera correctly notes that the US and UK were slow to appreciate Russia\u2019s malign intent once Putin became president. In the 00s, MI6 stopped monitoring the SVR\u2019s London office, he reports. By 2005, at least 30 career spies were based at the Russian embassy in Kensington. Typically, the Russians would elude MI5 surveillance. \u201cIt was our C team against their A team,\u201d one British counter-espionage official tells him.</p> <p><em>Russians Among U</em><em>s</em> offers a persuasive account of how Moscow had adapted its espionage toolkit in the wake of the 2010 fiasco. Increasingly, the Kremlin uses a range of intermediaries to influence and subvert western politics. Some are oligarchs. Others are \u201cco-optees\u201d \u2013 Russians without formal spy training. There are also \u201ccyber\u201d illegals who, in 2016, remotely impersonated Americans on Facebook during the US presidential election.</p> <p>Did Moscow seek to influence the outcome of the EU referendum vote, in the same way it backed Donald Trump\u2019s long-shot campaign for the White House? Corera swerves around this question, alas. Theresa May and Boris Johnson say there was no \u201csuccessful\u201d interference, but refuse to define what that means. Corera doesn\u2019t examine recent donations by wealthy Russian emigres to Tory coffers.</p> <p>Overall, this is a compelling book that combines good storytelling with a subtle understanding of spy methods old and new. Corera notes that the government hasn\u2019t taken meaningful action against Russian money, even after the gruesome Skripal hit. Wealthy Russians can buy mansions as before and float their companies on the London stock exchange.</p> <p>With Johnson and \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, Russia\u2019s blurred espionage war is set to continue.</p> <p><em>Luke Harding is the author of Shadow State: Murder, Mayhem and Russia\u2019s Remaking of the West to be published in May by Guardian Faber. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Russians Among Us: Sleeper Cells, Ghost Stories and the Hunt for Putin\u2019s Agents </em>by Gordon Corera is published by William Collins (\u00a320).

  "<p>In Ohio and Massachusetts they closed restaurants and bars, in Florida they closed beaches and at least 32 states closed schools.</p> \n<p>The emergency measures brought in across America to combat coronavirus have all been slightly different from state to state \u2013 but for weeks they have had one thing in common: nobody was acting on guidelines issued by the federal government, because there weren\u2019t any.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see a whole hodgepodge of efforts being taken across the country,\u201d said Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, which announced a tri-state agreement on Monday with neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut on Monday to close all gyms, movie theaters and casinos.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis state is doing this, this state is doing this, this city is doing this \u2013 it\u2019s chaos.

China, South Korea and Japan used mandatory quarantines, shutdowns and curfews to go from more than a 1,000 new cases per day each to figures now in the low-tens.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou look at the countries who have handled this, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s China, South Korea, Italy, they were all handled by national leadership,\u201d said Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cThis is a national problem.

The recommendations said bars, restaurants and gyms should be closed \u201cin states with evidence of community transmission\u201d \u2013 but no state was safe from community transmission.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems to me that if we do a really good job we\u2019ll not only hold the death rate down to a level that is much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August, something like that,\u201d Donald Trump said at the news conference. \u201cI say it washes through.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump told state governors in a conference call on Monday that they should pursue the acquisition of key medical equipment themselves instead of waiting for Washington to act.</p> \n<p>\u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves,\u201d Trump told the governors, according to a recording <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html\">obtained</a> by the New York Times. \u201cWe will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point-of-sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has often downplayed the coronavirus threat, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html\">calling it</a> \u201cmild\u201d, saying \u201cI\u2019m not concerned\u201d and promising \u201cit will go away, just stay calm\u201d. Asked about a shortage of diagnostic tests, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>The emergency response of the White House has seemed to be guided by concern for the hotel and cruise industries, which Trump has repeatedly promised to support, and for the performance of the stock market, which in the past weeks has crashed through a series of floors.</p> \n<p>As a new week of struggle with coronavirus began on Monday \u2013 the first day in which many Americans either stayed home from their jobs or reluctantly attended, began home-schooling or inventoried their pantries \u2013 the White House announced a news conference not for the morning but for 3:30pm, in what critics said was a transparent attempt to score a market rally in the last half-hour of trading.</p> \n<p>In trying to stop the market hemorrhage, Trump in previous days had announced made-up federal initiatives, such as a website engineered by Google to help people find testing locations, which the company only later, more than 24 hours after the fact, agreed to begin working on.</p> \n<p>The Centers for Disease Control has advised people to avoid large gatherings and said anyone who has come into contact with a known carrier should seek medical advice and self-quarantine for two weeks.</p> \n<p>In the vacuum of guidance, state governors have made rules on the fly. The Democratic governor of Illinois shut down all bars and restaurants in the state until next month. Pennsylvania announced similar restrictions, but only for certain counties. In Ohio, the Republican governor, Mike DeWine, announced statewide closures.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re two days from St Patrick\u2019s Day, when people get together and crowd into bars,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cWe are at a crucial, crucial stage.\u201d</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pwoodreporter/status/1239569058321829889\">Maryland governor on Monday</a> closed the port of Baltimore to cruise ships seeking to dock, banned evictions, mobilized state troopers, activated the state\u2019s medical volunteer corps and announced the automatic reactivation of expired medical licenses.</p> \n<p>The federal government, by contrast, has not yet announced moves by the defense department, national guard, Army Corps of engineers or Veterans\u2019 Administration \u2013 which has a nationwide network of hospitals \u2013 to help set up field hospitals, rededicate medical facilities, contract with private companies to accelerate manufacture of key supplies, maintain order or otherwise manage the expected wave of critical Covid-19 cases.</p> \n<p>Without federal guidance, local officials have in some cases issued conflicting orders. In Pennsylvania, the governor at the weekend advised people to stay home, and the commissioner of Montgomery county, which includes the Philadelphia suburbs, told people to cancel gatherings.</p> \n<p>But the mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney, had different advice, telling people to go out to eat, the <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/restaurant-closings-coronavirus-vetri-bars-pennsylvania-20200315.html\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a> reported.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would recommend you wash your hands, you stay out from within three feet of people, and go out and have dinner \u2013 and tip your waitstaff because they\u2019re struggling right now,\u201d Kenney said.</p> \n<p>While school districts across California closed, schools stayed open in the district of the Houseminority leader, Kevin McCarthy, a close Trump ally who calls Covid-19 \u201cChinese coronavirus\u201d.</p> \n<p>McCarthy\u2019s Republican colleague, Devin Nunes, encouraged people at the weekend to \u201cgo to your local pub\u201d.</p> \n<p>Where many Americans hear conflicting messages, Trump heard harmony.</p> \n<p>\u201cEverybody is so well unified and working so hard,\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cIt is a beautiful thing to see.

In conjunction with local work, these government decisions would protect people at the sharpest end of inequality in the UK.</p> <p>These are going to be some of the hardest weeks this country has faced in many years \u2013 a time of strain when some will undoubtedly try to turn our communities against each other. Our network is an explicit rejection of that kind of division \u2013 a sign that solidarity between people won\u2019t be broken, no matter how harsh the conditions we find ourselves in. Our hope is that by the end of this challenging period we will have fostered lasting connections within our communities \u2013 that begin to overturn the deep separation and inequity that is so prevalent in our country.</p> <p>\u2022 Farzana Khan is a writer and community organiser, and a founding director of <a href=\"http://healingjusticeldn.org/\">Healing Justice London</a></p>",
  "<p>The number of women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) could be much higher than previously estimated, as a new report shows the practice is carried out in more than 90 countries around the world.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/female-genital-mutilation/\">UN estimates</a> that 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM. But this figure is drawn from only 31 countries \u2013 27 in Africa \u2013 where national data has been collected.</p> <p>After pulling together data from indirect estimates, smaller surveys, academic studies and from anecdotal evidence, researchers from Equality Now, the End FGM European Network and the US End FGM/C Network found that hundreds of thousands of cases have been documented across 92 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Latin America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/06/we-will-end-female-genital-mutilation-only-by-backing-frontline-activists\">We will end female genital mutilation only by backing frontline activists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>FGM involves the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons.</p> <p>In the report, published on Tuesday, the three organisations are calling on governments to commission national surveys to create a more accurate picture of global prevalence rates, which would allow a more cohesive response to the problem.</p> <p>Divya Srinivasan, a lawyer and Equality Now\u2019s south Asia consultant, said the purpose of the report was to \u201cspotlight that it is happening all over the world\u201d.</p> <p>Srinivasan said the focus on stopping FGM has been targeted in Africa, where there has been some success. A study published in 2018 showed that prevalence rates had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/07/fgm-rates-in-east-africa-drop-20-years-study-shows\">fallen sharply across Africa</a> since the mid-1990s. In east Africa the rates fell from 71.4% in 1995 to just 8% in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cBut we assume it\u2019s not happening in the rest of the world. The international community and governments need to scale up efforts across the world,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Limited data means governments can \u201cturn a blind eye and pretend it\u2019s not happening\u201d.</p> <p>According to the report, more than 500,000 women and girls in the US have undergone FGM or are at risk of doing so. In Australia, more than 50,000 women and girls had been cut, while an estimated 600,000 have undergone the practice across the EU. In the UK, 137,000 women and girls had been cut and more than 67,000 are at risk. About 70,000 had undergone FGM in Germany. Cases were also found in regions of India, Iran, Israel and Russia.</p> <p>But Srinivasan, who co-authored the report, said these figures are likely to be underestimates as they are largely based on figures related to diaspora communities from countries where FGM is known to be practised.</p> <p>In the US, for example, the figure excludes Christian communities.</p> <p>In an interview for the report, Jenny, who grew up in a conservative Christian home in the US midwest, said she underwent FGM when she was five. She was taught to believe that women should be submissive and that \u201csex for pleasure was wrong for women\u201d.</p> <p>It is only recently that she has begun to talk about her experience, and started a petition to get the practice banned in Kentucky, one of 15 US states where FGM is legal. A bipartisan bill to ban FGM in Kentucky unanimously passed in January and is now heading to the Senate for consideration.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is important for people to understand just because so few Americans have spoken up, it does not mean it is not happening here,\u201d said Jenny. \u201cThere is such a silence that surrounds this practice, that until we are talking about it more, we are really never going to know the amount of girls in the US that have been affected. We have to remove the shame, make it a subject safe to talk about.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, 193 governments agreed to eliminate FGM by 2030 as part of their commitment to meet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2020/jan/15/environment-inequality-hunger-which-global-problems-would-you-fix-first\">sustainable development goals</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Global crises often bring surprises for schools. The first world war flagged up the high number of young soldiers who couldn\u2019t read or write. In the second world war, middle-class country families despaired when evacuated children showed up malnourished and riven with lice. In the aftermath of both, politicians determined to make life better: focusing schools more on literacy and introducing daily milk and school nurses.</p> <p>Pandemics, like wars, temporarily change our way of life. Change happens fast. Schools may even have closed by the time you read this. This will be difficult, and if it\u2019s for a long time and in isolation there are real concerns about safeguarding and loss of learning, but let\u2019s not forget schools shut for a six-week period each year and families do cope. What is of long-term concern is what happens even when schools are open.</p> <p>Official guidance is that everyone should be regularly washing their hands with soap and water while singing Happy Birthday twice. The song may not be official, but it helps children wash for the recommended 20 seconds. But this week the realisation has emerged that one in three schools don\u2019t usually have soap and hot water in their bathrooms.</p> <p>When the news broke that Covid-19 was in the UK and infected numbers were rising, Teacher Tapp, the daily survey app that I co-founded, asked over 6,000 teachers about precautions in their school. An alarming 37% said they did not have hot water and soap available for pupils. Soap is not a legal requirement in washrooms and given schools are struggling for cash, it\u2019s an easy thing to cut. Hot water access is legally required, but speaking to teachers, it is clear that old plumbing systems are not providing hot water \u2013 or at least not fast enough to get to the tap before the child has disappeared.</p> <p>Plus, <a href=\"https://www.sec-ed.co.uk/best-practice/school-toilets-guidance-and-regulations/\" title=\"\">regulations state</a> that schools need to have just one sink per 30 pupils. Line up every one of those kids, ruthlessly enforce a quick changeover at 20 seconds, and you need at least 10 minutes to get everyone\u2019s hands clean. Given the average school break is only 20 minutes, that doesn\u2019t leave much time for eating, playing, or going to the toilet. Which might explain why almost no secondary schools were actively teaching handwashing even 10 days ago.</p> <p>On top of that, only one in five teachers said tissues were available for children. Less than a third said their school was offering hand-sanitising facilities: \u201cEveryone has run out of sanitiser. We can\u2019t source it from anywhere, and we probably couldn\u2019t afford it anyway,\u201d one senior leader said.</p> <p>Thankfully, primary children are increasingly washing hands on entry and before leaving school \u2013 a job that\u2019s easier for infant classrooms with their own sink. One friend noted how nice it was to hold her young son\u2019s hand on the walk home from school now that his palms were no longer \u201csweaty and grimy\u201d.</p> <p>The coming months will be challenging and the focus will be on the extent to which schools can keep going at all. But once the pandemic has cleared, it\u2019s worth us remembering that nearly <a href=\"https://cyps.northyorks.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Health%20of%20Children%20and%20Young%20People/Public%20Health%20Advice%20for%20Early%20Years%20Providers%20and%20Schools/Infection%20Control/Handwashing%20Tookit%202017.pdf\" title=\"\">22 million school days</a> are lost every year to colds. About 40% of children get <a href=\"https://cks.nice.org.uk/threadworm\" title=\"\">threadworm</a>, a parasitic infection that causes a distractingly itchy bottom. Both problems are reduced by hand-washing, along with more serious respiratory viruses and tummy bugs.</p> <p>Other countries, already know this. In Japan, schools are equipped with long wash basins where pupils and teachers wash their hands several times a day. In Nigeria, after the Ebola crisis, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695531/\" title=\"\">handwashing in schools rose</a> by over 60%, with children more likely to take part if their friends were also washing their hands.</p> <p>The next few months are going to be a hard lesson in patience and acceptance. But, as with the two world wars, it may be that a better future sits on the other side. At the very least it should be one where every child is expected and, crucially, is able, to wash their hands regularly. </p>",

The commission, in a report partly stemming from the 2016 EU referendum, is proposing measures to change the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/online-political-ads-should-be-labelled-says-law-commission\">Victorian-era laws that govern how UK democracy operates</a>. In 2017, 42.8% of the total reported campaign advertising spend was online \u2013 much of it micro-targeted, making it hard to ensure electoral spending rules are observed and can be enforced. By contrast, printed material must by law identify its publisher. \u201cBeing able to track the origin of campaign material is also important for voters, as it enables them to assess its credibility,\u201d the report notes. Other recommended reforms include wider powers to suspend polling due to, for example, natural disaster or terrorism; letting courts throw out frivolous challenges to election results; and prison sentences for electoral fraud.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>More woe for Metro \u2013 </strong>A group of 17 Iranian customers is suing Metro Bank, saying their accounts were unfairly suspended without notice or explanation.

Data shows that over a period longer than the first world war 4,215 bombs and missiles were launched from Reaper drones or RAF jets in Syria and Iraq. A wide discrepancy has emerged between estimates of the number of civilians killed. The US-led coalition against Isis estimates all air raids caused 1,370 civilian casualties. Airwars, an NGO, says there were actually more than 8,000 and possibly more than 13,000.

We are testing with a specific definition, and we need definitions, we need lines in the sand, otherwise it is just chaos. But this is fast-moving, we have only just stopped arrivals walking into the country, imposing a 14-day self-isolation on arrivals, and we know for a fact people have come into the country showing no signs of illness.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many of those people have developed an illness, only a mild illness, not enough to go to the doctor but enough that the virus is passed on ... and without testing more widely, we don\u2019t know if those entries into the Australian community have caused chains of transmission.\u201d</p> <p>Mackay said the issues around testing capacity were serious, with reagents and other testing kit elements running short and with laboratories already running around-the-clock in order to keep up with demand.</p> <p>He said new testing protocols, such as molecular-based point-of-care testing, used on the east coast of Australia to test for influenza, had the potential, when developed, to dramatically boost capacity for Covid-19 testing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we know of most successful countries to turn around this pandemic \u2013 South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, China \u2013 is widespread testing to help them find cases, to keep contacts isolated and quarantine those who test positive.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Lyn Gilbert, an infectious diseases expert, said an enormous amount of testing had been done, but it was limited recently because of worldwide shortages. She said laboratory testing should be focused and targeted.</p> <p>\u201cWe have limited it recently because of a worldwide shortage, and there has been a lot of effort on behalf of the government to obtain more kits,\u201d Gilbert told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s a difficult dilemma between testing people just because they\u2019re interested when they\u2019ve got no reason to be tested, and having enough so if there is community transmission we can test people who need it.</p> <p>\u201cYou must have some indication for doing laboratory tests, otherwise it\u2019s wasting resources. When systems are overloaded we must be rational and sensible.\u201d</p> <p>Mackay said Australia had been too slow to enforce widespread testing. \u201cIt should have been happening last week \u2013 we wanted these abilities last week. What I have been agitating for is more testing of contacts to understand how far widespread these cases can go.\u201d</p> <p>But he said it was still within Australia\u2019s ability to arrest the exponential growth in confirmed cases.</p> <p>\u201cI think Australia can flatten that peak. I believe we have the capacity and the ability, and we have had the time to get everything ready. We\u2019ve now shut the country down to an extent, with the 14-day self-isolation for arrivals. The one thing we\u2019re missing is more widespread testing.\u201d</p> <p>To qualify as eligible for testing in Australia, a patient must meet both epidemiological criteria and clinical criteria as a \u201csuspected case\u201d. These are defined in the Communicable Diseases Network Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/7A8654A8CB144F5FCA2584F8001F91E2/$File/interim-COVID-19-SoNG-v2.0.pdf\">national guidelines for public health units</a>.</p> <p><strong>Epidemiological criteria</strong></p> <p>\u2022 International travel in the 14 days before illness onset OR</p> <p>\u2022 Close contact in 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>Clinical criteria</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Fever</p> <p>\u2022 Acute respiratory infection (eg shortness of breath, cough, sore throat) with or without fever.</p> <p>Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia with no obvious cause, or healthcare workers with patient contact and a fever and respiratory infection, are also classified as suspect cases.</p> <p>Close contact is defined as more than 15 minutes of face-to-face contact with a confirmed case or sharing of a closed space with a confirmed case for more than two hours.</p> <p>But there are concerns that rules such as these \u2013 applied in other countries too \u2013 effectively discourage doctors from testing patients who have no known ties to existing cases, precisely the kind of \u201ccommunity case\u201d that would signal that the pandemic has reached the stage where it is spreading, in some cases undetected, among strangers.</p> <p>The director general of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has implored governments to test more suspected cases, warning that they cannot fight the pandemic blindfolded.</p> <p>In an unflinching attack on governments that have neglected or held back testing, he said: \u201cWe have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response. The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot fight the fire blindfolded, and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don\u2019t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case.\u201d</p>",

Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/scott-morrison-brings-coal-to-question-time-what-fresh-idiocy-is-this\">waved a lump of coal</a> at his parliamentary opponents.</p> <p>In 2018 the World Health Organization predicted a threat from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/coronavirus-the-huge-unknows-by-robin-mckie\">what it called \u201cDisease X\u201d</a>, on the basis that \u201ca serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease\u201d. At the same time the global pandemic director for America\u2019s National Security Council resigned \u2013 and then his entire team was disbanded by Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton.</p> <p>Trump, of course, told reporters he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency-sketch\">took \u201cno responsibility\u201d</a> for cutting the global health security team \u2013 and tweeted: \u201cI encourage you to turn towards prayer as an act of faith.\u201d</p> <p>The echo of the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d sent out by Morrison during the height of the fires is not accidental.</p> <p>As the last glacier melts away, a politician somewhere will be clasping his hands together, simply because \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d offers a zero-cost alternative to expensive climate action.</p> <p>Mind you, the problem isn\u2019t simply money.</p> <p>The Trump administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/01/australia-welcomes-us-taliban-agreement-on-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal\">negotiating a treaty</a> that formalises the victory of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The war the US and its allies fought in that country cost the US some $2tn dollars, more or less entirely wasted.</p> <p>But war is good for business \u2013 and saving the planet isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Indeed, the coronavirus highlights the awful paradox that makes global heating feel so inevitable.</p> <p>A pandemic-induced recession will ruin people\u2019s lives. If the economy ceases to grow, some of us will lose jobs and others our homes. Many more will have to work harder for less pay, abandoning dreams and ambitions to struggle for bare survival.</p> <p>Yet a recession almost certainly also means that carbon emissions will fall, just as they did during the 2008-09 financial crisis.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the economic expansion on which we depend requires that, each year, industry consumes more and more natural resources.</p> <p>A healthy economy means a growing economy \u2013 and a growing economy makes demands on the planet that it can no longer sustain.</p> <p>A slump, by contrast, reduces that pressure.</p> <p>To be clear, a recession isn\u2019t good news, in any way, shape or form. Aside from anything else, expect governments across the world to now abandon whatever commitments they\u2019ve made to long-term decarbonisation as they scramble to get the wheels of industry turning again.</p> <p>But you can see the fundamental contradiction on which we\u2019re caught.</p> <p>Capitalism must expand or lapse into crisis. But an economy dependent on perpetual growth must, at some stage, come into conflict with the limits of the natural world.</p> <p>The characteristic ineptitude of today\u2019s politicians \u2013 the deep rottenness pervading our societies \u2013 reflects, in part, the impossibility of squaring that circle.</p> <p>In developing nations, for instance, the relentless expansion of capital means that cities now encroach more and more on wilderness and peasant holdings. With factory farming replacing traditional agriculture, viral outbreaks become more likely. As the evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growing genetic monocultures of domestic animals removes whatever immune firebreaks may be available to slow down transmission. Larger population sizes and densities facilitate greater rates of transmission. Such crowded conditions depress immune response. High throughput, a part of any industrial production, provides a continually renewed supply of susceptibles, the fuel for the evolution of virulence.</p> </blockquote> <p>The emissions pumped into the atmosphere represent another facet of the same problem: an increasingly obvious incompatibility between economic and natural cycles.</p> <p>Scientists tell us that, if we continue on this path, extreme weather events and other disasters will become more and more common. The experience of the past weeks shows precisely what that means.</p> <p>Capitalism pits humanity against nature. It will destroy both, if we let it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>\u201cHow can we keep the sport alive?\u201d</p> <p>This question, asked by FFA CEO James Johnson at a press conference on Monday morning, is one that Australian football has been asking itself a lot lately. From falling crowd figures to indifferent club owners, a bushfire crisis, a gutted sports media and now a global pandemic, the Australian game finds itself forced \u2013 like a reluctant side-kick into whose nervous hands the pliers have been thrust \u2013 to make some life-or-death decisions as the clock ticks agonisingly downward.</p> <p>Some decisions have been made, though; some wires have been snipped. At the professional level, in accordance with questionable government guidelines, football has retreated into the safety of sanitised stadiums. While the W-League semi-finals and round 23 of the A-League were played openly, albeit in front of anxious and scattered crowds, the women\u2019s grand final and the men\u2019s season will continue behind closed doors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/football-to-continue-in-australia-amid-coronavirus-crisis-but-behind-closed-doors\">Football and NRL to continue amid coronavirus crisis but behind closed doors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, state and grassroots competitions will go ahead with \u201cgreater precautions\u201d in regard to hygiene and social distancing: no sharing of water bottles, no unnecessary spectators, no shaking of hands or pre-match huddles. But the irony of encouraging social distancing in a close-contact sport \u2013 seen in players light-heartedly forgoing handshakes only to grab at each other\u2019s shirts and shoulders minutes later \u2013 is difficult to ignore.</p> <p>These decisions were made, according to Johnson, from \u201cthe starting point [of] the health and well-being of our community, of our participants [\u2026] We also want to be a good citizen to the broader public and do our part in helping the issue that the whole country is in.\u201d And therein lies the paradox of Johnson\u2019s \u201clocal but global\u201d mantra: for in prioritising the local football community (or, in the more conspiratorial parts of the internet, the game\u2019s main broadcaster) by allowing competitions to continue, FFA de-prioritises the global community that football is inextricably part of.</p> <p>Indeed, despite Johnson\u2019s insistence that the governing body are being \u201cagile,\u201d \u201cresponsive\u201d and other comforting adjectives as this catastrophe unfolds, the fact remains that FFA\u2019s decision could do more harm than good in the long run. That\u2019s because these various industry-wide shutdowns we\u2019re currently experiencing are aimed at achieving a single goal: flattening the curve. As health experts around the world have <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\">increasingly and desperately stressed</a>, the appropriate response to a pandemic is to take what feels like overly-cautious measures <em>now</em> in order to prevent exponential spikes in infections and deaths <em>later; </em>to slow the spread of the virus and ensure our health systems can carry the increased patient load over a longer period of time. </p> <p>This includes removing ourselves from environments that may lead to us becoming a preventable burden on those systems, including sport. As NSW Minister for Health Brad Hazzard said on Monday afternoon: \u201cIf the community can help do what we\u2019ve asked them to do, then we can manage it out over a longer period, with far less people taking up more beds in our hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>The question, therefore, should not be how can FFA keep the <em>sport</em> alive (football, like all sport, will survive with or without its professional manifestations), but rather how can FFA keep <em>people </em>alive? As the highest-participation sport in Australia with almost two million people registered last year, it\u2019s virtually impossible that football players, teams and leagues won\u2019t be affected by the coronavirus. Continuing to allow games to go ahead \u2013 whether in professional or grassroots environments \u2013 doesn\u2019t just risk spreading the virus within the football community, but it also risks burdening the already-stretched health system through the thousands of unrelated injuries sustained through playing the game each year, taking time and care away from those who currently need help the most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-and-australian-sport-a-list-of-the-major-cancellations\">Coronavirus and Australian sport \u2013 a list of the major cancellations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s this global responsibility that some groups within Australian football are beginning to recognise. Barely 12 hours after FFA\u2019s media conference yesterday, Football South Australia decided to <a href=\"https://www.footballsa.com.au/news/football-south-australia-statement-covid-19\">suspend lower-tier competitions entirely</a>. Soon afterwards, as more A-League and W-League players expressed anxiety and confusion at FFA\u2019s decision, the players\u2019 union <a href=\"http://pfa.net.au/news/pfa-statement-2/\">released a statement</a> saying: \u201cThe players have an acute awareness of the gravity of the current situation across the community and how acutely it may impact on some of their peers. The players are committed to solidarity. If the league continues, no player group should disproportionately carry the burden imposed by doing so.\u201d</p> <p>As these groups acknowledge, the ethical ropes that tie Australian football to the rest of the world cannot be simply cast aside when the existence of its professional, profit-driven forms becomes tenuous. To ignore that connectedness is to negate the very principles being used to structure a new era for the Australian game: this player-centric, local-but-global mantra. And so the paradox wheels round again: for while football\u2019s greatest strength is in bringing people together, its responsibility now must be in keeping them apart \u2013 because that, for the time being, is how we keep them alive.</p>",

Biden can win over reluctant Latinos with a bold and progressive stance on immigration, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cI hope that he doesn\u2019t eat up the lie that he has to be more conservative on the immigration issue,\u201d said Romero, who hasn\u2019t endorsed Biden or Sanders since her favoured candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of an issue that is so important for Latino voters, water it down and not have policies that Latinos can get excited about.\u201d</p> <p>Arizona and Florida are both likely to be battlegrounds in the November election. In Arizona, one in three residents is Latino; in Florida, it\u2019s one in four.</p> <p>Early in his administration, Obama aggressively increased efforts to deport immigrants living in the country illegally. He\u2019d hoped to convince members of Congress and the public that he was serious about border security in order to secure a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would extend legal status to millions of people living in the US without authorization. The reform bill never passed, but the deportations disrupted families, drove fear in immigrant communities and left deep wounds.<br></p> <p>Any Democrat\u2019s immigration policies would be superior to Trump\u2019s, but that won\u2019t be enough to excite Latinos, said Tomas Robles, co-director of Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, a Latino organizing group that has endorsed Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot depend on people\u2019s hatred or fear of Trump to inspire them to turn out in droves for Vice President Biden,\u201d Robles said to the AP. \u201cBernie has worked hard to motivate Latinos as a base. But the entire establishment part has failed at doing the same.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f70828f088d7575594308\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:32:10.952Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US calls on Vietnam to release blogger Truong Duy Nhat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The State department have issued <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/sentencing-of-blogger-and-radio-free-asia-contributor-truong-duy-nhat/\">a statement calling for the release of Truong Duy Nhat</a>, a weekly blogger for the Vietnamese service of Radio Free Asia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/truong-duy-nhat-vietnam-blogger-radio-free-asia-thailand\">He disappeared in January 2019</a>, a day after he applied for refugee status with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok, and reappeared in custody.</p> <p>Truong Duy Nhat was sentenced to a 10-year prison term last week.

Johnson was challenged about this at his Downing Street briefing, but left it to his chief medical officer, Chris Whitty to answer.</p> \n  <p>Whitty said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, we completely agree with the secretary general that testing is absolutely critical. </p> \n   <p>And within the UK, we have three levels of testing at the moment. We have testing in intensive care systems, which is across the whole system. We have testing in hospitals for people who have got pneumonia for people got milder disease, and we have the GP network, which is testing in the community.</p> \n   <p>The one thing which we did stop doing was testing based on geography ... at this stage geography is much less important in the disease. </p> \n   <p>We do intend to continue to scale up testing. But I think it\u2019s important to realise the scale of UK testing which has been substantial.

As the virus moves to low income countries, we are deeply concerned about the impact it could have among populations with high HIV prevalence, or among malnourished children. </p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on every country and every individual to do everything they can to stop transmission.

Do it for yourself, do it for others. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he urged people around the world to stop hoarding. Tedros said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We also asked people to express their solidarity by refraining from hoarding essential items, including medicines. Hoarding can create shortages of medicines and other essential products which can exacerbate suffering. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Tedros also warned against treating Covid-19 patients at home. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We recognise that many countries have already exceeded their capacity to care for mild cases in dedicated health facilities. In that situation, countries should prioritize all their patients and those with underlying conditions. </p> \n   <p>Some countries have expanded their capacity by using stadiums and gyms to care for mild cases, with severe and critical cases cared for in hospitals. Another option is for patients with mild disease to be isolated and cared for at home.

Good luck with that.</p> \n   <p>No one knows for sure how to predict the unprecedented \u2013 or how to handle it. Initially there was a sense, certainly among the doctors to whom I have spoken,that Britain\u2019s position at the non-hysterical end of the spectrum was correct. The chief medical officer for England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/08/five-coronavirus-experts-guide-british-public-through-crisis\">Chris Whitty</a>, took the view that the illness, though highly contagious, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\">most dangerous</a> for those with a vulnerable immune system.

There were reasons only for contingencies.</p> \n   <p>As the virus expanded and other governments reacted differently, this stance was challenged. But Whitty had accepted that, if circumstances altered, policy would shift from \u201ccontain to delay\u201d. This was undermined as global hysteria rose to a peak. Other countries were reacting as had China and South Korea, and progressed to \u201clockdown\u201d. England\u2019s chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, unwisely mentioned the technical term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">herd immunity</a>\u201d, implying that Britain would over time develop resistance to coronavirus.

overall death toll from the virus currently sweeping the world.</p> \n   <p>Emissions from petrol and diesel engines were still at \u201cdangerous\u201d levels that could imperil the most vulnerable during this and future pandemics, said the European Respiratory Society (EPS), which is a member of the EPHA.</p> \n   <p>\u201cPatients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die,\u201d EPS member Sara De Matteis said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThis is likely also the case for Covid-19,\u201d added de Matteis, who is also an associate professor in occupational and environmental medicine at Italy\u2019s Cagliari University.</p> \n   <p>While there is currently no proven link between Covid-19 mortality and air pollution, one peer-reviewed study into the 2003 SARS outbreak showed that patients in regions with moderate air pollution levels were 84 percent more likely to die than those in regions with low air pollution.</p> \n   <p>According to the European Environment Agency, air pollution leads to around 400,000 early deaths across the continent annually, despite European Union air quality directives.</p> \n   <p>One Covid-19 hotspot, northern Italy, has particularly high levels of PM10 - microscopic particles of pollution due largely to road traffic.</p> \n   <p>The number of fatalities in Italy shot up by 368 to 1,809 on Sunday - more than half of all the cases recorded outside China.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

In Scotland, authorities will continue to test key workers, including critical frontline NHS staff, to ensure the people who are so essential to managing the disease but also keeping a critical infrastructure going are not self-isolating unnecessarily.</p> \n  <p>Scotland is taking the same approach to the rest of the UK in considering asking elderly people to reduce social contact amid the coronavirus outbreak, the first minister said.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon would not comment in detail about the stringent approach other countries have taken, but said: \u201cI\u2019m not privy to the advice and decision making in those countries. My responsibility is to follow the scientific advice we\u2019ve been given, to interrogate and scrutinise that advice and to apply judgement to it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The first minister said that Scotland has already taken \u201cquite significant steps\u201d to tackle the outbreak and possibly prevent a second severe spike. \u201cAsking everyone who has a fever or a cough to stay in their house for seven days is a significant step and behaviour change that we\u2019re asking people to apply.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cThat advice of course is about how we slow the spread and reduce the impact, but we do that in a way that perhaps avoids a later perhaps just as severe spike later on.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Scottish government\u2019s ban on mass gathering does not currently apply to schools, travel, shopping and work. Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, described blanket school closures that lasted a few weeks as ineffective.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[You need] a minimum of three months in order to really suppress the spread of the virus in these type of institutions. The thought that children won\u2019t mix together for three months is impossible. </p> \n   <p>We therefore risk having children congregate to other areas together, the virus is spread amongst them, so you actually have measures put in which are ineffective in keeping virus from those groups of children.</p> \n   <p>To compare talking about closing the schools for two weeks, it\u2019s very very clear from the science that is not a scientific way to either prevent the spread of the virus nor indeed to protect vulnerable people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:46:30.592Z\">at 12.46pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6f6ed68f088d75755942f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:23:11.073Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Fears of the pandemic prompting a global recession have driven the FTSE 100 in the <strong>UK</strong> down 7.2% to 4976 points.

There was a testy exchange where Sanders criticised Biden for his refusal to disavow a super PAC supporting his candidacy and his past comments on potential cuts to social security.</li> \n   <li>Joe Biden<strong> </strong><strong>vowed to choose a woman as his running mate</strong> if he won the presidential nomination.
