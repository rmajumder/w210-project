  "<p>Among the key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> on Monday 16 March:</p> <h2>The global death toll moved past 7,000</h2> <p>According to figures compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, 7,119 people have died as a result of the pandemic. In all, there have been 181,377 confirmed cases and 78,085 people have recovered.</p> <h2>Britons were told to curtail social interactions</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">The new government advice</a>, something of a U-turn, came during the prime minister\u2019s first daily press conference. Boris Johnson said people with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and anyone aged 70 years or older should pay particular heed. Anyone whose relatives showed signs of illness were told to self-isolate for two weeks.</p> <h2>Americans received similar advice</h2> <p>The US president, Donald Trump, recommended Americans avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6fd2388f088d757559485c#block-5e6fd2388f088d757559485c\">warning them</a> that the stricter measures were necessary to slow the spread of the virus and that a recession could well be on the way.</p> <h2>France stepped up isolation measures</h2> <p>During a sombre national address, the country\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6fce7c8f088d7575594830#block-5e6fce7c8f088d7575594830\">said those citizens who had not submitted to self-isolation</a> over the weekend had put themselves and the people around them at risk and announced stricter measures to be backed up by police enforcement.</p> <h2><strong>Qantas made deep cuts to its services</strong></h2> <p>Following the leads of a host of Europe-based airlines, Qantas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e7007388f085e564ad855db#block-5e7007388f085e564ad855db\">decided to slash its international flights</a>, cutting international capacity by 90% until at least the end of May, and cutting domestic capacity by about 60%.</p> <h2>Idris Elba contracted the virus</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6fc5168f085c6327bc1017#block-5e6fc5168f085c6327bc1017\">The British actor confirmed the news on Twitter, saying he was self-isolating</a>. Earlier this month he was photographed at an event at London\u2019s Wembley Arena with Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau just over week before she tested positive. Elba\u2019s fellow actor, Tom Hanks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e700aa78f088d7575594a22#block-5e700aa78f088d7575594a22\">was released from hospital quarantine</a>, while Hanks\u2019 wife Rita Wilson remained in isolation, having also testing positive.</p> <h2>G7 stressed international cooperation</h2> <p>A statement released by Downing Street <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6fcc388f085c6327bc107c#block-5e6fcc388f085c6327bc107c\">sought to highlight the significance</a> of national governments not looking solely to their own interests \u2013 acknowledging that coronavirus is a global pandemic.</p> <h2>The Grand National was cancelled</h2> <p>The sporting event, arguably the most important on the British horse racing calendar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6fe7658f085c6327bc11ae#block-5e6fe7658f085c6327bc11ae\">was the latest to be called off as a result of the pandemic</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Despite an extensive royal commission, scores of criminal trials and excellent books such as Louise Milligan\u2019s Cardinal and David Marr\u2019s The Prince, there are still some unanswered questions about child sexual abuse in the now-tattered narrative of the Catholic church in Australia.</p> <p>These include: why did these priests do such horrible things? How did they justify their crimes to themselves and to God? What kind of conversations may they have had with, say, their archbishop or monsignor, once they were rumbled by a parent or teacher or victim?</p> <p>Accounts from the paedophiles themselves that may go some way towards answering those questions are also missing from this narrative. Perhaps this is because paedophiles do not want to talk due to shame or due to the media\u2019s preference for \u2013 in some cases \u2013 giving victims airtime and denying a platform to abusers. And then there\u2019s us, the audience. Do we really want to hear from them?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/05/pandemic-netflixs-new-series-about-global-outbreaks-is-eerily-timed-and-moved-me-to-tears\">Pandemic: Netflix's new series about global outbreaks is eerily timed, and moved me to tears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are arguments for listening to perpetrators explain themselves. You can better understand the crime if you understand the criminal. And the Catholic church has for a long time been so opaque on matters of sexual abuse that any interview, no matter how painful to watch, is illuminating.</p> <p>The first episode of the three-part documentary Revelation is built around such an interview. ABC journalist Sarah Ferguson sits down with Fr Vincent Ryan (yes he is still a priest, yet to be defrocked despite his horrendous crimes against children) and tries to answer all these questions.</p> <p>Ryan is 80 now and has been accused of sexually abusing more than 30 boys aged from six to 17 from 1975 until 1995.</p> <p>He was jailed for 14 years for his crimes in 1997 and last year he was tried on two new charges. These charges form the backbone of the documentary \u2013 for the first time during an Australian criminal trial, the ABC were allowed to film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da43447e7a930496b811178dfaadc3f518bfd1ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da43447e7a930496b811178dfaadc3f518bfd1ac/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the scenes of ABC documentary Revelation, about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Ferguson behind the scenes of ABC documentary Revelation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as interviewing Ryan (who pleaded not guilty), Ferguson speaks to two of the victims, the prosecution and defence barristers, as well as a psychiatrist who specialised in treating priests.</p> <p>The documentary doesn\u2019t make a promising start, opening with an introduction from Ferguson that is as purple as a priest\u2019s Lenten vestments: \u201cThere are men living among us, like Lucifer\u2019s fallen angels. It\u2019s their ordinariness that I find disturbing. They really should look like monsters to match their deeds.\u201d</p> <p>Lucifer\u2019s fallen angels? People that should look like monsters? Really?</p> <p>Luckily such flowery language is kept to a minimum and the old technique of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d quickly takes over. And that\u2019s really all that\u2019s necessary, because there\u2019s a lot on show here that we haven\u2019t seen or heard before on our screens. Be warned \u2013 you\u2019ll need a strong stomach to digest it. Like, for example, Ryan\u2019s justification for molestation: \u201cAs far as I was concerned, I was in a relationship. I was getting the love and the human touch and belonging.\u201d</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the central crime itself. The victims \u2013 courageous men of strength and grace \u2013 tell us what happened to them.</p> <p>They don\u2019t spare us with the details, and why should they? Part of the problem, as the documentary points out, is that shame abounds. The victims suffer twice: from the act itself and then the silence and stigma after it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/03/he-made-a-fortune-from-his-trademarked-bikram-yoga-but-now-his-empire-is-in-tatters\">He made a fortune from his trademarked Bikram yoga, but now his empire is in tatters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The victims were young altar boys. What alternate moral universe was Ryan living in? It was the universe of the Catholic church, a corrupt institution that moved paedophile priests around to avoid scandal, conveniently giving them a batch of fresh victims in each new parish; an institution that saw the children as \u201cinstruments of temptation\u201d rather than the innocent victims they were.</p> <p>Revelation starts off strange, becomes upsetting and is, finally, shocking. In some ways it mimics the mechanics of a jury trial: we, at home, hear all sides. There is no room for politeness or euphemism. The whole nasty, sorry business is laid out before us, and it\u2019s hard to remain with it, but there is a strong feeling that we must bear witness. The detail of the abuse is horrendous and I wish I hadn\u2019t heard it. But maybe as someone raised Catholic and still has some cultural affinity with the Irish branch of the church, I needed to.</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"https://iview.abc.net.au/show/revelation\">Revelation airs in three parts on ABC TV</a>, starting 17 March at 8.30pm</strong></em></p>",

Since then, a growing number of firms and individuals have changed their travel behaviour, with greater numbers of people working from home. This has led to an acceleration in the reduction in passenger numbers to around 19% on London Underground and 10% on buses compared to the same week the previous year, with days later in the week showing reductions larger than that average.</p> <p>This is an evolving situation and the financial impact is difficult to predict.

  "<p>With Britain dramatically stepping up its action plan to fight the coronavirus, we explore the measures outlined by Boris Johnson on Monday and the thinking and science behind them.</p> \n<h2>Avoid all nonessential social contact and \u2018unnecessary\u2019 visits to care homes</h2> \n<p>The idea behind avoiding all unnecessary contact is simple: the fewer people you come into contact with, the fewer people can infect you, and the fewer you can infect if you are harbouring the virus. This is what social distancing is all about. </p> \n<p>At the moment, the vast majority of the population are susceptible to coronavirus infection. Interact less, and the rate of infections will slow down. This is especially important in care homes, where people are likely to be highly dependent on others and extremely vulnerable because of their age. Fewer cases means less demand on the NHS and with that, fewer fatalities.</p> \n<h2>Avoid pubs, clubs, cinemas and theatres, and work from home</h2> \n<p>The prime minister said everyone should avoid gatherings and social meeting places, but stopped short of asking them not to open. Those who can work from home, should. Any place where people sit close together \u2013 within two metres of each other \u2013 for a period of time is a place where the virus can spread. </p> \n<p>Coronavirus spreads primarily through airborne droplets, mostly those coughed or sneezed into the air. But the virus can also spread via tabletops, cutlery and toilet doors: it can survive on hard surfaces for several days if they are not cleaned properly.</p> \n<h2>The over-70s, pregnant women and those with health issues</h2> \n<p>Those who are aged over 70, people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women should be particularly careful, according to Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus tends to be far more dangerous to older people. In China, only 0.4% of 40-somethings known to have contracted the virus died. But in those aged 80 or over, the death rate was 15%. </p> \n<p>The reason is that with old age comes other diseases, a weaker immune system and worse overall health. The respiratory system itself is also weaker in the elderly. Underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes are known to raise mortality risk, but the evidence is not in on pregnant women. </p> \n<p>Last week, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and others said there was no evidence the virus could pass from mother to baby. This was not the case with previous lethal coronaviruses, Sars and Mers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.&nbsp;<b>Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days</b>.</p>\n    <p>If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.</p>\n    <p>If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.</p>\n    <p>After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.</p>\n    <p><b>If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.</b></p>\n    <p>If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.<br></p>\n    <p>Staying at home means you should:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>not go to work, school or public areas</li>\n     <li>not use public transport or taxis</li>\n     <li>not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home</li>\n     <li>not go out to buy food or collect medicine \u2013 order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 <b>but stay at least 2 metres away from other people</b>.</p>\n    <p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/\">NHS 111 coronavirus service</a>&nbsp;to find out what to do.</p>\n    <p><i>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-advice/\">NHS England</a>&nbsp;on 23 March 2020</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>12 weeks\u2019 isolation for the most vulnerable</h2> \n<p>Johnson said that by this weekend, it will be necessary to go further to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are shielded from social contact for about 12 weeks. He did not define the most serious health conditions on Monday. \u201cThis is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it\u2019s now necessary,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<p>The most vulnerable face the toughest restrictions: to reduce as far as possible all contact with others. The intention is to protect those most likely to fall seriously ill and die if they contract the infection. The 12-week period is aimed to cover the weeks when the outbreak is at its peak, whenthe highest number of people are infected.</p> \n<h2>Entire households should self-isolate for 14 days if anyone suspects they have the virus</h2> \n<p>Johnson said all members of any household which includes a single person who suffers from a dry cough or a fever should, if possible, avoid leaving the house \u201ceven to buy food or essentials\u201d.</p> \n<p>This is an admission by the government that if one person in a household gets infected, any others in the house are likely to contract the infection too. The entire household must self-isolate for 14 days, giving enough time not only for the first person\u2019s infection to run its course, but any other infections that result to appear. The advice remains to self-isolate for seven days if you have coronavirus symptoms and live alone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Testing will be ramped up</h2> \n<p>On Monday, the head of the World Health Organization said not enough tests were being carried out. Prof Whitty defended the UK\u2019s testing regime but said: \u201cWe do intend to continue to scale up testing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Scaling up testing will give scientists a clearer idea of how many infections are in the community, but Whitty was keen to promote a new test being developed by Public Health England that will detect whether people have had the infection without knowing. </p> \n<p>That test will give a truer figure of the spread of the infection in the community and reveal how dangerous the disease is not only to those who fall ill, but to all who become infected.</p> \n<h2>The UK is \u201cthree weeks\u201d behind Italy</h2> \n<p>Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said the disease is accelerating through the UK and the country is less than a month behind Italy, the worst-hit country in Europe, where more than 1,800 people have died.</p> \n<p>In the early stages, epidemics tend to follow a similar pattern of exponential growth with the number of infections rising dramatically with time until the number of people left to infect falls off. </p> \n<p>This has played out in Italy and other regions where the virus was not contained early enough. The spread is driven by transmission between people in a region rather than by imported cases.</p> \n<h2>London is the centre of the UK\u2019s outbreak</h2> \n<p>The disease is rapidly spreading throughout the capital, and both the prime minister and Whitty urged Londoners to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces.</p> \n<p>As the main urban and financial centre of the country, and the largest transport hub, it is unsurprising that the UK outbreak is most severe in London, which has had 400 confirmed cases \u2013 nearly half the total in England. </p> \n<p>Johnson said London appeared to be a few weeks ahead of the country in terms of the rising number of cases, suggesting that most of the infections came into and spread from the capital.</p> \n<h2>We are approaching \u2018the fast growth part of the upward curve\u2019 for coronavirus</h2> \n<p>According to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the UK is approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve. \u201cWithout drastic action, cases could double every five or six days,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> \n<p>He said the number of cases had probably doubled from this time last week, when the number of actual infections was estimated at between 5,000 and 10,000. </p> \n<p>Prof Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said there is uncertainty over the true figure, but added there could have been 50,000 cases in the UK so far, with about 20,000 to 25,000 infected now. </p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve seen for past three to four weeks as transmission got established in the UK is exponential growth. We think it\u2019s doubling on the order of every five to six days. It will get worse from now on,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Schools remain open \u2013 for now</h2> \n<p>Vallance said further measures such as closing schools may be necessary at some point. \u201cThose things need to be done at the right time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Schools are remaining open for the time being, but there is concern that even though children are rarely affected by the disease, they do become infected and are almost certainly able to pass the infection on to others. </p> \n<p>Johnson indicated that school closures my come when the timing is right. Sian Griffiths, emeritus professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said this may involve closing some schools in some areas but not others. The Easter holidays are looming but may start earlier than expected at some schools.</p>",
  "<p>A week is a long time in a coronavirus pandemic. Within days of Boris Johnson and his advisers announcing that anyone with symptoms of a cold should stay at home for seven days but otherwise live life as normal, the prime minister came out with a series of bombshells that will effectively confine most of the population to their homes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/life-lockdown-parma-italy-coronavirus\">Orderly, dour, cowed: how my beloved Italy is changed by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What changed was new data on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war\">the impact of Italy\u2019s out-of-control epidemic on its health service</a>. Basically, it is catastrophic, with 30% of hospitalised patients having to be admitted to intensive care. The teams of modellers at Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who advise government <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196137/crunching-numbers-coronavirus/\">crunched those numbers</a> \u2013 and the death toll and pressure on the NHS that came out were unacceptable.</p> <p>Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis\">MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis</a> and colleagues found that the mitigation strategy, as they called it \u2013 or scenario 1 \u2013 that the government had just announced would lead to 260,000 deaths. That would be not just deaths from the virus, but from other illnesses that the NHS would be too hard-pressed to treat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/\">Their modelling looked at all the interventions</a> that might help drive down the infections and deaths. There were five, they said, that would have an impact:</p> <p>\u2022 isolating people with a cough and temperature at home for seven days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/checklist-zip/giv-3902ZJMvttImTJct\" data-alt=\"Graphic - how the UK's policy compares with other European countries'\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/checklist-zip/giv-3902ZJMvttImTJct\">Graphic - how the UK's policy compares with other European countries'</a> </figure>  <p>\u2022 quarantining families where somebody has symptoms for 14 days, to allow time for any symptoms in the others to show.</p> <p>\u2022 social distancing, involving cutting the normal contacts people make at home, school or work by three-quarters.</p> <p>\u2022 social distancing for everyone over 70, by asking them to stay at home.</p> <p>\u2022 closure of schools and universities.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s mitigation strategy was about people staying home for seven days with symptoms. It was said that quarantine for families plus keeping the over-70s at home would probably follow. That package would reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and cut deaths by half. But, the researchers said, \u201cthe resulting epidemic would still likely result in 260,000 deaths and therefore overwhelm the health system (most notably intensive care units)\u201d.</p> <p>So now we have scenario 2, which the modellers call suppression. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">It takes things much further</a>, adopting all the measures except closing schools and universities. And school closures, said Ferguson, are probably also on the cards before too long.</p> <p>Ferguson and his colleague Prof Azra Ghani liken the new measures to China\u2019s actions, which succeeded in driving down the epidemic to very low numbers. But unlike in China, anything that happens in the UK will be voluntary. The government will need population buy-in for this to work.</p> <p>The bad news is that although it will keep death rates down to 20,000 or possibly just a few thousand, said Ferguson, we are looking at these social curbs through to July or August \u2013 and even when the brakes are taken off, they may have to be slammed back on again. The virus will not have disappeared and could resurge. Only a small proportion of the population will have been infected, recovered and become immune.</p> <p>The government\u2019s earlier hopes that it could rely on large proportions \u2013 maybe 60% \u2013 of the population getting ill, getting better and becoming immune <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">to build up some herd immunity</a> in the UK population \u2013 something many experts thought was dangerous \u2013 are dashed by the new strategy.</p> <p>Herd immunity is normally created by vaccinating large numbers of children, safeguarding those who cannot be inoculated. Nobody has ever tried to do that by allowing infection with a disease before \u2013 and now, it appears to have been recognised that it\u2019s not safe to try.</p>",

The backlash was predictable with petitions claiming that a black mermaid was \u201ca betrayal of Ariel\u2019s original creator\u201d. Roffey points out that one of the first folkloric instances of a mermaid was black. Atargatis was an Assyrian goddess, who had a human lover called Hadad, a shepherd, whom she killed by accident.

  "<p>Bail out the airlines? Clearly, some form of government support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/ryanair-cancels-80-per-cent-of-flights-and-does-not-rule-out-full-grounding-coronavirus\">may be needed soon</a>, but a bailout is a misleadingly broad term. Ministers should keep a couple of principles in mind as they respond to ill-defined calls for help.</p> <p>First, financial assistance \u2013 which could be loan guarantees or secured lines of credit \u2013 is best offered on an industry-wide basis on equal terms to everybody. Those terms also have to be extremely favourable to the state. If an airline wants a state loan secured against an aircraft, for example, it cannot expect that aircraft to be valued at pre-coronavirus prices.</p> <p>Second, be strict about who you\u2019re trying to support. It is not the shareholders. If owners have sanctioned business models with little equity or cash protection or unsecured assets, their losses cannot be underwritten by the public purse. Why should the Italian taxpayer cough up another \u20ac600m to rescue Alitalia, a financial basket case long before coronavirus? Even if the underlying business of an airline is viable, the price for shareholders could be steep \u2013 loss of ownership control.</p> <p>The good news, of a sort, is that strong airlines think they can absorb a fair amount of shock. As they grounded most of their fleets, easyJet, Ryanair and IAG, owner of British Airways, made a show of their supposed financial virility.</p> <p>EasyJet said it has a \u00a31.6bn cash balance, an undrawn credit facility of $500m (\u00a3402m) and mortgage-free aircraft worth \u00a34bn. Ryanair paraded cash and cash equivalents worth \u20ac4bn. IAG said it has \u20ac7bn in cash plus \u20ac1.9bn of finance facilities. It not clear how quickly those resources would be depleted during an extended period of no flying, but at least the companies seem to have the right approach: they know their own funds are first in line.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some non-lending methods of support look simple to grant. It\u2019s fair for airlines to ask that their rights over landing slots be secured until the turmoil passes; it\u2019s not as if other airlines are itching to launch new flights to nowhere. There\u2019s also an argument for suspending air traffic control charges during the recovery phase, whenever that arrives. As for a suspension of air passenger duty, governments can take a view when there are passengers again.</p> <p>In the meantime, ministers need to tread carefully: as Virgin Atlantic demonstrated, the airline folk who will need most protection in the weeks ahead will be the employees. Keep your eye on them.</p> <h2>Is this a good moment to shut down the stock markets?</h2> <p>If stock markets are only delivering confidence-sapping readings, why not close them for a while?</p> <p>After yet another big \u201cdown\u201d day for share prices, the idea might sound appealing. Let every investor, saver and pension fund trustee take a time-out from staring at red screens. It would be the ultimate circuit-breaker. Instead of a 15-minute halt to trading, as happened again on Wall Street on Monday after an opening fall of 7%, everyone could go away and reflect on the long-term.</p> <p>A moment\u2019s thought, though, says it would be a terrible idea. First, the only guaranteed outcome would be more panic. There would be an immediate spill-over into markets that matter more for the functioning of economies in the real world, such as government debt.</p> <p>Second, even if almost nobody is currently using stock markets for the traditional purpose of raising fresh capital, share prices are still giving useful price signals. One of the most important came when stocks tumbled last week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/mar/12/trump-bid-to-calm-crisis-simply-caused-more-financial-chaos\">President Trump tried to reassure the US public</a> that his administration was on top of events. Investors\u2019 verdict \u2013 that the president was still underestimating the size of the healthcare crisis \u2013 was brutal but necessary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One can \u2013 just \u2013 imagine circumstances in which closure might be advantageous: if governments around the globe were about to unveil a coordinated fiscal strategy to reinvigorate economic activity. A temporary suspension, if followed by a truly impressive fiscal barrage, might add to the sense of a reset and encourage a whoosh of confidence.</p> <p>The trouble is, such a joined-up global approach is currently hard to imagine. The market\u2019s lukewarm response to the G7 finance ministers\u2019 vague statement on Monday about doing \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d was another useful indicator: there was an absence of detail, which is the bit that matters.

They should have more family contact, not less, he said.</p> \n  <p>And, even though this has been characterised as people being asked to stay at home, he said that people would not have to stay at home all the time: He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will almost certainly, as a four-country UK, we will move to a position in the next few weeks where we will ask those groups [the over-70s and those with pre-existing conditions] to not stay at home in the social isolation way that we are telling the symptomatic to do so, but to reduce their social contact.</p> \n   <p>It might be mosques, it might be churches, it might be bingo ... and pubs [that people have to avoid].

Only 11 days ago Boris Johnson was saying that as far as possible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d. </a>Only five days ago Rishi Sunak delivered a budget that featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/11/budget-2020-rishi-sunak-pmqs-boris-johnson-chairs-cabinet-ahead-of-rishi-sunak-unveiling-his-first-budget-live-newsrish?page=with:block-5e68f9068f087df56e4c6829#block-5e68f9068f087df56e4c6829\">a total coronavirus rescue package worth \u00a330bn. </a>Less than a week later, with sections of the economy grinding to a halt, that is starting to look well short of what\u2019s needed. <strong>Mel Stride,</strong> the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, said as much on the Westminster Hour last night. He told the programme: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The forecast upon which the budget rests is already well out of date, it doesn\u2019t show booming growth over the following years anyway. If this continues and there is a fundamental and deep and longer term impact, there will be some very difficult decisions to take around borrowing, taxing and spending.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It must be serious because No 10 let <strong>Grant Shapps</strong>, the transport secretary, give an interview to the Today programme this morning. Here are the main points he made.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps suggested rail companies could soon be allowed to run reduced services. </strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51896169\">Rail companies have been asking for their franchise obligations to be reduced because passenger numbers have been plummeting</a>.<strong> </strong>Asked about this, Shapps said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are working with [the rail companies] to see what it is that we need to do to sustain them. People still need to be be able to travel. Some of that is about how many trains are put on the line at any one time. I\u2019m meeting with the train companies this week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if that meant companies being freed from some of their current obligations, he went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is quite clearly an exceptional international moment in time, international crisis. And we need to be flexible as a country to react to that. And I\u2019ll be driven by, amongst other things, the demand. There is no point running ghost trains any more than there\u2019s any point in running ghost planes. But those are conversations which are ongoing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>By \u201cghost planes\u201d Shapps was referring to rules that require airlines to fly planes, even if they were empty, just to preserve their landing slots. He claimed that he had been successful in obtaining a dispensation from these rules from the EU. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government would be considering measures to help the airline industry.</strong> He said that he had been speaking to the aviation industry over recent days, and that he would be taking their proposals to an economic business and response committee being chaired by the chancellor to discuss what the government could do to help. Asked what the government would do, he said the industry had \u201ca variety of different asks\u201d.

  "<p>World leaders at a G7 video summit told Donald Trump that medical firms must share and coordinate research on coronavirus vaccines rather than provide products exclusively to one country.</p> \n<p>The US president has been accused by German political leaders of trying to buy exclusive US access to vaccines being prepared by a German firm, CureVac laboratory.</p> \n<p>The German firm and the US have denied the move, but the episode, first reported in the German press at the weekend, has symbolised fears that Trump does not have an instinct to cooperate with other world leaders to fight the virus.</p> \n<p>There had not been any sign of a coordinated international response to the pandemic until Monday\u2019s G7 call, in contrast to the 2008 financial crash. Many countries have opted for unilateral monetary and health initiatives, sometimes in competition with each other.</p> \n<p>After the one-hour call, members of the G7 issued a joint statement of solidarity, saying: \u201cBy acting together, we will work to resolve the health and economic risks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and set the stage for a strong recovery of strong, sustainable economic growth and prosperity.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU council president Charles Michel implicitly criticised any go-it-alone move on vaccines, saying: \u201cWe expressed a very strong political will that we considered it very important to work together to develop vaccines and therapies.\u201d</p> \n<p>The EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, added that the G7 had learned lessons from the previous Ebola epidemic on the need to set up a platform of renowned scientists, known as CEPI \u2013 Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation \u2013 to share research.</p> \n<p>She also said it was \u201cof the utmost importance that neighbouring countries harmonise their measures so that there is the same strong message to the people that the member states are conveying, because that then increases the certainty of the people\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UK has until now largely been out of line with mainland European states on its response to the crisis, making fewer announcements \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">until Monday\u2019s dramatic moves</a> \u2013 on social distancing.</p> \n<p>Some countries, notably Singapore, have even accused the UK of abandoning any effort to combat the virus. Boris Johnson spent some part of the video conference explaining the rationale behind the UK approach.</p> \n<p>No major new economic measures were announced at the end of the meeting, but White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said \u201cthey all want to do whatever it takes\u201d. Ahead of the call, the US Federal Reserve on Sunday had already cut interest rates to near zero and announced plans for $700bn (\u00a3570bn) in bond purchases.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson implied further demand-side measures may be in the pipeline, saying: \u201cThere is a widespread agreement among colleagues in the G7 that we are going to need to make sure everybody has access to liquidity and that if we do things jointly, then I think that the global markets will understand that we\u2019re all operating in the same sort of fiscal framework and I think we\u2019ll be much more successful that way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The difficulty is that economic activity is collapsing with every move to curtail movement and social contact.</p> \n<p>The idea of a summit at leader level, bringing together the main western economies and Japan, was proposed last week by Emmanuel Macron, the French president.</p> \n<p>Since then, the crisis has spiralled and the major economic interventions by the US Federal Reserve, coupled with steps by the Japanese central bank, had failed to reassure markets, leaving world leaders to hold their talks against the backdrop pf another round of crashing stock markets and figures showing the spread of virus in Europe is now worse than in China.</p> \n<p>The EU largely used the summit to inform the other states it was closing its external borders for a month to all countries outside the Schengen visa area. EU finance ministers met separately.</p> \n<p>The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The US is the current chair of the G7, but Trump\u2019s leadership on coronavirus has been haphazard and the US president, who has an inherent dislike of multilateral solutions, had to be coaxed into holding the summit.</p> \n<p>Robin Niblett, the director of the Chatham House thinktank, had warned the epidemic represented a make-or-break moment for international cooperation.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe disjointed global economic response to Covid-19, with its enormous ramifications for global prosperity and economic stability, has blown into the open the urgent need for an immediate reaffirmation of international political and economic cooperation.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Kudlow insisted the call had been worthwhile, and said the summit had expressed solidarity with Japanese hopes that the Olympics will still be able to go ahead this summer.</p> \n<p>Trump did not consult with European leaders before he imposed the US travel ban last week and the weekend revelation that the US sought to secure exclusive access to a potential vaccine by offering a lucrative contract to CureVac laboratory in south-west Germany has infuriated public opinion. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

  "<p>The new week that is now under way will be like no other. Europe is officially the centre of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/european-countries-take-radical-steps-to-combat-coronavirus\" title=\"\">global coronavirus pandemic</a>. Last weekend saw the imposition of drastic new measures by governments across the continent, with schools, museums, businesses and national borders closed. Gatherings, including major sporting fixtures, have been cancelled and states of emergency declared. In the UK, local elections that were due to take place in May have been postponed. In Italy it was announced that 368 people had died in 24 hours \u2013 the worst single-day death toll for any country including China, where the Covid-19 outbreak began in November. Markets around the world have fallen sharply, with the FTSE 100 closing on Monday at an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/16/recession-markets-tumble-fed-emergency-rate-cut-coronavirus-ftse-dow-iag-flutter-business-live?page=with:block-5e6fab9c8f085c6327bc0e9c\" title=\"\">eight-year low</a>.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s late afternoon press conference on Monday, and the promise of daily televised briefings, went some way to calm justified fears about his government\u2019s approach to the coronavirus crisis. In a dramatic ratcheting up of official guidance, described by the prime minister as \u201cvery draconian\u201d, entire households are now asked to quarantine themselves for 14 days if any member has either of the two key symptoms of a high temperature or continuous cough. Everyone should minimise non-essential contact, work from home if possible and avoid unnecessary travel. Vulnerable groups, including over-70s and pregnant women, should stay indoors for 12 weeks.</p> <p>Nothing about these instructions could be described as reassuring. A large number of businesses are likely to go bust. But the manner of their delivery, in a public forum, was at least an improvement on the events of last weekend, when the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-14/elderly-to-be-quarantined-for-four-months-in-wartime-style-mobilisation-to-combat-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">proposal to quarantine over-70s</a> first emerged via an off-the-record briefing with a single journalist. Direct communication by ministers and their officials is the least that the country should expect.</p> <p>Messaging aside, questions about the government\u2019s strategy will not go away. The idea of building \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\" title=\"\">herd immunity</a>\u201d, rather than preventing infections, has provoked strong criticism from experts as well as alarm among members of the public. And while the government has now announced much stronger steps aimed at preventing infections, its approach is still out of step with much of the rest of the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-education-officials-to-discuss-possible-school-closures-in-england\" title=\"\">Schools in the UK</a> remain open unlike in many other European states.</p> <p>The World Health Organization reiterated on Monday its view that tests should be at the heart of the official response. Testing, combined with isolation and contact tracing \u2013 in order to identify and contain as many clusters as possible \u2013 was the strategy pursued in South Korea and other Asian countries where outbreaks appear to have peaked. But the UK is sticking to an approach that requires only people needing hospital treatment to be tested. The twin aims of the plan set out by Mr Johnson and his advisers on Monday are to \u201csuppress the curve\u201d of the Covid-19 outbreak, in order to give the NHS the best chance of coping with those needing treatment, and to shield from infection those groups who are known to be at risk.</p> <p>This strategy will now be put to the test, as the UK enters what officials described as the disease\u2019s \u201cfast-growth period\u201d. As well as the virus itself there are all its knock-on effects: on employment, education, travel plans, other health issues, social life and income. Panic buying last weekend, as supermarket shelves in many places were emptied, along with closures of theatres and workplaces, have brought the reality of a pandemic sharply home. And while it is tempting to mock as overblown health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/03/14/must-do-everything-power-protect-lives/\" title=\"\">comparison to the blitz</a>, it is true that the situation we now find ourselves in more closely resembles dystopian fiction than anything most people have experienced.</p> <p>An exceptionally difficult period lies ahead, one which will be far harder to manage for those already struggling with health or family difficulties, or to make ends meet. With official instructions to avoid social contact, most individuals will turn inward. But as a society, we must do everything in our power \u2013 including through public policy \u2013 to reach beyond our family circles, and ensure the poorest and loneliest do not bear the brunt.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global cases surpass 175,000</h2> <p>The number of people around the world known to have died as a result of the pandemic reached 6,706. According to figures compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, 175,250 confirmed cases have been identified globally, 77,658 of whom have recovered.</p> <h2>Italian death toll exceeds 2,000</h2> <p>The death toll in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> from Covid-19 has increased to more than 2,000 with the announcement that another 349 victims have died. The country has identified about 25,000 cases.</p> <h2>Test, test, test, WHO urges</h2> <p>In a strongly worded attack on governments that have neglected or carried out only limited testing, which include the UK, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: \u201cWe have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate. You cannot fight the fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don\u2019t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case.\u201d</p> <h2>Britons told to isolate</h2> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember anything like it in my lifetime,\u201d the UK\u2019s prime minister told citizens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">as he advised them to avoid non-essential contact with other people</a>. That included visits to relatives in care homes, as well as social events such as going to pubs, theatres and restaurants, Boris Johnson said, acknowledging that it amounted to demanding a huge change in the way people live their lives for an indefinite period.</p> <p>But he stopped short of giving the advice a legal underpinning or threatening sanctions should people choose not to follow it.</p> <p>Johnson said families should stay at home if any member of the household is ill and said people aged 70 and older, believed to be the group at greatest risk, should avoid all unnecessary contact. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said schools could yet be closed, which the government has so far shied away from.</p> <h2>UK cases increase by nearly 200</h2> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said 53 people had died and figures from the Department of Health and Social Care showed the country had identified 1,543 confirmed sufferers, up 181 from 1,372 in 24 hours. Officials said 44,105 people had been tested in the UK, of which 42,562 had been confirmed negative.</p> <h2>Europe continues shutdown measures</h2> <p>The EU proposed suspending all non-essential travel for 30 days, the president of the EU commission has announced.

The closure would not apply to commerce or trade, he said.</p> <h2>Global recession concerns mount</h2> <p>Financial markets around the world plunged amid fears of a recession as a result of the pandemic and the measures taken across the world to stop its spread.

St Mungo\u2019s helped create a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for homeless people by sharing personal data with the Home Office without consent.</p> <p>\u201cBy doing so, they forfeited the trust of vulnerable migrants, making the work of outreach teams more difficult.

  "<p>Four centuries is a long time to wait for justice, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/05/artemisia-gentileshi-painter-beyond-caravaggio\">Artemisia Gentileschi</a> hasn\u2019t got it yet. What a cruel joke that, after being assaulted and dishonoured in her lifetime, forgotten for centuries, then slighted by art snobs who affect to prefer her father Orazio, the greatest, most revolutionary woman artist before modern times has now become a cultural victim of the coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/artemisia/artemisia-postponed\">The National Gallery in London has postponed its exhibition Artemisia</a>. It had no choice, with works due to come from locked-down Italy and loans from America facing global air paralysis.</p> <p>This is a tragedy for anyone who likes to see a wrong righted. Artemisia should be a household name \u2013 and this exhibition promised to make her just that. As long ago as last summer, I met with its visionary curator <a href=\"https://www.alainelkanninterviews.com/letizia-treves/\">Letizia Treves</a> to find out what she planned to include. I was thrilled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"340c14798c4053443e19eed82a7c34c72f1218c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/340c14798c4053443e19eed82a7c34c72f1218c0/0_0_4092_5814/704.jpg\" alt=\"Susanna and the Elders by Artemisia Gentileschi, 1610.\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A painted nightmare \u2026 Susanna and the Elders by Artemisia Gentileschi, 1610.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GL Archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was to include her prodigious teenage masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.theartstory.org/artist/gentileschi-artemisia/artworks/\">Susanna and the Elders</a>, which she signed and dated in 1610, age 17. It is astonishingly accomplished \u2013 her father boasted accurately that she could already outdo the leading male professionals \u2013 yet it is a painted nightmare. The two elders don\u2019t just spy from a distance on the naked Susanna in this brightly lit scene that has the unreality of De Chirico. They creep right up to her. They don\u2019t give her any breathing space.</p> <p>It eerily mirrors the artist\u2019s own experience of being abused by two men. In 1612, Orazio Gentileschi brought a charge against the painter Agostino Tassi of raping his daughter. There was a court case in which Artemisia had her name blackened by Tassi and his defence witnesses, and underwent torture. The National Gallery planned to include the original handwritten transcript from Rome\u2019s archives.</p> <p>My own interpretation of the document for <a href=\"https://www.laurenceking.com/product/artemisia-gentileschi/\">a new biography of Artemisia Gentileschi </a>shocked me. Tassi claimed to be her art teacher, but the truth was far worse. In an uncannily similar situation to the one she shows in Susanna and the Elders, Tassi and a papal official called Cosimo Quorli harassed and pressured her for months. This was a conspiracy against a young woman hatched at the heart of the Rome of the popes.</p> <p>The National Gallery exhibition was to lay it all bare. It was to show the painting I believe she created in the heat of these events and gave to Tassi as a carnival present. <a href=\"https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/judith-beheading-holofernes\">Judith </a><a href=\"https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/judith-beheading-holofernes\">Beheading Holofernes</a> was due to be loaned by the Capodimonte Museum in Naples. In it, the dishonoured Artemisia paints a plan for a murder. Two young women are attacking a man. But how can they do it? Teamwork. One of them has climbed on his bed to pin him down. Meanwhile, the other \u2013 Judith, or, rather, Artemisia \u2013 is hacking his head off. He\u2019s conscious but he can\u2019t do anything. His blood pours down the side of the bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0bd144952b38f62f6e206d445bc38a161f2d72d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0bd144952b38f62f6e206d445bc38a161f2d72d/74_85_2109_2559/824.jpg\" alt=\"Judith Beheading Holofernes by Artemisia Gentileschi, c1612.\" width=\"824\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teamwork \u2026 Judith Beheading Holofernes by Artemisia Gentileschi, c1612.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artemisia Gentileschi/\u00a9 Gabinetto fotografico delle Gallerie degli Uffizi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But how does she stand up as an artist? Was she a one- or two-hit wonder? I think everyone would have agreed on her brilliance after seeing this show. It was due to include her lovely and moving <a href=\"https://www.dia.org/art/collection/object/judith-and-her-maidservant-head-holofernes-45746\">Judith and Her Maidservant</a> from the Pitti Palace, Florence, in which the assassin duo look vigilantly into the night, her subversively real nude <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_(Artemisia_Gentileschi,_Ferrara)\">Cleopatra</a>, her recently identified self-portraits, and the great <a href=\"https://www.italianopera.org/img/gentileschi_allegoria.jpg\">Allegory of Painting</a> from the Royal Collection.</p> <p>Talk about a cursed artist. Artemisia Gentileschi had to fight tooth and nail for recognition in her lifetime. She survived rape and public shaming. Her extraordinary letters to a lover, found in 2011 and due to be shown in this exhibition, reveal that she also endured an unemployable husband, the deaths of her children, debt and falling out with her father. She was dogged by bad luck \u2013 no sooner did she secure a place at the English court than her patron King Charles I went to war with parliament and got his head chopped off. Decapitation wherever she looked. Fleeing to Naples, she sailed smack into another bloody revolution. She died there, probably in 1654. Her grave is lost.</p> <p>Like Caravaggio, whom she probably met when she was a child and whose intense dark and light inspired hers, she was forgotten in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were both rediscovered by the 20th-century Italian art historian <a href=\"http://www.travelingintuscany.com/art/art/villailtasso.htm\">Roberto Longhi</a>. His wife Anna Banti wrote a novel called Artemisia that\u2019s a classic of neorealism. But while Caravaggio\u2019s fame grew, Artemisia\u2019s has, until recently, stuttered.</p> <p>Then along came Treves. The exhibition she put together was boldly thought through. It was the show Artemisia has been awaiting \u2013 the one to establish once and for all that she\u2019s Caravaggio\u2019s heir and a revolutionary whose art speaks clearly to our time.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t have to wait too much longer.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.laurenceking.com/product/artemisia-gentileschi/\">Artemisia Gentileschi</a> by Jonathan Jones is published by Laurence King, \u00a312.99.</p></li> </ul>",

She was a dedicated Labour councillor in London for more than a decade throughout the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>Born in London, Enid was the second daughter of Bertha (nee Brown) and Zadik Heiber, a businessman, both from Polish-Jewish families. She grew up with her sister, Jacqueline, near the shop her mother ran on High Street Kensington, selling ladies\u2019 lingerie, corsetry and hosiery.</p> <p>She attended St Paul\u2019s girls\u2019 school in Hammersmith and in 1947 won a place at the London School of Economics to study government and politics.

Her first post was to chair the film viewing board, a censorship committee, with a young Ken Livingstone as her vice-chair. Enid caused controversy almost immediately by announcing her opposition to the idea of government censorship and suggesting that her post ought to be abolished. When a proposal to do this was brought forward in 1975, it attracted news coverage and outrage from the Nationwide Festival of Light, a Christian organisation. Enid became a heroine of the civil liberties movement at the time. But her plan failed because a number of labour GLC members got cold feet and voted it down.</p> <p>She was later appointed vice-chair of the transport committee, and took a great interest and role in improving London transport. She was also an active member of the Inner London Education Authority, taking a particular interest in special needs education. As a Camden councillor she chaired the arts and libraries committee and became a governor of Greater London Arts and the British Film Institute.</p> <p>In later years Enid returned to academia as a professor of government and politics at Middlesex University. She wrote books on local government, film censorship, the politics of transport, devolution and localism, and regional identity and diversity.</p> <p> Many of my friends described Enid as formidable and slightly terrifying on first meeting, but they soon saw that she was always interested and kind and was an accepting person without prejudice.</p> <p>She had a wonderful marriage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/12/ernest-wistrich-obituary\" title=\"\">Ernest Wistrich</a>, whom she married in 1950; he died in 2015. </p> <p>She is survived by my brother, Daniel, and me.

  "<p>In flagrant disregard for the old adage about the show going on, the entertainment industry has ground to a halt. Reports of coronavirus outbreaks put a stop to production on everything from the teen soap du jour to a high-profile Elvis biopic. (Get well soon, Hanx.) With movie theaters shut down across the globe, studios have pulled their big-ticket releases en masse with an eye on a more clement climate by late summer or fall. Even if the theaters were still running, it\u2019d be a moot point, given the populace\u2019s general reluctance to leave the house for any high-density social areas.

Others have taken this as an occasion to revisit films that speak more directly to the phenomenon at hand; screening rentals and downloads of Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s disaster thriller Contagion have soared, as have considerations of its chillingly realistic simulation of a pandemic. On Twitter, colleagues have recommended Ling Ma\u2019s recent novel Severance and the 2011 cult sci-fi thought experiment Perfect Sense, more dystopian accounts of worldwide sickness.</p> <p>The 1995 film Outbreak \u2013 the original release of which hits the 25-year mark this week, a creepy cosmic wrinkle of chance \u2013 has also enjoyed a huge surge in streaming views (as of writing, it\u2019s the third most watched film on Netflix in the US) as its subject matter grows increasingly, stomach-churningly relevant. It would appear to be a perverse quirk of the modern human condition that compels us to seek out media foregrounding that which upsets us, but this has been hardwired into our pathology for millennia. Viewers have been flocking to these films for a sanctioned version of exposure therapy, in which an inconceivable menace can be experienced and survived.

Such films as Contagion and Outbreak \u2013 or less literal projections, like the zombie armageddon of 28 Days Later \u2013 allow audiences to vicariously live through the end of days and survey what will be left after. It\u2019s a form of emergency preparedness for the mind, rendering thinkable the unthinkable and theorizing where the average person\u2019s place in all of it might be. It\u2019s a disquieting way to kill two hours, as affirmed by the sheen of dread covering every \u201cI rewatched Contagion today, oh boy\u201d essay. All the same, it theoretically leaves the viewer a bit tougher and more inured to whatever horrors may still come.</p> <p>But I\u2019d contend that there\u2019s a faint futility to analyzing apocalypse viewing of any sort, because when something occupies as much mental real estate as the widespread panic of Covid-19, everything becomes apocalypse viewing. If it\u2019s impossible not to spend every waking hour obsessing over the precarious state of the public\u2019s health, it\u2019s likewise impossible not to project those anxieties on to anything one might choose to watch.</p> <p>To speak anecdotally: just last night, I did what all the reports said to do and tore my eyes away from the news to spend time on the couch with my loved ones. The safe refuges of Mad Men and 30 Rock reruns, however, didn\u2019t afford the instant morphine wave of relief they usually do. Any premise or plot development could be contorted into an unnerving parallel with the viral elephant we desperately wanted to keep out of the room.</p> <p>Don Draper has a panic attack after his shameful secrets are nearly outed for the umpteenth time, and his shaking feverish sweats bring to mind only one thing. Liz Lemon advises Jack Donaghy that his elderly mother may not be long for this world, and that he would do well to get whatever closure he can with her while there\u2019s still time \u2013 that one doesn\u2019t even require much of a stretch. With the stakes this high, anything and everything can be a hypochondriac trigger.</p> <p>For the first time of my life, moving pictures have proven insufficient consolation from the day\u2019s stresses. At times like this, the viewing equivalent of the fight-or-flight response should drive the Homo sapiens toward the full-on confrontation of disaster movies as a method of gaining control or the warming effects of escapism as a haven of denial. But even those of us usually in the escapism camp can only take that defense so far. It\u2019s starting to seem like the only real therapy is the detached, unplugged, attention-commanding simplicity of chopping vegetables.</p>",

We do not yet know the exact assumptions given they have yet to be shared by the government; but if these are some of them, the evidence is not clear.

And NHS staff don\u2019t understand why pressure is not being immediately taken off the health sector, to give time to build capacity. Now is the time for decisive action, especially given that we still are learning about the virus.

Health staff on Covid-19 wards need to know if they have the virus \u2013 not only so they can protect their families, but also so they don\u2019t go on to expose others in the hospital. We need to avoid clusters of cases among vulnerable groups there, which is what occurred early in Italy\u2019s outbreak.</p> \n<p>The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said we need to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/16/test-test-test-who-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-video\">test, test, test</a>\u201d.

It minimises further spread and it quickly treats those with the virus and that\u2019s the key behind our very low fatality rate.\u201d If capacity is a problem within the UK, then the government needs to communicate a clear plan of how many tests can currently be conducted, who will be prioritised and why, and what the plane is for scale-up.</p> \n<p>Second, we need to be protecting our frontline health workers by ensuring they have adequate personal protective gear in line with WHO guidance, and that they are not being pressured to see patients when it could be a risk to them. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, says the federal government will now <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/national-govt--politics/gov-virus-testing-will-prioritize-medical-staff-elderly/yovTo6DXOdy54JxBQsjmeJ/\" title=\"\">prioriti</a><a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/national-govt--politics/gov-virus-testing-will-prioritize-medical-staff-elderly/yovTo6DXOdy54JxBQsjmeJ/\" title=\"\">se health workers</a> and frontline responders.

A clear statement from the government that this will be prioritised is important, as our health workforce is limited, precious and cannot be manufactured in a day or weeks.</p> \n<p>Third, we need to buy time for the NHS to acquire more ventilators, set up sufficient beds and get in the other equipment that will be needed in the coming days and weeks.

The virus will get you if you don\u2019t move quickly \u2026 if you need to be right before you move, you will never win.\u201d There is generally consensus that, while disruptive both economically and socially, short-term social distancing is effective at slowing transmission. The debate is what happens when these restrictions are lifted and how sustainable \u201cshutting down\u201d society is. But right now, what we need is time. Time for the NHS to prepare, for rapid diagnostics, for vaccine trials to be conducted and for antiviral therapies to be trialled.</p> \n<p>Right now there is confusion among the public about how serious this crisis is; whether the media are overhyping it; and who to trust, given different governments are taking different strategies. Many individuals and institutions are making their own decisions based on what they are hearing from friends and colleagues from around the world.

  "<p>Greece is hoping critical talks between the EU and Ankara will help ease the border crisis that has weighed heavily on the country since Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, declared he had \u201copened the gates\u201d to Europe for migrants and refugees.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said planned talks between the German and French leaders on one hand, and Erdo\u011fan on the other, on Tuesday would be an opportunity to finally \u201cset the record straight\u201d.</p> <p>At a time when the coronavirus outbreak has overtaken the global agenda, neither Brussels nor Athens want a repeat of the dangerously chaotic scenes that recently played out on the Greek-Turkish border.</p> <p>\u201cNow that things have quietened down, this is the time to set the record straight and make sure that what has happened is not going to happen again,\u201d Mitsotakis said.</p> <p>The Greek leader called his Turkish counterpart\u2019s threat of \u201cunleashing\u201d migrants on Europe utterly unacceptable.

It is very clearly a geopolitical issue,\u201d he said, arguing that innocent people being used as political pawns were the real victims of a crisis constructed by Erdo\u011fan to pressure Europe for further financial assistance and support in Idlib, Syria\u2019s last rebel-held province.</p> <p>Even before the latest flare-up, Greece was being targeted with renewed vigour by traffickers with 74,600 people arriving last year \u2013 a jump of 151% compared with 2017 \u2013 according to the UN refugee agency. The rise had not only fuelled tensions with Turkey but fomented friction between locals and migrants especially on islands where vigilante groups have appeared.</p> <p>But signalling that some good had come out of it, Mitsotakis welcomed Europe\u2019s decision to finally implement relief measures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-to-offer-2000-to-migrants-willing-to-go-home-from-greek-islands\">instituting a programme of voluntary returns to alleviate Greece\u2019s vastly overcrowded camps</a> and accepting to relocate minors across the bloc.

As the historian of medicine Frank Snowden recently<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-pandemics-change-history\"> told the New Yorker</a>: \u201cEpidemic diseases are not random events that afflict societies capriciously and without warning \u2026 on the contrary, every society produces its own specific vulnerabilities.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has exposed the effects of successive budgetary cuts on the NHS, leaving the health service under-resourced and ill-equipped to cope with a pandemic. And like other pandemics before it, coronavirus will disproportionately take the lives of those who are most vulnerable: the elderly, the homeless, prisoners, migrants denied access to healthcare, and those with existing health conditions such as cancer and HIV.</p> <p>The virus has also shone a light on another fatal weakness in our health system: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/04/market-coronavirus-vaccine-us-health-virus-pharmaceutical-business\">profit-driven pharmaceutical innovation model</a> that we rely upon to develop life-saving vaccines and medicines.</p> <p>The news that Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal\">has sought to buy up the exclusive rights to a promising </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal\">Covid-19 vaccine</a> from a German biotech firm has been greeted with anger. During a global crisis, when all of humanity is at risk, our sense of fairness \u2013 and our own self-interest \u2013 makes this shameless attempt to buy the right to life (with little regard for those it excludes) seem immoral.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the same way that pandemics show the worst in us, they can also teach us how to make ourselves safer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this is about more than just Trump. Coronavirus should give us pause to reflect upon whether the pharmaceutical industry, and the monopolies that drive its profits, should continue to control which medicines will be developed, and who will get to access them.</p> <p>Profit is what drives decision-making in the pharmaceuticals industry. It\u2019s why we don\u2019t have drugs to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, which kill millions of the world\u2019s poor every year \u2013 and it\u2019s also why we aren\u2019t closer to finding a vaccine for Covid-19.

The Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a foundation based in Washington DC, was established in 2017 to drive public investment in R&amp;D for pandemic treatments, but even today it complains that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/contributors/pharma-vaccines.html?searchResultPosition=1\">it has struggled to interest pharmaceutical companies</a> in research that could save countless lives.<br><br>As companies are starting to see the potential for profit in Covid-19, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/\">investment has grown</a>; like <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/10/2329?ijkey=cc719bb23cad9ce1a8ab5e8947978d9bdb281780&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha\">almost every drug brought to market</a>, the public sector will play a critical role in funding almost every candidate vaccine and treatment. But there is a huge risk that without government intervention, any vaccine for coronavirus will be priced so steeply that only rich countries will be able to afford it. <br><br>In the US, Bernie Sanders has called for any coronavirus vaccine to be <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/election-2020/bernie-sanders-promises-absolutely-free-coronavirus-vaccine-if-elected/\">made available for free</a>. Trump\u2019s move to buy up exclusive use of a candidate vaccine for Americans does not bode well. The UK must act differently. In the same way that we have seen the moral imperative of an NHS that guarantees equitable healthcare to all, we need to apply conditions on research funding that prohibit profiteering from Covid-19, so everyone across the globe who needs treatment can get it. This should be the first step towards a reordering of the pharmaceutical innovation model, away from profit and towards public health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/first-participant-us-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-moderna-dose\">First participant in US coronavirus vaccine trial to be given dose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the same way that pandemics show the worst in us, they can also teach us how to make ourselves safer.

Those over 70 years old will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-uk-over-70s-to-be-asked-to-self-isolate-within-weeks-hancock-says\">confined to quarters</a>, possibly for months on end. Gatherings of more than 500 people may be banned. Land will be compulsorily acquired for mass burials. Hancock drew comparisons with the wartime blitz, with bombs \u201cpounding every night, with rationing and loss of life\u201d.</p> <p>The contrast of such language with Whitty\u2019s caution was stark, though Hancock accepted that decisions were \u201cnot yet taken\u201d. So why mention them, especially when he had not reversed the odd decision not to provide public testing for the virus? The answer can only be the political instinct to hype a crisis. Now Johnson is to do likewise, with a daily attempt to calm nerves \u2013 or capture attention, according to taste.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/doctors-scared-coronavirus-crisis-nhs-consultant-staff\">We doctors are scared of the coronavirus crisis.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global death toll from the coronavirus outbreak passes 6,500</strong></h2> <p>Almost 170,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 6,509 have died, with cases and deaths outside China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-spain-takes-over-private-healthcare-amid-more-european-lockdowns\">overtaking those in the country</a> where the outbreak began, according to a Reuters tally.</p> <p>The most substantial infection centre outside China is in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a>, where there are nearly 25,000 confirmed infections and more than 1,800 deaths.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, which the World Health Organization described as the centre of the pandemic, France has 4,500 cases and 91 deaths, Germany has 11 deaths and more than 5,700 infections, the Netherlands has 20 deaths and 2,270 infections, Switzerland has 14 deaths and 2,200 infections, and the UK has 21 deaths and 1,144.</p> <p>The next worst affected country is Iran, where there are just under 14,000 confirmed cases and 724 deaths. There are fears that the country\u2019s fragile health services and economy are struggling to cope with the outbreak, and on Friday, satellite imaging appeared to show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-iran-mass-graves-qom\">mass graves dug in the city of Qom to bury coronavirus victims.</a></p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson to chair the daily coronavirus press conferences</strong></h2> <p>Boris Johnson, the prime minister, is to address the nation on the coronavirus threat again today, amid widespread criticism of the measures so far taken by his government to tackle the outbreak.</p> <p>The last time Johnson spoke directly to Britons he told us all that many of our loved ones would die, before promptly disappearing from sight over the weekend. Government plans have since been drip-fed to the public through media articles, some official, some unattributed, many contradictory.</p> <p>However, as my colleague Andrew Sparrow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/boris-johnson-to-hold-daily-coronavirus-press-briefings\">reported last night</a>, on Monday afternoon Johnson will hold the first of what are intended to be daily ministerial press conferences on the crisis.</p> <h2>NHS document suggests 8m may need hospital treatment</h2> <p>The coronavirus epidemic in the UK could last until next spring and could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised\">lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised</a>, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> officials revealed.</p> <p>The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS.</p> <p>It also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time.</p> <h2>Passengers on London tube down by a fifth</h2> <p>The numbers of passengers travelling on London\u2019s tube network <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f5b938f085e564ad84e12#block-5e6f5b938f085e564ad84e12\">has fallen by nearly a fifth</a>, while the numbers on buses are down 10%, compared with the same time last year, according to a statement by Transport for London.</p> <p>Significantly, commuters travelling on the tube, which is more expensive and connects the city centre to the suburbs, tend to be drawn from higher socio-economic groups, who tend to work white-collar jobs and are more able to work from home.</p> <p>The figures suggest that more well-off Londoners are more likely to be staying at home to avoid the coronavirus outbreak, while those in less well-paid jobs are still travelling to work every day.</p> <p>TfL estimates that it will take a hit of up to \u00a3500m to its revenue as a result of the fall in passenger numbers, which comes as tube and bus revenues were already about 2% lower than the previous year.</p> <h2><strong>Spanish government requisitions private healthcare sector</strong></h2> <p>Faced with an overstretched healthcare system and a coronavirus epidemic that is spreading at one of the fastest rates in the world, the Spanish government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f65758f085c6327bc0aa3#block-5e6f65758f085c6327bc0aa3\">has announced sweeping measures </a>that allow it to take over private health care providers and requisition materials such as masks and Covid-19 tests.</p> <p>Private health care providers are now at the disposition of public health authorities, health minister Salvador Illa said on Sunday evening. As well, any company that has supplies of protective gear that could help the country fight the virus \u2013 or any company capable of manufacturing these materials \u2013 have been given 48 hours to report to health authorities or otherwise face fines.</p> <h2>Singapore criticises UK coronavirus strategy</h2> <p>Adding to a growing chorus of international criticism, Singapore\u2019s national development minister Lawrence Wong sharply criticised the UK approach to tackling the coronavirus outbreak as he announced new border control measures to apply to the UK, Switzerland and Japan.</p> <p>Wong said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are watching America closely, yes you are right that the numbers are rising there as well. But if you look at the countries that we have highlighted, one concern we have in UK, in Switzerland, in Japan, it\u2019s not just about the numbers that they have reported.</p> <p>In the case of the UK it is rising very rapidly but it\u2019s not just about the numbers but the fact that these countries have abandoned any attempt at containing the spread of the virus. They have said so publicly, especially the UK and Switzerland, perhaps less so for Japan; but certainly in the case of the UK and Switzerland. I think the UK has been most public in acknowledging that there\u2019s no point containing and they are simply now at the phase of trying to delay the spread.</p> <p>So if there is no deliberate effort to contain then we anticipate that the numbers of infected cases in these countries will rise even more sharply in the coming days or weeks, and that\u2019s why we are quite concerned.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Macron to address France amid martial law rumours</h2> <p>Emmanuel Macron will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news?page=with:block-5e6f56e58f085c6327bc0a20#block-5e6f56e58f085c6327bc0a20\">address an anxious France</a> on Monday night about the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports.</p> <p>According to the agency, Macron is to hold a meeting with his prime minister, top military adviser, intelligence coordinator and ministers of health, the interior and foreign affairs on the escalating health crisis, before giving a televised address at 8pm (7pm GMT).</p> <p>France has been gripped by rumours that the government is about to issue a decree stopping people from circulating and using the military to enforce it, that spread on social media on Sunday.</p>",

Another had sold an 18-pack of Andrex for \u00a38.50 \u2013 more than triple the retail price of \u00a32.50.</p> \n<p>During the widespread panic buying of toilet paper and other tissue products it is unlikely that consumers are considering the consequences of using alternative products for tasks they were not designed for, says Wilding.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s largest water and wastewater service, Thames Water, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thameswater/status/1239168011489214465?s=20\">is already warning</a> customers not to \u201cfeed\u201d so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/dec/20/fighting-fatbergs-this-is-now-a-huge-environmental-issue\">fatbergs</a> \u2013 formed from a build-up of fat and non-biodegradable matter \u2013 by using kitchen towel and wet wipes as a substitute for toilet paper and flushing them down the loo. It says the only things that should be flushed are the 3Ps: poo, pee and (toilet) paper.</p> \n<p>Wilding, a professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield School of Management, said: \u201cWe are seeing shortages of toilet paper but worryingly also shortages of paper kitchen towels and industrial paper towel used, for example, in garages and workshops and other wipe products.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf kitchen towels, baby wipes or industrial papers are used as a replacement for toilet paper, our sewage systems could readily become blocked with the resulting chaos and increased health risks associated with this.

This means builders, tilers and plasterers or other workers who regularly use masks for protection against airborne particulate matter, for instance, are struggling to get hold of this equipment from certain suppliers.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was with no small degree of scepticism that I recently journeyed to the lodgings of a Viktor Wynd Esquire in the East End of London. It had been relayed to my editor, on what I deemed to be dubious authority, that Wynd was the keeper of rare and exotic beasts, and that his basement dwellings contained examples not just of two-headed lambs and mummified fairies but also of erotica so unseemly it could redden the eyes of anyone who glanced upon it. It had furthermore been rumoured, in less salubrious quarters, that Wynd was a purveyor of hallucinatory liquors in his upstairs bar \u2013 and would dispense them to paying punters alongside small packets of miniature anuses sculpted from Belgian chocolate.</p> <p>This Wynd character, it seemed likely to me, would prove to be nothing more than a charlatan \u2013 if indeed he existed at all. But after relaying such doubts to my editor, I was displeased to find him still keen on ushering me out the door on a blustery March morning to investigate further.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c77e8ba6eb4d85ffb3c7bc7d5575580cdcccd381\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c77e8ba6eb4d85ffb3c7bc7d5575580cdcccd381/1479_868_3125_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Wynd\u2019s establishment in Hackney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lair \u2026 Mr Wynd\u2019s establishment in Hackney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I perchanced upon The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; UnNatural History before the clock struck 11, with instructions to knock twice and attend its opening. Wynd was in, as fortune would have it, and I must report he is indeed a most curious gentleman. He greeted me in a suit of pink velvet and was possessed of both a fine beard and a mischievous glint in his eye. After making pleasantries, I requested a visit to the water closet, which I confess to having found rather disturbing on account of a bronze sculpture of Wynd\u2019s bottom on the outer door \u2013 for no other purpose than to fondle, it seemed to me \u2013 and a photograph purporting to depict his own suicide, positioned next to the cistern.</p> <p>Feeling somewhat unsettled by this, I then descended with Wynd to his basement, whereby I was forced to admit that his home was, indeed, most unlike any other I have come across. A half-monkey half-fish hung in wait atop the stairs, suspended from the ceiling, its mouth preserved in some kind of blood-curdling scream. At the bottom of the staircase lay the legbone of, Wynd attested, a giant. \u201cOur rational friends would have us believe it\u2019s from a mammoth,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut a giant is more fun.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Ah yes,' he says at what looks like a rotting corpse.

It was a most peculiar assortment: feathers from extinct birds, shrunken human heads, the golden-plated skull of one of drug lord <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/06/life1.lifemagazine2\">Pablo Escobar</a>\u2019s hippopotamuses, artworks by the great English surrealists, a lock of Elvis Presley\u2019s hair, a syringe found in the very room where artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/18/sebastian-horsley-obituary\">Sebastian Horsley</a> died, the skull of a cyclops, portraits of fellating nuns, radioactive seashells, condoms made specifically for the less well-endowed, and jars containing the \u201cpreserved front bottoms of Victorian prostitutes\u201d, or so the labels read.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this,\u201d spoke a voice from within the gloom, \u201cis a horse\u2019s stomach that\u2019s been infected with botflies!\u201d This startled me somewhat, because I had not noticed Wynd\u2019s return. \u201cThey lay their eggs around the horse\u2019s mouth and then, when it licks them, the eggs go in, the larva hatches, attaches itself to the horse\u2019s stomach and pupates.\u201d He paused and intoned: \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201d</p> <p>I studied Wynd\u2019s expression closely in the murky light. For surely a man of twisted means <em>could</em> make this stuff up, and indeed would \u2013 were it to prove successful in providing even modest financial remuneration. I glanced up and noticed a jar resting on a shelf, with its label claiming it contained the faecal matter of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\">Ms A Winehouse</a>. The specimen, Wynd claimed, aroused the attention of the Human Tissue Authority, who recently paid a visit. This suggestion struck me as preposterous, and my suspicions around Wynd redoubled.</p> <p>We retired to a bench at Wynd\u2019s sarcophagus, the top of which boasted a glass panel through which to view the human remains within. Next to Wynd sat a taxidermied goat \u2013 a self-portrait, he said, while stroking its face. I sipped my drink and listened to his divulgences, the details of which I reproduce faithfully for you now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6f49b8693879cdda6cca20e4baf69f65c7ea7e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6f49b8693879cdda6cca20e4baf69f65c7ea7e6/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curiosities \u2026 a cabinet of birds, beasts and wonders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curiosities \u2026 a cabinet of birds, beasts and wonders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wynd told me how he\u2019d started collecting as a boy, but that upon reaching manhood, when his peers found their interests diverted elsewhere, he had simply kept going. \u201cI grew orchids and carnivorous plants, I kept reptiles. And I still do those things.\u201d</p> <p>His curiosities are the spoil of Wynd\u2019s countless voyages around the globe \u2013 to the Congo or along the Sepik river in Papua New Guinea, where Wynd was enthused to find they still discuss spirits and fairies. \u201cNot a conversation you can have seriously here, even though right up until 70 years ago it would not have been regarded as unusual.\u201d Wynd also told me about his own travel agency, Gone With the Wynd, which he set up so that others could accompany him. But he was adamant that travel was not essential for building a collection: \u201cI could find an amazing broken children\u2019s toy just by looking in the gutter.\u201d</p> <p>How did he know how much to offer for such unusual items? \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve got in my bank account that day,\u201d he ventured. \u201cIf I can afford it and I want it, then I tend to buy it.\u201d He furrowed his brow. \u201cI was just the other day offered a mummified arm, but I hadn\u2019t \u20ac2,000 on me.\u201d Could he not have haggled? \u201cI\u2019m not interested in haggling. And it\u2019s not the end of the world if I can\u2019t get one specific thing. I see the museum more as a three-dimensional fictional novel \u2013 a sculpture of the inside of my brain.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Ah yes,\u2019 he says at what looks like a rotting corpse. \u2018The\u00a0Paul Robeson\u00a0and Pamela Anderson Unification Cake\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before opening his museum, Wynd told me he had been a disillusioned artist: \u201cI got bored. The great triumph was if some boring rich person came in and bought something. I gained no pleasure from that.\u201d</p> <p>Instead he turned his attention to throwing debauched parties throughout the 00s: \u201cMy life at that time was as hedonistic as I could make it and still be alive to tell the story,\u201d he sighed. Wynd recalled for me the occasion he transformed one venue into a recreation of the Onion Cellar from G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s The Tin Drum \u2013 filling it with dead flowers while fining anybody caught smiling the sum of one pound. \u201cI made chopping boards in the shape of teardrops so guests could chop onions and cry. I suppose it was a commentary on the reason why people drink and take drugs until 6am. A lot of it is to do with escaping the black dog you live with.\u201d</p> <p>After 10 years, Wynd\u2019s parties started to blur into one. So he turned his attentions to his childhood passion: collecting. At first the building was known as Viktor Wynd\u2019s Little Shop of Horrors, the business side of his endeavour leaving him at near-permanent risk of financial collapse. Now it exists as a museum (\u00a36 entrance) and absinthe bar, which allows Wynd the freedom to turn himself to other projects. One of these is a new book, <a href=\"https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/The-Unnatural-History-Museum/Viktor-Wynd/Prestel-com/e549616.rhd\">The Un</a><a href=\"https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/The-Unnatural-History-Museum/Viktor-Wynd/Prestel-com/e549616.rhd\">Natural History Museum</a>, a tome that has been written with admirable wit and whimsy. </p> <p>In it, Wynd delightfully recounts the stories around the items he has amassed: a wooden carving believed to tell the story of a New Guinean village in which the women spurned the men as lovers for dogs; a tongue-eating louse (\u201cthe most disgusting thing in my collection\u201d); even a curious crinkled stone that turns out to be a baked potato Wynd once left in his Aga (\u201cI found it rather attractive so I kept it\u201d).</p> <p>Indeed, it was while lost in these pages that my perception of Wynd began to change. I had assumed him to be a shallow fellow, but the book reveals instead a tortured soul, drawn to solitude and prone to melancholy. Indeed, I am still haunted by something Wynd opined: \u201cBeing alive is a terribly sad and miserable experience. There are little chinks of happiness and joy that light up an otherwise dark world. But we are all miserable, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1158f15b89c5db406e46707bc57426bd011970c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1158f15b89c5db406e46707bc57426bd011970c4/1487_0_6928_3211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Falmouth, scene of Wynd\u2019s next endeavour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"463\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beware \u2026 Falmouth, scene of Wynd\u2019s next endeavour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Abbitt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The degree of Wynd\u2019s sadness is difficult to discern.

This one was found in a family Bible!\u201d</p> <p>It was while discussing such oddities that Wynd seemed at his most animated. \u201cYou must come to Falmouth!\u201d he declared. \u201cBut I won\u2019t be there.

Was this tiny basement, I asked myself, where the world\u2019s true magic and wonder resided? But just as I was beginning to fall under my host\u2019s charming spell, my attention was seized by an item of such alarming grotesquery that I tremble even now to recount it in full. For lying beneath a glass display cabinet of bones, toy dolls and sordid literature was a full length, semi-rotting human figure. I leaned towards it cautiously, only to jump back with fright. The left half was unmistakably that of the bass baritone and political activist Mr Paul Robeson.

Although we weren\u2019t. We didn\u2019t want to look silly.\u201d</p> <p>Wynd laughed and, trapped in the darkness, I felt suddenly gripped by a stomach-churning sensation. Whether it was the liquorice brew I\u2019d imbibed or something more sinister, I could not say. But I knew I must leave while I still could.</p> <p>I made my excuses and turned towards the staircase, only to hear Wynd call after me, distraught.

  "<p>In times of national crisis, governments need to act, advise and inform. But they also need to tell stories that allow us, as citizens, to understand government policy and, crucially, to coordinate our individual efforts towards a common goal.</p> <p>The story isn\u2019t just \u201cspin\u201d; it is a central component of policy. And whether it receives our support will be critical to determining whether, and how well, the policy is implemented, and whether it succeeds or fails. Winston Churchill\u2019s \u201cWe shall fight on the beaches\u201d speech in 1940 during the Battle of France perfectly encapsulated a clear narrative of collective resistance at a time of national peril. What should the story be now?</p> <p>Two very different approaches are being deployed by governments across the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news\">Covid-19</a> is either a fire than must be beaten back, or even completely extinguished; or a rising tide against which resistance is futile and managed retreat is the only option.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most honest and credible narrative would be that the government doesn\u2019t, and can\u2019t, yet know the best course of action</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fire narrative is implicit in the lockdown policies already in place in many affected countries, such as China, South Korea, Italy and Spain. The more a fire takes hold, the harder it is to fight, meaning fast, aggressive action is vital. Continual vigilance is required: each new flame must be extinguished. Crucially, putting out the fire takes precedence over everything else, lest the fire burns unchecked. Collective and individual sacrifice isn\u2019t merely justified \u2013 it\u2019s an overwhelming necessity.</p> <p>The tide narrative, implicit in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">the UK\u2019s current plans</a>, is very different: the progress of the virus is seen as an unstoppable wave that will overwhelm temporary defences. In this metaphor, the endpoint is clear: most people (perhaps 60% to 80%) will be infected by the virus, until the point of \u201cherd immunity\u201d is reached, when new infections peter out. The only question then will be how best to manage this process: for example, trying to slow, and evenly spread, the flow of new cases over the summer months when the health system is under less strain; and trying to ensure that the elderly and vulnerable are isolated while the infection rages through the population.</p> <p>Policymakers should be asking three questions: which narrative is right?; which narratives are politically sustainable?; and in the light of uncertainties over the first two questions, what is the best course of action?</p> <p>The first question is an ongoing debate among epidemiologists and public health experts, and outside my expertise as a behavioural scientist. China and South Korea seem to have dampened the \u201cfire\u201d with astonishing success. We don\u2019t yet know how European countries will fare. And we don\u2019t yet know whether coronavirus will surge again as restrictions are loosened, although the signs in China at present seem encouraging.</p> <p>The UK government has made much of the danger of \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d: that people will not be able to maintain new patterns of vigilant behaviour for very long. If this is a primary reason for assuming the virus cannot be stopped, it seems a very unconvincing one (as a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/covidopenletter/home\">recent </a><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/covidopenletter/home\">open </a><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/covidopenletter/home\">letter</a> to the UK government, of which I was a signatory, points out). But behavioural fatigue, to my knowledge, has no basis in science. Indeed, with a compelling collective narrative, people are capable of maintaining remarkable solidarity over months and years, especially at times of national crisis.</p> <p>The second question about which narratives are politically sustainable depends on how far the narrative can build a new, shared, \u201csocial contract\u201d that citizens will be willing to back. Politically speaking, the fire narrative is far easier to sign up to. Most of us can support a heroic vision of collectively battling an epidemic (or at least tamping it down until help arrives in the form of a vaccine or a cure).</p> <p>The tide narrative is a harder sell: it requires society accepting that a huge burden of illness and death is inevitable; and, for that matter, the personal realisation that we will likely get sick. More crucially, perhaps, such fatalism will be very difficult to sustain while other nations are seen taking aggressive countermeasures. As soon as UK mortality statistics start to outrun those of other countries, the public pressure to shift strategy will be acute.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news\">Coronavirus updates: death toll passes 6,500 as global infections outstrip China cases - live news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what should the government do? Here, I think policymakers should allow for the possibility that scientists don\u2019t yet know which narrative is right: whether covid-19 can be stopped, as the fire narrative suggests, or whether it\u2019s an unassailable tide. The virus is new, and its behaviour is relatively unknown. But a huge global scientific and medical effort is under way to understand the genetics, mutation and transmission of the virus, to model its spread, to learn from the experience of other countries, and to explore the viability of vaccines or cures.</p> <p>The government\u2019s bet that the virus is unstoppable \u2013 and its decision to allow it to spread through the population over the summer \u2013 is a move that, if misjudged, could lead to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths.</p> <p>A basic principle of good decision-making under extreme uncertainty is to make choices that are robust to whichever narrative turns out to be right. Right now, surely policymakers need to buy time; and that means slowing the spread as much as possible, while we learn more.</p> <p>The most honest and credible narrative is surely to admit our ignorance: that the government doesn\u2019t, and can\u2019t, know yet what is best. In the meantime, we should hold back the virus with every resource we have, until the science around it is clearer. I would like to believe that, as a nation of pragmatists, this is a story we can all get behind.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nick Chater is professor of behavioural science at Warwick Business School.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Firstly, many eyes across European football were rolled as the Italian football authorities struggled to make coherent decisions in a post-coronavirus world. Now, everybody is getting into the same boat. The Bundesliga, so in tune with the value of factoring in fans and of outside engagement to the product, is discovering what a scramble it is to find clarity and a united front in the eye of the storm.</p> <p>\u201cNow there is a point,\u201d wrote Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s sporting director Fredi Bobic in a guest column in Kicker, \u201cwhere we have to assume responsibility in management positions without precise facts and make decisions that concern the health of all of our employees, and indeed everyone involved in football. The worst part is a decision made out of clear conviction in the morning is already useless by the afternoon.\u201d <br><br>Bobic himself went through that last week, with his club\u2019s pledge on Wednesday that the following day\u2019s Europa League tie with Basel would be played to an expected full house, before making a U-turn later the same day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/mason-mount-warned-by-chelsea-after-breaking-coronavirus-self-isolation\">Mason Mount warned by Chelsea after breaking coronavirus self-isolation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like most European leagues, the Bundesliga has been reacting on the fly to the coronavirus crisis, for there is simply no other option. In the middle of last week there was no nationally unified approach across German football. On Tuesday, last Saturday\u2019s scheduled Revierderby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke had already been arranged to be played behind closed doors (no small decision given the dimensions of the occasion and a potential \u20ac5m loss of matchday revenue), Union Berlin released a statement that said after consultation with Berlin\u2019s municipal authorities, their game against Bayern Munich would go ahead with fans present.</p> <p>By Wednesday that advice had evolved, forcing Union to change tack and <a href=\"https://www.fc-union-berlin.de/en/union-live/latest-news/professional/Bayern-clash-behind-closed-doors-442A/\">announce the game would be behind closed doors</a>. Later in the same day was a historical first for the Bundesliga, with its first-ever game behind closed doors (Geisterspielen, ghost games, as they\u2019re referred to) - a Rhine derby between Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and K\u00f6ln.</p> <p>As Gladbach squeezed to a 2-1 win there were all the appropriate pantomimes. Breel Embolo celebrated his opening goal by mock-cupping his ears. At full-time, having been stymied in their chase for an equaliser, Mark Uth dropped to his haunches and Jorge Mer\u00e9 pulled his shirt over his face in frustration. None of it felt right. Rather than explain contested decisions, referee Deniz Aytekin lamented an evening that was anything but an occasion to the Sky cameras. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething is missing, and it\u2019s [a] massive [loss]. The passion isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s tough to concentrate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Thiago6/status/1238420665683841024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is crazy.

With a group of Gladbach ultras estimated in excess of 2,000 turning up outside Borussia-Park, despite the stadium being out of town, and demanding to celebrate with their players at full-time, it was starting to become clear that limiting public gatherings would require games to be postponed, rather than to be just played without fans, in scenes reflective of those in the Champions League at Valencia and Paris.</p> <p>Further upstairs, it seemed to be taking a little longer for the message to get through. As late as Friday afternoon, the Deutsche Fu\u00dfball Liga\u2019s official plan was to play all of Matchday 26 \u2013 up to and including Monday night\u2019s match between Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen - behind closed doors before starting a hiatus afterwards. This was despite the unease of many of the main protagonists, including Bayern\u2019s Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara, who had made clear his exasperation in a mid-morning tweet. \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d wrote the midfielder. \u201cPlease stop fooling around and land on reality.\u201d</p> <p>As in other territories, the big decisions were essentially taken out of the hands of the authorities. Paderborn coach Steffen Baumgart started showing symptoms of possible infection ahead of his team\u2019s Friday night game at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, while local authorities in Bremen had become deeply concerned about the possibility of fans gathering outside the Weserstadion \u2013 \u00e0 la Gladbach, but possibly in even greater numbers \u2013 for Werder\u2019s game with Leverkusen.</p> <p>Certainly Karl-Heinz Rummenigge\u2019s declarations in the Bayern press conference to preview the Union game, alongside Hansi Flick, didn\u2019t age well either. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about finances and the big outstanding TV payments to the clubs,\u201d he had said. \u201cI think it\u2019s right that, under the current conditions, this weekend\u2019s games take place.\u201d Equally Dortmund\u2019s Hans-Joachim Watzke upset some by admitting on Sunday\u2019s Sportschau that he would have been in favour of the games going ahead to limit losses.</p> <p>Yet when Uli Hoeness, who described football\u2019s scheduling dilemmas as \u201cthe smallest problem, when doctors in Italy have to make decisions about life and death because they cannot assign a ventilator to every patient,\u201d is the voice of calm and compassion, you know these are unusual times. Bobic wrote in his Kicker column about a series of complex, \u201csometimes very contradictory discussions\u201d in the lead-up to the plug eventually being pulled, with the usual diverse points of view and priorities coming up against a series of unprecedented immovables.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/15/ezequiel-garay-among-five-involved-with-valencia-positive-for-coronavirus\">Ezequiel Garay among five Valencia staff found to be positive for coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As various ways forward were floated, including the possibility of a 22-team top-flight with four promoted teams and no relegation, the constant was finding a way of softening the forthcoming financial blows. It may be considered beyond vulgar given the global situation, but the administrators of the game have to deal with financial reality, and making sure there is a game (and clubs) to come back to. The last instalment of the season\u2019s TV rights money \u2013 some \u20ac304 million - is due to the clubs of the country\u2019s top divisions in May. Delay or withholding the payment of the \u20ac34 million due to Bayern, for example, would undoubtedly sting. The failure of clubs at the other end of the spectrum, like Sandhausen or Aue, to bank their dues of just over \u20ac2 million could have even more serious effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9735fc189412037c0971b30d4f14fa3694f96127\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9735fc189412037c0971b30d4f14fa3694f96127/0_277_3393_2036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans hold up pictures of Dietmar Hopp, Fritz Keller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge with red clown\u2019s noses, venting their anger with the German soccer federation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans hold up pictures of Dietmar Hopp, Fritz Keller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge with red clown\u2019s noses, venting their anger with the German soccer federation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernd Thissen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the forthcoming days and weeks sides, attitudes and preconceptions must flex.

The anger of those supporters towards Hopp has always been entirely separate from the other facets of his business life \u2013 nobody has denied his extensive philanthropy and work for cancer patients \u2013 but this latest development does underline his status as one of the most complex characters in the German game.</p> <p>As for the ultras, many groups have called for unity and, in some cases, put their campaigning skills to great use by fundraising for Italian emergency workers (see tweet below). Yet they too already have their view on the possible way forward. The cross-club fan alliance Unsere Kurve released a statement on Monday in opposition to further Geisterspielen. \u201cIt must not be that public life is shut down, but professional football continues to try to maintain a pseudo-reality by all means necessary,\u201d it said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ftamsut/status/1239489185104433153\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">VfB Stuttgart ultra group Commando Cannstatt are raising donations for an Italian hospital.<br><br>Another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/VfB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#VfB</a> group, Schwabensturm, say most of their members are not part of any <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> risk group and offer their help.<br><br>The levels of solidarity in Germany&#39;s ultra scene.

Draped in a black floral-print sari, Mishti is a boat driver \u2013 a rare trade for a woman in Bangladesh.</p> <p>Every morning before the sun rises over Barishal, Mishti unmoors her small wooden boat from the banks of the Kirtankhola River and sets off to catch the early commuters. \u201cMy father taught me everything there is to know about working a boat,\u201d she says. \u201cI was steering by the age of nine.\u201d Growing up on a boat means that living and making a living on the river comes naturally to Mishti.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"bf160a8e00f3ea9783c2f46b7f95b834309310f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf160a8e00f3ea9783c2f46b7f95b834309310f4/0_371_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mishti ferries passengers on her boat.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mishti ferries passengers on her boat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"2e7a255326644512ad2c4533491b2d2c803e4aeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e7a255326644512ad2c4533491b2d2c803e4aeb/0_408_3800_4750/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mishti.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mishti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ba71790788f4246ae9acf150b309240acc19a78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba71790788f4246ae9acf150b309240acc19a78/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boat work earns Mishti approximately 200-300 taka (\u00a32) a day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boat work earns Mishti approximately 200-300 taka (\u00a32) a day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI remember falling into the water and my father had to jump in to save me,\u201d she laughs, her grey eyes glistening as she speaks. \u201cIt was difficult to learn at that age, but I enjoyed it.\u201d Looking after four children on her own, Mishti\u2019s whole life has been affected by extreme weather.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-women-of-barishal/2020/feb/28/its-perfectly-possible-to-make-it-on-your-own-how-women-are-building-for-the-future-in-bangladesh\">\u2018It\u2019s perfectly possible to make it on your own\u2019: how women are building for the future in Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In November 2007, her boat \u2013 and only source of income \u2013 was destroyed by the devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/21/bangladesh-natural-disasters\">Cyclone Sidr</a>, which struck the south-west coast of Bangladesh, with menacing winds of almost 150mph. It is estimated the death toll was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/nov/19/bangladesh.internationalnews\">15,000</a> across affected areas of Bangladesh and neighbouring India.</p> <p>The cyclone was so fierce it sank Mishti\u2019s boat while she and her small children huddled together onboard. They all toppled into the water and swam desperately for their lives. \u201cNothing was saved \u2013 the water took everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI am just grateful to Allah that my children and I made it to shore safely.\u201d</p> <p>A few months later, Mishti pieced together a makeshift home from iron sheeting and other scrap metal \u2013 not far from the same river that swallowed her boat. She took out a microloan from a local NGO to help build the shelter but struggled to pay back the high interest rates. Every week, a collector came around to collect Mishti\u2019s dues, and there were days when she would go without any food.</p> <p>Her home was broken down by winds and floods in 2010, prompting Mishti to move with her children and what little belongings they had, before she received an eviction notice informing her that she had illegally erected the structure. They were on the move once again, barely surviving and renting a boat on and off. But after receiving a cash grant from the <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Cross</a>, Mishti was able to buy a new boat, enabling a stable income for her family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c3687c676e37565ac8e409ef8b990842ad2872b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3687c676e37565ac8e409ef8b990842ad2872b7/0_364_5468_3281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The river has always been my home,\u2019 says Mishti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The river has always been my home,\u2019 says Mishti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, remnants of her old house remain on the riverbank; a lasting reminder of a place she temporarily called home. This has left Mishti longing for a real home and she is now saving the money from her income to buy land, so she can build a proper house for her children. \u201cThe river has always been my home, but it felt secure to have a roof over our head,\u201d says Mishti. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t much but, for the first time, I wasn\u2019t living in a boat and there was land beneath my feet.\u201d</p> <p>Every day, Mishti ferries roughly 160 commuters from one side of the river to the other, including students, workers and small families. She makes approximately 200-300 taka (\u00a32) a day and, each week, Mishti saves a little of her income. \u201cI have a bank account now and I\u2019m saving money in case of an emergency,\u201d she says. Without the money she earns, Mishti wouldn\u2019t be able to feed her family, pay the rent for her home or fund her children\u2019s education.</p> <p>But despite working every day from 7am to 5pm \u2013 with little to no breaks \u2013 Mishti still earns less than her male counterparts. She also misses out on further earning potential as she is unable to work night shifts like the men, due to the threat of sexual harassment.</p> <p>Squabbles with other boat drivers are common. \u201cWe all have our own stretch, but the river doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. So, you need to get there first to claim your spot,\u201d she says firmly. Though, there have been recent efforts on the river to put a process into place. \u201cWhen it\u2019s busy, we form a queue and take it in turns to carry customers across. Not everyone follows the rules, though, so you need to edge your boat forward.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8a079480962711ee75c8dd58aad939d7eb57c36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8a079480962711ee75c8dd58aad939d7eb57c36/0_309_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mishti with her daughters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mishti with her daughters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzana Hossen/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Climate change continues to affect Mishti, with weather patterns becoming more erratic and less predictable than before. \u201cTidal surges can make paddling more difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cThe waves are strong, and you need a lot of strength to overcome them.\u201d</p> <p>Though some people in her community think boat work should only be done by men, Mishti doesn\u2019t let that discourage her. \u201cI work to survive. I don\u2019t listen to what anyone has to say,\u201d she states matter-of-factly. Mishti is one of just five women out of a total of 40 boat drivers in Rasulpur; she says there are more women who know how to operate a vessel but can\u2019t afford boats. \u201cIt feels good to have my own boat,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about renting one or returning it by a certain time. Right now, I decide when I work.\u201d</p> <p>With firsthand experience of working in a male-dominated environment, Mishti is determined to give her children the best chances at life. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to be able to send all my daughters to school,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son works as a tuk-tuk driver to support me, but I don\u2019t want my girls to miss out. Having an education will help them succeed in the future.\u201d</p> <p><em>As we enter unprecedented times, building resilience in vulnerable communities is needed now more than ever.

  "<p>Cinema attendance in the US and around the world slumped dramatically last weekend, as the effects of the coronavirus outbreak began to bite.</p> <p>In North America, box-office revenue dropped to its lowest level in two decades as audiences began to stay away. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/box-office/box-office-coronavirus-moviegoing-north-america-1203534698/\">Variety reported</a> that the total amount for Friday to Sunday in the US and Canada was about $55.3m, the worst result since September 2000, and a 45% drop from the weekend before. The top-performing film, Pixar\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/06/onward-review-pixar-conjures-big-screen-adventure-with-wizard-quest-story\">Onward</a>, recorded a fall of 73.1% for a total of $10.53m.

Cinemas were closed in France and Spain, joining China and Italy, and the UK and Ireland have <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/03/showcase-cinemas-reduces-auditorium-capacities-50-u-s-uk-sites-combat-coronavirus-1202883296/\">limited capacities</a> and implemented social distancing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/cinemas-and-pubs-in-uk-remain-open-amid-coronavirus-concerns\">such as seat gaps</a>. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/03/bloodshot-onward-coronavirus-17-billion-more-impact-global-intternational-box-office-1202883682/\">Deadline reported</a> that the top five films recorded $30.7m in non-US territories, around 85% less than the same weekend two years ago. The Vin Diesel comic book action movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/11/bloodshot-review-vin-diesel\">Bloodshot</a> emerged top, taking $15.1m to add to its US first-week total of $10.5m.

Like the US, Onward was the top-grossing film, but its takings of \u00a31.3m was 50% down on last week\u2019s. Misbehaviour the Miss World protest comedy drama, recorded \u00a3330,000 on its opening session.</p> <p>Future prospects look even worse, as restrictions increase. The mayors of New York and Lost Angeles, Bill de Blasio and Eric Garcetti, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/coronavirus-movie-theaters-new-york-close-1203532292/\">have both ordered cinemas to close</a> as part of wider-ranging efforts to safeguard public health.

It involves the <strong>central bank buying up government bonds </strong>and other financial assets from banks and pensions funds, thereby <strong>flooding the system with liquidity</strong>. The hope is that the financial institutions will use the extra funds to increase lending to households and businesses.<br></p> \n  <p>It\u2019s often referred to as a \u201cmoney printing scheme\u201d because although the money used to buy the bonds is electronic and not printed notes, those funds are nevertheless simply created by the central bank at the push of a button.</p> \n  <p>We don\u2019t know yet how much the RBA scheme will be worth but it will run into billions of dollars. When the Bank of England started the scheme in the GFC, it racked up \u00a3375bn (A$750bn) over three years before it stopped in late 2012. The US Fed reached US$4.5tn in its first five years. Japan\u2019s total is also in the trillions.</p> \n  <p><strong>So what does it mean and how has this come about?</strong></p> \n  <p>This is an extraordinary, radical measure used by central banks in the US, UK, Europe and Japan in the past decade to prop up the financial system in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p> \n  <p>Back then, the mechanics of the system seized up as billions of dollars worth of financial instruments were exposed as worthless and bank after bank collapsed. Central banks cut interest rates to flood the system with cheap money but when that failed to stem the crisis, notably when the mighty investment bank Lehman Brothers crashed, they got together and launched QE.<br></p> \n  <p>It was considered an emergency measure but despite attempts to wind back the scheme, especially by the US Fed, the schemes have underpinned western economies ever since. The massive amount of cheap money unleashed by the schemes has inflated asset bubbles all over the world, with stock markets reaching all-time highs as recently as February. Attempts to deflate the bubbles met with panic in the financial markets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/01/the-liquidity-timebomb-fiscal-policies-have-created-a-dangerous-paradox\">notably the Fed taper tantrum fiasco.</a></p> \n  <p>This time around it\u2019s a different problem because the economy itself is seizing up as normal daily activity grinds to a halt across the world. But the response of central banks is the same because all of them \u2013 including the RBA \u2013 have already cut rates as far as they can in recent years and have no alternative except to unleash QE and hope that it reassures investors that they will prop up the system \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/what-is-quantitative-easing\">What is quantitative easing?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T02:12:58.302Z\">at 2.12am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6eda468f085e564ad84b48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T01:50:39.168Z\">1.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>National Gallery of Australia, in Canberra, will suspend tours</strong>, school visits, events and talks \u2013 but will remain open. </p> \n  <p>In an email to members, the gallery said that the suspension would last at least four weeks. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T01:53:25.583Z\">at 1.53am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ed97f8f085e564ad84b3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T01:43:21.376Z\">1.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bluesfest</strong>, a NSW music festival due to host Patti Smith, Crowded House and Dave Matthews Band,<strong> has been cancelled today</strong>.

  "<p>I had the strangest sensation this week.</p> <p>A creeping, prickling, lurching fear. Sitting at my desk, I had logged into our imaging system and opened the scan of the patient I\u2019d been asked to review. He had come in with fever and a cough and \u2013 crucially \u2013 no recent travel or contact with anyone unwell. The characteristic pattern of speckled whiteness, akin to powdered glass, was sprinkled around the outer part of both his lungs. For the first time I could no longer pretend that the disease I had read so much about was in China, or Iran, or Italy. It was here, and spreading. In my city. In my hospital. On my screen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The usual petty grumbles and disagreements have been put aside, hopefully for good. We will need each other in these times to come</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We have been planning intensively for a month or so, hoping against hope that it would all be a waste of time. At our daily meetings, my colleague from A&amp;E would inform us about plans to split up the department to isolate suspected cases. The lead for our intensive care unit talked about reallocating anaesthetists from planned surgery and scavenging ventilators to expand their capacity to care for the very sickest. We physicians made plans for designated wards to cohort patients and examined the detail of how to take them to intensive care or the CT scanner without contaminating other areas. Fittings of protective masks took place and colleagues shaved off their beards in preparation. We checked that the hospital\u2019s oxygen supply would not be exhausted if a surge in cases arrived.</p> <p>What has blindsided us is the speed at which the hypothetical became the real and then the rapidly obsolete. A few days ago, we implemented our cohort ward plan; the capacity was exceeded the same afternoon as the government expanded testing criteria. Halfway through our mask-fitting programme we have run out of the type of mask that was most commonly being fitted, rendering two weeks of intensive training useless. A steady stream of cases continues and we have already had to change our approach from planning ahead to simply reacting to changing pressures, isolating patients wherever we can and struggling to stay ahead. We are fortunate to have strong leadership within our hospital but sometimes there is little we can do in a system already so brutally overloaded.</p> <p>The knock-on effects of this are unimaginable. We are cancelling operations and outpatient appointments, but how will we ever pick up this work again? There is already a seven-month wait for a simple follow-up appointment in my clinic. Medical education has been put on hold and our students have been withdrawn from their placements. Their exams may be cancelled; will they be able to graduate this summer? How will we staff the wards from August? All of our plans for developing our services, improving the hospital, making things better for our patients, have had to cease.</p> <p>Our NHS will be affected for years to come, probably for ever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news\">Coronavirus updates: global infections outstrip China cases as US ramps up response - live news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That same creeping sense of dread I felt is consuming the hospital and its staff. People are frightened in a way that I have not seen before. Senior consultants have been in tears. Our junior doctors, desperate for guidance, look to a consultant body that does not have the answers. Friends in other specialties and hospitals contact me for information, wrongly hoping I may know more than they do. We are all worried about our young families, our elderly parents. We will carry this disease home to our loved ones on our clothes and in our own lungs. How can we not be scared? I know I am not the only one plagued by insomnia.</p> <p>This is just the beginning. I have privately estimated our peak caseload and if 60% of our local population does indeed become infected, the number of cases coming through our front door every few days could become greater than the entire bed capacity of our hospital. That hospital is already full and our staff have begun to get sick. A hastily convened ethics panel will try to offer us some guidance on how we ration our limited resources and to whom we will be forced to deny lifesaving treatment. The numbers imply that this will not have to happen in the summer, or in a few weeks, but in a few days. And yet I cling on to the hope that my calculations are wrong, that somehow we will avoid the grim situation we have seen elsewhere, however unlikely this is.</p> <p>But despite all of this we are still here.

  "<p>They cut speed limits, changed street design, removed space for cars and generally made life harder for motorists.</p> <p>Now it appears the work is paying off. Two of Europe\u2019s smaller capital cities \u2013 Oslo and Helsinki \u2013 are reaping the rewards of committed action on making their roads safer, reducing pedestrian fatalities to zero last year.</p> <p>Helsinki recorded no deaths for the first time since records began in 1960, down from an average of 20-30 a year in the 1990s. In Oslo, there were also no pedestrian or cyclist deaths in the city, which has a population of 680,000, and no children under 16 died in traffic crashes in the entire country.</p> <p>In comparison, 57 pedestrians <a href=\"http://content.tfl.gov.uk/casualties-in-greater-london-2018.pdf\">died in London in 2018</a>; 2019 figures have yet to be released.</p> <p>The Nordic achievements beg the question: what did they do to achieve such dramatic improvements?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\" data-alt=\"ad\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/this-is-europe-nugget-zip/giv-3902djciTE7YISlG/\">ad</a> </figure>  <p>Christoffer Solstad Steen from Trygg Trafikk, a road safety organisation in Norway, said: \u201c[Politicians in Oslo] have chosen to make it more difficult to use a car \u2013 it takes more time to drive from one part of the city to another now and you have to pay money to use the road much more than you used to.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017 there was a <a href=\"https://www.newsinenglish.no/2017/10/03/car-wars-iii-as-oslo-strikes-back/\">70% increase in tolls across the city</a>, in plans spearheaded by the Labour and Green parties, which led to a 6% decrease in traffic.</p> <p>Car parking charges <a href=\"https://www.newsinenglish.no/2016/02/15/car-owners-feel-bullied-in-oslo/\">were also increased</a> \u2013 by 50% in downtown Oslo and 20% elsewhere \u2013 although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/13/oslo-ban-cars-backlash-parking\">thousands of spaces have now been wiped out</a> to make room for 35 miles of new cycle lanes.</p> <p>The city has reduced speed to a maximum of 30km/h outside schools and <a href=\"https://www.eltis.org/discover/news/oslo-experiments-car-free-heart-zones-around-schools\">started trialling \u201cheart zones\u201d</a>, where driving is banned in areas around schools. Officials in Oslo hope to create 100 of these zones over the next four years.</p> <p>There has been some opposition to the changes, admits Arild Hermstad, Oslo\u2019s vice mayor for environment and transport \u2013 particularly when it comes to banning cars from certain areas of the city.</p> <p>However, he thinks when people become accustomed to the new set-up, they see the benefits: \u201cWhen it actually starts happening and people see that it\u2019s working, then no one wants to reintroduce the cars into these roads. So I think more and more people are seeing that this is actually good for the city,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to reduce the overall car traffic in Oslo by 30% by 2030. It\u2019s a hard goal, but we think it will be good for the city as well.\u201d</p> <p>Similar traffic reduction tactics have been employed in Helsinki, where speed limits have been tightening for decades and were reduced again last year. Now the speed limit is 30km/h on most residential streets and the city centre, 50km/h on main streets in suburban areas and 40km/h on those in the inner city.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not only a question of speed limits, although I think all our specialists do say that is the most important single thing affecting traffic safety,\u201d said Anni Sinnem\u00e4ki, the deputy mayor of urban environment in Helsinki.</p> <p>\u201cIn the last few years, we have also focused on how we build the street environment. Streets are being better divided between pedestrians, cycle lanes and cars \u2013 the car lane is not the widest possible.\u201d</p> <p>Along with narrower driving lanes, Helsinki has also built dozens of roundabouts and installed speed bumps since the 1990s to reduce speed.</p> <p>The wider picture across Europe shows a sharp difference in road safety. <a href=\"https://etsc.eu/wp-content/uploads/PIN-FLASH-37-FINAL.pdf\">From 2015 to 2017</a>, the average number of road deaths on urban roads per million urban inhabitants was 10.9 in the UK. In Norway it was just 5.3, the lowest in Europe, while in Finland it was 16.9. The countries with the highest rates of urban road deaths were Romania with 105.2, Croatia with 87.9 and Serbia with 73.8.</p> <p>Norway and Finland have implemented <a href=\"https://visionzeronetwork.org/\">Vision Zero</a>, a set of principles and policies aimed at eliminating serious injuries and fatalities involving road traffic. The project shifts responsibility for crashes from road users to the designers of the road system \u2013 if one occurs, it is up to authorities to ensure that it does not happen again.</p> <p>The initiative has been taken up across the world with varying levels of success. Sadiq Khan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/sep/17/vision-zero-has-the-drive-to-eliminate-road-deaths-lost-its-way\">signed London up in 2018</a>, but Norway has been working towards it since the 1990s.</p> <p>The goal hasn\u2019t been achieved yet, however. Although both cities recorded zero pedestrian fatalities in 2019, in Helsinki three drivers died in traffic crashes last year, while in Oslo one driver died. A pedestrian has also been killed in the city this year.</p> <p>In Norway, there has also been a <a href=\"https://www.tryggtrafikk.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Adferdspa%CC%8Avirkningsrapport2017_ENG_nett.pdf\">renewed focus on road safety education</a> in schools and maintaining a tough driving test.</p> <p>Hermstad said: \u201cFor many years, the driver education system has focused a lot on road safety. And also strict regulations and road rules that prioritise safety, maybe more here than in many other countries.\u201d</p> <p>Steen added: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to build yourself out of problems but it is more difficult to get people to understand that this is important and make them act in a more secure way.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that we have managed to achieve that goal, but it\u2019s one of the things we have been focusing on for many years in Norway and probably one of the reasons why things are getting better.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When news of the coronavirus broke at the end of last year, and as the stories from the outbreak became more alarming over time, I found myself wondering how health anxiety sufferers were coping.</p> <p>You see, I used to be one. In late 2015, I suffered a post-traumatic stress disorder relapse which led to debilitating anxiety, much of which was health-related. During that period, I was paralyzed by the thought of becoming ill and dying. I was constantly checking for symptoms and signs of disease online and I was fixated on the health of my loved ones.</p> <p>After treatment, including trauma-focused CBT, I almost completely recovered. But I remember vividly how it felt to be in an all-consuming state of panic. For many months, it ruled my entire existence. Approximately 40 million American adults \u2013 roughly 18% of the population \u2013 have an anxiety disorder, while in the UK there were 8.2 million cases of anxiety in 2013. There are few statistics about health anxiety, but it can affect those who have an existing anxiety disorder or those who have experienced a life event such as bereavement, birth trauma or an accident. In times like these, where a global pandemic is taking up most of the media conversation, it can be even more difficult to stay calm.</p> <p>Here is some advice that may give some comfort to those of you who are struggling.</p> <h2><strong>1) Avoid the (health-related) news</strong></h2> <p>We all want to keep up to date, but when you have health anxiety the need to check and read the latest updates can become compulsive, feeding the anxiety. Try having a news detox, or allocating yourself a time limit for reading or watching news. If you\u2019re really worried about missing something crucial, you can always tell friends and family to contact you in the event of an emergency situation in order to keep you informed.</p> <h2><strong>2) Try not to seek constant reassurance</strong></h2> <p>Seeking reassurance can make you feel calmer for a little while, but in my experience, it is always temporary. Your brain creates a feedback cycle where you become increasingly reliant on reassurance, which only serves to reinforce the anxiety. It\u2019s natural to want your loved ones to tell you things will be OK, but when you start needing that reassurance several times a day it\u2019s time to take a step back.</p> <h2><strong>3) Introduce an absolute ban on Googling symptoms</strong></h2> <p>Dr Google is not, and never will be, your friend, especially not when you are a sufferer of health anxiety. Nor will message-boards and forums. Try to remember that people visit these places when they have reason to be concerned. Once you start understanding it\u2019s a skewed lens, you\u2019ll be better able to put things in perspective</p> <h2><strong>4) Try a countering technique</strong></h2> <p>This is a CBT exercise which involves giving a persistent thought the courtroom treatment, by confronting it with a rational counter-statement. For example, if your persistent thought is something like \u201cEveryone I love will die from this virus\u201d you can counter it with factual statements such as \u201cActually, most people who get Covid-19 are likely to make a full recovery, and that\u2019s assuming mum, dad and my little sister will even catch it at all.\u201d As my mother always says: \u201cJust because you think something, doesn\u2019t make it true.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>5) Do some exercise</strong></h2> <p>Even if it\u2019s just star jumps in your bedroom, or shaking your body parts like you\u2019re in the warm-up section of a hippie acting class, exercise will help get the adrenaline out of your system and channel the panic elsewhere.</p> <h2><strong>6) Breathing and grounding exercises</strong></h2> <p>From guided yogic breathing to using a strong smell (I favored lavender oil), grounding exercises can help bring you back to reality. I also found bending over to touch my toes and then very slowly standing up starting at the base of my spine to be beneficial, as it centers me.<strong> </strong>You can look for examples online, but sometimes, something as simple as sitting on the floor can help.</p> <h2><strong>7) Allocate yourself a daily </strong><strong>\u2018worry period\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Give yourself half an hour to worry about this to your heart\u2019s content, and then you have to go and do something else.</p> <h2><strong>8) Treat yourself</strong></h2> <p>Anything that will give you a little boost can help. It doesn\u2019t need to involve spending money: you can also cook yourself something nice, have a hot bath, or listen to a song you love.</p> <h2><strong>9) Remember that your anxious state isn\u2019t permanent</strong></h2> <p>When you are in it, anxiety always feels as though it will never end, but it will. It\u2019s hard to remember this, but do try. I genuinely thought that I would never recover, and now even though we are in a public health crisis, I feel calm and have things in perspective. It\u2019s a worrying time, and many of us, myself included, will have loved ones who might be showing symptoms, but the tendency to jump to the worst-case scenario very rarely reflects reality. Be kind to yourself. It may be a bit cheesy, but this too shall pass.</p>",

About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

  "<h2>Ravneet &amp; Jaswinder Gill &amp; Jit Atkar</h2> <p><em>Ravneet Gill is a pastry chef who has worked at St John</em><em> and has her own pop-up bakery, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/puffthebakery/\" title=\"\">Puff</a>. She is the founder of <a href=\"https://countertalk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Countertalk</a>, a platform that connects chefs and advocates supportive and healthy work environments in the industry, and her first book, The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide, is out next month. She grew up with her mother, Jaswinder, and grandmother, Jit, and learned to cook in restaurants before she ever cooked with her mother.</em></p> <p>When Ravneet Gill was about 14, an astrologer told her mother that Ravneet would work in the food industry. Jaswinder thought of the girl at home, so picky she\u2019d only eat jam sandwiches for lunch. It was such a ridiculous prophecy, she forgot to tell her until last year, when Ravneet was 27 and had been a chef for seven years.</p> <p>\u201cShe was so fussy, she never helped out,\u201d Jaswinder says, explaining why they never cooked together when Ravneet was growing up.</p> <p>\u201cYou would never let me help you,\u201d Rav shoots back. Rav is having afternoon tea with her mother and grandmother Jit, who they call Biji. She and Jit think that Jaswinder is too particular in the kitchen \u2013 \u201ccontrol freak\u201d is the exact phrase, repeated with much teasing.</p> <p>\u201cMum considers me messy but a normal person would consider me <em>very</em> clean,\u201d adds the chef, so adept in the precision of the pastry section that she works as a consultant for new businesses.</p> <p>\u201cShe is still messy,\u201d mutters Jaswinder.</p> <p>Jit doesn\u2019t speak much English but knows what they\u2019re talking about. How are her kitchen habits? The question brings a shrieks of laughter from the others.</p> <p>\u201cVery messy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo messy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe gets told off every day for her mess,\u201d says Ravneet.</p> <p>Discussing who, really, is the best cook brings more laughter. Jit loves her granddaughter\u2019s cakes (\u201cplain sponge,\u201d says Ravneet, \u201cshe hates chocolate\u201d) and Jaswinder\u2019s pakoras. Nominating Jit\u2019s best dish is immediate and unanimous: \u201cHer saag!\u201d \u2013 a Punjabi recipe of lots of greens, lots of butter, lots of onion, ginger and garlic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hands down, Mum is the best cook in the family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe loves making it,\u201d says Ravneet, as Jit demonstrates how to hand-press the chapatis that go with it. \u201cBut we get upset because it stinks the whole house out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoiled greens and lots of fenugreek,\u201d Jaswinder shakes her head and rolls her eyes in only partial mock exasperation.</p> <p>But, Ravneet says, it is acknowledged through the extended family that \u2013 \u201chands down\u201d \u2013 Jaswinder is the best cook: \u201cAll my dad\u2019s brothers\u2019 wives are from India, but Mum is from Kenya, so she\u2019s got more of an edge when it comes to spicing.\u201d Jaswinder explains that Indians will often only cook the food of the region they\u2019re from, but growing up in Nairobi exposed her to different ingredients and cuisines, so she might draw on Swahili or Gujarati elements.</p> <p>After her husband died, Jit moved her family to the UK in 1974, when Jaswinder was 14. Jit worked in a sewing factory in Aldgate, so it fell to her daughter to do the cooking and shopping. \u201cWe had to get on with it,\u201d Jaswinder shrugs. She found that not only did she enjoy cooking, but people loved her food.</p> <p>\u201cAll the ingredients in Kenya were fresh and organic,\u201d Jit says, adding that she\u2019d never cooked anything from the freezer before moving to the UK, and has still never used an oven. \u201cWe cooked with coal there, but when we came to England the hobs were gas.\u201d</p> <p>Ravneet became more interested in cooking in her late teens, especially baking cakes. After completing a psychology degree, she trained as a pastry chef. She still didn\u2019t cook at home, and didn\u2019t learn how to cook Indian food until she worked at London restaurant Jamavar.</p> <p>\u201cMy Indian food is way different to theirs,\u201d says Ravneet. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt so much about all types of cuisines, yet I have this Indian background, so I love taking seasonal ingredients and making curry with them in a way my mum and Biji wouldn\u2019t, like a delica pumpkin one I made.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou roast your pumpkin first, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jaswinder asks, explaining that she\u2019d use raw pumpkin, peeled then added to mustard and cumin seeds toasted in oil with (always) onions, ginger, garlic and chilli. Ravneet describes her more cheffy approach of making different elements: roast the pumpkin, make a base, then a sauce \u2013 before putting it all together. She might use coconut, which Jaswinder and Jit would eat happily but not think to cook with. These days, at 90, Jit is more likely to squirrel away the pumpkin seeds, scattering them in the garden without telling the rest of the family. \u201cLast year she went mad,\u201d laughs Ravneet, as her mother shakes her head, again. \u201cThere were pumpkin plants everywhere. Next door had them growing up into their trees.\u201d</p> <p>The leftover dal parathas, below, , is a recipe they all make, though Jit uses gram flour, which Jaswinder doesn\u2019t, and she doesn\u2019t put chilli in her dal, which Jaswinder does. Ravneet has shown her mum how to make Indian dishes that she\u2019s learnt in restaurants, like chat, and they now work together well enough to host dinners, splitting cooking duties. \u201cShe finally let me make samosas,\u201d jokes Ravneet.</p> <p>\u201cI made mogo [cassava chips],\u201d says Jaswinder. \u201cYou boil it and deep fry it, and add a spicy garlic paste, sprinkle it with lemon juice and coriander, so it\u2019s these African-Indian flavours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, we love that one,\u201d murmurs Ravneet. \u201cIt was only a few years ago that I realised what amazing cooks they are, and how lucky I am.\u201d <strong>HO</strong></p> <h2>Dal and fenugreek parathas with lemon pickle and yogurt</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a63d241a0753bcd4402dc21f33b0c61cf3eb042a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63d241a0753bcd4402dc21f33b0c61cf3eb042a/0_1021_6019_5707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dal and fenugreek parathas with lemon pickle and yogurt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"948\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dal and fenugreek parathas with lemon pickle and yogurt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ravneet</strong> It would be a complete lie to say that we work in harmony in the kitchen. Instead, our kitchen consists of three women who think they know more than the others. My grandma is extremely messy, loves pickling and hates throwing anything away. My mum is obsessed with cleaning and always puts too many chillies in our food. I became a chef but it hasn\u2019t earned me any credit with them yet. I grew up watching the two of them bicker and cook fantastically.</p> <p>One of my favourite things to this day is these leftover dal parathas, and we all make them slightly differently. They are so comforting and all you really need is a big bowl of natural set yogurt and some pickle to enjoy them.</p> <p>We eat these with my grandma\u2019s lemon pickle, which takes at least one week to get going; she has jars of the stuff on the go constantly.</p> <p>You can make the parathas vegan by adding oil instead of butter, and they\u2019re a great way of using up any leftover dal. There\u2019s lots of room to play here, so adjust according to your palate.</p> <p><em><strong>Makes 4-5<br>For the parathas<br></strong></em><strong>chapa</strong><strong>ti flour</strong> 200g, white or multigrain<br><strong>fine salt</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>potato</strong> 1 small, boiled, then mashed<br><strong>white onion</strong> 1 small, peeled and minced<br><strong>green chillies </strong>2, finely chopped<br><strong>coriander seeds</strong> 1/4 tsp, crushed<br><strong>ajwain (carom) seeds</strong> 1/4 tsp<br><strong>fresh coriander</strong> 25-30g, chopped<br><strong>fresh fenugreek</strong> 15g, chopped (optional)<br><strong>melted butter</strong> 1 tbsp, or neutral oil, plus extra to brush the parathas<br><strong>leftover cooked d</strong><strong>al</strong> 200g, we like to use yellow dal that has been seasoned properly so it\u2019s super flavourful</p> <p><em><strong>For the lemon pickle (makes a large jar which should last a month or so)<br></strong></em><strong>lemons</strong> 5 large<br><strong>bird\u2019s eye chillies</strong> 20<br><strong>vegetable oil</strong> 200ml<br><strong>yellow mustard seeds</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>nigella seeds</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>turmeric</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>red chilli powder</strong> 1 tbsp<br><strong>fine salt</strong> 100g<br><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 250ml<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>asafoetida</strong> 1 tsp </p> <p><em><strong>To serve<br></strong></em><strong>natural set yog</strong><strong>urt<br></strong><strong>lemon pickle</strong> (see above)</p> <p>To make the pickle, cut the lemons into pieces the size of a 50p coin. Keep the chillies whole. Put them in a heatproof bowl. Heat the oil, then add the mustard and nigella seeds and heat for a few minutes. Pour the hot oil over the lemons and chillies, and add the remaining ingredients. Stir, stir, stir. Decant into an airtight, sterilised jar, and leave for 2 weeks before eating. Make sure you keep stirring the pickle every few days.</p> <p>To make the chapatis, mix together the flour, salt, potato, onion, chilli, and spices and herbs.</p> <p>Add the melted butter and the dal, and mix with enough cold water to form a dough, not too sticky and not too dry. We add the water by eye because the mix varies each time depending on the other ingredients. Leave to rest for 1 hour.</p> <p>To cook the parathas, roll out pieces of the dough into a circle (about 15cm in diameter), brush with a little melted butter or neutral oil. Fold it up, sides in first then the top and bottom down. Roll it out again into a circle (15cm) and brush again with melted butter or oil. Cook the parathas in a large frying pan over a medium heat, brushing with extra butter or oil if they look dry at any point, until cooked. It will be nicely browned and slightly puffy with no raw spots. Transfer to a plate and cover with a tea towel to keep warm while you repeat with the remaining dough.</p> <p>Serve the parathas with yogurt and the lemon pickle.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pastry-chef-s-guide-9781911641513.html\" title=\"\">The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide</a> by Ravneet Gill (Pavilion, \u00a318.99); <a href=\"https://countertalk.co.uk/\" title=\"\">countertalk.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>Jessie &amp; Lennie Ware</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ea504392722bdae7ed7e64cb9346a9ff4c00e90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea504392722bdae7ed7e64cb9346a9ff4c00e90/0_502_5564_4619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessie and Lennie Ware.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She makes things look so effortless\u2019: Jessie and Lennie Ware.

We\u2019ve always talked about food.\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Growing up, Mum was very much head chef. I don\u2019t even know if I could call myself sous chef, but I was observing, picking things up. She was constantly in the kitchen making something and I\u2019ve inherited that from her. When I was 10 or 12 I felt I could have more independence and make my own food, but actually my mum always cooked dinner \u2013 and I\u2019m very appreciative of that.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> I cooked every night for dinner and we\u2019d all sit down to eat.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> She\u2019s so self-sufficient, so it was like: \u201cWhy would I need your help, I can do 10,000 things at the same time?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> I\u2019m also super bossy and controlling.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> She said it.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> I\u2019ve got better at delegating as I get older. Last week, when I got ill, and you had to cook, and I couldn\u2019t boss you around \u2026</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> And it was quite good, wasn\u2019t it?</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> It was great.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Mum\u2019s chicken soup is 68 years of \u2026</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> It\u2019s not 68 years, I didn\u2019t start cooking it when I was born.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> All right. Fine. When did you start cooking it?</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Probably when I left home. Because I had to, because I was so desperate for it.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Would you do Friday night dinner without your mum?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The best way cooking works now is if we avoid each other at all costs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Yes, latterly. Mostly after you were born.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Mum would make it for her friends, whereas I would bring my friends round to Mum\u2019s. I started making it when I had children \u2013 as much as she is eager to Uber it over. There\u2019s nothing better than my mum\u2019s one, especially if you\u2019re poorly. Everyone thinks their mother\u2019s is the best, but \u2026</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Mine is.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Hers really is. Jamie Oliver confirmed that when we made it for the podcast with him. We\u2019re living together at the moment, and I think the best way cooking works is if we avoid each other at all costs. Otherwise it just ends in \u2026</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Out-bossing.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Well, I don\u2019t boss.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> You do boss, Jessie.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> I just go quiet and very subservient.</p> <p>Lennie You go quiet and you get cross.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Inside. I wouldn\u2019t show it to you.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> How do I know you\u2019re cross then?</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> Because of the silence. Because I\u2019m never quiet unless you\u2019re telling me off.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> The big problem is, Jessie\u2019s very messy. If Jessie cooks, I\u2019ve got to be sous chef and just tidy up after her constantly.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> And that kind of suits me.</p> <p>Mum makes things look so effortless. She\u2019ll execute five or six different dishes \u2013 an array. And I\u2019ve inherited that generosity, but it\u2019s slightly optimistic.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Jessie is much better at flavours; she\u2019s much more adventurous. I can rescue things; I know how food works.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> She can rescue anything. The challenging thing with the cookbook was that we\u2019ve never really written down recipes. It was memories, \u201ca bit of this and a bit of that\u201d. With the matzo balls, you\u2019d never taught me how to make them. I\u2019d just watched you do it.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> When I had to write the recipe down, I got it completely wrong. Because I just used to shake things in. Now, having to repeat it and write it for the book, I\u2019ve got it absolutely perfect. I learnt it from my mother. With the soup, she would have never used chicken thighs, she would have had a kosher chicken \u2013 a boiling hen \u2013 and the giblets. I learnt from friends, if you leave the skin on the onions, it gives it a darker colour. And I have my soup completely clear, my mum would have left the onions in. She wouldn\u2019t have wasted bits of chicken and onions, whereas I throw it all away. By the time you\u2019ve boiled the shit out of it for five hours, you can\u2019t eat the chicken.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> See, I would have kept the chicken in, all shredded.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> I\u2019d put a shredded chicken breast in extra, if you want it.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> You never do though.</p> <p> I probably wouldn\u2019t make the matzo balls at home. I Iove having my mum\u2019s soup, hers is the supreme, but mine might be more hearty, verging on a stew. I\u2019m no good at puddings. It\u2019s the thing that least interests me.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> But everyone loves puddings, Jessie. We went to friends\u2019 last weekend and there were six different puds.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> And I ate all of them, but I\u2019m not a big pudding person. So if I\u2019m doing the main, Mum will do the pud, and she will just get on with it, and that\u2019s helpful. Quite annoyingly everything that she does is pretty excellent. But I\u2019m better at curries than you.</p> <p><strong>Lennie</strong> Yes, you are. You could make some this weekend.</p> <p><strong>Jessie</strong> OK, I will. <strong>HO</strong></p> <h2>Lennie\u2019s chicken soup</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9c786ae77b500fd843987e76c129a6b1bf91e5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c786ae77b500fd843987e76c129a6b1bf91e5d/0_1357_6025_5320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken soup and matzo balls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"883\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicken soup and matzo balls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The soup may not be completely clear (and it doesn\u2019t really matter), but if you want to make it as clear as a consomm\u00e9 then you can either put it all through a tea strainer (as I did when Jay Rayner was our guest) or you can use one or two egg shells from the matzo balls and put them in the soup as you bring it back to the boil \u2013 fish out the egg shells before you put the matzo balls in.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 6 (makes about 2 litres)<br></strong></em><strong>kosher boiling hen </strong>1 (if you can\u2019t buy one, use about 3-4kg chicken thighs, legs and wings)<br><strong>large onions </strong>4, skins left on, halved, cutting off the rooty bit<br><strong>carrots</strong> 8, sliced about 2-3cm thick<br><strong>celery sticks </strong>4, with leaves, halved<br><strong>leeks </strong>2, halved<br><strong>swede</strong> \u00bd<br><strong>Telma chicken soup mix</strong> 2 tbsp (available from a kosher shop or online) or 2 good chicken stock cubes<br><strong>whole black peppercorns</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>matzo balls </strong>(see below), to serve</p> <p>Put the chicken and all the vegetables in a stockpot or very large pan (about 5 litres capacity) with enough cold water to cover everything by about 5cm (about 3 litres) and bring to the boil.

Add the soup mix or stock cubes, the peppercorns and salt, bring back to the boil and then reduce the heat and gently simmer for 2-3 hours.</p> <p>Season the soup to taste, then leave to cool. Pour the soup through a colander into a large bowl. Carefully retrieve the carrots from the colander and add back to the soup. Give everything else a good squeeze to release the juices. Some people put a little of the chicken into the soup, but I\u2019m not sure it has much taste after being boiled for so long \u2013 and you will make your cat/dog very happy if you give them the bone-free chicken meat.</p> <p>Put the clear soup and carrots into the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight.

He grew up on a farm in Winchester, where he was taught to cook by his mother, Jenny.</em></p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I think anything that we do at <a href=\"\" title=\"\">Coombeshead Farm</a> has a fundamental grounding in what Mum\u2019s done for many, many years. Whenever she comes down there, I suspect she thinks it\u2019s a rip-off of her.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> No, I don\u2019t, actually, Tom.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> You, for example, find it very odd that cordials can be purchased in a shop. You have fundamentals in how to manage a larder.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> But you\u2019re a much better cook, making things people wouldn\u2019t have tried. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about you, Tom. If I make elderflower cordial it\u2019s maybe very good but it\u2019s normal, but you put a twist on it.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I\u2019d say less so nowadays. The more I\u2019ve cooked, the less I\u2019m interested in messing around during it. The processing is more interesting than cooking now. I get much more excited making cheese or bacon than cooking with cheese or bacon.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> I just made stuff to eat.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> It\u2019s the same thing. Subsistence is the fundamental. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 feeding people well.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> And treating the land well. All the fruit in my garden is absolutely used, isn\u2019t it? I hate waste.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> You had quite a go at me yesterday, for not putting the small top of a leek into the compost.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As far back as I remember, there was something bubbling away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Jenny</strong> You\u2019ve been chopping vegetables from an early age. But you really got into cooking things when you went to university to do some classical civilisation thing.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> Well, the course had some elements of Greek and Latin poetry. But I\u2019d say cookery became my passion at 15 or 16, like daily pancakes did at age nine and tomato sauce at 10. You were pretty tight about switching on the heating at home, so the kitchen was the warmest place to be \u2013 and watch. As far back as I remember, there was always something bubbling away and the Aga is good for putting your bum against. I loved raiding the pantry.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> I had to put a lock on the door. But cooking together was pretty happy and natural times, wouldn\u2019t you say, Tom?</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> It was more like being an understudy. And going out and picking stuff like rhubarb and being taught how to.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> He became obsessed by pigs.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I got a subscription to <em>P</em><em>ractical Pigs</em> and in the back there was a lot about the breeds available.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> We gave him four piglets for his 18th, rather than a car.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> I\u2019d grown up with sows the size of a sofa. I\u2019d ride Empress and imagine she was a dinosaur when I was nine or 10. But with the four piglets it was about the whole processing. Pigs are not the original farmhouse staple for nothing. There aren\u2019t many animals which can sustain a household for a year \u2013 with hams, sausages, bacons, offal, p\u00e2t\u00e9, you name it. I bought 18 pigs from a breeder in Lincoln. We had a wood at home and I kept them there but left mum to look after them when I was working in London.</p> <p><strong>Jenny</strong> Thanks Tom.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> Yes, taking care of 18 fairly wild pigs is not the easiest task. Mum was a bit \u201cEr, you need to deal with them, Tom\u201d. I\u2019d moved to London and taken a job first on Clapham High Street in a burger kitchen as a dishwasher and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/01/how-randolph-hodgson-and-neals-yard-dairy-gave-cheese-a-chance\" title=\"\">Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy </a>in Borough Market, in wholesale.

He does animal husbandry to a very high level and it takes time. And now him and Lottie have a five-month baby. And he\u2019s wanting to do four more rooms in one of the barns and another orchard and vegetable patch.</p> <p><strong>Tom</strong> Each part makes the whole better.

While dishes akin to this are found all over Europe \u2013 countless countries have a dish founded upon a humble legume, fresh tomatoes and some piece of salted and preserved pork \u2013 for me at least, this is synonymous with my mother, and the kitchen of my childhood home in rural Hampshire.</p> <p>My mother has wonderfully green fingers and that rare but vital ability to build a larder of beautiful things from what is farmed, grown, foraged and gathered through the seasons. During my childhood, there was rarely a moment when something was not bubbling away on the stove, salting in the larder or being frantically bottled. A simple dish of braised beans and tomatoes from the garden \u2013 sometimes with bacon if available, sometimes not \u2013 was a constant presence through late summer, and even well into winter thanks to a freezer stocked with enough batches of summer tomato sauce to last through an apocalypse. A cast-iron pot would slowly tick away over the course of a few hours, often left on top of the Aga to keep hot for for any of us kids to help ourselves as we passed through the kitchen. It regularly made for an ideal lunch with some aioli, fresh leaves and a warm baguette, and often became a fine dinner with additional steamed greens and some slow-roasted poultry. It\u2019s also one of those dishes that benefits from a day or two in the fridge before being reheated.</p> <p>This dish is a lesson in the importance of great ingredients and, in hindsight, was perhaps the most important thing to understand from watching and helping in the kitchen and garden at home. When made with tomatoes at the peak of their power, fresh herbs and fine bacon, this is a thing of unbelievable satisfaction. On the other hand, substitute the vitals for tinned tomatoes, poorly dried herbs and soggy wet cured bacon, and this will be a most ordinary affair. And therein lies the beauty of the simplest of foods.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 comfortably<br></strong></em><strong>extra virgin olive oil<br>smoked bacon </strong>100g, diced<br><strong>onions</strong> 3 medium, peeled and diced<br><strong>garlic</strong> 6 cloves, minced<br><strong>celery</strong> 6 sticks, diced<br><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2<br><strong>rosemary</strong> 2 sprigs <br><strong>thyme</strong> 2 sprigs<br><strong>smoked paprika</strong> \u00be tsp<br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 250g, fresh and nicely ripe, roughly diced<br><strong>dried haricot beans</strong> 250g, soaked overnight, or fresh beans if available<br><strong>chicken stock</strong> 500ml<br><strong>salt</strong> to taste<br><strong>crusty bread</strong> to serve<br><strong>aioli</strong> to serve</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4.

Add the bay leaves, rosemary, thyme and paprika. Keep cooking for another 10 minutes. Add the fresh tomatoes, and allow them to cook for 30 minutes until they are fully broken down. Season to taste at this stage.</p> <p>Add the soaked and drained haricot beans and the chicken stock, and bring to a gentle simmer on the stove.</p> <p>Move the pan to the oven with the lid off and bake for 2 hours until thick and unctuous with a nice crust.</p> <p>Taste again and season accordingly with salt.</p> <p>Remove from the oven and allow to mellow for an hour.

Bankers and analysts say they have plenty of capital, in part because over the past few years they have been forced by the prudential regulator to hold more and more.</p> <p>Instead, the issue has been that, because of the crisis, they only want to hold assets that are either cash or can be instantly turned into cash.</p> <p>Government bonds, however, pay returns over years or decades.</p> <p>In normal times this doesn\u2019t matter as much because there is a lively market in which banks and other investors trade bonds.

Banks have a strong incentive not to hold too much money in the RBA strongbox \u2013 it pays the worst interest rate going around, of 0.25 points below the official rate.</p> <p>With official rates at 0.5%, that means the banks are getting just 0.25% \u2013 and if the RBA cuts rates again to 0.25%, as markets predict, they will get a big fat zero.</p> <p>At a meeting with regulators \u2013 including the RBA \u2013 on Tuesday or Wednesday, the commercial banks will also be looking for help dealing with their loan books.</p> <p>The banks have all agreed to give businesses extra time to make repayments, or help them restructure their loans to help them through the cashflow crisis many are suffering.</p> <p>They will probably ask regulators to waive regulations that make that harder or slower.</p> <p>Nonetheless, analysts predict bad debts will balloon because of the virus crisis, to as much as $4bn over the next three years.</p> <p>The next risk for banks is that the crisis currently smashing their small and medium-sized business customers will leak into home loans.</p> <p>This is where the RBA\u2019s market interventions might become ineffective.</p> <p>All the big four banks are heavily reliant on lending to Australians who have bought into the country\u2019s ever-buoyant property market.</p> <p>If large numbers of people lose their jobs and can\u2019t make home loan repayments, the banking system will come under extreme stress.</p> <p>The Australian economy avoided a housing crash in the GFC, in part through the Rudd government\u2019s cash splash to ordinary workers.</p> <p>So far, the Morrison government has resisted that move.</p> <p>But, as RBA governor Phillip Lowe has repeatedly said, there is only so much the central bank can do on its own.</p>",

For example, they should be offered without the head and legs, so that in supermarkets it is viewed as organic healthy meat instead of a slaughtered pet.\u201d</p> <p>A 2019 report by Peru\u2019s ministry of agriculture revealed a growing international demand for cuy meat, with an 18% growth in sales between 1994 and 2018.

The shocking possible extent of the crisis comes as Boris Johnson sought to shore up confidence in his handling of the situation by announcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/boris-johnson-to-hold-daily-coronavirus-press-briefings\">that he will hold a daily media conference</a> for \u201cas long as necessary\u201d. Deaths in the UK stand at 35 and family have paid tribute to the man believed to be the youngest victim so far, a 59-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/tributes-paid-to-uks-youngest-victim-of-coronavirus\">former police officer, Nick Matthews</a>. There is concern that the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/cancel-this-years-gsce-and-a-levels\">could force this year\u2019s GCSEs and A-level exams to be postponed </a>until later in the year and unions have warned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-unions-attack-paltry-sick-pay-for-self-isolating-couriers\">lack of sick pay for laid-off courier workers</a>. . <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news\">More news all day at our live blog.</a></p> \n<p>There are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-global-deaths-and-infections-overtake-those-inside-china\">more cases of coronavirus around the world than inside China</a>, the epicentre of the outbreak. Worldwide infections have grown to more than 86,000, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker, while cases inside China stood at 80,860 as of Monday.

The shift has been triggered by changes to the state pension age, the data reveals, with the number of older women in the workforce increasing by 51% since the reforms were introduced in 2010. The number of working men aged between 60 and 64 increased by 13% over the same period. Experts described the shift as \u201cseismic\u201d and said it would have profound implications for women now and in later life.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Biden v Bernie \u2013 </strong>They kept their distance and bumped elbows, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">but Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders still managed to come together to condemn Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis</a> in the first one-on-one debate in the slimmed-down Democratic presidential nomination debate. Biden said it called for wartime-style national mobilisation and he would summon the army while his rival took the opportunity to tout his plan for sweeping healthcare reforms. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/joe-biden-vp-woman-female-running-mate\">Biden also pledged to choose a woman as his running mate</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9cd86439-9730-4d31-9420-04159eb9e36f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QbhWz5QD6R8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Ghost trains\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Thousands of trains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/16/investigation-reveals-number-of-ghost-trains-lying-idle-in-britain\">are sitting idle in depots across Britain</a> despite the country\u2019s creaking rail network being in desperate need of additional rolling stock. An investigation by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches has found that many of the carriages, which contain around 110,000 seats, could be used immediately. Research also reveals the inequality between services in the north and south of England, with experts calling for more widespread electrification to fix the problem.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Scrolls downer \u2013 </strong>They were always suspected of being one of the most elaborate hoaxes in history but now it\u2019s official: the fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls for which an American museum paid millions of dollars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/16/dead-sea-scrolls-fragments-at-museum-of-the-bible-are-all-fakes-study-says\">are fakes</a>, experts have said. Steve Green reportedly paid millions for the \u201cscrolls\u201d for his Museum of the Bible in Washington DC. But a team of researchers have concluded after exhaustive testing that they are probably fakes made of old shoe leather.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>The story continued to move quickly overnight. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people as the death toll rose to 64 and California\u2019s governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/california-governor-directs-all-bars-nightclubs-wineries-close-coronavirus\">asked bars to shut down.</a> New York City ordered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-new-york-city-closes-public-schools-system\">all its public schools to close</a>. Argentina has gone into full lockdown and South Africa has declared a national emergency. In Washington, however, Donald Trump gave a brief press conference in which he insisted the US was \u201cdoing great\u201d in fighting the outbreak, and heaped praise on the US Federal Reserve after it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\">announced it was slashing interest rates</a> to near zero.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fecb04-934a-4af1-baee-358948ad8ba5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0hG3V9378fg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But even that emergency cut has failed to calm nerves on financial markets with another turbulent day in prospect on global stock markets. The Sydney market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/australian-stock-market-mayhem-as-asx200-tumbles-97-on-coronavirus-fears\">dropped almost 10% on Monday</a> despite Australia\u2019s central bank announcing it is on the brink of quantitative easing. The FTSE100 is on course to lose 2.5% at the opening bell this morning.</p> \n<p>There was anger in Germany after it was reported that Trump had offered $1bn to a German pharmaceutical company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/not-for-sale-anger-in-germany-at-report-trump-seeking-exclusive-coronavirus-vaccine-deal\">in exchange for exclusive US access to a Covid-19 vaccine</a> it is developing.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast</h2> \n<p>Like a growing number of people, Simon Parkin suffered from insomnia for years.

  "<p>Marie Millande Tulm\u00e9 was at work in a prison when she received a call confirming her fears: the gruesome sickness spreading rapidly across her nation was indeed cholera.</p> <p>The head nurse for Haiti\u2019s Central Plateau region at the time, Tulm\u00e9 was investigating rumours that prisoners were getting violently ill and that two had died. \u201cI thought: \u2018Haiti will perish,\u2019\u201d she says, recalling her reaction when Haiti\u2019s national laboratory phoned with the news. \u201cBecause I knew that cholera was grave. That it spreads easily.\u201d</p> <p>Within days, hundreds of people living near the the country\u2019s longest river, the Artibonite, which irrigates rice paddies across central Haiti, were wrapping their sick in bedsheets or carrying them on mattresses to hospitals so crowded that patients were lying head to toe on the pavement outside. Cholera would eventually sicken 800,000 people \u2013 nearly 10% of Haiti\u2019s population \u2013 and kill 10,000.</p> <p>But against all odds, Haiti\u2019s cholera crisis appears to be over now. No new cases have been confirmed in more than 12 months. Experts say two more years must pass in order to definitively declare Haiti cholera-free. But a year without cholera is testament to the fearless and tireless work of Haitian health workers. </p> <p>Even before the confirmation of cholera, Tulm\u00e9 had been trying to investigate where the sickness was coming from, tracing the early cases to the banks of the M\u00e9y\u00e9 River, a tributary of the Artibonite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e3a7ba53b35be4d632bd03dc706663ea136fa89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3a7ba53b35be4d632bd03dc706663ea136fa89/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women wash laundry along the Meille River, a tributary to the Artibonite River, the longest waterway in Haiti, which carried cholera through the country\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women wash laundry along the Meille River, a tributary to the Artibonite River, the longest waterway in Haiti, which carried cholera through the country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Shelley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Tulm\u00e9 arrived here in October 2010, residents on the eastern bank pointed her to a drainage pipe across the way that delivered waste from a UN peacekeepers\u2019 bathroom straight into the river.</p> <p>\u201cThe farmers, they told me there\u2019s a place where Minustah [the UN stabilisation mission in Haiti] is throwing poop,\u201d says Tulm\u00e9. \u201cIt was not far from the river. Which means infiltration can happen very fast.\u201d</p> <p>Tulm\u00e9 knocked on the peacekeepers\u2019 front gate to investigate, but \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t let us in,\u201d she recalls. When she asked whether anyone in the base had come down with symptoms similar to those experienced by Haitians in the area, they told her: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have people with diarrhoea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were telling the truth,\u201d says Tulm\u00e9.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t. Journalists from the Associated Press visited the site and observed waste flowing into the river. Still the UN continued to deny media reports and scientific studies that pointed to that base. It wasn\u2019t until six years later that the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/dec/01/haiti-cholera-outbreak-stain-on-reputation-un-says\">admitted the UN\u2019s responsibility</a> and apologised.</p> <p>Minustah had failed to test peacekeepers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, for the disease. When they got sick, waste from the bathroom they used flowed directly into the river. Additional waste was trucked off by a private company and deposited a few hundred metres away, where it contaminated the water there, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"035fb3e6a02a1bd5c03436a0235502faf98b5220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/035fb3e6a02a1bd5c03436a0235502faf98b5220/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marie Millande Tulm\u00e9, an epidemiologist, speaks with Reynald Louis Charles, a farmer, on the banks of the Meille river at the former UN base near Mirebalais\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marie Millande Tulm\u00e9, an epidemiologist, speaks with Reynald Louis Charles, a farmer, by the Meille River at the former UN base near Mirebalais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Shelley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reynold Louis Charles, a local cow-herder, says families living along the river never used to think twice about using its water. \u201cWe thought the water was clean.

Minustah pulled out of Haiti in 2017. All that\u2019s left are crumpled concrete walls painted with messages about good conduct such as: \u201cLearn safety, teach safety, and practise safety\u201d \u2013 an ironic reminder of the absence of basic safety practices there that caused a catastrophe.</p> <p>Cholera \u201ctook everyone by surprise,\u201d says Paul Christian Namphy, a cholera coordinator for Dinepa, Haiti\u2019s Water and Sanitation Authority.</p> <p>The timing was terrible: cholera was confirmed less than a fortnight before Haiti\u2019s annual All Saints\u2019 Day, when families travel to visit the graves of loved ones. Touching the tombs, touching each other, and travelling long distances in crowded public buses spread the bacteria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a country where you quarantine people because of a disease. The state can\u2019t stop people from moving around,\u201d says Namphy.</p> <p>It was only 10 months after Haiti\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake \u2013 more than a million people were still living in displaced persons\u2019 camps, many without proper sanitation. Namphy and his government colleagues raced to chlorinate water arriving in the camps.</p> <p>And then, four weeks later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/nov/05/hurricane-tomas-haiti\">tropical </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/nov/05/hurricane-tomas-haiti\">storm T</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/nov/05/hurricane-tomas-haiti\">omas hit</a>, flooding Haiti.

Cholera clinics began popping up across the nation, funded by international donors. Nurses tested sick patients and sent samples to Haiti\u2019s national laboratory. They gave patients oral rehydration, or an IV if necessary.</p> <p>Health workers would go to the clinics, read the book with the addresses of the sick patients. \u201cWithin 48 hours they would go decontaminate the house and distribute chlorine tablets for treating the water,\u201d Namphy recalls.</p> <p>To treat patients for cholera is not complex, says Ndiaga Seck, chief of communications in Haiti for Unicef, the UN children\u2019s agency, which coordinates the rapid response teams. \u201cYou just rehydrate the person.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1f42225feb72f077d7ea654d72288599782b2ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1f42225feb72f077d7ea654d72288599782b2ee/0_0_4912_3296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of twins with cholera are held by their mother, right, and sister, centre, as they receive IV drips at a cholera clinic in Port-au-Prince\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pair of twins with cholera are held by their mother, right, and sister, centre, as they receive IV drips at a cholera clinic in Port-au-Prince in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Shelley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seck grew up seeing cholera cases treated effectively in his home country of Senegal. \u201cBut if you have a collapsed health system, it can be a catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Haiti too has come around. \u201cWe used to be 55 teams. Now we are eight,\u201d says Seck. \u201cThe reported cases are getting fewer and fewer every day.\u201d</p> <p>In the mountains around Mirebalais, Haitian health workers from the NGO Acted load a pickup truck with chlorine-water and set off to a clinic where, the previous day, a patient had arrived with cholera-like symptoms.</p> <p>When the epidemic was at its height, these clinics were so overcrowded that patients were lying, sometimes dying, on the floor. Today, they are eerily empty.</p> <p>After checking the records for the address, the team set off to find the woman at her home. They asked her whether she used treated water and warned her that the open pit latrine above her home was a cholera risk because its unlined pit was overflowing. The woman, 51-year-old Antonia Macenat, explained that she hadn\u2019t had enough money to pay to dig a new latrine.</p> <p>The rapid response team split into two and set to work spraying the latrine and homes close by. They called neighbours and children walking home from school to an impromptu public sensitisation in which they showed diagrams and sang jingles that explain how cholera is spread and how it can be stopped by washing hands and treating water.</p> <p>\u201cCholera came in 2010, right?\u201d health worker Jennyfer Joseph asked the crowd. \u201cWell even before cholera came, we had diarrhoea, right? So after cholera is gone we will still have diarrhoea. So we need to do these things every day to prevent it.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph was just 22 when the epidemic began. Ten years later, she is among hundreds of Haitian rapid response workers credited with stopping the disease. She says cholera\u2019s legacy outlived the infamous 2010 earthquake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8887852aa318562ed584b4248d780e3fabe2685c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8887852aa318562ed584b4248d780e3fabe2685c/0_0_5524_3683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reynald Louis Charles leads one of his cattle past a toilet on the banks of the Meille river at the abandoned UN base near Mirebalais, the centre of the 2010 cholera epidemic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reynald Louis Charles leads one of his cattle past a toilet by the Meille River at the abandoned UN base near Mirebalais, the centre of the 2010 cholera epidemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Shelley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe earthquake was just one day. Cholera? Every day people would die.\u201d At first, she recalls, \u201cpeople wouldn\u2019t want to say they have cholera\u201d because they were afraid of being sent to a hospital with other sick people, away from their families. But by talking to people in their own communities about the urgency of getting treated, health workers began to overcome that stigma, since everyone felt like they were in it together.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe this was the main factor in eventually getting the upper hand,\u201d says Namphy. A UN official says that 840,000 Haitians benefited from the rapid response teams.</p> <p>\u201cThey were quite innovative,\u201d says Josette Sheeran, the UN\u2019s special envoy to Haiti. \u201cSo we made sure they got the funding they needed.</p> <p>\u201cIn every public health crisis, there\u2019s not a dearth of ideas, but a dearth of strategies. You need a battle plan to tackle it. And as we put that in place, you began to see those numbers go down.\u201d</p> <p>Sheeran says the UN\u2019s goal was \u201cto end this chapter with dignity \u2013and that meant stopping deaths and stopping the spread (in) the communities hardest hit.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s more, says Namphy, Haiti is \u201cthe pioneer\u201d of this novel new approach to combating cholera.<strong> </strong>\u201cNow they\u2019re looking at Yemen, South Sudan, eastern Congo, to use the lessons that were learned here and tailor that to those countries.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the success story, though, many feel Haiti\u2019s cholera chapter won\u2019t be closed until the UN compensates the 800,000 victims for the healthcare costs, the suffering and the deaths.</p> <p>\u201cSince it was Minustah that came and brought this to our country, they should pay,\u201d says 39-year-old Tuseuier De Louis as she washed clothes in the Artibonite river in Mirebalais, just down the road from the UN base. At a nearby park, hand-painted posters demand justice: \u201cReparations for all Minustah crimes in Haiti!\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), a US-based legal advocacy organisation, filed a claim against the UN on behalf of 5,000 Haitian victims. The UN rejected the claim as \u201cnot receivable\u201d and has refused to establish a standing claims commission to hear the dispute, although its peacekeeping agreement with Haiti requires it to do so.</p> <p>Nor has the UN created commissions to consider any of the other claims against UN peacekeepers in Haiti, including wrongful killings and child abuse. In 2013, IJDH sued the UN in the US federal court, which dismissed the case citing legal immunity.</p> <p>Some in Haiti say the UN\u2019s actions during the cholera outbreak go beyond negligence, amounting to a deliberate cover-up that may have unnecessarily endangered lives.</p> <p>\u201cEven if we take the viewpoint most critical of the UN \u2013 that the UN was responsible for introducing cholera and it was the UN\u2019s responsibility to admit the truth and it was the UN\u2019s responsibility to eliminate it and save lives \u2013 in the beginning, that isn\u2019t what happened,\u201d says Namphy.</p> <p>\u201cThe UN troops destroyed evidence at their base, including digging up leaking pipes and draining septic tanks, before scientists could examine it,\u201d <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/03/when-the-u-n-sowed-cholera-in-haiti-how-fast-did-americans-know.html\">wrote</a> the journalist Jonathan Katz, who watched as it happened.

So far, the UN has raised just over $20m \u2013 barely 5% of the total. (A UN official said UN agencies mobilised $64m between 2016 and 2019, $10m of which was through that fund.) Funding was also used to vaccinate 1.7 million people against the disease.</p> <p>But Haiti is \u201cfar from [its] objectives\u201d when it comes to ending waterborne disease, says Namphy. \u201cRight now, acute diarrhoea is more of a risk than cholera.

We must be content with the government releasing extreme policies, such as quarantining elderly people for months, not in press conferences where they can explain and reassure, but through <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-14/elderly-to-be-quarantined-for-four-months-in-wartime-style-mobilisation-to-combat-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">private briefings to journalists</a> who then ventriloquise rather than question. It is as if any reasonable need to understand such policies, and indeed, why we are diverging from every other country in this regard, is a populist storming of the palace. No one is demanding that the public make the decisions, simply that there be an effort to explain <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/uk/uk-coronavirus-response-boris-johnson-intl-gbr/index.html\" title=\"\">why this country is taking such a different approach</a>, the success of which hinges on mass observance from the public.</p> <p>This need not be confused with a disregard for specialists. It is in fact a plea that the government allow those specialists to walk us through it. But asking for such becomes not just a reasonable scepticism based on the government\u2019s previous form, or even a basic democratic exercise, it is now \u201cpoliticising\u201d the crisis. Politicising in this instance means not having enough <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11162290/coronavirus-social-media-cheap-shots-boris-johnson/\" title=\"\">respect for authority</a>. The fact is it is political when our politicians do not reassure us sufficiently during a health pandemic that the prime minister (with just enough tremolo of course), called a once in a generation event. It is political, when politicians cannot convince the public of the reliability of their decisions, forcing people to take matters into their own hands anyway and start remote working protocols, cancel events, avoid mass gatherings and <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300403\" title=\"\">pull their children out of school</a>.</p> <p>It is a dangerous British trait to fall obediently into line behind those in power when things are uncertain. When the chips are down, a class system redux kicks in. The laws of the hierarchy must be observed. It is a sort of tyranny of politeness and deference that suspends judgment. Johnson is no longer thought to be an untransparent, unserious man guided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/10/solidarity-required-in-resistance-to-johnson-cummings-autocracy\" title=\"\">by a crank</a>. He is our leader in troubled times. His role and the circumstances, rather than his record or his performance, demand respect.</p> <p>In a way Johnson\u2019s previous lack of seriousness plays to his advantage now, so desperate are we to believe that underneath the clown makeup there is a serious person running the country, that it was always an act. It is the same impulse that prompts politicians and the media to declare Donald Trump as \u201cfinally\u201d <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/01/politics/van-jones-trump-congress-speech-became-the-president-in-that-moment-cnntv/index.html\" title=\"\">becoming president</a> when he manages to get through a single event or speech without melting down. Johnson may indeed have made difficult decisions based on serious consultation with experts on the right response. In which case neither he nor those scientists \u2013 who are far more comfortable with uncertainty than politicians and their followers \u2013 should mind showing us their working.</p> <p>There is clearly no consensus on how to respond to the pandemic even among the scientific community. Prof Neil Gershenfeld of Massachusetts Institute of Technology put it best when he said that \u201cbuilding models is very different from proclaiming truths\u201d. All anyone wants to know is how our particular model was built, and then we can all squash the sombrero together.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-need-new-stories-9781474610407.html\" title=\"\">We Need New Stories: Challenging the Toxic Myths Behind Our Age of Discontent</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2020 to expand the quotation from the Daily Mail.</p>",
  "<p>Last year was one of the worst in recent times for both flooding and drought in England, a study has found.</p> <p>There were more than 5,600 flood warnings in England in 2019, more than in any of the last 15 years except 2012. Groundwater levels were lower than normal in 25 areas, more than in any year since comparable records began in 2006.</p> <p>In 2012 there were only eight areas where groundwater levels were lower than normal. In 2014, another wet year, no areas recorded lower than normal levels.</p> <p>Having both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/14/storm-ciara-expected-to-cost-up-to-200m-in-insurance-claims-storm-dennis\">very wet</a> and very dry weather is unusual but is likely to become more common as weather becomes more extreme as a result of climate change. People may begin to experience both water shortages and flooding, putting infrastructure under unprecedented strain.</p> <p>Wildlife will also suffer, a group of conservation charities have said. They estimate that only 1% of current spending on flooding and drought goes to nature-based solutions such as restoring water meadows and wetlands, which can act like a sponge to store water under flooding and as natural reservoirs at times of drought.</p> <p>The charities are particularly concerned that staff cuts and stretched resources at the Environment Agency and Natural England and in local government and other government agencies charged with environmental protection mean years like 2019 will stretch England\u2019s resilience to breaking point.</p> <p>Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: \u201cIf funds for our water watchdogs dry up, the human and ecological effects of flooding and drought will grow every year. We need to get flood funds flowing to Natural England and the Environment Agency to ensure that good water management is part of the fabric of our landscape.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should devote new cash to the agencies for natural flood mitigation, urban resilience, habitat enhancement and sustainable farming, plus vital functions like regulatory enforcement and spatial planning.\u201d</p> <p>This year has had one of the wettest starts on record, with rainfall in February in many areas breaking records after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/09/storm-ciara-hurricane-force-winds-batter-uk-transport\">Storm Ciara</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2020/feb/15/storm-dennis-footage-shows-weather-chaos-hitting-the-uk-video\">Storm Dennis</a>.</p> <p>Benwell said more heavy rainfall this spring would be likely to lead to further widespread flooding and damage to wildlife in waters and wetlands. This is due to exceptionally high river flows and groundwater levels, and soil saturation.</p> <p>But if this summer is hot and dry, as in the drought of 2018, rivers would quickly cease to flow again in parts of the country.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s chalk streams, a natural habitat under increasing threat from extremes of weather, are likely to be among the worst-hit areas, said Ian Hepburn, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.</p> <p>\u201cExceptionally serious drought and floods created a perfect storm for our waters and wildlife last year, with our globally rare chalk streams particularly badly hit,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change means that without radical action many more years of flood and drought crises lie ahead. We need substantial, consistent and urgent investment from the government in our water watchdogs and natural flood and drought defences or our rivers and lakes, and the wildlife that relies on them, will continue to deteriorate.\u201d</p> <p>In the budget, the chancellor of the exchequer pledged to double capital spending on floods, from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a35.2bn, which the government said would protect an additional 330,000 homes. However, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/chancellor-announces-spending-on-flooding-will-be-doubled\">new spending will not take account of ongoing maintenance and upkeep costs</a>, and only a small proportion of the money is likely to be spent on the kind of natural flood management projects that conservationists say are necessary to protect wildlife and nature as well as homes.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cWe will continue to work closely with [Natural England and the Environment Agency] to ensure they have the right resources to continue to not only protect our natural environment but also improve it for future generations.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: \u201cNow more than ever, urgent action is needed to tackle the climate emergency and the government has been very clear about its ambition to tackle climate change and restore our natural environment. Nature-based solutions such as restoration of peat bogs and our marine sea grass beds will play a huge part in this and Natural England will be at the forefront of delivery. We are currently in discussion with Defra about next year\u2019s budget for our existing statutory duties and for new work such as this.\u201d</p>",

But this patch of Wharfedale is a landscape I know well, and a seasonal lapwing presence in this field, with the accompanying sights and sounds, is reliable enough that it forms part of my mental map of the place.

The 2014 novel moves back and forth between the first days of a pandemic that ends civilization, and the long aftermath, as small groups of survivors try to rebuild. One band of characters forms a post-apocalyptic Shakespeare troupe and they travel the wilds of Canada, staging old plays in exchange for food. The real drama of the novel doesn\u2019t come from gore or gun battles, but from the protagonists\u2019 constant reckoning with just how much they have lost. \u201cSurvival is insufficient,\u201d they keep reminding each other, even as survival itself is far from guaranteed. It all feels terrifyingly plausible.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve read Station Eleven already, the author has a much anticipated new novel out this month: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567284/the-glass-hotel-by-emily-st-john-mandel/\">The Glass Hotel</a>, about a global Ponzi scheme and a woman who vanishes.</p> <h2><strong>Severance, by Ling Ma</strong></h2> <p>Looking for a pandemic novel that\u2019s also a satire of global capitalism? In Severance, the pandemic that ends civilization is the Shen fever, believed to have originated in Shenzen, China, the center of electronics manufacturing, and then spread through tiny fungal spores across the globe. The narrator is Candace Chen, who works in publishing in New York City, overseeing the Bibles division. Candace is sharp, sardonic, and before the world ends, slightly diffident. Somehow, she becomes one of the last people in Manhattan left alive, before fleeing into the wilderness in a yellow New York City taxi. As Alison Willmore, a film critic at Vulture, wrote: \u201cWe should all be reading Ling Ma\u2019s Severance, not just because of the pandemic parallels, but because its heroine\u2019s survival seems to depend on her resistance to nostalgia.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The Great Believers, by Rebecca Makkai</strong></h2> <p>This is a novel about the long consequences of trauma and loss, set among a group of gay friends in Chicago at the very beginning of the Aids epidemic. It tells two stories in parallel, one unfolding in 1985, as Yale Tishman, a young art expert, begins to lose his friends to Aids, and the second in 2015, as Fiona, whose brother died from Aids in 1985, searches for her missing daughter, and must confront her unresolved grief. This is a gripping, fast-moving novel, a good choice for long days of isolation. I read it all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/29/social-media-detox-read-books-one-week\">alone in a cabin in the woods</a>, and I forgot myself, and I could not put it down.</p> <h2><strong>The Old Drift, by Namwali Serpell</strong></h2> <p>This multigenerational epic follows the intertwining fortunes of three Zambian families (black, white and brown) over more than a century, from the late nineteenth century into the near future. It\u2019s a big, dazzling book, and Serpell\u2019s ambition and humor will win you over from the very first page. This is not a pandemic novel, but the Aids epidemic shapes the stories of the later generations, and the novel as a whole is grappling with other forces that shape our current pandemic: colonialism, technology, stigma and secrets, the idea of Europe, the idea of Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b8b95a3ed40ea568182d1fe6d51d2f37325a775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b8b95a3ed40ea568182d1fe6d51d2f37325a775/906_422_2258_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Namwali Serpell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Namwali Serpell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Power, by Naomi Alderman</strong></h2> <p>In this bestselling 2016 novel, women and girls develop the power to inflict pain or death on other people \u2013 men, mostly \u2013 with power that comes from their hands. It\u2019s the opposite of a pandemic, but it has a similar ability to destabilize and remake society. This is not a relaxing novel: the women who develop the power sometimes develop it in response to horrific violence, including sexual violence, and so the novel is a chronicle of the pain and terror inflicted on women around the world, as well as their growing rebellion.</p> <h2><strong>The Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis</strong></h2> <p>In this 1992 novel by one of America\u2019s most acclaimed science fiction writers, a graduate student who is part of a time-traveling history research group at Oxford is sent on an expedition to the Middle Ages and ends up in the middle of the Black Plague.

Jane Eyre is so much bigger and stranger and more compelling than the gothic love story that made it famous. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be quarantined with someone else, read Jane Eyre aloud.</p> <h2><strong>Room, by Emma Donoghue</strong></h2> <p>This novel is narrated by a five-year-old boy, who has grown up with his mother in the single room where she is being held captive. For him, that room is the whole world, and everything in it is vividly real to him: the bed, his favorite spoon, the drawings that his mother makes for him. The love and inventiveness his mother shows in trying to give him a good life in that room will be especially resonant in this moment.</p> <h2><strong>Real Life, by Brandon Taylor</strong></h2> <p>Loneliness. Alienation. Mistrust. Science as it is actually practiced, so different from Science as an idea. The themes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/brandon-taylor-author-real-life-interview\">Taylor\u2019s elegant campus novel</a>, which follows the life of a queer black graduate student at a primarily white university, are resonant in a pandemic, though there are no zombie battles, just an ambiguously contaminated experiment.</p> <h2><strong>My Side of the Mountain, by Jean Craighead George</strong></h2> <p>This classic children\u2019s book from 1959 tells the story of a boy who runs away from home and learns how to live alone in the wilderness of the Catskill Mountains. He digs himself a burrow underneath a tree. He learns to fish. He tames a falcon. His loneliness is, for the most part, bracing and wholesome and creative. An excellent escape fantasy, and a reminder of the brilliant pleasures of solitary life (though few of those pleasures may be readily available in your apartment).</p> <h2><strong>The Plague, by Albert Camus</strong></h2> <p>You might think this slim novel is on so many pandemic book lists only because its title is literally The Plague. But it\u2019s so much more than that: I like to think of The Plague as an unexpected guide to self-care. You can take breaks, Camus reminds us, even in the most intense and devastating situations. So go swimming! I mean, you can\u2019t go swimming. You\u2019re in quarantine. Listen to the Existentialists: take a bath.</p> <h2><strong>Meditations in an Emergency, by Frank O\u2019Hara</strong></h2> <p>Just the poetry collection you need. Read the <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/26538/meditations-in-an-emergency\">title poem here.</a> \u201cI am the least difficult of men,\u201d O\u2019Hara writes. \u201cAll I want is boundless love.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>My Year of Rest and Relaxation, by Ottessa Moshfegh</strong></h2> <p>In New York City, an alienated young woman tries to sleep through an entire year. This is a critically acclaimed book, beloved of many discerning New Yorkers. I would rather eat every back issue of n+1 than finish this novel, but you, dear reader, may like it.</p> <h2><strong>Something that May Shock and Discredit You, by Daniel Mallory Ortberg (now Daniel M</strong><strong> Lavery)</strong></h2> <p>This essay collection, from one of the co-founders of the cult feminist website the Toast, is characteristically wry and winsome. Lord Byron! Evelyn Waugh! The Golden Girls! But there are real stakes to these essays, a real wrestling with faith, family, and transition. It\u2019s a good book to read while quarantined, because if you cry while reading it in public, you cannot touch your face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bd4b790c18d12004934fd8f118d40e9b8387a4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bd4b790c18d12004934fd8f118d40e9b8387a4d/0_928_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel M.

Boccaccio\u2019s framing device is the Black Plague. His protagonists, seven women and three men, retreat to a villa outside Florence to avoid the pandemic. There, isolated for two weeks, they pass the time by telling each other stories, with a different theme for each day. Read a few of them.

Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus dominated the debate, with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders offering different visions for how to combat the crisis. </strong>After the pair bumped elbows to greet each other, Biden described the coronavirus crisis as an \u201call hands on deck\u201d situation that required immediate steps to protect vulnerable communities, while Sanders said the pandemic underscored the need for an overhaul of the US healthcare system to protect all Americans. The contrast reflected one of the key questions in the primary race: should the country focus on immediate, short-term results or broad, structural change?</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden pledged to choose a woman as his running mate. </strong>Sanders would not explicitly commit to selecting a woman running mate but said, \u201cIn all likelihood, I will.\u201d Biden\u2019s pledge could help to reassure Democrats who are disappointed that the party\u2019s historically diverse field has narrowed down to two white men in their late 70\u2019s.</li> \n   <li><strong>Biden avoided a complete debacle, which Sanders needed to change the direction of the race. </strong>Biden did stumble at times, but considering his significant delegate lead, Sanders needed his opponent to have a terrible night if he wanted any chance at turning the tide of the race. Biden managed to avoid that catastrophe.</li> \n   <li><strong>The debate was surprisingly combative considering the current crisis. </strong>Many commentators had predicted the night would be relatively tame as the candidates focused on the health crisis gripping the country. However, Sanders went after Biden for his refusal to disavow super PACs and his past comments on Social Security, and Biden returned the favor by criticizing Sanders for his record on gun control and his recent praise of <strong>Fidel Castro.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Tonight made the case for holding debates without live audiences. </strong>The debate was conducted without a live audience or a media spinroom because of coronavirus, and a number of commentators said it was a welcome change from past debates. It\u2019s possible the practice could be replicated with general election debates.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thanks for following our live debate coverage tonight, and our US politics live blog will return tomorrow morning.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">Biden and Sanders confront coronavirus crisis in first one-on-one debate</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6eeee88f088d7575593f95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T03:16:07.689Z\">3.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anita Dunn, </strong>a senior adviser to <strong>Joe Biden, </strong>compared <strong>Bernie Sanders </strong>to the average protester who shows up at Biden\u2019s events in a post-debate call with reporters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KThomasDC/status/1239386937741508610\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Biden sr. adv.

  "<h2>Jessa Crispin: \u2018Sanders was too gentle on Biden\u2019</h2> <p>Throughout this primary, I\u2019ve heard supporters of other candidates complain about Bernie Sanders\u2019 tendency to raise his voice. Where the hell was that yelling Bernie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">on Sunday night</a>? His tendency to try to keep an undignified process dignified and his discomfort with going for Joe Biden\u2019s throat were on clear display. If Biden wins the nomination, he\u2019s going to have to debate the least classy man ever to appear in World Wrestling Entertainment. Bernie would have been doing us \u2013 and frankly, Joe as well \u2013 a favor by channeling <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/stone-cold-steve-austin-gives-a-nsfw-defense-of-gay-m-1566573678\">gay rights king</a> Stone Cold Steve Austin and pinning Biden on issues like how the 2008 bank bailout was disastrous for homeowners, or how his warmongering has stuck us in an endless war, or how the Violence Against Women Act that he loves to brag about <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-violence-against-women-act-is-unlikely-to-reduce-intimate-partner-violence-heres-why-103734\">did basically nothing</a> to prevent violence in relationships.</p> <p>For a while, I felt like I was watching a Beckett play, with two old men on stage talking about totally different realities, talking past one another as if they did not even exist within the same space and time. Here was Bernie Sanders, acknowledging how our flawed and deteriorated health system could enable coronavirus to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. And here was Biden, convinced he was in Independence Day, saying the coronavirus \u201cis like we\u2019re being attacked from abroad\u201d \u2013 although a bunch of people getting sick because the government is too timid to ask people not to go to <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/3/14/21179885/st-patricks-day-chicago-coronavirus\">a goddamn St Patrick\u2019s Day bar crawl</a> is not exactly an alien invasion. He talked about sending the military in to deal with it, as if it were a foreign country of brown people, with oil reserves.</p> <p>Once again the moderators may as well not have existed. Jake Tapper, looking weirdly waxy and like his makeup person had dumped a bottle of 1985 Cover Girl foundation on his face and smeared it around a little, couldn\u2019t even be bothered to step in when a squabble arose about whether or not Biden had made statements about cutting social security on the floor of the Senate. He was just sitting there! Couldn\u2019t he have pulled out his phone and gone \u201cto the YouTube\u201d, as Sanders implored, to factcheck that one?</p> <p>The division between Sanders and Biden is clearer than ever. Sanders wants lasting change, Biden wants to respond to everything as if it were a \u201ccrisis\u201d and keep things pretty much the same. But Sanders wasted the opportunity tonight to take his opponent out, and Biden managed to get through an entire conversation without glitching and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/03/13/media_attempts_to_spin_bidens_tirade_into_a_triumph.html\">threatening to punch someone</a> in the face.

Unless the government immediately begins providing a universal basic income and places a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, vehicle repossessions and utility disconnects, we will not be able to flatten the pandemic curve and save potentially millions of lives.

We are facing down a pandemic that could kill more than a million Americans. A great many of us are self-isolating at home, made even more anxious by the fact that our current government has totally botched the coronavirus response, putting us all at tremendous and unnecessary risk. We don\u2019t have the most basic faith that, despite living in one of the most prosperous societies in the history of the world, our leaders will keep us safe.

Joe Biden is the frontrunner and he squandered an opportunity to act like it. Bernie Sanders has a newly resonant moral authority as someone long pushing for all of the policies that would patch up the holes in the American safety net \u2013 holes that have become glaringly, terrifyingly apparent as we face down this new pandemic. Biden could have acted like the gracious and venerable leader he tells us he would be.

  "<p>This is no time for presidential debates and wild promises from the candidates. It\u2019s also no time for presidential tweets and wild promises from the incumbent.</p> <p>The split screen of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest\">Sunday\u2019s debate</a> was not between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders; it was between the cold hard reality of a global pandemic and the cold dead arguments about negative TV ads.</p> <p>There is only one issue in front of American voters, and it is the reason they are emptying supermarket shelves and wondering how they will pay their bills this month and next.</p> <p>That issue is not about past votes in the Senate, who supported the war in Iraq, or how to unite the Democratic party. It\u2019s about how to survive the health and financial disaster that lies ahead.</p> <p>On that issue, Biden and Sanders were even further apart than their socially distanced podiums on CNN\u2019s debate set.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to the pandemic was a glimpse into what Obama\u2019s staffers called the shit sandwich they were handed by their predecessors: notably the financial collapse and great recession of 2009. Not to mention the swine flu pandemic and the Ebola crisis.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 reaction was a critique of the system, a big picture view of the structural reforms needed for long-term change: from campaign finance reform to a nationalized healthcare system.</p> <p>Biden spoke like a man who had worked in the Situation Room to marshal the forces of the federal government. Sanders spoke like a man who wanted to build a new federal government.</p> <p>\u201cThis is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people,\u201d said the former vice-president. That meant widespread testing, deploying the military to set up hundreds of temporary hospital beds, and rapid economic support for the whole country.</p> <p>For his part, Sanders sounded less interested in waging war on the coronavirus, and more determined to wage war on the political system.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear this crisis is only making a bad situation worse,\u201d said the Vermont senator. \u201cIn a good year, without the epidemic, we\u2019re losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don\u2019t get to a doctor on time.\u201d</p> <p>This was a strangely obtuse debate between two disputatious old men. Quite apart from the urgent need to talk about the pandemic, their own argument has already been resolved by the voters who gave Joe Biden a wide delegate lead over the last few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cAs much as we can, we hope this will be a conversation between the two of you,\u201d said CNN\u2019s moderator, Jake Tapper, as he kicked off the debate.</p> <p>If they were genuine, CNN\u2019s hopes were dashed within minutes.</p> <p>Biden knew that Sanders would turn the coronavirus conversation towards his favorite topic of a socialized healthcare system known as Medicare for All. So Biden pointed out early and often that Italy\u2019s socialized system had not stopped the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWith all due respect to Medicare for All, you have a single-payer system in Italy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for All.

And it counts for even less when Biden has all but won the nomination already.</p> <p>Sanders tried to make the case that Biden was propped up by big money and the party establishment. \u201cYou need to take on Wall Street. You need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t take campaign contributions from them. You take them on and create an economy that works for all.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s response amounted to turning his pockets inside out. \u201cBernie\u2019s implication is somehow I am being funded by millionaires,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last Super Tuesday and before that, Bernie outspent me two, three, four, five, six-to-one. I didn\u2019t have any money, and I still won.\u201d</p> <p>To be clear: both the surviving Democratic candidates sounded more pandemically plausible than a president who was still tweeting yesterday about Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239204333851488266\">emails</a>, his former national security adviser (who pleaded <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239242219019735042\">guilty</a> to lying to the FBI), and the Senate Democratic leader\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239237382458806277\">comments</a> about the US supreme court.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost as if Donald Trump spends his days trying to distract the nation from the fact that he is fundamentally useless at his job.</p> <p>In the meantime, both the septuagenarian candidates face a more pressing challenge: keeping clear of the virus that appears to be most life-threatening to people of their own age group.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very careful about the people I\u2019m interacting with,\u201d Sanders said, ignoring the question about his recent heart attack. \u201cI\u2019m using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell fortunately I don\u2019t have any of the underlying conditions you talked about and have to worry about,\u201d observed Biden, swiping at his slightly older rival, while also saying he was washing his hands all day.</p> <p>It was that kind of night: a desperately personal debate about all the small stuff we used to care about, and a desperately small debate about all the personal stuff we currently obsess about.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders auditioned in real time for the job of president on Sunday night during the first one-on-one debate of the Democratic primary, as the world confronts the growing threat of the coronavirus pandemic and American public health officials warned the worst is yet to come.</p> \n<p>The fast-escalating national emergency dominated the prime-time encounter between two candidates with starkly different visions for the country. Yet Biden and Sanders vigorously agreed on the need for a much more aggressive government response to the virus, which had already <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">resulted in</a> 3,244 confirmed cases in the US, with 62 reported deaths, as of Sunday night.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is bigger than any one of us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis calls for a national rallying for one another.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden, who has presented himself as a pragmatic standard-bearer, compared the battle against the disease to a war, calling for a whole-of-government strategy that includes deploying the the military and enacting a \u201cmulti-multi-billion-dollar program<em>\u201d </em>to address the public health and economic crises.</p> \n<p>Sanders, a democratic socialist, urged sweeping economic reforms and the creation of a single-payer healthcare system. He said the pandemic had revealed \u201cthe dysfunctionality\u201d of the country\u2019s patchwork healthcare system, arguing that the adoption of a Medicare for All-style system like the one he has championed would help mitigate the toll of future pandemics.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the reasons that we are unprepared, and have been unprepared, is we don\u2019t have a system,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people in a good year, without the epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Biden said a single-payer healthcare system was not the solution, pointing to Italy, where the outbreak has overwhelmed the country\u2019s national health services.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are looking for results, not a revolution,\u201d Biden said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a381fa53-24c1-46a8-a648-7710acb74a3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K30TgRppDzg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Where there was consensus was in their denunciation of Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak and his ability to lead the nation through a time of crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, the first thing we have got to do, whether or not I\u2019m president, is to shut this president up right now,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the debate, which Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239383648018804739\">deemed</a> \u201cVERY boring\u201d, his campaign operation accused the candidates of \u201cplagiarizing\u201d the president\u2019s response to coronavirus, which it described as \u201ca model for all future pandemics\u201d.</p> \n<p>At a press conference from the White House on Sunday afternoon, Trump urged Americans to \u201crelax\u201d and refrain from hoarding food.

In a sharp reversal of fortunes, Biden stepped on to the debate stage on Sunday night as the frontrunner while Sanders fought for the future of his candidacy, just days ahead of four more primary votes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-vermont-senator-socialist-democratic-party\">How Bernie Sanders went from frontrunner to the last-chance saloon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After rebounding in remarkable fashion, Biden now leads Sanders by roughly 150 delegates following a second consecutive week of commanding primary victories.

In a statement, Sanders said the plan did not go far enough.</p> \n<p>The candidates sought to strike a delicate balance between debating the issues and addressing the urgent health crisis.

The candidates said they were taking extra precautions to protect themselves from becoming infected, emphasizing that they were in good health and had not displayed any of the known symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not shaking hands,\u201d Sanders said, noting that he held a \u201cfireside chat\u201d from his home in Burlington on Sunday instead of a rally.</p> \n<p>Biden added: \u201cI wash my hands God knows how many times a day.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If the battle cry of our government\u2019s response to the global financial crisis was \u201cgo early, go hard, go households\u201d, this government\u2019s approach to the current crisis seems to be \u201cgo late, go half-measures, and go ... well ... go to Hillsong\u201d.</p> <p>For a decade we have been accused of having gone too far in our efforts to avoid the GFC. When we look back on the decisions taken over the last month, they will be seen (as with the bushfires) as the mark of a complacent and negligent government.</p> <p>No two crises are the same. The crisis of 2008-09 began within the American financial system. A financial collapse became an economic collapse and then mass unemployment.</p> <p>Then followed a political crisis as governments around the world went into deficit and debt to save their economies, exposing themselves to attack for \u201cwasting money\u201d as they sought to deal with a problem not of their making. The current crisis obviously has radically different origins.</p> <p>It began as a public health crisis in China where an appalling failure to contain the coronavirus in December allowed its spread across the country, grinding its national economy to a halt before extending the contagion and its economic impact to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Policy makers around the world now have to deal with a crisis at three levels: first, containing Covid-19 so it spreads along the flattest curve possible to enable our health system to cope until we have a vaccine; second, preventing recession, cashflow-induced business collapse and large-scale unemployment; third to ensure that national actions are coordinated with global actions to ensure that one doesn\u2019t undermine the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/rudd-mark-ii-what-experts-say-about-australian-governments-176bn-stimulus-package\">'Rudd mark II': what experts say about Australian government's $17.6bn stimulus package</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/coronavirus-nationalist-response-fails-by-kevin-rudd-2020-03\">I wrote that China\u2019s January and February would become the rest of the world\u2019s March and April</a> based on the simple mathematical probability of the virus\u2019s spread elsewhere.</p> <p>Indeed, the danger is, in the absence of hard measures in the rest of the world, the public health and economic impact will extend much longer. I also specifically warned back then of Australian complacency.</p> <p>On public health, the government\u2019s public information campaign on personal hygiene, social separation and community events (the biggest determinants of the \u201ccontagion curve\u201d and the coping ability of the health system) has been several weeks too slow.</p> <p>Its messaging has also been contradictory on basic things like handshaking and public events. So much so that the public could be forgiven for concluding, based on the official commentary alone, that the virus would not be a big deal for Australia.</p> <p>Then it all changed late last week. Lax border controls were suddenly tightened over the weekend once New Zealand acted. A public advertising campaign suddenly appeared. Yet the chief medical officer has told us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-australian-stocks-of-covid-19-testing-kits-rapidly-deteriorating-says-chief-medical-officer\">we are running out of testing kits</a>. On none of these measures have we been leading the world.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been lagging the world. The effectiveness of public health measures is fundamental to any rational discussion on the economic policies needed to avoid recession. Fear of the virus is undermining business and consumer confidence. And the uncomfortable truth is fear will only be removed once there is public confidence in our ability to manage, contain and eventually eliminate it.</p> <p>In the meantime, the central economic task is to ensure that firms with normally sound business operations are protected.</p> <p>This is not a gift to business. It\u2019s essential to employment. Large corporations in the travel, tourism, hospitality and education sectors have seen a near collapse in trading conditions. Most SMEs have limited financial reserves.</p> <p>If cashflow dries up, unless the banks extend credit perfectly good businesses will collapse and unemployment will skyrocket. This in turn will compound the demand-side pressures already emerging from imploding consumer confidence.</p> <p>Quite apart from other specific supply-side problems arising for various retailers from interrupted global supply chains. But of all these, the credit crisis for firms looms largest of all.</p> <p>Against this analysis, what to make of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/australian-government-unveils-176bn-stimulus-package-as-coronavirus-hammers-stock-market\">the government\u2019s stimulus package</a>? Like their response to the public health challenge: too little, too late.</p> <p>The total package is less than 1% of GDP. That\u2019s unlikely to be sufficient to avoid recession given that China will have negative growth for the first quarter and will not return to normal growth by the second. Japan is already in recession. Korea is heading that way. The same for both Europe and the US. Put all that together, it starts to look like the quantum of contraction we faced in 2008-09.</p> <p>We avoided recession by the skin of our teeth with a total stimulus strategy worth 5% of GDP spread over two years. Apart from the quantum, the key policy question remains how to keep firms solvent during this crisis and this may provide a creative alternative to pure stimulus.</p> <p>Both Germany and China have been seized on this. China has directed its banks to provide \u201ccredit forbearance\u201d for six months to businesses directly impacted by the crisis \u2013 underpinned by central bank loans to the rest of the banking system.</p> <p>Whether this will apply universally to all distressed firms is unclear. Germany has deployed what it describes as its \u201cbig bazooka\u201d by directing its state-owned KfW bank to provide credit to distressed firms \u201cwith no upper limit on the amount of loans that KfW can issue\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/the-government-response-to-the-bushfire-crisis-has-been-evasive-tepid-tone-deaf-and-above-all-too-late\">The government response to the bushfire crisis has been evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and above all, too late | Kevin Rudd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Australia\u2019s case, while the government\u2019s announced grant of up to $25,000 for SMEs is helpful, it won\u2019t be sufficient to keep businesses afloat.

This leads to the third essential element of the government\u2019s response: the future stability of the financial system itself.</p> <p>Recent decisions by the Australian Office of Financial Management to open its \u201crepo window\u201d to Australian institutions following the dumping of Australian bonds by hedge funds is necessary.</p> <p>A ban on short-selling should be instituted as we did in 2008. It will be critical to respond rapidly to any signs of emerging illiquidity in US financial markets and/or their retreat from foreign exposure.

On Twitter, the theatre announced \u201cwe do not believe that it is practical or responsible for us to stage shows while people\u2019s lives are at risk\u201d. The Arcola explained that the majority of its income comes from theatregoers and called for donations to ensure that it \u201cstays thriving, long after this crisis is past\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The Turbine theatre, which opened at Battersea Power Station last summer, has cancelled all performances until 18 April. The Bunker, which is housed in a former underground car park in London Bridge, has cancelled a week of performances which featured almost 100 artists and was due to start on Monday. \u201cThis is not a decision taken lightly,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have spent months organising this week; at the last count we had 94 people involved in our week and to have to cancel the day before we begin is soul destroying. But we have to put our artists\u2019 safety first.\u201d</p> \n  <p>On Saturday, the Young Vic cancelled two performances of Nora: A Doll\u2019s House due to a member of the company self-isolating as a precaution.

There could also be a shift to household isolation rather than individual self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, a new-born baby in England who has tested positive for coronavirus is likely to be one of the world\u2019s youngest patients with the disease. The infant and its mother both tested positive at a north London hospital and staff who had contact with them have been advised to self-isolate.</p> \n  <p>The developments come as the UK\u2019s approach to developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d against Covid-19 has been called into question.</p> \n  <p>But Hancock denied that achieving herd immunity was part of the government\u2019s policy.
