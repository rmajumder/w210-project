The total number of infections in Herat is 3,621 with 64 deaths.</p> \n  <p>In the capital, Kabul, 161 new cases have been recorded. In the remote province of Kunar, five patients tested all returned positive results, as seven patients died of Covid-19 overnight. In Helmand, two patients tested in the last 24 hours both were positive and the province recorded its first death.</p> \n  <p> Meanwhile, amid continuing conflict, at least 20 Afghan security forces personnel were killed in two incidents in the last 24 hours.

confirmed infections.</p> \n  <p>The health ministry reported 9,887 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total to 236,657.</p> \n  <p>Most of the new cases are in rural areas following the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who left cities and towns after the lockdown in late March.</p> \n  <p>The lockdown is now largely being enforced in high-risk areas while authorities have partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. </p> \n  <p>Shopping malls and religious places are due to open on Monday with restrictions to avoid large gatherings.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T05:11:33.182Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

  "<p>It must have been a strange last four years for the workers at Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory, as they went about their business of making cars while at the same time being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/08/sunderland-how-labour-city-became-one-of-the-uks-most-eurosceptic\" title=\"\">caught in a symbolic tug of war</a> between a divided Brexit nation.</p> <p>When things are going well for the plant, it apparently shows that Global Britain is surging ahead of rivals; when the wind turns, it is a symbol of the UK\u2019s industrial decline, with government having to go <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/government-letter-to-nissan-reveals-brexit-promise-to-carmarkers\" title=\"\">chequebook in hand</a> to bureaucrats in Japan to keep it afloat.</p> <p>Workers will return to the plant on Monday, with a phased restart as it gradually raises its output from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/29/british-car-industry-produced-just-197-cars-last-month\" title=\"\">zero cars produced in April and May</a> towards the 28,000 monthly total achieved on average in 2019.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s largest single car factory has the potential to build 600,000 cars a year, but it last broke the 500,000 mark in 2016. Even if carmaking restarts quickly, production for 2020 will surely be the lowest in years. What happens beyond that is an open question, as a result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/nissan-sunderland-plant-at-risk-if-uk-leaves-eu-without-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">comments last week</a> from Nissan\u2019s chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta.</p> <p>\u201cYou know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe are committed.\u201d</p> <p>Two sentences; two inaccuracies. First, Nissan made 346,871 cars in the UK in 2019, against Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s 385,197 (although the latter were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/04/brexit-what-are-carmaker-contingency-plans\" title=\"\">produced at various locations</a>). The second caveat was rather more important: the carmaker is committed, but only up to a point.</p> <p>\u201cHaving said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it\u2019s not our intention, but the business will not be sustainable,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody has to understand.\u201d</p> <p>Standard World Trade Organization tariffs would add 10% to the cost of exports to countries with which the UK does not have a trade deal. For companies used to shaving off fractions of a percentage point in efficiencies, the prospect of carrying on as before in such circumstances is as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/03/uk-motor-industry-backs-uk-remaining-in-europe-survey-eu-positive-impacy\" title=\"\">absurd now as it was before the referendum</a>.</p> <p>The exasperation of car executives at still having to deal with Brexit on top of everything else is almost palpable \u2013 particularly at Nissan, which has already said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/nissan-sunderland-factory-safe-but-plant-in-barcelona-will-close-coronavirus\" title=\"\">will be shedding 2,800 workers in Barcelona</a> as part of a deep restructuring in favour of the UK plant.</p> <p>Sunderland is one of 35 Nissan plants worldwide, according to industry data company Marklines, even when those operated by its alliance partners, Renault and Mitsubishi, are not included. It has survived one crisis so far; a second might be tempting fate.</p> <p>As Adrian Hallmark, chief executive of luxury carmaker Bentley, put it last week after announcing 1,000 job cuts, a no-deal Brexit would add another human-made disaster on top of the virus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/car-dealer-lookers-cuts-1500-jobs-and-closes-12-showrooms\" title=\"\">Thousands of redundancies at Aston Martin, McLaren</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/29/renault-to-cut-14600-jobs-as-part-of-2bn-cost-saving-plan-covid-19\" title=\"\">Renault</a> and parts manufacturer ZF are testament to the difficulties facing the entire global car industry. \u201cMy message to politicians is this: please don\u2019t push us off a second cliff,\u201d Hallmark told the <em>Financial Times</em>.</p> <p>So where does this leave Sunderland? A symbol of Great British quality or of Britannia\u2019s declining fortunes? The truth is, as in most cases, somewhere in between. Britain\u2019s largest car plant is a genuine exemplar of car-a-minute efficiency, and Nissan does not want to let it go. At the same time, the pandemic has shown how everything can change for the worse overnight \u2013 whether because of politics or otherwise.</p>",
  "<p>The Rugby Football Union is to lobby the government to reduce its physical distancing rule from two metres to one, calculating that the current stipulation would cost it \u00a312m if crowds were allowed back for the four November internationals at Twickenham.</p> <p>Britain is one of the few countries \u2013 Spain and Ireland are others \u2013 to insist on two metres as part of the measures of stop the spread of Covid-19, but the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, reckons it would reduce the capacity at Twickenham to less than 10,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/premiership-rugby-to-resume-season-on-15-august\">Premiership Rugby sets provisional date of 15 August to resume season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you are using two metres, you are talking about a four-metre distanced safe space,\u201d he said. \u201cWith one, it is one metre all round which has the effect of increasing capacity fourfold. If you use two metres in an 80,000-seater stadium and factor in traffic flow, such as someone wanting to use the toilet without going past someone and touching them, it reduces your capacity to between 9,000 and 9,500.</p> <p>\u201cI was surprised, not thinking it would be that low. With one metre, which is the World Health Organization\u2019s guidance, you get close to 40,000, and we would like it to come down to that by the autumn. We would not increase the stadium capacity at the risk of safety, nor do anything contrary to government guidelines, but we want clarity on whether the two-metre rule is absolutely essential or is one metre possible.\u201d</p> <p>England are scheduled to play New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Australia. Asked what the difference would be in financial terms, Sweeney replied: \u201cIt depends on who you have coming and ticket pricing. It is probably worth in the region of \u00a33m a game and I believe we would be able to open catering facilities, as long as they were out of doors.\u201d</p> <p>It is a time when even the richest governing body in the world needs every pound it can harvest once rugby resumes. The financial stress felt by every union and professional club throughout the game has focused efforts on organising a global calendar to align the seasons in the north and south and remove overlaps between Test and club rugby.</p> <p>More progress has been made in the past two months than in the previous 20 years and a working group, which includes Sweeney among its six officials, has produced plans that could mean change coming as early as next season, including one that would shift the Six Nations to March and April and played at the same time as the Rugby Championship, with the professional leagues in Europe starting in January.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing of the Six Nations is part of the conversation around the global calendar,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cIf agreement can be reached as part of finishing off the 2019-20 season and then moving into the new campaign and it was the one landed on by everybody, it would be possible. It has to be tailored to the needs of each individual union.\u201d</p> <p>It would mean professional rugby in Europe would be played through the summer months, with players resting in December, denying clubs Christmas takings. It would also mean the Lions tour to South Africa next year moving from July and August to October, leaving 19,000 supporters who have paid deposits for the trip having to rearrange holidays.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/04/breakdown-rising-through-crisis-will-always-be-englands-rugby-ritual\">The Breakdown | Then and now: rising through crisis will always be England's rugby ritual</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt is a massive factor,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cThe sales for the tour have been the most robust ever, but you cannot have a conversation about the global calendar and not include the Lions. Next year\u2019s tour has been looked at, along with the one in 2025, but it would be a logistical challenge with so many fans having committed themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney expressed surprise Premiership Rugby had not inquired whether Twickenham would be available when the league season resumes in August and one or two grounds are used to stage the matches, saying it would be available, but the eight clubs who have offered their stadiums have done so on the basis there will be no fee involved.</p> <p>He also revealed the RFU had a contingency plan should a second wave of the coronavirus lead to another lockdown. \u201cWe do not refer to it too often,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be tremendous damage for all of us; we would all be in a different world and it would not be very pleasant.

By 2024, it will be too late to undo much of the damage. A movement of resistance against the onslaught on jobs and public services, on migrants and many basic rights and protections, will have to be urgently built. In the Jeremy Corbyn years, social movements and industrial action tailed off. The left will now have to take its demoralised activist base from cheering on the old Labour leadership to organising protests against NHS privatisation, strikes against a new wave of cuts, rent strikes and direct action in a matter of months.

On one hand is his instinct to be cautious, and his respectability offensive aimed at winning over middle-ground voters. On the other, his promise to stay true to the radical policies of the Corbyn period, to inspire voters and to be in tune with the grassroots of the party. If he opts for an approach anything like that of Ed Miliband, who infamously refused to back strikes during the anti-austerity movement of 2011, his credibility and popularity will be shattered.</p> <p>To navigate the coming storm, the left will have to be bold, but so too will the Labour leadership. Starmer must situate Labour as the centre of a wider movement against the new austerity and the Tories\u2019 Brexit plans and he must go on the offensive. As Starmer himself has argued, there was never anything to be gained by Labour giving ground to rightwing narratives about immigration. And there is no public support for cuts or for economic deregulation.

At the base, the fattest part, are the people who will vaccinate. Then there are increasingly smaller, but increasingly resistant layers. There are the \u201ccautious acceptors\u201d. Then there are the \u201chesitant acceptors\u201d, followed by the \u201cselective vaccinators\u201d who might accept certain vaccines but will reject others. At the sharp peak of the pyramid are the decliners, those who won\u2019t vaccinate.

  "<p>The outrage that has gripped many nations in the wake of the death of George Floyd is likely to have been fuelled by resentment over Covid-19\u2019s extreme impact on black communities, one of the world\u2019s top health experts warned on Saturday.</p> <p>David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College London, said the disease was now having a disproportionately severe impact on the most disadvantaged sections of those nations that had been the slowest to tackle the pandemic and who now have the worst infection rates.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the anger now being expressed among people of colour may be traced to the fact they have actually had to carry the brunt of this,\u201d said Nabarro, who is also an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nabarro said the problems posed by the coronavirus had been exacerbated by heads of state who had initially presented the disease as a mild threat. The US was a clear example of a country that had failed to react quickly to the appearance of the disease. Other western nations were also at fault, he added.</p> <p>As a result, the virus spread quickly to communities whose members could least protect themselves from infection. \u201cCommunities of black and poor people have been exposed to excess risk because it is much harder for them to take sick leave or to protect themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are bearing the brunt of this disease.</p> <p>\u201cMany countries did respond quickly to protect citizens from Covid. But in other countries, heads of state made light of the threat. That is why the United States and some other western countries face a much bigger challenge compared with those that acted with speed.\u201d</p> <p>The crucial point is that black people and poor people in these countries have had to continue working throughout the pandemic, triggering resentment that may have helped fuel the current racial protests that have swept many nations, he suggested. \u201cAll this is happening at a time when there is a heightened sense of injustice among people of colour,\u201d said Nabarro.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/05/lack-of-response-to-bame-covid-19-toll-risks-fuelling-tensions-say-mps\">Lack of response to BAME Covid-19 toll risks fuelling tensions, say MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn Kansas, black people are dying at seven times the rate of white people while in Washington and New York their death rate is three times the rate for white people. This virus is deeply ingrained in society and is touching more people of colour.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Similarly in the UK, it has been revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">black and Asian ethnic groups are up to twice as likely to die</a> from Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>An illustration of the differing national responses to the impact of Covid is provided by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/meat-plant-workers-us-coronavirus-war\"> meat-processing workers</a> who work side by side in cramped conditions and who have suffered major outbreaks of the disease, said Nabarro. When this danger was revealed, Germany swiftly introduced measures to protect workers. By contrast Donald Trump simply ordered meat plant workers to keep going to work despite the fact that many were dying of Covid-19 and spreading the virus to their families.</p> <p>\u201cThis crisis should not be about the visibility and the positioning of our leaders,\u201d said Nabarro. \u201cWe need a mindset change. This virus is going to be with us for the foreseeable future and we are going to have to recognise that those with the least power and resources are the ones who needed the greatest support.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street has been accused of reopening the door to imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef, after a leaked memo instructed ministers to have \u201cno specific policy\u201d on animal welfare in US trade talks.</p> <p>The letter from No 10 states that the ministerial mandate for the US negotiations was \u201cbeing updated to reflect\u201d the fact that the UK was to have no policy position on animal welfare.

It reveals serious cabinet unrest over the shape of a US deal and appears to suggest UK regulations could be changed to accommodate an agreement. It also makes clear that talks were to be used to \u201cmaximise leverage\u201d in trade negotiations with the EU.</p> <p>\u201cConsultation and agreement from relevant colleagues is sought before agreeing to change domestic policy or regulations as part of the negotiations,\u201d it states. \u201cIn the context of preserving the integrity of UK domestic law, any decisions taken in sensitive areas \u2026 must take into account the potential legal implications for the UK and be agreed by the relevant ministers.\u201d</p> <p>The memo reveals how contentious the US trade talks are regarded as being within the cabinet. Issues were raised by 11 cabinet ministers, including health secretary Matt Hancock, environment secretary George Eustice and Mark Spencer, the chief whip.</p> <p>\u201cWritten responses were received from the health secretary, foreign secretary, the chief whip, the business secretary, the environment secretary, the chancellor of the exchequer, the justice secretary, the defence secretary, the culture secretary, the Welsh secretary and the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,\u201d it states. \u201cAll other members of the committee were content.\u201d</p> <p>The briefing also states that a cabinet committee would return to the animal welfare issue \u201cin June to settle all outstanding agriculture issues\u201d, suggesting an unresolved split. Meanwhile, it demands that \u201cministers receive regular progress reports of concurrent EU and US negotiations to help maximise leverage and allow policy tensions to be resolved as they emerge\u201d.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said that it had been \u201cvery clear since the outset that we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d.</p> <p>Campaigners want legal guarantees on those standards to be enshrined in an agriculture bill currently being debated in parliament. The issue has already prompted a Tory rebellion in the Commons.</p> <p>It comes after reports last week that the government was proposing a \u201cdual scheme\u201d that would see higher tariffs on US foods with lower animal welfare standards. It is not clear whether higher tariffs would also be linked to environmental standards.</p> <p>Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson, said: \u201cPeople can now see that promises made by Johnson and Gove were worthless.\u201d</p> <p>Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: \u201cIt is unacceptable for the government to allow our high food standards to be compromised and our farmers undercut in any future trade deals. Attempts by ministers to use tariffs and tax rates to get around their manifesto commitment on food standards won\u2019t wash.\u201d</p> <p>Nick von Westenholz, director of EU exit and international trade for the National Farmers Union, said: \u201cThe government made a manifesto commitment not to compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards in trade negotiations, and this commitment is explicitly stated in the government\u2019s specific objectives for the US negotiations. We would expect UK trade negotiators to be rigorous in upholding these commitments.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cWe will always stand up for British farming and are determined to use trade negotiations to secure new opportunities for farmers.</p> <p>\u201cHaving left the EU, we will get to decide how we set and maintain our own laws, standards and regulations, upholding our food, environmental and animal welfare standards. Our food regulators will continue to provide independent advice to ensure that all food imports into the UK comply with those standards.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Has the Madeleine McCann case finally been solved? Maybe. Maybe not.

All these years on, do people think this is an original thought or, more pertinently, that the McCanns don\u2019t regret that decision with every fibre of their being? What possible justification, bar sanctimony and gossip, is there for kicking that tender bruise?</p> <p>However, this has been the tone throughout. People declaring they were \u201cpositive\u201d that the McCanns murdered their daughter (and disposed of the body, while scrutinised by police and global media?); others deciding the couple were \u201cmoney-hungry\u201d/\u201dpublicity-grabbers\u201d, which makes no sense. To keep looking for Madeleine, the McCanns needed as much publicity and funding as possible. In the end, they received endless exposure and millions of pounds \u2013 considerably more than most cases get. Would you, as a desperate parent, have turned it down?</p> <p>This case has been about a lot of things \u2013 our obsessive reappraisal of childhood and ranking of ourselves (and others) as \u201cgood\u201d/\u201cbad\u201d parents. The rebranding of \u201ctrue crime\u201d (including child murder) from documentary to family-friendly entertainment. But it\u2019s also been about class. Some thought the McCanns were supported and defended because they were middle class, but it seems equally true that it has been used against them.&nbsp;</p> <p>How many times were they denounced as \u201ccold\u201d, \u201cstiff\u2019, \u201cunnatural\u201d? Never mind that both parents had modest backgrounds and worked hard to become medics. Or that they were clearly private and reserved by nature. The script required them to be aloof, uptight, emotionless \u2013 every outdated caricature of the middle class \u2013 so that indeed was that.</p> <p>I\u2019m not arguing that the McCanns are living saints, because that would just dehumanise them further. I\u2019m also aware that, here I am, a member of the media, discussing this \u201chot topic\u201d yet again. Still, as it looks as though there could possibly be some kind of closure for the McCanns, it\u2019s time to look at ourselves too. The entire world wants to know what happened to Madeleine McCann, but that\u2019s no excuse for a 13-year grubby, toxic pile-on.</p> <h2>Raab\u2019s inaction is disgraceful and endangers many Britons</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dfe7cc6ce0ecd148b4c6cfb1b6f9a918d3f5237\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dfe7cc6ce0ecd148b4c6cfb1b6f9a918d3f5237/0_124_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He seems to be quite the bully when he wants to be, but submissive and weak\u2026 again, when he wants to be.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exactly how toothless is the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, when it really matters for British citizens? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jun/05/zaghari-ratcliffe-endures-further-wait-for-iranian-decision-on-release\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a>, the British-Iranian womanimprisoned in Iran since 2016, is to continue her furlough from prison.

However, it concluded the sending of disciplinary letters to a staff member in one particular, separate case had resulted in the creation of a \u201chostile and offensive environment\u201d, a finding Moreira rejects.</p> <p>TI\u2019s own ethics panel also conceded that there were problems with the way Moreira ran the secretariat, TI\u2019s global coordinating arm which operates separately from its national chapters, including Transparency International UK.</p> <p>It called for the secretariat to introduce a new integrity system and acknowledged there had been \u201can urgent need for more communication, transparency and professionalism\u201d within the organisation.</p> <p>But now, in a highly embarrassing move, Moreira has accused the leading NGO of flouting its commitment to transparency by failing to conduct a sufficiently wide investigation into problems within the organisation.</p> <p>In response, TI said it \u201chas no further comments on the investigation at this time\u201d.</p> <p>Trouble began after Moreira became managing director in October 2017, with a mandate to restructure TI\u2019s secretariat. Her efforts were met with claims that she promoted a culture that enabled bullying and silenced critical voices.</p> <p>After the allegations surfaced in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/21/transparency-international-staff-complain-of-bullying-harassment\"> the media</a>, the TI board appointed the law firm Taylor Wessing to investigate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75c3fe0c2b35bc83c1039eb626756dd0abe1e412\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75c3fe0c2b35bc83c1039eb626756dd0abe1e412/0_248_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Web homepage of NGO Transparency International.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Web homepage of Transparency International.

The [ethics] panel will report to TI\u2019s annual membership meeting, to whom the board is accountable. At this time, TI is unable to comment further on the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>The board dismissed Moreira in February as relations between both sides deteriorated.</p> <p>A friend said: \u201cShe feels extremely angry, not just at the way she and her staff have been treated but at the hypocrisy TI is displaying as an organisation committed to accountability and fair trial.</p> <p>\u201cTI tried to persuade Patricia to take a payoff in exchange for dropping her formal complaint against the board. She refused, and walked away from negotiations. She plans to sue TI for unfair dismissal, and wants to see her bullying complaints properly investigated by an independent party.\u201d</p> <p>TI said: \u201cPatricia Moreira\u2019s position as managing director ended following intensive discussions with the board of directors on the operating structures of the TI secretariat, during which it turned out that the two parties had different visions for the effective management of the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>The Taylor Wessing report found that many of TI\u2019s staff \u201cperceived a lack of transparency\u201d within the secretariat when it was being run by Moreira. It said they \u201cfelt excluded from decision-making processes, or felt unsafe in reporting lines and that their complaints have not been dealt with by senior management\u201d.</p> <p>Moreira insists there is no evidence for the claims which she says were never put to her.</p> <p>In internal correspondence seen by the <em>Observer</em>, Moreira insists that the secretariat\u2019s management problems existed before she took over and claims that she was the \u201cperson most persistently engaged in trying to free the organisation of its toxic culture\u201d.</p> <p>TI said it had been working hard to address the problems identified in the reports and had implemented the new integrity initiative.</p> <p>However, the row could damage the Berlin-based organisation\u2019s hopes of securing further funding from the Department for International Development, which has given it almost \u00a35m since 2017.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/11/oxfam-abuse-claims-haiti-charity-commission-report\">Oxfam sexual exploitation scandal</a> in 2018, DfID wrote to civil society groups explaining \u201cit is crucial that any organisation in receipt of DfID funds should ensure not only that they have safeguards in place which prevent exploitation but also the systems and the organisational culture needed to deal with and report incidents when they do occur\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>From champion of austerity to Europe\u2019s biggest spender \u2013 Germany has travelled a long way in just a few months. The notoriously frugal ministry of finance has agreed to spend \u20ac130bn \u2013 a sum equal to 4% of national income \u2013 on more than 50 initiatives to promote growth across the country.</p> <p>This breathtaking investment programme comes on top of the almost 30% of GDP the government has so far spent on rescuing businesses and protecting jobs during the coronavirus crisis. </p> <p>The sums have shocked onlookers, dwarfing as they do the funds Germany deployed in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. Yet they are consistent with a broader push by European institutions to co-ordinate more than ever the recovery from recession of the EU economy.</p> <p>The effort was already under way last year, aimed at counteracting a slowdown in GDP growth: after accelerating through 2017 and 2018, it had started fizzling out. The pandemic has turbocharged the response and brought the EU\u2019s main actors together in a way not seen since the days of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl.</p> <p>German chancellor Angela Merkel has buried her grievances with French premier Emmanuel Macron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/merkel-and-macron-propose-500bn-eu-rescue-fund\" title=\"\">to produce \u20ac500bn of grants</a> for hard-pressed business across the EU. The move circumvented the Bundestag\u2019s refusal to countenance debt sharing across the euro area and, said Macron, overcame the bloc\u2019s failure earlier in the pandemic to show sufficient solidarity.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhat is sure is that this \u20ac500bn will not be repaid by the beneficiaries \u2026 We are proposing to do real transfers [of money] ... that\u2019s a major step.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Society is facing a profound upheaval, so we couldn't just offer a traditional stimulus package</p> <footer> <cite>Angela Merkel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Macron, who, to the annoyance of many in Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic party, is a supporter of greater financial integration, has seen his tepid relationship with Germany\u2019s chancellor revived somewhat in the past few months.</p> <p>Last Thursday, the European Central Bank stirred the pot with a generous increase in lending to sovereign nations and the banking sector, joining the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England in making sure the cost of borrowing remains at all-time lows for years to come.</p> <p>Stock markets climbed on news of the combined funding packages, and analysts said they expected the financial markets to accelerate back to pre-pandemic levels during the rest of this month.</p> <p>The German Dax was among several European stock markets to make notable gains. The Dax jumped 3.4% last Friday, taking the week\u2019s increase to more than 10%, and more than a quarter since mid-March.</p> <p>Helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/us-unemployment-may-great-depression-job-loss\" title=\"\">surprisingly positive US jobs data last Friday</a>, this jump in stock prices was nevertheless underpinned by an announcement from EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson that travel restrictions were about to be eased.</p> <p>\u201cI personally believe that we will return to a full functioning of the Schengen area and freedom of movement of citizens no later than the end of the month of June,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Some countries, such as Austria, are ahead of the pack: after cutting the number of coronavirus cases and deaths dramatically, it has now eased its lockdown so far as to include travel to and from neighbouring Germany and Hungary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/gdp-chartsx3/giv-3902JJfsQ1WkxfG4/\" data-alt=\"gdp forecasts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/gdp-chartsx3/giv-3902JJfsQ1WkxfG4/\">gdp forecasts</a> </figure>  <p>The Schengen security area, which allows free movement among its 26 member states, is often cited as the cornerstone of European economic activity, so the prospect of it reopening was always going to excite investors. All eyes, though, are on Merkel\u2019s Germany, which is the first to go beyond the rescue phase and bring forward a fistful of measures to aid the recovery.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/germany-unveils-huge-130bn-coronavirus-recovery-package\" title=\"\">The \u20ac130bn package</a>, far from inciting either a rightwing backlash or condemnation from the left for being too weak, has received unexpected praise. The Green party called it \u201cbetter than we had feared\u201d, though economists did criticise the stimulus package\u2019s short-term thinking.</p> <p>After spending two days hammering out a deal, Merkel said that because society was facing a \u201cprofound upheaval\u201d shaped by climate change and digitisation, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t just introduce a traditional stimulus package\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt also had to be done with an eye to the future, so that is what we especially emphasised.\u201d</p> <p>Across Germany, the recovery package is seen as a defeat for the once all-powerful car lobby, which had reportedly spent weeks urging the government to include a subsidy not just for electric vehicles but also for those with internal combustion engines.</p> <p>In 2016, Germany launched an inventive scheme that was meant to drive up demand for electric cars: with each purchase of an electric vehicle the buyer would get a \u20ac4,000 rebate, half of which was paid for by the government, with the rest funded by carmakers.</p> <p>Instead of extending the scheme to diesel and petrol cars, as lobbyists had demanded, Merkel\u2019s government decided to increase the rebate for electric vehicles to up to \u20ac9,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government has managed to turn a corner just in time and given up on a subsidy for combustion engines</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Habeck, Green party</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>News magazine <em>Der Spiegel</em> cited industry insiders calling the package a paradigm change: \u201cTruth is, the times in which the government fulfils every wish of the car sector are over\u201d, it added.</p> <p>Both the Green party and Merkel\u2019s junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), claimed the change of tack as a victory. Saskia Esken, the SPD\u2019s joint leader, had defied car industry supporters in her own party and rejected plans for a subsidy for petrol and diesel cars earlier in the week.</p> <p>\u201cThe package is better than we expected\u201d, said Green party joint leader Robert Habeck. \u201cThe government has managed to turn a corner just in time and given up on a subsidy for combustion engines.\u201d</p> <p>Other countries, including the UK, are still drawing up their recovery packages. The Treasury is known to be circumspect about following in Germany\u2019s footsteps given that Britain\u2019s public finances are in a much weaker position.</p> <p>However, Britain\u2019s chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was urged last week by a thinktank that has strong connections to the Tory party to take bold action and bring forward a stimulus package that includes tax cuts alongside huge infrastructure spending.</p> <p>The thinktank, Policy Exchange, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/bank-of-england-faces-calls-to-overhaul-restrictive-remit\" title=\"\">cuts to stamp duty and VAT</a> should be part of a scheme designed to spur spending by both businesses and consumers.</p> <p>Merkel also put forward a cut in VAT, in a move that made the recovery package a more palatable compromise for many of her MPs.</p> <p>Economists, though, were more sceptical. \u201cIt is completely unclear whether businesses will pass on the VAT reduction to customers at all,\u201d said Sebastian Dullien, director of the Macroeconomic Policy Institute. \u201cIn retailing, you already have a lot of threshold prices: items that currently cost \u20ac99 are hardly going to go on sale for \u20ac97.50.\u201d</p> <p>Christian Odendahl, chief economist at London thinktank the Centre for European Reform, cited the temporary cut in VAT the UK government introduced in 2008, pointing out that only \u201c75% of businesses passed [the cuts] on to consumers\u201d.</p> <p>Clemens Fuest, president of the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Munich, said the VAT cut risked not providing a lasting stimulus: \u201cIt\u2019s a measure that allows you to drive up turnover in the short term. But after that period the whole thing doesn\u2019t work any more, of course. So you could have a problem in 2021 when consumption collapses.\u201d</p> <p>France will be keen to follow in Germany\u2019s footsteps. And doing so will be much easier now that every country in the EU is on course to breach the strictures of Brussels\u2019 3% deficit rule.</p> <p>The free flow of government funds will not be held up by eurocrats worried by claims of governments spending beyond their means. Borrowing is cheap for all developed countries and few of them are likely to spurn the opportunity.</p> <p>Ursula von der Leyen, the EU commission chief, has called for restraint from governments that may be considering offering bailouts to ailing businesses and perpetuating huge zombie companies.</p> <p>But Macron is unlikely to worry too much about that. He has already ditched his stance as champion of private-sector knowhow for a more nuanced approach that embraces the stability of the public sector and businesses that rely on state aid.</p> <p>It would help him hugely if France could regain its status as the world\u2019s favourite travel destination. Without the return of packed flights and trains full of tourists, thousands of small businesses will go bust, and larger companies will struggle to rebuild their revenues.</p> <p>Last Friday, Macron called on unions to reform the 35-hour working week. The government expects GDP to drop by 11% this year, in the worst recession since 1944, with the budget deficit expected to rise above 10% of GDP. Unions immediately opposed the idea, saying it represented a pay cut.</p> <p>Macron, though, understands that his European project will fail if France is dragged back by infighting. He needs to keep pace with Merkel, or many of the gains made in the past three months will be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e5380bb4c60da860f284e7abe7eadd608ddc688\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e5380bb4c60da860f284e7abe7eadd608ddc688/0_194_6299_3779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, called for a European-style Marshall plan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Di Lolli/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The race to rescue the EU</h2> <p>EU leaders have worked to make sure that Europe\u2019s haphazard response to the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 which set the north against the south and almost caused its disintegration \u2013 is not going to be repeated. Bailout operations have been larger and more coordinated, but continued resistance in some more conservative quarters to sharing Europe\u2019s wealth and income has persuaded some leaders to battle openly for deeper solidarity.</p> <p><strong>5 April </strong>The Spanish prime minister, <strong>Pedro S\u00e1nchez</strong>, called on Europe to produce a Marshall plan to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies. Referring to the US-funded investment programme put together in 1947 by secretary of state George Marshall, S\u00e1nchez said failure to act in solidarity could imperil the union\u2019s future.</p> <p>\u201cEurope&nbsp;must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery. Europe was born out of the ashes of destruction and conflict. It learned the lessons of history and understood something very simple: if we don\u2019t all win, in the end, we all&nbsp;lose.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6 April</strong> Germany\u2019s chancellor, <strong>Angela Merkel,</strong> warned that the EU faced the biggest challenge since its foundation as she spoke about the economic and political consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cEveryone has been hit equally by this and it must be in the interest of everyone, and of Germany, that Europe emerges stronger from this test,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong>16 April </strong>In an interview with the <em>Financial Times</em>, the president of France, <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>, said: \u201cWe are at a moment of truth, which is to decide whether the EU is a political project or just a market project. I think it\u2019s a political project\u2009\u2026\u2009We need financial transfers and solidarity, if only so that Europe holds on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>13 May</strong> <strong>Paolo Gentiloni</strong>, a former Italian prime minister and now the EU\u2019s economy commissioner, said that an uneven economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the&nbsp;EU. He said: \u201cWhat is clear is the uneven level of the recovery and the risks this creates to our single market and the necessary convergence, especially within the euro area. This is something that I could even define as an existential threat to the building of the union,\u201d he told a group of European newspapers, including the&nbsp;<em>Guardian</em>.</p> <p><strong>27 May</strong> <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the president of the European commission, called on EU countries to back a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3671bn) recovery plan, saying the union was facing a moment such as it had never seen in its 70-year history. \u201cThe crisis has huge externalities and spillovers across all countries and none of that can be fixed by any single country alone.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In the early days of the lockdown, philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/04/bruno-latour-moving-earths-theatre-science-climate-crisis\">Bruno Latour</a> wrote an essay for the <em><a href=\"https://aoc.media/\">AOC</a></em> cultural online newspaper. \u201cThe first lesson the coronavirus has taught us,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/downloads/P-202-AOC-ENGLISH_1.pdf\">he wrote</a>, \u201cis also the most astounding: we have actually proven that it is possible, in a few weeks, to put an economic system on hold everywhere in the world\u2026\u201d That essay, translated since into <a href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/852.html\">at least 12 languages</a>, has encouraged many to reimagine how different the world could look if we learned from this experience. It has also solidified the reputation of the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po)&nbsp;emeritus professor as one of the most influential thinkers of our age. </p> <p><strong>How has the pandemic reshaped our societies?<br></strong>Some say this is the revenge of nature. That is silly. Anyone who has studied the history of medicine knows how a virus can make a society feel completely different. We are on a great learning curve. It\u2019s a huge experiment. This is a global catastrophe that has come not from the outside like a war or an earthquake, but from within. Viruses are completely inside us. We cannot completely eject them. We must learn to live with them.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>At the beginning of the pandemic, you suggested everyone ask themselves what they would like to keep from the lockdown, what they would like to change</strong><strong>. Those questions are now being asked all over the world. Has the interest surprised you?<br></strong>Even if you were not a spiritual person, the lockdown forced everyone into a kind of retreat, a moment for reflection. It was quite extraordinary. The questions were therapeutic. They gave people powerlessly stuck at home a way of thinking about how they would create a better future. </p> <p><strong>Can an idea go viral like a disease?<br></strong>Covid has given us a model of contamination. It has shown how quickly something can become global just by going from one mouth to another. That\u2019s an incredible demonstration of network theory. I\u2019ve been trying to persuade sociologists of this for 40 years. I\u2019m sorry to have been so right. It shows that we must not think of the personal and the collective as two distinct levels. The big climate questions can make individuals feel small and impotent. But the virus gives us a lesson. If you spread from one mouth to another, you can viralise the world very fast. That knowledge can re-empower us.</p> <p><strong>Many countries are now easing out of lockdown. What can we expect to emerge from this period of reflection?<br></strong>The pandemic has reopened the debate about what is necessary and what is possible. It has put us in a position where we can decide what is useful and what is not. That choice disappeared before. Everything seemed relentless like a tsunami. Now we realise it was not. We can see things are reversible. We can see which jobs are necessary and which are junk. How long that will last, I don\u2019t know. We might have forgotten everything in three months. That depends on how hard the economic crisis becomes. I am overwhelmed by the size of the economic problem, from what I hear from my students.</p> <p><strong>To put your own question back to you, what would you change?<br></strong>What we need is not only to modify the system of production but to get out of it altogether. We should remember that this idea of framing everything in terms of the economy is a new thing in human history. The pandemic has shown us the economy is a very narrow and limited way of organising life and deciding who is important and who is not important. If I could change one thing, it would be to get out of the system of production and instead build a political ecology.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Has the pandemic response made you more or less optimistic about humanity\u2019s ability to tackle the climate and nature crisis?<br></strong>The bad guys are better organised and clearer in knowing what they want. The war we are engaged in is a difficult one. It is not that we are powerless; it is that many of us don\u2019t know how to react. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We cannot endlessly extract resources and discard our waste. In the critical zone, we must maintain what we have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>In your latest <a href=\"https://zkm.de/en/exhibition/2020/05/critical-zones\">art collaboration</a> at </strong><strong>ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany</strong><strong>, you define the scope of human existence as the \u201ccritical zone\u201d, a narrow band of Earth that can support life. What is the purpose of this approach?<br></strong>It is a redefinition of our landscape. The idea of the \u201ccritical zone\u201d is useful because it gets you out of nature. Nature is very big. It covers everything from the big bang to microbes. Conceptually, that makes it a complete mess. The critical zone is limited. It is just a few kilometres thick \u2013 above and below the surface of the Earth. But all discovered life is within it. This brings us inside in a way that nature does not. It is very different from the way of thinking that makes people such as Elon Musk think they should go on a mission to Mars. That is escapist. But when you think in terms of a critical zone, you are locked in, you cannot escape. What does it mean for politics if we are locked in and not in the infinite cosmology opened by Galileo? It means we cannot behave in the same way. It means we cannot just endlessly extract resources and discard our waste. In the critical zone, we must maintain what we have because it is finite, it\u2019s local, it\u2019s at risk and it\u2019s the object of conflict.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>This seems to add a political edge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\">James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\">hypothesis</a>, which explains how \u201cLife\u201d acts to maintain habitable conditions for itself. You have long been a champion of this theory\u2026<br></strong>Lovelock locked us in! While Galileo used a telescope to reveal that the Earth is part of an infinite universe, Lovelock used his electron capture detector to reveal that the Earth is completely different from any other planet because it has life. He and [Lynn] Margulis spotted Gaia. Lovelock from space, taking the question as globally as possible; Margulis from bacteria, taking the question from the other end, both realising that Life, capital L, has managed to engineer its own conditions of existence. For me that is the greatest discovery of this period, though it is still not very much accepted by mainstream science. This may be because we do not yet have the tools to receive it.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Why do you think scientists are still wary?<br></strong>That such an important concept is still so marginal in the history of science is extraordinary. I have done everything I can to make it accepted. But scientists are reflexively cautious. The cosmological shift from Aristotle to Galileo is the same as that from Galileo to Gaia. With Galileo, our understanding moved outwards to an infinite universe. Grasping that took a century and a half and faced resistance. Gaia is not just one more concept. It is not just about physics and energy. It is Life.</p> <p><strong>Your work has often challenged the </strong><strong>objective, </strong><strong>God\u2019s-eye view of science. You argue convincingly that humanity cannot be so detached. But the political right have twisted this approach to undermine all expert knowledge on the climate and nature crises. Any regrets?<br></strong>A critique of how science is produced is very different from the post-truth argument that there are alternative truths that you can choose from. Post-truth is a defensive posture. If you have to defend yourself against climate change, economic change, coronavirus change, then you grab at any alternative. If those alternatives are fed to you by thousands of fake news farms in Siberia, they are hard to resist, especially if they look vaguely empirical. If you have enough of them and they are contradictory enough, they allow you to stick to your old beliefs. But this should not be confused with rational scepticism. </p> <p><strong>Has the Covid-19 crisis affected our belief in science?<br></strong>The virus has revealed the number of things you need to know to decide what is factual and what\u2019s not. The public are learning a great deal about the difficulty of statistics, about experiment, about epidemiology. In everyday life, people are talking about degrees of confidence and margin of error. I think that\u2019s good. If you want people to have some grasp of science, you must show how it is produced.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Watching the violent chaos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">night after night in the US</a>, I keep thinking of what Benjamin Franklin said to the woman who asked him, as he emerged from the constitutional convention in 1787: \u201cWell, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\u201d To which he famously replied: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d What\u2019s happening on the streets there at the moment suggests that they could be coming close to losing it.</p> <p>When Trump was elected, I was assured by my American friends that the republic\u2019s democratic institutions, conventions and constitution were strong enough to rein in the narcissistic despot. Sure, it might be a rollercoaster ride, they conceded, but the republic would pull through. Well, if my transatlantic email is anything to go by, some of that cheery confidence seems to have evaporated.</p> <p>The thing that keeps my friends going, though, is the fact that Trump, despite his frantic, violent flailings, and despite his apparently rock-solid hold on a third of the electorate, is <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html#!\">trailing Joe Biden in the polls</a>. So, the thinking goes, if we all hold our nerve, the nightmare will end on 20 January 2021, when Trump has to hand over power to his victorious opponent.</p> <p>At which point my mind goes back to this time in 2016, when similar sentiments were the conventional wisdom about the chances of Trump defeating Hillary Clinton. And one of the most agonising questions in the aftermath of that election was: how could <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/\">Nate Silver and co</a> have got it so wrong?</p> <p>The answer is simple: nobody, including opinion pollsters, knew about the Trump campaign\u2019s astonishing <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news/\">mastery of social media</a>, especially Facebook. Trump may not have known much about that at the time \u2013 he really only understood Twitter \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/09/the-man-behind-trumps-facebook-juggernaut\">Brad Parscale</a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/09/the-man-behind-trumps-facebook-juggernaut\"> and his team</a> sure knew how to make use of Facebook\u2019s micro-targeting machine. And they did.</p> <p>Spool forward to now. Trump knows that if things continue as they are \u2013 with no party conventions or mass rallies and if the election is held in November (a sizable \u201cif\u201d IMHO) \u2013 then Biden will win. The only thing that could change that is \u2013 you guessed it! \u2013 Facebook.</p> <p>This thought is now informing everything he does. In particular, it explains his response to having his tweets labelled by Twitter by issuing a fatuous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">executive </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">order</a> (EO) threatening changes in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. This is the clause that shields social media companies from legal liability for stuff that users post on their platforms. It\u2019s what underpins the business models of Twitter, Facebook and Google, among others.</p> <p>Legally, the executive order is a farce and may be unconstitutional. Most of the media thought it was aimed at Twitter but in fact, as the academic <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/05/trumps-executive-order-isnt-about-twitter/612349/\">Zeynep Tufekci</a> spotted immediately, its real target was Facebook, which has much more to lose if Section 230 were to be radically amended. And, as a warning shot, it worked a treat. No sooner had news of the EO emerged than who should turn up \u2013 on Fox News, Trump\u2019s favourite TV channel \u2013 than Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook boss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/zuckerberg-facebook-police-online-speech-trump\">solemnly intoning his view</a> \u201cthat Facebook shouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. Private companies probably shouldn\u2019t be\u2026 in the position of doing that.\u201d</p> <p>Evidence that the strategy of ensuring that Facebook was onboard for the Trump ride quickly emerged. When Trump, addressing \u201cthose THUGS\u201d demonstrating in Minneapolis, tweeted \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter flagged the tweet</a> as violating its policy against \u201cglorifying violence\u201d. Over at Facebook, however, Mark Zuckerberg made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">personal decision</a> to leave the equivalent message up on Facebook.</p> <p>What it all comes down to is this: only one man \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 now stands between Joe Biden and the US presidency. If he were to decide (and in these matters his controlling stake in Facebook means he is unchallengeable) that the company\u2019s famed micro-targeting engine were to be off-limits to both Trump and Biden and their various supporting organisations, then Trump\u2019s candidacy would be toast.</p> <p>He won\u2019t do it, of course, for the simple reason that there\u2019s a lot of money to be made from politics in the 150 days between now and the presidential election. And if Trump wins, Zuckerberg will have that \u2013 and its grisly aftermath \u2013 on what is laughingly called his conscience. But so too will a former deputy prime minister of the UK who happens to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\">his </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\">consigliere</a></em> and was once, I believe, a liberal and a democrat.

Shopping malls and places of worship will open their doors, but no large gatherings, distributions of food offerings, sprinkling of holy water or touching of idols and holy books will be allowed.</p> <p>Almost half of the country\u2019s known cases have been traced to the four densely populated cities of Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Mumbai, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/india-mumbai-hospitals-overwhelmed-coronavirus-cases\">where hospitals have already run out of beds</a> and patients sleep on floors and share oxygen tanks.

The country\u2019s official death toll is 5,725. There were also 8,855 new cases, according to officials. This pushed the total number of recorded infections to 458,689.</p> <p>The official death toll has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/st-petersburg-death-tally-casts-doubt-on-russian-coronavirus-figures\">called into question</a> after mortality data from Russia\u2019s second-largest city,&nbsp;St Petersburg, revealed it had issued 1,552 more death certificates in May 2020 than in May 2019, a rise of a 32%. It was a strong indicator that hundreds of deaths caused by Covid-19 are not being reflected in the city\u2019s official coronavirus death toll for the month, which was 171.</p> <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased in <strong>Germany</strong> by 407 to 183,678.</p> <p><strong> China</strong>&nbsp;recorded three new confirmed cases, down from five the day before.

In the early hours of 13 March Taylor, a certified EMT who hoped to become a nurse, was shot to death by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. The officers were executing a no-knock search warrant and broke down a door to get in; Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, says he didn\u2019t hear officers announce themselves and thought it was a home invasion. Walker, a licensed gun owner, responded by shooting an officer in the leg; they fired more than 20 rounds in return and Taylor was hit at least eight times.</p> <p>Taylor would have turned 27 on Friday. She should have been celebrating. She should have had many decades of life ahead of her. Instead she is a hashtag. Meanwhile, the officers involved in her shooting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">haven\u2019t been charged with any crimes</a>. Nor have they been fired; they are on administrative leave. Taylor\u2019s family have filed a wrongful death lawsuit and the FBI\u2019s Louisville office announced that it would be opening an investigation into Taylor\u2019s death on 21 May; since then, however, there&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/breonna-taylor-birthday-charges-arrests-case-trnd/index.html\">doesn\u2019t seem to have been much movement in the case</a>.</p> <p>Taylor hasn\u2019t gotten justice yet, but she hasn\u2019t been forgotten: protesters around the world are chanting her name. Nevertheless, the public outrage over Taylor\u2019s death has been somewhat belated. Had it not been for the massive protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s murder, it\u2019s unlikely that Taylor would have received much, if any, mainstream attention.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869930040/as-the-nation-chants-her-name-breonna-taylors-family-grieves-a-life-robbed\">NPR notes</a>&nbsp;that the earliest news stories covering Taylor\u2019s death didn\u2019t mention her name; they referred to her and Walker as \u201csuspects\u201d and focussed on the injured police officer.</p> <p>Writing for Time, author and professor Brittney Cooper notes black women and girls are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/5847970/police-brutality-black-women-girls/\">often an afterthought in our outrage over police violence</a> \u2013 which is why the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aapf.org/shn-campaign\">#SayHerName</a>&nbsp;campaign, which draws attention to female victims of state violence, was created in 2015. Cooper posits that one reason outrage over the police killing of black women is often a secondary concern is because many of these deaths have happened out of the public eye: \u201cAnd in a world where the pains and traumas that black women and girls experience as a consequence of both racism and sexism remain structurally invisible and impermeable to broad empathy, these killings recede from the foreground quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Black women, Cooper explains, also don\u2019t easily fit into \u201cthe lynching script, what with its accreting black male victims, overzealous cops and devious white women,\u201d which helps us understand why black men keep getting killed. \u201cFemininity is a weapon only if you\u2019re white,\u201d she writes. \u201cBlack women have no such protections.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe most disrespected person in America, is the black woman,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-malcolm-x-speech-black-021500517.html\">Malcolm X said in 1962</a>. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman.\u201d Over half a century later, not much has changed. Black women are rarely centered in narratives about police violence; they are rarely the catalysts for mass outrage; their&nbsp;deaths are often an afterthought.

  "<p>Most modern teenagers have a discreet, thumbed-aside corner of their smartphones where they stash away the apps they are most ashamed of using. In 2018, this was where a 17-year-old US high school student called Dixie D\u2019Amelio kept an odd little social media app called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\" title=\"\">TikTok</a>. From what Dixie could make of it, TikTok expected users to record and post ultra-short, ultra-energetic videos of themselves that were soundtracked with pre-made audio clips. Songs. Snatches of dialogue. Users danced to these clips or lip-synced along. They copied each other\u2019s moves and riffed on references and in-jokes that were starting to slosh around <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" title=\"\">TikTok</a>\u2019s expanding global network.</p> <p>More and more, Dixie enjoyed scrolling through the endless feed of hectic TikTok videos, but in private. She was a TikTok lurker and would never have dreamed of posting anything herself because, as she puts it: \u201c<em>Ew</em>. People at school made fun of TikTok. It was looked down on. Embarrassing!\u201d When she found out that her younger sister Charli, a talented dancer, had started posting videos on the app, Dixie was horrified. It would surely mean social death. \u201cI was, like, Charli, dude, what are you <em>doing</em>?\u201d</p> <p>Today, in the spring of 2020, TikTok has about 800 million active users around the world. ByteDance, the Beijing-based startup that created the app, was valued at around $75bn in 2018 and is now thought to be worth close to $100bn. TikTok has made global superstars of its most popular users, and when <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dixiedamelio?lang=en\" title=\"\">Dixie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio?lang=en\" title=\"\">Charli</a> D\u2019Amelio talk to me over video from their home in Connecticut, it is in their capacity as unquestioned TikTok royalty.

How did a Chinese app step in from the fringes to take such an awesome bite out of a social media market traditionally dominated by powerhouse Americans (Facebook, Twitter)? Dixie and Charli tell me their half of the story from their bedroom, speaking over each other in that fluent, seamless way of close siblings. They both have shoulder-length brown hair, freckles and the reedy physicality of young athletes. (Dixie is a former nationally ranked BMX racer and school track athlete; Charli started dance training for ever ago.) Having not so long ago rolled out of bed, the D\u2019Amelios wear the bleary expressions of just-woken teens who will shortly need to go and forage for snacks. They paint their nails while we talk.</p> <p>\u201cI remember Dixie was <em>so</em> embarrassed to have a sister on TikTok,\u201d Charli says. \u201cAnd then in May 2019 \u2013 oh! I guess that was a year ago \u2013 all my friends started making TikToks. They asked me for help copying some of the dances. They said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got to teach us.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s weird, I don\u2019t even have my own account.\u2019 But then I started making videos and I guess I started having a lot of\u2026 fun?\u201d</p> <p>Dixie interrupts. \u201cDo you remember when people first started recognising you? They would say, \u2018Where do I know you from?\u2019 And you would say\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would say \u2018social media\u2019,\u201d Charli says. \u201cBecause I was embarrassed to say TikTok.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f15eebb810128fb0dd074bdf0fd9ca61a4386608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f15eebb810128fb0dd074bdf0fd9ca61a4386608/0_935_3809_4758/801.jpg\" alt=\"Charli and Dixie D\u2019Amelio.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charli, right, and Dixie D\u2019Amelio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time, the app was attempting a delicate manoeuvre, trying to position itself as a place for teens and tweens to come to be silly, unashamed, unfiltered \u2013 a tonic to the earnestness of Instagram, the stress of Snapchat, the verbal warfare of Twitter. The app had been around in some form or another for years, first gathering momentum in 2016 after Twitter closed down its short-form video service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/vine\" title=\"\">Vine</a>, leaving a small but exploitable hole in the social market. In summer 2018, it merged with the US lip-syncing app <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/04/musical-ly-lip-synch-video-app-turns-pop-fans-into-stars\" title=\"\">Musical.ly</a>, increasing its reach, and by the end of that year it had crept to the top of Apple\u2019s US app charts.</p> <p>TikTok\u2019s strategy of appealing to Gen Z\u2019s need for release, somewhere for them to not be Insta-perfect, was working. It was adding tens of millions of new users every month; in January 2019, the influential technology blog TechCrunch published an editorial headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/its-time-to-pay-serious-attention-to-tiktok/\" title=\"\">It\u2019s time to pay serious attention to TikTok</a>\u201d \u2013 advice that Facebook and Twitter, now hurriedly preparing copycat products, had been uncharacteristically slow to heed. When ByteDance celebrated the new year by <a href=\"http://www.fgreatstudio.com/portfolio/tiktok-burj-khalifa-projection-mapping\" title=\"\">projecting its TikTok logo</a> on to the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, it was a statement of arrival.</p> <p>Charli\u2019s perky, precise dance videos caught on in 2019 and grew in popularity as TikTok did. It hadn\u2019t exactly become cool in her friend circle, Dixie explains, but few people would have thought of pretending they didn\u2019t use the app, or understand its references and in-jokes. TikTok culture had spilled over into the school corridors.</p> <p>What is that culture? You could think of it like YouTube (beauty how-tos, cartoony science experiments, impressive athletic feats, pets being cute, domestic accidents filmed by chance, monologues to camera, goofy lip-syncs, breathless dances), only on TikTok such videos have to be severely truncated in order to be uploaded. Users get 15 seconds to express themselves, and this brevity helps to create a staccato, no-explanations, absurdist flavour to much of the content. Comedy skits benefit from the tight edit, for instance. If some of the monologues are over-earnest, at least they don\u2019t run on too long. TikTok has made capsule celebrities of young magicians, fashion mavens, political campaigners. It has also elevated people to notoriety by accident (my favourite being a young woman known as <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/tiktok-heres-the-motherfucking-tea\" title=\"\">The Motherfucking Tea Girl</a>, after a rant of hers that went viral in 2019).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were out one night and noticed kids staring. We thought, there\u2019s no way they know Charli from that weird app</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a TikTok novice, I didn\u2019t fully grasp its peculiar culture until I started thinking of the app as if it were my old playground at school. When I was a kid in the 90s, everyone had seen the same TV shows, listened to the same songs, had heard about the same laugh-out-loud acts of cheek against the teachers. To listen in on our playground conversation as an outsider (Simpsons references, Britpop lyrics, hyper-local gossip) would have been like hearing a gabbling alien language. But to be in the thick of it, <em>getting</em> it, was wonderful. So now I think of TikTok as one big secondary-school playground, with 800 million people crammed in. All babbling, all getting it.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Dixie, when I pitch her my comparison.</p> <p>It was more or less why she cracked and started posting videos herself, she explains. \u201cEvery conversation was about TikTok. \u2018Oh my God, Charli has 100,000 followers. Oh my God, she has 200,000.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m done! If Charli hits 1 million followers, I\u2019ll start posting because I\u2019m done being left out like this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Charli: \u201cShe never thought I was gonna hit one million followers.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Charli: \u201cAnd then I hit one million.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>This was October 2019. The D\u2019Amelio family celebrated Charli\u2019s milestone with a cake and Dixie kept up her end of the agreement, popping up in Charli\u2019s videos and then shooting her own knockabout solo efforts, fooling around in the family home. Dixie\u2019s presence supercharged both sisters\u2019 popularity. By now, their parents had accounts of their own, initially to keep an eye on the girls, but soon with millions of curious followers of their own.</p> <p>\u201cWe were kind of on autopilot as a family at the time,\u201d recalls Marc, who is 51 and works in sportswear. \u201cDixie was about to go to college. She was driving Charli to school in the mornings. Me and Heidi were kind of looking at the finish line of parenting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoasting,\u201d agrees Heidi, 48. \u201cAnd then we were out to dinner one night and we noticed kids at the other table staring. We both thought, there\u2019s no way they know Charli from that weird app\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Before long, there were mobbings at the mall and at airports. Managers and marketers contacted the house, hoping the sisters would sign deals. Marc and Heidi first met in the 90s in New York, where Marc ran his sportswear business and Heidi was a model and personal trainer. They both had some experience at the crossover point of consumer and celebrity culture, but still \u2013 that their teenage daughters had become lucrative stars, in a matter of weeks and without leaving their bedrooms, was a bit of a surprise. Marc recalls: \u201cWe really thought we\u2019d figured out how to have two kids. Then this was thrust on us. We had to regroup. Huddle together as a family and figure out all this new stuff.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e08ad1ed455a8576743f713a864ca5a62a5123c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e08ad1ed455a8576743f713a864ca5a62a5123c1/143_87_2733_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charli on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charli on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In November 2019, Charli was invited to go on holiday with a collective of young TikTokers based in Los Angeles (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thehypehouse?lang=en\" title=\"\">the Hype House</a>, a kind of 21st-century <a href=\"https://variety.com/gallery/the-mickey-mouse-club-famous-members/nikki-deloach-mickey-mouse-club/\" title=\"\">Mickey Mouse Club</a>) and though the affiliation did not last, it was a move that helped nudge her further into the millions of followers. There were other, more random boosts to her popularity. Before Christmas, she copied a TikTok dance that was doing the rounds \u2013 the audio was the clip of a track by the rapper <a href=\"http://www.kcamp427.com/about\" title=\"\">K Camp</a> \u2013 and a lot of people gravitated to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8OctG2KWX0\" title=\"\"> Charli\u2019s version</a>. The video was watched more than 150m times, mostly by users trying to copy and perfect the dance. The suburban high school girl, still 15, suddenly had the market reach of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Knowles-Carter</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\" title=\"\">Kardashian.</a></p> <p>In early 2020, Charli was signed by the powerful Hollywood agency UTA, along with the rest of the D\u2019Amelio family. By then, <a href=\"https://theface.com/culture/charli-and-dixie-damelio-chase-hudson-derek-hough-tiktok-social-media-interview\" title=\"\">The Face magazine</a> felt comfortable describing her as \u201cthe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/01/pina-bausch-obituary-dance\" title=\"\">Pina Bausch</a> of TikTok\u201d. In February, Dixie joined the cast of a YouTube drama made by the tween production company Brats and, meanwhile talks began about constructing a TV reality show around the entire family. In April, Charli was invited to dance for a national TV audience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3xbnumiS0E\" title=\"\">on The Jimmy Fallon Show</a>, by which point she was the most-followed person on TikTok\u2019s platform. As Heidi describes this period: \u201cThings. Went. Crazy.\u201d</p> <p>***<br>It\u2019s worth pausing here to consider a question often asked in the comment-threads under Charli\u2019s TikTok videos. Why her? What made this particular teenager\u2019s breezy, professionally dapper, but ultimately innocuous dance videos take off in such an enormous way?</p> <p>To properly understand a community and its whims, there\u2019s little point zeroing in on the gilded few who have risen to the top. <em>They</em> don\u2019t know. To understand Charli\u2019s mass appeal, I would need to speak to representatives of the masses, users who were stuck in the foothills of the app with tens or hundreds of followers and who nevertheless kept the network churning with content and comments and follows. Several of my teenage nieces and nephews are dogged TikTokers and after a quick call-out on the family WhatsApp group, I was able to assemble a brain trust of Charli obsessives who could answer any question about her.</p> <p>Why Charli, I ask?</p> <p>Niece #1: \u201cShe\u2019s funny. Upbeat.\u201d</p> <p>Nephew #1: \u201cShe\u2019s very smiley and positive.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #2: \u201cA major thing with Charli is her age. The general TikTok audience is younger than on Facebook or Instagram, so the influencers need to be younger.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #3: \u201cShe\u2019s a good dancer.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #2: \u201cWhenever we want to learn a dance, we\u2019ll look for Charli\u2019s video because she\u2019s so good, we think of hers as the best version to copy.\u201d</p> <p>Nephew #1: \u201cHer having an older sister helps. They can do videos together.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #1: \u201cThey can do synchronised moves.\u201d</p> <p>Niece #2: \u201cA lot of families across the world use TikTok and it\u2019s a bond people recognise.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re offered deals all the time that we turn down. Charli will not promote something she doesn\u2019t like</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I ask the D\u2019Amelio family the same question \u2013 why them? \u2013 Marc puts it down to luck. An app came along that prized a certain style of dancing (just this side of practised) and a certain style of personality (just this side of sarcastic) and Charli and Dixie happened to fit the mould. They benefited from \u201cthe lightning in a bottle effect\u201d, Marc says, of being relatable to a generation.</p> <p>Charli has long professed bafflement about her rise. TikTok, though noticeably friendlier in tone than most of its social media competitors, is by no means an online utopia. People can be cruel. Towards the end of last year, Charli had to post a captioned video in response to a common observation that her popularity did not make sense. \u201cI don\u2019t understand [it] either,\u201d Charli wrote in the video, \u201cbut that\u2019s not my problem.\u201d This slightly flinty statement has softened over time into a kind of mantra for dealing with both the attention and the questions about whether she deserves it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d it now says on Charli\u2019s TikTok profile page, \u201cI don\u2019t get the hype either.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie says: \u201cI wish I could protect her a little bit more from the haters.\u201d</p> <p>I ask them how the worst of the negativity manifests itself. Comments? Direct messages? Actually, on TikTok it tends to be a little more roundabout than that. A popular collaborative feature on TikTok allows users to take a stranger\u2019s video and \u201cduet\u201d with it. (The original video appears on one half of a split-screen, the responding one on the other half.) Credited by some tech observers as a key innovation that helped TikTok create a sense of ongoing collaboration, \u201cduets\u201d are also a quick and easy vehicle for mockery. \u201cYou can\u2019t really avoid them,\u201d Dixie explains, adding that if you\u2019re the subject of someone\u2019s duet (well-intentioned or otherwise), that video is invariably pushed into your feed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think people\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Charli finishes her sentence: \u201c\u2026understand that. They think you\u2019ll never see. But it\u2019s just not true.\u201d \u201cLearning how to deal with hate,\u201d Dixie says, \u201cthat\u2019s the part we\u2019re still working on it. It gets very frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>As for the numbers, Charli says, \u201ceven 100,000 pairs of eyes is a <em>lot</em>. So it\u2019s been, since very early on, that the numbers stopped making sense to me. I try to think, \u2018I don\u2019t know how these people found me, and this is all crazy, and I\u2019m just gonna keep doing what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***<br>We break off the interview so Charli and Dixie can make some TikTok videos. Charli\u2019s creative process for this is not much of one at all. She scrolls through her \u201cFor You\u201d page (a sort of welcome-to-the-app splash screen full of videos algorithmically generated for each user) and chooses an audio clip she likes. Otherwise, she thumbs through a list of saved, favourite clips that have caught her ear before and earmarked for possible use. Today it\u2019s a crunchy, low-quality recording of a couple of bars from a 2011 track by rapper J Cole called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWlibNTrg80\" title=\"\">Work Out</a>.</p> <p>For reasons of not looking as if you\u2019re trying too hard, another convention of TikTok is that the music clips often sound secondhand, slightly distorted, as if taxing the limits of a smartphone speaker. Charli hits the button that says \u201cUse this sound\u201d and she\u2019s ready to shoot. Now, and not before, she\u2019ll think about what to do. \u201cThere\u2019s no planning. The thing about making a TikTok is, whenever you\u2019re making it, that\u2019s when the ideas come.\u201d She props her smartphone against a water bottle in her bedroom and, with Dixie, films a brief dance. It ends in a comic tumble as Dixie collides with her sister and loses her balance. Good enough: the footage is edited down to seven seconds, ending on a smeared closeup of Dixie as she collapses forward towards the camera lens. \u201cUpload.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie goes downstairs to make a solo video of herself dancing on the kitchen counter while Charli stays in her room and, choosing a clip of an old song by Drake, lip-syncs along. Her follower count has just ticked over 54 million, so she appends a comment: \u201cTHANK YOU GUYS SO SO MUCH FOR 54 MILLION!!!!\u201d Meanwhile I track the progress of the J Cole dance that ended with Dixie falling over. It goes online in the early afternoon and by teatime it has been seen 4m times. Within a day the number is up past 20m. After a week it\u2019s 45m and still tick-tocking up, up, up. These are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\" title=\"\">Adele</a> numbers. Sports broadcast numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29800fab943fbc174bdfe0be24ba7d23305fe346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29800fab943fbc174bdfe0be24ba7d23305fe346/0_43_3961_5818/681.jpg\" alt=\"The D\u2019Amelios in their garden in Norfolk, Connecticut.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The D\u2019Amelios at home in Norfolk, Connecticut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt <em>is</em> a business now, 100%,\u201d Marc tells me. \u201cWhen kids have millions of followers, it\u2019s kind of hard to put the brakes on it. So, for lack of a better term, we\u2019ve kind of decided to double down. We\u2019re seeing where all this goes.\u201d The sisters currently have a range of endorsement deals, including with a skincare company, though Marc stresses \u201cwe\u2019re offered deals all the time that we turn down. Charli will not promote something she doesn\u2019t like.\u201d Heidi adds: \u201cI\u2019ve seen her sit in a room full of executives and say no. I couldn\u2019t have done that at her age.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok as a service has been deliberately slow to monetise, creators ByteDance deploying the softly-softly startup strategy of growing a base of devotees before trying too obviously to sell them things. In spring 2019, early video ads were allowed on to the network. A few months later, a feature was added called Hashtag Challenges: sponsored marketing campaigns, by any other name, in which TikTokers push certain products. In February, the D\u2019Amelios were involved in some hectic promotion of a Hashtag Challenge in aid of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/j-lo-shakira-super-bowl-half-time-show-review\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lopez\u2019s half-time performance at the Super Bowl</a>. The family were flown to Miami, where <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/6788733687660956933?lang=en\" title=\"\">Charli filmed a dance with Lopez</a>.</p> <p>It probably says a lot about TikTok culture (and maybe older media\u2019s hesitant grasp of it) that some videos Charli made of herself <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/6788516032416877829?lang=en\" title=\"\">dancing to a Sean Paul track in her Miami hotel bathroom</a> got more eyeballs than the J-Lo collaboration. For now, at least, there\u2019s distrust in TikTok land of any stars who too brazenly sell out. On Charli\u2019s 16th birthday, the D\u2019Amelio family recorded videos of themselves wearing matching Charli-branded hoodies in celebration. Marc put out a message directing fans to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcdamelio/status/1256076779615399936\" title=\"\">Charli\u2019s online shop</a> where the hoodies were on sale (\u201ctoday only\u201d). I noticed, though, that he kept the salesmanship to his Twitter account, away from TikTok.</p> <p>In the same way the young users of the app seem to resist many of the aesthetics of the Instagram age (the D\u2019Amelios will often make videos while wearing pimple cream, to the amazement of their mother), there\u2019s evidently a squeamishness about echoing the mistakes of older Insta-stars who will haphazardly sell followers anything \u2013 teabags, eScooters, obscure holiday destinations, whoever\u2019s paying. Heidi, trying to explain why Charli would face down a room full of advertising execs and refuse lucrative offers, gives a compelling reason: \u201cCharli doesn\u2019t want to get crushed for it online. She doesn\u2019t want to be called out.\u201d</p> <p>***<br>One of Charli and Dixie\u2019s most popular TikToks, made in the days after our interview, lasts just four seconds. It\u2019s a compact, gnomic expression of Gen Z mores and tics \u2013 an initially inexplicable duet between the sisters and three strangers that takes me a good half an hour to decode when it pops up on my \u201cFor You\u201d page. Here\u2019s what I think is happening in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQReyNiuV84\" title=\"\">the video</a>.</p> <p>A random TikToker, feeling sentimental, has a thought about Charli and decides to express it by filming themselves curled up in bed with a pensive look on their face. \u201cI know for a fact,\u201d it says on an overlaid caption, \u201cthat Charli D\u2019Amelio would wait for me to tie my shoe while everyone else kept walking.\u201d Another TikToker takes the prompt and \u201cduets\u201d with this video, adding the lightest touch of snark about too-good-to-be-true Charli. \u201cI just know [she] would ask me if I was feeling OK after the rest of the group laughed at my self-deprecating joke.\u201d This goes on a bit, with more pensive expressions and more \u201cI just know\u201ds, until Dixie sees the video and gets involved. She videos herself curled up in bed and appends the caption: \u201cI just know Charli D\u2019Amelio.\u201d</p> <p>The coup comes from Charli herself, who breaks the chain of melancholy faces by filming herself clenching her fists, jiggling from side to side with a deadpan, shit-eating grin, under a caption that reads: \u201cI Charli D\u2019Amelio.\u201d The whole thing plays out, without explanation, to a looping clip of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltrMfT4Qz5Y\" title=\"\">Kenny Loggins singing the 1984 soundtrack to Footloose</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/tiktok-is-the-social-media-sensation-of-lockdown-could-i-become-its-new-star\">TikTok is the social media sensation of lockdown. Could I become its new star?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>This</em> is TikTok. The ad hoc collaboration between distant strangers. The tonal blend of earnestness and irony. The unbothered bed-head aesthetics and the incongruous soundtrack. Watching the video, trying to unravel it, gets me thinking about Gen Z as a whole \u2013 what a confused and sad world we\u2019re bequeathing them. We\u2019ve thrust cameras in their faces for as long as they can remember, making them twitchily aware of their appearance from all angles. No wonder they have begun to congregate, away from all the stumbling grownups, in a place they can be silly, arch and sweet, and look a mess, and think at microprocessor speed \u2013 all in a format that registers as gibberish to outsiders.</p> <p>As Dixie explains, \u201cIf someone has never used TikTok before and they come on it, they\u2019ll have no idea what\u2019s going on. Things go viral and then disappear right away. It comes and goes, and comes and goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s fun,\u201d Charli says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be on-your-best all the time. Things keep passing. There isn\u2019t some impossible thing you can be, that you\u2019re shooting for, that you have to maintain.\u201d</p> <p>Dixie: \u201cThings can last one day and then nobody talks about them ever again. And that\u2019s\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Charli: \u201cThat\u2019s super-cool.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is safe to say that the measures taken by Japan during the Covid-19 pandemic have so far delivered relative success. At the time of writing, we have seen <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/japan/\">903 deaths</a>, which makes the mortality rate <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">0.72 per 100,000 people</a>. This is one-eightieth that of the UK (60.14) and is lower than any other G7 country.</p> <p>Thanks to the fact that the rate of new patients is also low and steady, Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/japan-lifts-state-of-emergency-after-fall-in-coronavirus-cases\">lifted its state of emergency</a> on 25 May. There has been a lot of trial and error (take the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">Diamond Princess cruise ship</a> case, for example, over which Japan was exposed to much criticism). Yet since what we consider to be the first wave was dealt with without any lockdowns or curfews, we are often asked for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/from-near-disaster-to-success-story-how-japan-has-tackled-coronavirus\">secrets of our initial success</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Time-consuming public health work</strong></h2> <p>The first principle of controlling an emerging disease is to detect the outbreak and respond early. Understanding the transmission dynamics through field investigations is key. Japan is fortunate to have <a href=\"https://asiatimes.com/2020/06/japans-contact-tracing-method-is-old-but-gold/\">469 local public health centres</a> with more than 25,000 staff, who have been working hard to conduct contact tracing even before the virus became prevalent in the country. With no tracing apps (given patients\u2019 reluctance to disclose full information), contact tracing has been somewhat analogue and time-consuming, involving calling patients and politely asking them to name the people they have met with in the last fortnight. But the system has worked well, and has resulted in an effective \u201ccluster-focused\u201d approach.</p> <h2><strong>Pinpointing \u201cclusters\u201d</strong></h2> <p>What we found at an early stage was that efforts to find cases through testing those who had had contact with patients was not particularly effective. Further investigation revealed that while many patients do not infect anyone, some end up infecting many, thereby forming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/the-cluster-effect-how-social-gatherings-were-rocket-fuel-for-coronavirus\">\u201cclusters\u201d</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/the-cluster-effect-how-social-gatherings-were-rocket-fuel-for-coronavirus\"> of infected people</a> from a single source.</p> <p>Therefore, in addition to contact tracing, we focused on a retrospective tracking of links between patients and found unrecognised cases surrounding the possible source, thereby identifying clusters. In addition, monitoring of the number of unlinked cases led to an early detection of exponential growth in the number of patients, which enabled the government to provide the public with an effective early warning.</p> <h2><strong>Clear and effective communications</strong></h2> <p>The government of Japan does not have the legal authority to implement strong measures such as lockdowns and curfews. Similarly, all the travel restrictions announced were voluntary requests. What the government was left with, therefore, was its capability to share knowledge about the disease with the public in an easy-to-understand manner. Through the cluster investigation, we recognised that the <a href=\"https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/content/000061935.pdf\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/content/000061935.pdf\">three Cs\u201d</a> (closed, crowded spaces with close contact) were the major environmental risk factors that led to clusters. The government introduced the \u201cAvoid three Cs\u201d slogan from early March, which I believe helped significantly to delay the peak.</p> <h2><strong>Strong peer pressure</strong></h2> <p>Foreign visitors and expatriates in Japan can tell you how the Japanese are loyal to uncodified social norms. Physical distancing measures exist in Japan under the <a href=\"https://verfassungsblog.de/japans-soft-state-of-emergency-social-pressure-instead-of-legal-penalty/\">Special Measures Act</a>, but the government can only encourage people to stay at home; closure of facilities can be requested, but offenders will not be punished.</p> <p>Yet the majority of people made efforts to stay at home and shopping centres remained closed in major cities during the state of emergency. Whether Japan can rely on the same methodology in a possible second wave remains to be seen.</p> <h2><strong>Bows and </strong><strong>masks</strong></h2> <p>Social customs had a significant role to play. Shaking hands \u2013 let alone hugging and kissing \u2013 is seen as a western fashion to greet people. In addition, many Japanese are less reluctant to wear masks, as it is common to wear them in order to safeguard against pollen allergies in spring and flu in winter. Social customs such as these may have helped lower the transmission efficiency in the community \u2013 and may have made it easier for people to accept the new reality.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is reported that Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist of Sweden, who designed the soft-touch approach to the virus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/architect-of-sweden-coronavirus-strategy-admits-too-many-died-anders-tegnell\">remarked</a>, \u201cIf we were to encounter the same illness with the same knowledge that we have today, I think our response would land somewhere in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done.\u201d Talking about the middle-approach, I cannot help wonder if Tegnell had these Japanese measures and customs in mind.</p> <p>Yet we cannot and should not let our guard down. Tokyo is now gradually reopening. Whether Japan can remain equally resilient and whether people can get used to a \u201cnew normal\u201d by exercising peer pressure during the expected second wave remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Tomoya Saito is director of the Department of Health Crisis Management at Japan\u2019s National Institute of Public Health&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>In 2016, when I finished writing <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/14/the-return-father-sons-and-the-land-in-between-hisham-matar-review\">The Return</a></em>, a book about my journey back to Libya after 33 years of not being able to go there for political reasons, and my failed search for my father, a Libyan political dissident who was imprisoned and made to disappear by the Gaddafi dictatorship, I went to Siena. I spent a month in the Tuscan city looking at paintings from the Sienese School, which covers the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Works from this period have interested me ever since I first saw them at the National Gallery in London, some quarter of a century before, when I was 19, the very year my father was abducted. Something about their availability and vitality appealed to me. The time I spent in Siena provided a space to consider the connections between love and loss, death and art.</p> <p>The Sienese School, which sits between the waning influence of the eastern church and the Renaissance, was dramatically changed by the 1348 plague, the Black Death. That pandemic was the most devastating incident in human history. It altered not only human society but the imagination itself. Its traces can be perceived today, and perhaps more lucidly during these difficult days. With their lack of modern technology, the 14th-century Sienese were even more incredulous than we have shown ourselves to be in the early days of the coronavirus crisis. The speed of the Black Death was so staggering that in just over a year it had conquered the known medieval world, reducing the population of each country by an average of 45%. To the Sienese artists, who were engaged in a fruitful competitive collaboration with one another and had established a supportive infrastructure of apprenticeships to train young artists, the carnage seemed very far away and the reports were so wild and grotesque that they could scarcely be believed. But then when they heard that Sicily had fallen, it became obvious that there would be no escape. Fear and hysteria gripped Siena. Some people ran into the countryside; others, believing themselves safer inside the metropolis, rushed to enter through one of the many gates that surrounded the city like open mouths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Vermeer were all threatened by the Black Death. It is thought that Titian died of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before Italy became a nation, it was made up of a collection of city-states governed by <em>un\u2019autorit\u00e0 superior</em>, in the form of a powerful noble family or a bishop. Siena was an exception in that it favoured civic rule. This partly accounts for the unique character of its art. It produced Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s <em>The Allegory of Good and Bad Government,</em> a series of frescos housed in the Palazzo Pubblico, the civic heart of the city. It is one of the earliest and most significant secular paintings we have. If civic rule were a church, this would be its altarpiece. Siena also imbued its artists with a rare and humanist curiosity that, even in their depictions of religious scenes, involved them in meditations on human psychology and ideas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78247d5eed9924459535bd866e2e0875e7b71b03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78247d5eed9924459535bd866e2e0875e7b71b03/442_0_6259_3759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Excerpt from The Allegory of the Good and Bad Government.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from The Allegory of the Good and Bad Government.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Image Partnership Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This changed with the arrival of the Black Death.<em> </em>The Sienese, like their medieval European Christian counterparts, suffered under the conviction that all diseases came from God. They took the Black Death as proof of their guilt. In the 14th-century Middle English narrative poem<em> Piers Plowman,</em> William Langland puts the matter succinctly: \u201cThese pestilences were for pure sin.\u201d The Tuscan poet Petrarch, observing the abandoned bodies of the dead, wrote: \u201cOh happy people of the future, who have not known these miseries and perchance will class our testimony with the fables. We have, indeed, deserved these [punishments] and even greater.\u201d The church encouraged such supernatural explanations. Many priests refused to bless the infected on the grounds that they were receiving God\u2019s punishment. Most of the believers devoted themselves to prayer and penitential practices, repairing churches and setting up religious houses. The papacy became more powerful. Ideas and the very structure of people\u2019s values shifted.</p> <p>The 1348 Black Death and its various proceeding reoccurrences, shaped our attitudes to death and dying and, by implication, to life and living across the world. Ibn Khald\u016bn, the Tunisian historian and historiographer credited with pioneering the field of sociology, lost his parents to the plague. To him it was an event of immense global importance, but also a personal affront. It drove him to conclude that the Black Death exposed profound weaknesses in human civilisation. His was a pre-Darwinian Darwinian view, and he wanted to see the opportunities in the tragedy. It made life seem, he wrote, \u201cas if it were a pristine and repeated creation, a world brought into existence anew\u201d. Indeed, the plague was destructive but also generative. The flowering of the Renaissance and the baroque took place in its shadow. Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Vermeer were all periodically threatened by it. It is thought that Titian died of it. And it entered their minds, tinged their thinking, and made death a familiar and inescapable guest, the silent companion who will inevitably have the last word. The imagination began to focus on the end of things. \u201cNo thought is born in me which has not \u2018Death\u2019 engraved upon it,\u201d Michelangelo wrote in a letter to Vasari.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c5a2e8a689e68d81f7015a9550098df64d90a29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c5a2e8a689e68d81f7015a9550098df64d90a29/0_204_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art\u2019 \u2026 Hisham Matar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art\u2019 \u2026 Hisham Matar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The religious fervour the Black Death inspired in Siena instilled a powerful commitment to the church. Barely seven years had passed when, in 1355, the city\u2019s civic rule ended. The clergy now were the principal clients. They had a great deal of money and influence. They determined what was painted. They commissioned a new chapel down the corridor from Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s <em>The Allegory of Good and Bad Government</em>. Taddeo di Bartolo, the artist assigned to decorate the walls of the chapel, had a big task to fulfil. He needed to revive and carry forth the Sienese tradition as well as reinvent it and make it more adaptable to the tastes of the new patron. His depictions of the death of the Virgin, pictures concerned with the end of things, is a register that was not up to then central to Sienese art. It is impossible to look at <em>The Funeral of the Virgin </em>and not think of it as containing the memory of the dead of Siena, the bodies piled high on pavements because there was no place to bury them. Each of the Apostles carrying the Virgin as well as the onlookers seem utterly alone, as though touched by the thought of death. The whole chapel is a fabulous and contradictory performance of repentance and excess. Every surface \u2013 every centimetre of floor, wall and ceiling space \u2013 is decorated. It is an anxious space. Through its grandiose certainty, its sheer assertiveness, it manages to satisfy the clergy while at the same time expressing the problem with faith: that faith, any kind of faith, and regardless of how adamant it might appear, is a space of doubt. It was as though Bartolo was echoing that mischievous statement of Boccaccio\u2019s, the Florentine poet and Petrarch\u2019s friend and correspondent, who had also witnessed the Black Death: \u201cA seemly thing it is \u2026 that whatever we do, it be begun in the holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all.\u201d An element of that sardonic rebellion is here in the chapel, albeit faintly, perhaps even unintentionally, through the double-edged gesture of assertive magnificence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e412b1d847efb007334955598d36aca4e0b4116d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e412b1d847efb007334955598d36aca4e0b4116d/127_549_2374_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail from The Funeral of the Virgin by Taddeo di Bartolo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from The Funeral of the Virgin by Taddeo di Bartolo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Picture Art Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/19/hisham-matar-month-in-siena-books-interview\">Hisham Matar: \u2018Writing is both the easiest and the most difficult thing\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I thought I had gone to Siena simply to look at art.

In writing <em>A Month in Siena, </em>I had to think about all of this and about how death changes things. It is uncanny then to emerge from that to find our own world captured by a pandemic. And in thinking about all of this I find myself remembering the 20th-century Italian poet and novelist Cesare Pavese\u2019s statement that art is \u201ca defence against life\u2019s offenses\u201d. Although that may be too ambitious a role to assign to it, true art is always a symptom and a revelation.

The Davorens had worked these hills for 400 years.</p> <p>But growing intensification fuelled by European subsidies meant that most farmers in this part of Ireland were having to decide between getting big or getting out. Hundreds were choosing the latter.</p> <p>Davoren followed the advice to specialise and chase the beef markets. \u201cThe more animals I kept, the more money I got,\u201d he says. \u201cI put more cattle out, bought fertiliser, made silage. Slurry run-off was killing fish. But if I kept fewer animals I\u2019d be penalised 10% of my subsidy.\u201d</p> <p>The austere appearance of the Burren landscape belies its rich diversity. The thick rocks were laid down 300 million years ago when warm tropical seas covered the area, and the bodies of billions of marine creatures cascaded to the sea floor to form the Burren limestone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/27/turning-farming-upside-down-mob-grazing-on-a-cumbrian-hill-farm\">Turning farming upside down: mob grazing on a Cumbrian hill farm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These limestone cracks are usually jammed with life.

He soon recognised the changes that were exerting negative pressures on the landscape. Resilient breeds were being replaced with larger continental cattle with feed demands greater than the land could provide. Cattle slurry was seeping into underground streams causing water pollution.</p> <p>\u201cIt was economically successful for farmers. They were grant-aided to turn \u2018bad\u2019 land into \u2018good\u2019,\u201d says Dunford. \u201cThey were trying to make a living. It was a big moment for me \u2013 I figured that unless I came back with a better financial proposition, with the conviction that this is the right thing to do, then I was at nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Dunford needed to radically rethink what it means to be a farmer. \u201cWhat defined farmers was how much food they can produce. The biggest challenge was to get them to take on a new role \u2013 to convince them they have a broader destiny than just food. And for that, they needed to be supported and paid to do it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/im-constantly-putting-on-a-brave-face-farmers-speak-out-on-mental-health\">'I\u2019m constantly putting on a brave face': farmers speak out on mental health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He established a pioneering scheme, funded by the EU\u2019s environment directorate, that pays farmers for nature-filled fields and clean waterways.

Dunford\u2019s project has reinvigorated the close relationship between farmers and their hilly fields. Farmers have rejuvenated an ancient tradition called \u201cwinterage\u201d, where cattle spend the cold months on the uplands. They graze down the tough, hardy grasses which provides space for rare flowers in spring; here the limestone slabs act as giant hot-water bottles, slowly dissipating the summer heat stored in the rocks. It has transformed parts of the uplands into species-rich <a href=\"http://www.magnificentmeadows.org.uk/assets/pdfs/Calcareous_Grasslands.pdf\">calcareous grasslands</a>, replete with native flowers such as <a href=\"https://www.first-nature.com/flowers/dactylorhiza-fuchsii-okellyi.php\">O\u2019Kelly\u2019s spotted orchid</a>, the perennial mountain-avens and the rare lesser twayblade orchid.</p> <p>Life attracts life; each summer, butterflies such as the pearl-bordered fritillary and the brown hairstreak can be seen in the fields, and it\u2019s now not uncommon to hear the distinctive soprano buzz of the shrill carder bee. Recent data by entomologist Dr Dara Stanley, of University College Dublin, shows that higher-scoring fields in the Burren programme have a higher species richness of bumblebees. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing in the Burren is working,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>Ireland\u2019s environmental crisis</h2> <p>The Burren scheme is no panacea. It\u2019s not easy to convince younger generations of farmers to resist the temptations \u2013 and salaries \u2013 of urban life. Dunford\u2019s current budget to pay them for nature \u2013 on average they get about \u00a36,000 a year \u2013 isn\u2019t enough to keep them all on the land. Many of Ireland\u2019s cattle end their lives in large-scale feedlots \u2013 a growing feature of the country\u2019s industrialised agrifood sector \u2013 to be fattened up before slaughter and export, mainly to the UK.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Big ships are difficult to turn around and agriculture is a very big ship</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Davoren, farmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But morale among farmers in the Burren is high and their environment is in remarkable shape. This sets it firmly apart from the majority of Irish farmland. Nature in Ireland is facing \u201cacute problems\u201d, says Dr Liam Lysaght, of the National Biodiversity Data Centre, whose scientists <a href=\"https://www.biodiversityireland.ie/the-fight-to-save-the-bees/\">predict </a>that a third of all <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/a-third-of-all-bee-species-in-ireland-could-be-extinct-by-2030-1.3543104\">bee species in the country face extinction</a> within the next 10 years.

A third of the budget goes to so-called \u201cgreening measures\u201d, designed to enhance nature and reduce emissions, but these have been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/23/eu-in-state-of-denial-over-destructive-impact-of-farming-on-wildlife\">dismal failure</a>. In March, a group of European scientists <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10080\">called for a radical change</a> to farm subsidies, arguing that the fund must be used to pay farmers for public goods, and that results-based schemes should be part of this reform. Meanwhile, the EU\u2019s new food policy, which was <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/farm2fork_en\">published last month</a>, is rooted in the kind of ecological-based farming systems that Dunford\u2019s model has pioneered. The Burren could serve as a regional template of farming for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c2b71ab043556a8fdb4ac3c97aec8175b869e68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c2b71ab043556a8fdb4ac3c97aec8175b869e68/0_214_1066_1332/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many Irish cattle end up in large-scale feedlots to be fattened up before slaughter and export, mainly to the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Caffrey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Public money for public goods is the basis of the UK\u2019s proposed replacement for EU farm subsidies.

But Brendan Dunford turned it around for us,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the past, the environment was a by-product. In the future, the environment is what we\u2019ll be producing, and the food will be a by-product.\u201d</p> <p>Dunford\u2019s guiding philosophy \u2013 that we need more farming, not less \u2013 overturns the view held by some that the only hope for nature is to erase humans from the picture and leave the land alone.

But there is still hope that some restaurants will cling to this renewed focus on community in a post-coronavirus landscape.</p> <p>In a country where a privileged group of people save labour time by eating at restaurants while others <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/uk-food-banks-face-record-demand-in-coronavirus-crisis\">rely on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/uk-food-banks-face-record-demand-in-coronavirus-crisis\">food banks</a>, the need for alternative modes of catering has taken on new resonance. Not only should access to healthy, nutritious food be a universal right, but social eating can be a solution for those reliant on mutual aid networks, whether they are elderly, disabled, vulnerable or simply lonely.&nbsp;</p> <p>An example of this approach is the <a href=\"https://www.nationalfoodservice.uk/\">National Food Service</a> (NFS), started in Sheffield two years ago, which aims to create a free-at-point-of-use social eating hub, run by local communities, in every UK neighbourhood. Since March, branches have had to switch to a takeaway and delivery model and have convinced local restaurants to join the scheme. Some restaurants are now planning to make it a permanent feature of their business model. This would involve not just supplying surplus food to NFS branches, but transforming their lunch services into contribute-what-you-can social eating spaces, subsidised with the profits they make from their dinner service.&nbsp;</p> <p>The community-owned structure of NFS not only gives those being served food more agency in making sure the meals they are given are appropriate in terms of culture, nutrition and dietary requirements, but avoids the stigma that food banks have. According to Carys Kettlety, co-founder of Bristol NFS, the way the system works means there is \u201cno segregation between rich and poor, working and non-working, deserving and undeserving\u201d.</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://granvillecommunitykitchen.wordpress.com/\">Granville Community Kitchen</a> in Kilburn, <a href=\"https://boroughmarket.org.uk/articles/the-biggest-global-issue-is-access-to-food-we-produce-enough-food-for-everyone-in-the-world-and-then-throw-half-of-it-away\">co-founder and food campaigner Dee Woods</a> has provided home-cooked food to local residents every Friday for the past six years in the form of communal dinners. During the pandemic, demand for food has spiked \u2013 and she\u2019s had to step up deliveries to two or three times per week, enlisting the help of some local restaurants. But not all contributions have been helpful, or taken into account that food poverty in London<a href=\"https://www.stateofhunger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/State-of-Hunger-Report-November2019-Digital.pdf\"> disproportionately affects </a><a href=\"https://www.stateofhunger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/State-of-Hunger-Report-November2019-Digital.pdf\">black people</a> and other people of colour.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a complete lack of culturally appropriate food,\u201d Woods told me. \u201cThe attitude of some chefs needs to change; they shouldn\u2019t think that because people are poor and they\u2019re hungry they will eat anything.\u201d Woods believes restaurants can play a role in solving the problem of food access, but that it will require a form of collaboration that divests power from the chef and moves on from restaurants simply sending on their surplus, with menus \u201cco-created with a community\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>The elephant in the room in all this is the role of the government. State-mandated food has always had a bad rep in the public consciousness, from turkey drummer school dinners to <a href=\"https://lidenz.ru/russian-stolovaya/\">Soviet stolovayas</a>. But the answer isn\u2019t to nationalise Wetherspoon\u2019s. When Beveridge and Bevan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/18/nye-bevan-history-of-nhs-national-health-service\">created the NHS</a> they did not magic it from nothing, but relied on existing structures, fleshing them out with funding and facilities. Similarly, many food justice projects already exist \u2013 from community kitchens and food-buying co-operatives, to communal food-growing in gardens and farms. Each one is already tailored to the needs of its community \u2013 all they would need is more chefs and volunteers, as well as local authority funding.</p> <p>In previous times of economic crisis, community food hubs have provided vital lifelines to communities in the form of canteens. In 1940 the minister for food, Lord Woolton, drew up plans for <a href=\"https://triedandsupplied.com/saucydressings/food-in-wartime/\">\u201ccommunal feeding centres\u201d</a> run by local authorities to supply hot food for those unable to afford restaurants. The name, in its evocation of other things that start with \u201dcommun\u201d, raised the government\u2019s hackles. Ultimately it was Churchill who, in a branding masterstroke, came up with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Restaurant\">\u201cBritish Restaurants</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Restaurant\">\u201d</a>. By 1941 they were feeding over half a million people per day, introducing the working class to the idea of dining out \u2013 and presaging the democratisation of restaurants.</p> <p>Almost 30 years later in California, the Black Panthers organised to provide <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/food/the-plate/2015/11/04/the-black-panthers-revolutionaries-free-breakfast-pioneers/\">free school breakfasts</a> for impoverished children, eventually expanding the programme to 23 cities and 20,000 children. The legacy of these projects, whether grudging or revolutionary, was not so much in how many mouths they fed, but in the conversations they started over access to food. Six years after the Panthers scheme, the government finally introduced free school breakfasts.&nbsp;</p> <p>The NFS and Granville are today\u2019s lodestars, continuing to steer these conversations about whether access to good food is a privilege or something that should be a basic tenet of a healthy society. In diaspora restaurants that give immigrants access to their home foods, in working-class cafes that serve communities and offer OAP discounts, in <a href=\"https://london.eater.com/2019/5/10/18564300/elephant-and-castle-guyanese-kaieteur-kitchen-faye-gomes-pepper-pot\">street food vendors like Faye Gomes</a> in Elephant and Castle who provide hot food to the homeless, restaurants have shown that they are already part of this conversation.

Thrilling for them and, let\u2019s be honest here, thrilling for me: I take the easing of the pandemic restrictions incredibly seriously, of course, but I\u2019ll admit, there may have been some quiet crowing about my rediscovered freedom, albeit one in which I\u2019m still unable to see my friends or parents. Whole <em>hours</em> when I can work \u2013 work! \u2013 without being interrupted by someone asking why Snoopy doesn\u2019t talk, or why they aren\u2019t allowed to drink Toilet Duck. The great wide open stretching in front of me is positively giddy-making. Time to rewatch the whole of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\" title=\"\">Parks</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\" title=\"\">And Recreation</a>\u2026 I mean, write that novel!</p> <p>But this kind of talk does not go down well with two demographics who make up the majority of my friends: people whose kids are not back to school and those who don\u2019t have kids, and so take such crowing as an implied suggestion that lockdown has been a nonstop box set binge for them. Although really, you\u2019d think my friends would know by now that I\u2019m not talking about them: it\u2019s always all about me.</p> <p>The beginning of lockdown already feels more distant than my school days, but I distinctly remember there was a hope \u2013 an expectation, even \u2013 that we would feel some kind of collective unity during this. We\u2019re all in it together! After all, why else were we doing this, if not to protect one another? But the cracks started to appear pretty quickly. There was anger (justified) at those who fled to their second homes, and a general feeling (less justified) that everyone had to acknowledge what is now known as their \u201cprivilege\u201d any time they spoke about how they were finding lockdown. Rare was the text I received in April and May that didn\u2019t include some kind of embarrassed apology for complaining when the sender had a garden/food/functioning lungs. I\u2019m not sure when the memo went out that unless you were on your deathbed you weren\u2019t allowed to find living through a global plague an ordeal, but I haven\u2019t kept up with the daily briefings.</p> <p>I\u2019m a great fan of venting. Unless people feel free to vent, their dusty complaints turn into corrosive resentments. This, I think, lies behind a tendency I increasingly noticed in myself and others this spring, which was not to complain about one\u2019s own lockdown situation, but instead to point to others who have it so much easier. Gardens were the first battleground, with people rightly pointing out that limits on outdoor activity weren\u2019t such a hardship if you have a 20ft garden out back. Then parenthood became a flashpoint, with arguments raging online about whether being locked down with children was <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/05/lockdown-is-a-miserable-time-for-parents/\" title=\"\">as much of an ordeal as parents said</a>, or just a grownup temper tantrum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> blew all this skywards when he claimed that it was totally reasonable for him and his family to go to Durham, because of his \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, which turned out to be being a parent. Suddenly, the whole of Britain, from newspaper letters pages to people on Cummings\u2019 own street, was shouting about their own circumstances \u2013 single parenthood, loneliness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/boris-johnsons-support-for-dominic-cummings-is-a-slap-in-the-face-for-us\" title=\"\">looking after toddler triplets while sick with the virus</a> \u2013 as the frustrations of the past months burst forth in an outraged gush.</p> <p>Cummings unleashed it, but this frustration had been building; the lockdown has been a slog for all. If Cummings had just acknowledged that in the first place when asked about his trip, instead of suggesting his struggle was \u201cexceptional\u201d, he\u2019d have saved himself a lot of bother. Yes, some people have had it easier than others, but engaging in lockdown hardship top trumps is only going to hurt you, as you lie awake at 4am, feeling your anxiety headache morph into a rage.

  "<p>Looking out across 130 empty acres of Chester zoo, Jamie Christon, the zoo\u2019s chief operating officer, is furious. In a conference call last weekend with government officials, zoo bosses were told that while non-essential shops can reopen on 15 June, zoo gates were to remain closed \u201cindefinitely\u201d. This was despite the fact that Christon and other zoo chiefs across the UK insist they are able to make their attractions far more \u201cCovid-secure\u201d than Primark or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/30/three-people-seriously-injured-jumping-into-sea-at-dorset-beach\">Durdle Door</a> in Dorset, where beachgoers were seen crowded together last weekend.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we see pictures of public beaches, parks and UK beauty spots busy with people, our zoo \u2013 a huge outdoor space, with 16km of pathways, and measures in place to ensure a safe environment for guests \u2013 sits empty,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cJust up the road from us in Warrington, Ikea reopened this week, an indoor space where social distancing will be much more difficult than outdoors.\u201d</p> <p>With revenue from visitors making up 97% of the zoo\u2019s income, Christon says the long period of closure is having a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on the future of the UK\u2019s most visited zoo, which he says may never reopen its doors again.<br>It costs \u00a3465,000 a month just to care for Chester zoo\u2019s 35,000 animals. With additional outgoings for utilities, insurance, maintenance and security, as well as global conservation projects and scientific research, the zoo says it needs \u00a31.6m a month just to keep going. To plug the gap, it is asking the public to <a href=\"https://www.chesterzoo.org/online-shop/adopt-an-animal/\">adopt an animal</a>, while other zoos have launched crowdfunding campaigns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abf447c36b4d41416e11e4c493a9562e985b92bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abf447c36b4d41416e11e4c493a9562e985b92bc/0_0_2479_2809/883.jpg\" alt=\"Elephants feeding in their enclosure at Chester zoo this week.\" width=\"883\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephants feeding in their enclosure at Chester zoo this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In London, Dominic Jermey is also in despair. As director general of the Zoological Society of London, he cannot reopen either London zoo or Whipsnade safari park, despite having&nbsp;\u201credesigned the whole experience at our&nbsp;zoos&nbsp;to make them Covid-secure\u201d.</p> <p>He said he couldn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s rationale. \u201cOur&nbsp;zoos&nbsp;should be part of the solution to Covid, providing Covid-secure outdoor experiences where a population emerging from lockdown can visit with confidence,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, the longer we stay closed, the less likely we are to survive the lockdown.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In Scotland, where the devolved government has been more cautious in easing lockdown restrictions, zoo bosses face a similar situation.</p> <p>The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland said it will be ready to reopen Edinburgh zoo and the Highland wildlife park by the end of June, but has warned that being closed over the summer months could be \u201cfinancially disastrous\u201d.</p> <p>A wide range of safety measures is being put in place by the wildlife conservation charity, which has had to borrow \u00a35m due to the coronavirus pandemic and the closure of both parks.</p> <p>In Colwyn Bay, the Welsh Mountain zoo, Wales\u2019 national zoo, has also been \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d funds, according to Jen Jesse, director of operations and administration.</p> <p>She said the zoo would have made at least \u00a3500,000 in the past two months, and that even with closed doors and 17 staff furloughed, a zoo is a very expensive endeavour.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we have cut expenditure, we cannot furlough our dedicated keepers. You cannot, basically, \u2018switch off\u2019 a zoo,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The&nbsp;government says it is working to understand how and when zoos and aquariums can safely reopen and says it provided a \u00a314m support fund for English zoos but big zoos \u2013&nbsp;including Chester and London \u2013 complain they were exempt.</p> <p>Asked about zoos in the daily government briefing on Friday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cI very much hope that we can get zoos reopened in a safe and Covid-secure way, but of course it has got to be done in way that doesn\u2019t allow the R [the virus reproduction rate] to go above 1.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&nbsp; said: \u201cWe understand the challenges faced by zoos and aquariums but it\u2019s vital that we do not move too quickly in reopening to ensure public health is protected.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Max Brooks is getting a little tired of being proved right. An author with cult appeal and massive sales, he is regularly referred to as \u201ca soothsayer\u201d and \u201ca genius\u201d. His 2006 novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/world-war-z-9780715653739.html\">World War Z</a></em>, was about a deadly virus originating in China that causes global devastation, and his compulsive new one, <em>Devolution: A Firsthand Account of the Sasquatch Massacre</em>, is about people forced into self-isolation, huddling in terror from an unimaginable threat outside. But Brooks, 47, is dismissive of the hyperbole: \u201cEverything I write about has already happened. The history of pandemics tends to come in extremely predictable cycles. So if I\u2019m the smartest guy in the room, we\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d he tells me over Skype from his home in Los Angeles (our interview was in May, before the national protests after the killing of George Floyd, but well after lockdown started.). He has the jittery energy of the chronically anxious, and the easy confidence of one who has been thoroughly validated.</p> <p>He certainly saw the coronavirus coming long before most politicians, and was making preparations in January. On 16 March, when most people in the western world were barely getting to grips with the lockdown, he made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40yPXcMaOw\">a video</a> about the importance of social distancing to protect the elderly. He enlisted the help of the oldest person in his life, his father, comedy god, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mel-brooks\">Mel Brooks</a>. \u201cIf I get the coronavirus, I\u2019ll probably be OK. But if I give it to him, he could give it to Carl Reiner, who can give it to Dick Van Dyke, and before I know it, I\u2019ve wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends,\u201d says Brooks, pointing to his father behind a glass door and listing his closest friends. The video has been watched more than 16m times. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given some secret information. I got my information from the news. Really deep state: turning on CNN and watching Wuhan getting locked down,\u201d he says dryly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought World War Z was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, he even scared himself when he predicted a day in his own life. Despite its title, <em>Devolution</em> has nothing to do with Scottish political independence, \u201cand I\u2019ll do a Scottish apology tour if it\u2019s a problem, from the Outer Hebrides to Hadrian\u2019s Wall,\u201d he says. It tells the story of an eco-community that is cut off from the outside world after a volcano erupts, and that is only the start of their problems. The novel is largely told through the journal of Kate, one of the community\u2019s inhabitants, and in one scene she warns her partner, Dan, against cleaning the solar panels on their roof, because she\u2019s worried he\u2019ll hurt himself. \u201cInjury turns you from a giver to a taker,\u201d another inhabitant adds.</p> <p>Cut to spring 2020 and Brooks is in lockdown at home with his wife, Michelle Kholos (\u201cthe greatest playwright in the world!\u201d) and their teenage son, Henry. He heads up to clean out the gutters on the roof. \u201cAnd my wife said: \u2018Oh no you don\u2019t! If you fall, you can\u2019t cook, you can\u2019t clean, you just consume resources,\u2019\u201d he recalls. Does it freak him out to live in his own books? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t freak me out, it saddens me. Because I would much rather be wrong,\u201d he says</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"692456b7031b29eae1c48141a6a3275ae8315866\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/692456b7031b29eae1c48141a6a3275ae8315866/0_102_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Pitt, left, and Daniella Kertesz in the 2013 film adaptation of World War Z.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brad Pitt, left, and Daniella Kertesz in the 2013 film adaptation of World War Z.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>World War Z,</em> which uses zombies as a metaphor for the Sars virus, with the infected turning into killer creatures, takes a geopolitical perspective of a pandemic, with each country responding to the crisis in characteristic style: Israel makes brutally pragmatic choices to save itself; the US is overconfident about its exceptionalism. The parallels with today are breathtaking.</p> <p>\u201cBut on a personal level, the day-to-day life of what we\u2019re all going through now, that\u2019s played out in <em>Devolution</em>. And that I did not expect,\u201d says Brooks. And that\u2019s no surprise, given <em>Devolution</em> is a thriller about Big Foot. Yet the novel provides very practical solutions for how to deal with isolation and fear \u2013 growing your own vegetable garden, seeking out small groups of trusted friends \u2013 and it is to Brooks\u2019s credit that his galumphing beasts are genuinely scary, as opposed to laughable. When I make the mistake of mentioning the saccharine 1980s Big Foot family comedy, <em>Harry and the Hendersons</em>, Brooks \u2013 who takes his responsibilities to fans of horror (\u201cmy tribe\u201d) as seriously as any other part of his research \u2013 recoils in disgust: \u201cNoooo!\u201d</p> <p>Brooks has always been a worrier. When I ask if he was an anxious kid, he reels back as if I\u2019d asked if the Pacific Ocean is wet: \u201cOh GAHHHHD. Yes!\u201d he gasps. He researches disasters because it\u2019s when he doesn\u2019t understand something, or what to do about it, that he spins out. \u201cKnowledge calms me down. I can deal with fear, it\u2019s the anxiety I have trouble with,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a testament to the thoroughness of his research that after the publication of <em>World War Z </em>he was invited to join the Modern War Institute at West Point as a <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/max-brooks/\">non-resident fellow</a>. There, he writes articles about \u201cnon-military issues that could turn violent in the future,\u201d he says, such as a recent piece about <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/food-insecurity-the-real-danger-of-monsantos-sale-to-bayer/\">how corporations now control the food chain</a>, and he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgq04T9YOCc\">lectures cadets</a> about how to think creatively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/maxbrooksauthor/status/1239624352305303552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A message from me and my dad, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MelBrooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Melbrooks</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontBeASpreader?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DontBeASpreader</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Hqhc4fFXbe\">pic.twitter.com/Hqhc4fFXbe</a></p>&mdash; Max Brooks (@maxbrooksauthor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxbrooksauthor/status/1239624352305303552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But how to educate the public? He knows some people don\u2019t listen to lectures, or even the news. So instead he channels his knowledge into popular fiction. \u201cI write about fictional threats, because they\u2019re easier for people to deal with, but I provide factual solutions,\u201d he says. <em>World War Z</em>, which has sold over 1m copies, has been named among the <a href=\"https://www.duckworthbooks.co.uk/horribly-good-books/\">best horror books of all time</a>, alongside Stephen King\u2019s <em>It</em> and Bram Stoker\u2019s <em>Dracula</em>. But Brooks\u2019s writing hero is thriller writer Tom Clancy, famously another fan of research. \u201cThe best way to educate is to entertain. In the second world war, the US government got Hollywood on board to break down the complicated strategic ideas into very simple stories, and America used to be the best at that. But somewhere along the line we gave up,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While stressing that he\u2019s \u201cquite proud to be the child of these two awesome parents\u201d \u2013 his mother was the late, great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/08/obituaries.news\">Anne Bancroft</a> \u2013 Brooks has generally kept his parents at arm\u2019s length from his career. Unlike plenty of other Hollywood progeny, he has not wanted to be known as anyone\u2019s junior, because he found out early on that it would only hurt him: his first book, <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em> (2003), was originally marketed as \u201cMel Brooks Jr writes <em>Young Frankenstein</em> part two!\u201d The book flopped, \u201cand no surprise, because the media looked at it and said: \u2018This is the least funny book ever\u2019, and the horror people thought Mel Brooks\u2019s brat was taking a giant dump on something they loved,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone wanted Anne Bancroft to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brooks is not anyone\u2019s image of a Hollywood brat. Yes, his parents had famous friends: Reiner, Van Dyke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gene-wilder\">Gene Wilder</a>. But when they would all meet up on Sundays, they tended to talk about whether anyone had found a good dentist in Los Angeles, and who knew of a decent car mechanic. \u201cThey were all immigrants to this town \u2013 they were trying to figure out how to live,\u201d Brooks says. The family was comfortable, but his father drove him to school in a Honda Accord 1982 (\u201cbest car ever\u201d) because, he told his son: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to make your fortune. But don\u2019t drive your fortune past people who are starving.\u201d His dad may have written the line, \u201cIf you got it, flaunt it\u201d, for <em>The Producers</em>, but that was very much not how he lived. \u201cBoth my parents came from poverty and most people who are first-generation wealth always worry they\u2019re going to lose their money, because they\u2019re not really sure where it came from,\u201d says Brooks. His father lives close by in Santa Monica and, until the virus started, he would come to Brooks\u2019s house every evening before heading off for his nightly dinner with his best friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/20/love-and-free-food-mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner-share-the-secrets-of-their-70-year-friendship\">Carl Reiner</a>. These days, Brooks and his son go to his father\u2019s house and wave at him through the glass door, just as he did in the video.</p> <p>Brooks has his mother\u2019s dark Italian colouring and his father\u2019s features as well as his wit. (When I ask if he liked the 2013 movie adaptation of <em>World War Z</em>, starring Brad Pitt, he replies: \u201cI thought it was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote.\u201d) He credits his love of science and research to his mother: \u201cIn show business they only ever want one flavour and everyone just wanted her to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes \u2013 but I did. Everything I am comes from her,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Bancroft was 40 when she was pregnant with Brooks and had long since given up hope of conceiving. She was asked if she wanted a test for Down\u2019s syndrome, but was warned if she had a termination she would never be able to get pregnant again. Bancroft refused, saying she would love this baby whatever. \u201cSo I was very ... appreciated,\u201d says Brooks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America has the most incompetent, disastrous, captain ever, but the ship has had mechanical problems for some time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a child, he struggled with reading, and although the school dismissed him as another lazy Hollywood kid, his mother suspected he was dyslexic. She was right. There was little help available to dyslexic kids in the early 80s, but in 1959 Bancroft had won an Oscar for her performance in <em>The Miracle Worker </em>as Annie Sullivan, who taught Helen Keller, who was deaf and blind, how to read. So she knew about services available to blind children and she adapted them for her son, such as turning his schoolbooks into audiobooks, so he could read along to the tapes. \u201cPeople assume because of who my parents are that I had this very privileged childhood. And they\u2019re damn right, because I had this incredible mother who understood her son,\u201d he says. His father, he says, \u201cwas busy feeding us. My parents were great partners.\u201d Bancroft died from uterine cancer in 2005, two months after Brooks\u2019s son was born, \u201cso she got to be a grandmother for a bit. Thank God,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After college, Brooks worked briefly at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, but soon realised he is really more of a solo worker than a collaborator. At 31, he published <em>The Zombie Survival Guide</em>, turning a lifetime of anxiety about existential threats into something potentially productive. For every one hour of writing, he says, he spends up to 100 hours researching, \u201cand that totally comes from my mom\u201d. People often ask if writing about zombies and Big Foot and apocalypses scares him, because they don\u2019t understand that the writing calms him down. But now he has a different problem: he knows too much.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t pacify myself with the ignorant notion that we were caught unaware [by the virus]. I can\u2019t go to bed at night thinking, we didn\u2019t have a plan so all the mistakes are forgivable. Here it is!\u201d he says, brandishing a thick wodge of papers, which is the National Response Framework, the United States\u2019s plan for how to respond to emergencies. \u201cSo there is absolutely a plan.\u201d According to Brooks, if America had fully locked down the country for three weeks, instead of doing it piecemeal state by state, and maintained a strict lockdown, the virus would have gone.</p> <p>I ask if the problem was the incumbent president. \u201cI don\u2019t want to blame everything on Trump. America has the most incompetent, disastrous, dangerous captain that we\u2019ve ever had. But the ship has had mechanical problems for some time,\u201d he says. He launches into an engrossing monologue about how trust in the government has collapsed, after it was attacked first by the left in the 1960s, then by the right in the 80s, eroding public trust to a disastrous effect. \u201cWe have planted a very bitter crop, and now it\u2019s harvest time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But none of this explains why the UK\u2019s response has been so terrible, I say. He throws his hands in the air, exasperated. \u201cI expected all this from us. But I did not expect it from you. I\u2019m shocked, because you already had a national health service, you\u2019re much more unified than us, you still understand the need for government. So what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d he asks. There are some questions even Max Brooks can\u2019t answer.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Max Brooks is on Twitter @maxbrooksauthor</em></p>",

That lasted more than two years, but it\u2019s one particular night I\u2019m thinking of \u2013 the sweats and shivers, and the fear that I\u2019m not going to make it through till morning. After that, I used to check my pulse every time I woke up to see if I was alive.</p> <p>Last night Diane took me to the emergency GP. The GP was lovely, caring, cautious. But too cautious. Diane told her I\u2019d gone a bit loopy. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly in my sleep. I\u2019m perfectly sane and lucid in the day.\u201d The doctor asked me what day it was, how many fingers she was holding up. Thursday, four fingers. She said to Diane that I may have sepsis. Perhaps I ought to go to hospital, even if only as a precaution. Sepsis can kill, she said. Sepsis my arse, I said to Diane on the way home. I\u2019ve got a urine infection and I just want to go back to bed.</p> <p>I\u2019m still shivering and sweating when Diane wakes up. She says we\u2019re going to the hospital. No, I say, I just want to sweat it out. I want to wrap the duvet around me and turn into a Simon burrito.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to A&amp;E,\u201d Diane says.</p> <p>I tell her I don\u2019t want to go.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so unyielding!\u201d I shout. Diane and I rarely argue. She looks upset. I don\u2019t know where the word unyielding comes from; I\u2019ve certainly never said it to Diane before.</p> <p>A&amp;E is packed. Valentine\u2019s Day, but nothing romantic about it. I am expecting to wait for hours, but as soon as I see the triage nurse, they put me on a bed in a cubicle. Within minutes, they\u2019ve inserted a canula. They test my blood pressure, my oxygen level, temperature. None of it is quite normal, but my temperature is the biggest concern \u2013 over 39C. Ever since the misdiagnosis of my encephalitis (my doctor, who just happened to be my dad\u2019s best friend, told me I was a malingerer, and suggested that Mum had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/aug/19/features11.g21\" title=\"\">Munchausen</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/aug/19/features11.g21\" title=\"\"> syndrome by proxy</a>), I have been terrified of being called a hypochondriac and done my best to stay away from hospital.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Three days of IV antibiotics get rid of my urinary infection and my temperature. The only thing is, I\u2019ve started to cough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re treating it as sepsis,\u201d the doctor says, more to Diane than me. \u201cIf it\u2019s not sepsis, he\u2019s on the road to sepsis. We\u2019re going to put him on IV antibiotics. It\u2019s the Domestos treatment \u2013 kills all bugs.\u201d I smile. It sounds good. And, best of all, I\u2019m being believed.</p> <p>This small ward (six beds) is where people come when they\u2019re admitted straight from A&amp;E. It isn\u2019t full. Ilias is in agony with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/sickle-cell-disease\" title=\"\">sickle cell anaemia</a>; he\u2019s on morphine to ease the pain, but it makes him horribly itchy. The man next to me is out for the count: heavy, middle-aged, he just collapsed the other day and was rushed in. Barry, the fella closest to the window, is having tests. He\u2019s had an unlucky couple of years during which he\u2019s been in and out of hospital \u2013 a terrible car crash, broken back, urinary infections, and now goodness knows what. There is a spoilt young lad who plays his films and music at top volume. </p> <p>The IV paracetamol brings my temperature right down. Then it whizzes back, to almost 40C. I sit on the edge of my bed hugging my coat. The number game starts again; I still can\u2019t get past nine. They put me back on the IV paracetamol. Again, it does the trick.</p> <p>It\u2019s early evening and Diane and my younger daughter, Maya, have to leave. This is my first night in hospital since I was 11, and I\u2019m weepy. I\u2019ve got my laptop and headphones, and I\u2019m playing the same song on a loop: the medley from the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road \u2013 Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight and The End. I feel as if I\u2019m grieving, but I don\u2019t know what for.</p> <p>Saturday, I\u2019m feeling stronger. There\u2019s a camaraderie on the ward. The nurses are beyond wonderful \u2013 endlessly patient with difficult patients, physically strong, kind. Likewise the ancillary staff who keep the place virtually spotless. Sure, there\u2019s a cockroach in the loo, but it\u2019s more pet than threat.</p> <p>I am given three lots of IV antibiotics a day for three days. The nurses wake me gently in the night to test my blood pressure and oxygen levels. I am sent for a chest X-ray. Within a couple of days, I\u2019m feeling human. My appetite is back. Even the food is good: lamb dhansak and chickpeas, jerk chicken with rice and peas, fish and chips with mushy peas.</p> <p>Everybody is talking about the terrible virus that appears to be decimating China. Three weeks ago, a whole city, Wuhan, was placed under quarantine. Unbelievable. Two weeks ago, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency and named the disease Covid-19, short for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d. Almost 1,400 people have died in China, and today France has announced the first Covid-19 death in Europe. Thankfully, there\u2019s nothing here yet, though we are being advised to wash our hands regularly for 20 seconds while singing God Save The Queen.</p> <p>Miraculously, three days of IV antibiotics and paracetamol get rid of my urinary tract infection and my temperature. The only thing is, I\u2019ve started to cough, badly. I\u2019ve been susceptible to chest infections since my encephalitis. Back then, I was rushed to hospital with a pneumonia that almost did for me, and ended up staying there for six weeks.</p> <p>My chest feels dreadful by Monday morning. The doctors so far have been lovely \u2013 all women, all good listeners. The doctor who discharges me is a young man, and not a good listener. He says he thinks I\u2019ll be fine to go home today, if that\u2019s OK. It feels like a rhetorical question. I don\u2019t want to say it isn\u2019t fine (who wants to stay in hospital, however good the food?) and I don\u2019t want to sound aggressive. So I tell him I think I have a chest infection, and would perhaps benefit from another chest X-ray. He doesn\u2019t seem to hear. A few minutes later I search him out and say I\u2019m worried, because I have a history of chest infections and pneumonia. He tells me the antibiotics will take care of that.</p> <p>I feel sad to say goodbye to Ilias and Barry, and sad because one infection seems to have been replaced by another. Sure, I\u2019m no longer crazy feverish, but nor would I say I was fixed. Still, they obviously need the beds.</p> <h2>20 February: \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound good\u2019</h2> <p>Yesterday the global death toll from Covid-19 passed 2,000. Meanwhile, my chest is getting rawer and sorer. I head to the GP where a locum really listens \u2013 to me and my chest. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good at all,\u201d she says. \u201cCould be pneumonia. I think you should get back to the hospital for an X-ray.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc9e8317be15cc35163670213c15e39aa751e0dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc9e8317be15cc35163670213c15e39aa751e0dc/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Hattenstone, photographed by his daughter in hospital on 20 February with a nebuliser over his nose and mouth\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re going to put you on a nebuliser for 20 minutes\u2019: Simon Hattenstone, photographed by his daughter in hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maya Hattenstone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I see another young male doctor at A&amp;E. He asks me if I get asthma attacks. Occasionally, I say, but this doesn\u2019t feel anything like asthma.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s asthma,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI think I need an X-ray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou had an X-ray last week. It was clear and we don\u2019t want to irradiate you.\u201d But there was no reason it shouldn\u2019t have been clear; it didn\u2019t feel infected at that point.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to put you on a nebuliser for 20 minutes,\u201d he says. Afterwards, he takes off my mask. \u201cAny better?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cBut it does feel like I\u2019ve been on a mini break to the seaside.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOK, we\u2019ll give you another 20 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Asthma asks if I use an inhaler. I tell him I sometimes use a blue Ventolin, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have any effect.</p> <p>\u201cDo you inhale straight from the Ventolin or have you got an AeroChamber?\u201d</p> <p>I look blank.</p> <p>\u201cAh well, that\u2019s it. They\u2019re useless without the chambers. I\u2019m going to give you one to take home.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m beginning to think he may be a salesman rather than a doctor. Then he gives me a packet of steroids, which puts my mind at rest.</p> <p>Eight tiny pills, a few times a day. They make no difference, except for making me feel sick when they stick in my throat. My breathing is getting worse.</p> <h2>Early March: do we cancel our big party?</h2> <p>Diane and I have been together for over 30 years, and in January we got \u201ccivilled\u201d; civil partnerships for mixed-sex relationships had just been introduced. We were only the fourth heterosexual couple to get one in the London borough of Haringey, and were a little bit proud of it. It was a great day \u2013 surprisingly romantic, fun, history-making (if you count fourth). Only immediate family were there, but we are planning a big party in two weeks \u2013 by far the biggest we\u2019ve ever hosted. We\u2019ve invited more than 200 people, and even if I\u2019m not on top form, it\u2019s only one evening. It will be great anyway.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO has just raised the global risk of spread of Covid-19 from \u201chigh\u201d to \u201cvery high\u201d. \u201cThis is a reality check for every government on the planet. Wake up. Get ready,\u201d says Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme.</p> <p>Everybody has started talking about how vulnerable old people are, and the need for social distancing. I am slightly worried about my symptoms. We don\u2019t want to kill off our guests, after all. I phone the GP, hang on for the obligatory 20 minutes before reception passes me to a doctor. \u201cCan I check whether I was tested for coronavirus in hospital?\u201d I ask. They did so many tests, but I haven\u2019t a clue what for. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and puts down the phone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I promise you, you do not have coronavirus, you\u2019re just getting better from what may have been a little chest infection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The public are being advised to phone NHS 111 if they are worried they might have coronavirus. After half an hour I get through. If you have symptoms, you go through the process again. Eventually I get through to a helpful nurse. \u201cYes, those sound like Covid-19 symptoms,\u201d she says. \u201cWould you prefer to see your GP or the emergency GP at the hospital?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmergency GP at the hospital,\u201d I say, too enthusiastically.</p> <p>The hospital GP is charm personified. I tell her I\u2019m worried I may have Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cHave you been abroad recently, to China or Italy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you been in contact with anybody who has had coronavirus?\u201d How on earth do I know, I think.</p> <p>She gets out her stethoscope: \u201cA little bit of wheeziness, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>She asks me to blow into a peak flow meter. I take a mighty breath and reach 450.</p> <p>\u201cWonderful! 500!\u201d she says. \u201cAbsolutely nothing to worry about.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if I can try again because I normally do better on a second go. It\u2019s 350. And the third time. She ignores those readings. \u201c500. Wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe to have our party? I\u2019ve heard about this social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely safe. I promise you, you do not have coronavirus, you\u2019re just getting better from what may have been a little chest infection.\u201d</p> <p>I go home relieved. When Diane returns, I tell her I definitely don\u2019t have Covid-19: it\u2019s game on for the party. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you thought you did have it,\u201d she says.</p> <p> On 3 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, boasts on telly about shaking hands with the Covid-19 patients he\u2019s just met. In fact, the PM seems to be getting more insouciant by the day. On 5 March he suggests that, rather than locking down the country, \u201cone of the theories is that perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease, as it were, to move through the population, without taking as many draconian measures\u201d. Apparently, this is known as herd immunity.</p> <h2>10 March: the empty clinic</h2> <p>Nothing is shifting. I am breathless climbing the stairs. The asthma pump makes no difference. I ring the surgery and tell the doctor that I wasn\u2019t given an X-ray at hospital. \u201cOh, poor love,\u201d says Dr Niceynice. \u201cBless you. That\u2019s shocking. I\u2019m booking you in for one right this minute.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Niceynice is magnificent at phone empathy, less good at face-to-face appointments. She sends me to the smaller local hospital up the road. It\u2019s gloriously empty. A man in a mask ushers me to a waiting area, but before I have time to sit down I\u2019m whisked off for the X-ray. In and out.</p> <p>An hour after getting home, I get a call from Dr Niceynice. \u201cYour X-ray\u2019s clear,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, but\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Too late. Dr Niceynice has put the phone down.</p> <h2>12 March: a pandemic</h2> <p>My wheezing sounds like feedback \u2013 a song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/my-bloody-valentine\" title=\"\">My Bloody Valentine</a> may have written in their heyday. Diane says she\u2019s worried. Yesterday the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Everybody seems to be talking about why Britain hasn\u2019t gone into lockdown; why is everything going on as normal?</p> <p>At night I can\u2019t sleep.</p> <p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you think it is?\u201d Diane says.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe a bit of pneumonia, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m getting better.\u201d</p> <p> We tell our guests we\u2019re going ahead with the party. Great, ping back the emails, we need something to celebrate.</p> <p>My sister, Sharon, and I argue for the first time ever. She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for Mum to come to the party and wants me to tell her not to. I say I\u2019m happy for her not to come, but I\u2019m not going to <em>tell</em> her not to. Mum, an incredibly youthful if shrunken 92-year-old, could stay alive by locking herself away and having a miserable existence, or she could take a few risks and thoroughly enjoy her final years, I say; it\u2019s the difference between living and existing. Ugh. I can\u2019t believe I said that. Smug git.</p> <p>I phone Mum, tell her not to come, and burst out crying to Sharon.</p> <p>Then Ireland announces its lockdown. We decide it\u2019s time to cancel our party, whatever the UK government is or isn\u2019t doing. \u201cWe\u2019re so relieved,\u201d our friends say. \u201cWe would have come, but it would have been so strange not being able to kiss and hug, and dancing at a distance.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I am so relieved we cancelled our party; who wants a party hosted by a horseman of the apocalypse?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the next day, 10 people in Britain have died and there are nearly 2,000 confirmed cases. Diane is determined to get me seen at A&amp;E before a lockdown. When we get there, it is scarily empty. A couple of minutes later, a doctor calls me into the cubicle.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are your symptoms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPersistent cough and breathing difficulties.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s young and kindly looking, but sounds angry. \u201cWhy did you come here today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was told to come back if there was no progress. It\u2019s got worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut why today?\u201d</p> <p>Stay calm, I tell myself. I\u2019ve been on antibiotics for three weeks and I\u2019m still no better. If it\u2019s a virus, I want to know if it is <em>the</em> virus.</p> <p>He gets out his stethoscope and listens closely. I wheeze in and wheeze out.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound wheezy to me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Jesus, they\u2019ve moved the goalposts on sickness. Last week the GP suggested it was pneumonia; today I\u2019m worse and the doctor\u2019s telling me I\u2019m fine.</p> <p>\u201cSo why today?\u201d he asks again.</p> <p>\u201cOh bollocks to this,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not come here to be made to feel like a hypochondriac. I hate hospitals \u2013 this is the last place I want to be. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I get off the bed.</p> <p>My outburst shocks him into politeness, and upsets me. \u201cLook,\u201d I say, \u201cI know it\u2019s not your fault, you\u2019re just doing what you\u2019ve been told to. I\u2019m sorry. If we were allowed to hug, I\u2019d give you a great big hug.\u201d He looks terrified.</p> <p>But he\u2019s started to soften. \u201cI can hear something,\u201d he concedes. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI used to, about 14 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve got COPD [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/breakthrough-science/2017/oct/23/the-life-changing-lung-disease-that-often-goes-undiagnosed\" title=\"\">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>]. I\u2019ll write a report for your GP.\u201d</p> <p>But until a few weeks ago my lungs were fine, I say. I ran six miles, three or four times a week. </p> <p>\u201cYes, COPD,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Back home I discover Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has just announced that 60% of the country \u2013 40-odd million people \u2013 need to catch the virus for us to build up herd immunity. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to beat coronavirus, Vallance suggests, adding that we don\u2019t want to \u201cswamp and overwhelm NHS services\u201d. Perhaps that\u2019s why Dr Angry had been so upset: I was swamping the empty hospital.</p> <p>Apparently, the NHS has also stopped testing for Covid-19, apart from the most serious cases in hospital. Anybody with a fever or \u201ccontinuous cough\u201d should simply stay at home.</p> <p>Two days after Vallance\u2019s announcement, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\" title=\"\">Matt</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\" title=\"\"> Hancock</a>, tells us we all misunderstood; herd immunity was never part of the plan. This may have something to do with the outcry that followed \u2013 when everyone did the sums and realised the government was talking about the deaths of 500,000 British people.</p> <h2>14 March: the ambulance</h2> <p>My breathing is deteriorating. In bed at night, I sound like a cattle farm. Diane and my daughters tell me off for using the phone. I can barely get a sentence out without spluttering. I\u2019m dizzy and my head hurts. I\u2019ve also developed a dull, persistent ache in my leg \u2013 the kind you often get with a virus.</p> <p> On Saturday, the day before our non-party, my breathing takes a turn for the worse. I am so relieved we cancelled; who wants a party hosted by a horseman of the apocalypse? Diane says she\u2019ll phone for the ambulance. I tell her not to be daft. A few minutes later, she says gently, \u201cShould I call the ambulance now?\u201d Yes, I nod.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa5f5fba1da537912e8a1ed3937bc6a6955c1f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa5f5fba1da537912e8a1ed3937bc6a6955c1f65/0_663_5412_5255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A thermometer glowing as if it is hot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"971\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The ambulance is here in five minutes. They arrive in space-age blue suits, heavy boots, masks and goggles. They\u2019re certainly not lacking in PPE. Just the sight of them seems to improve my breathing. There are three of them \u2013 warm, likable, funny. They test my oxygen levels and take my blood pressure.</p> <p>\u201cNothing much wrong with your breathing,\u201d says one of them. \u201cMy breathing is worse than yours.\u201d</p> <p>I can see neighbours across the road staring at the ambulance. The three paramedics say they are going to sit in it to write their report. They return and tell me I\u2019ve got Covid-19. I\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>How d\u2019you know, I wheeze. I mean, on either front.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it seems like Covid-19. Covid-19 symptoms. Try not to call us again. I know it\u2019s tempting when you\u2019re struggling with breathing.\u201d The female paramedic shows me some deep breathing exercises, though I can barely shallow breathe. \u201cAs I say, try not to call again because we\u2019re very busy,\u201d she says to Diane. \u201cBut if his lips turn blue, ring 999.\u201d</p> <h2>15 March: no party, more tests</h2> <p>Giving away \u00a35,000 worth of food isn\u2019t as simple as you\u2019d think \u2013 not now, anyway. Eventually we find two takers: a drop-in for migrants and a homeless shelter. On Monday morning, our older daughter, Alix, delivers the food. She returns elated. Everybody was so happy to get it, she says, and suddenly it doesn\u2019t feel that the money was wasted. The party just took a different form. She brings back a few samples \u2013 mushroom flan, teriyaki salmon, cheesecake, lots of lovely salads.</p> <p>On 17 March the prime minister urges the British public to \u201cavoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues\u201d. Stanley Johnson, his 79-year-old father, is having none of it. \u201cCourse I\u2019ll go to the pub if I need to,\u201d <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KkFJcMnUNyg\" title=\"\">he tells Phil and Holly on This Morning</a>. The Johnson family are good value, they\u2019d make an entertaining reality TV show; I just wish they weren\u2019t in politics.</p> <p>By now, it\u2019s more or less impossible to see a doctor. The GP surgery is closed down; A&amp;E visits are a no-no. We are told to ring NHS 111 if we\u2019re worried, but we can\u2019t get through. Soon enough the government tells us we\u2019re better off going to <a href=\"https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/\" title=\"\">its Covid-19 website</a>, which tells us to self-isolate. It\u2019s a vicious circle of self-isolating helplessness.</p> <p>I tweet Boris Johnson. \u201cDear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson\" title=\"\">@BorisJohnson</a>, I am sat at home struggling to breathe, as too many people are. You\u2019ve finally got the job you want, and within weeks you have created an NHS that tests for NOTHING &amp; leaves us all gasping for air, helpless in the greatest crisis of our lives. Act now. TEST US.\u201d No response.</p> <p>I decide to go private, for the first time in my life, only it\u2019s near impossible to get an appointment with a respiratory specialist; they\u2019re too busy saving lives for the NHS. Eventually, one agrees to a phone consultation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I tell the doctor we are Guardian journalists. He becomes animated, and tells us there is a desperate shortage of PPE</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr Lung asks about my history, my symptoms, when the chest complaint developed. He tells me I need a lung scan, but there is a problem \u2013 the private hospital isn\u2019t allowing respiratory patients in. Don\u2019t worry, he says, we can see you on the NHS \u2013 get the tests done, the scan, the works. I\u2019m relieved, but it also makes me feel even worse. So this is how private medicine works in a pandemic: I\u2019m using a private referral to queue-jump, and not even paying for it. Morally queasy doesn\u2019t begin to cover it, but I am desperate. \u201cGo to the hospital and my colleague will see you,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There\u2019s something postapocalyptic about the hospital. Deadly silent. Security on the front door. They block our way in: why are we here? \u201cI\u2019ve got a persistent cough. Breathing problems. I\u2019ve been sent here by Dr Lung.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cOK, follow me.\u201d The man leads us to a side entrance usually reserved for ambulance arrivals. There is one other person here \u2013 a chatty woman with asthma who takes off her mask to eat her KFC when the staff aren\u2019t looking. There is a different kind of intensity to the hospital today; the bonhomie of my last visit has gone. Then, it felt the hospital was just preparing; now, it\u2019s the real thing.</p> <p>A red-haired doctor examines me. Halfway through, he apologises and says he has to rush to a meeting. Then he returns, listens to my chest, asks what I do. I tell him Diane and I are Guardian journalists. He becomes animated, and tells us there is a desperate shortage of PPE. Meanwhile, he says, they are short-staffed because so many people have had to take time off with symptoms, because they can\u2019t be tested. </p> <p>The only people who <em>do</em> seem to be getting tested are celebrities, footballers and politicians. Tell me about it, he says. I say that I want a test because, if it\u2019s not coronavirus, then I can start looking for other conditions \u2013 hopefully treatable ones. He says he\u2019s happy to admit me, but if he were me he\u2019d steer well clear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have Covid-19 now, you probably will by the time you leave.\u201d I decide to go home without the test. They do the regular tests instead \u2013 blood oxygen, blood pressure, then one swab up a nostril and another in my mouth \u2013 and book me in for a lung scan in a few days. The doctor tells me he thinks I\u2019ve made the right decision and pats me on the arm affectionately. </p> <p>\u201cOi,\u201d I say: I thought we weren\u2019t supposed to be touching. He smiles. I hope he\u2019s going to be OK.</p> <h2>20 March: a new perspective</h2> <p>It\u2019s so quiet and peaceful in the night, give or take my wheezing. Everything starts to make sense. Of course it\u2019s terrible that all these people are dying, but the world is renewing itself. This always happens at some point, when things get out of control. Today the sky was a cloudless blue, there were hardly any cars on the road, the air felt pure and you could hear the birds making whoopee. The dawn chorus makes the silence even more profound. If this is the planet renewing itself, then we\u2019ve all got to do our bit.</p> <p>The world is beginning to feel unrecognisable. On 20 March the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>, announces that a rightwing Brexiteering government will pay 80% of a salary up to \u00a32,500 a month for those not working during the coronavirus crisis, if their companies agree to keep them on. Bankers are an irrelevance now. The key workers are the same doctors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a> was so critical of when he was health secretary; the same nurses for whom the Tories gleefully blocked a pay rise; the same supermarket workers whom the government contemptuously dismissed as unskilled.</p> <p>Every issue is illustrated in curves these days. There\u2019s the curve for those who don\u2019t know they have it; the curve for those who have a mild illness; and the curve for those who die. But what about the inbetweeny curve \u2013 for those who have been chronically ill for ages but are going to get better without ventilators and admission to the Covid-19 wards? The curve for those who happen to get a terrible chest condition while a pandemic is raging, but feel they don\u2019t have the right to complain because others are suffering far worse? The curve for those who go on to live long, fulfilled lives. I want to be on one of those.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"450d727d2a53a619f089e36decabaf129574ff4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450d727d2a53a619f089e36decabaf129574ff4a/0_2191_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A packet of tablets with three out\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Later, I head back to the hospital for my lung scan. The roads are clear and I walk into the empty hospital. There\u2019s one older man in a mask waiting for a scan. A computerised voice tells me to hold my breath while the scanner closes in.</p> <p>A couple of days later, I meet my urologist on the phone. I started seeing him for a urinary tract infection a few months ago, but I\u2019ve always had my doubts about him; I suspect he\u2019s keen to whip my prostate out before I\u2019m ready.</p> <p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, actually, I had another infection that turned into sepsis and I was hospitalised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Really?\u201d says Dr Piss. \u201cWell, perhaps it\u2019s time for the operation.\u201d He finds my notes and is quickly up to speed. He even has my chest X-ray. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got an area of pneumonia on the X-ray.\u201d</p> <p>No, I say, it was clear.</p> <p>No, he says, there\u2019s an area: not full-blown, but pneumonia.</p> <p>When was it taken, I ask.</p> <p>\u201cMid-February, in hospital,\u201d he says. This was a couple of days before my chest got bad. It must have already been on its way.</p> <h2>24 March: lockdown</h2> <p>The government finally orders all non-essential workers to stay at home in their \u201cprimary residence\u201d. I love the presumption that we have more than one. </p> <p>My right leg ache has extended into the left now. If I\u2019m lying in bed, it\u2019s agony, so I get up every few minutes \u2013 walk around, make myself some hot water as a treat. Jesus, what\u2019s become of me? All my life, I\u2019ve drunk coffee by the gallon, finishing off the day with a 1am cuppa. But less coffee means less urinary infections means less sepsis means less weird chest infections that may or may not be Covid-19 means more life.</p> <h2>27 March: Boris Johnson takes it on the chin</h2> <p>Two days after the start of lockdown, I stand by the front door in my purple dressing gown, giving NHS workers a good whoop. It\u2019s not good for my chest, but it\u2019s worth it. I start to well up, though anything makes me cry these days.</p> <p>A day later, it is announced that the prime minister has Covid-19. So he really is taking it on the chin, as he suggested we all do. NHS workers are becoming more vocal about the lack of testing. I tweet Johnson again, saying we need tests for all, and hoping he gets better. No reply, but I do get a surprise phone call.</p> <p>\u201cMr Hattenstone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tested negative.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve not been tested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you were. Last week in hospital, and it\u2019s negative.\u201d I ask questions, but the woman on the other end apologises, says she\u2019s in a call centre and has no more information.</p> <p>My friends are getting ill. Everybody\u2019s friends are getting ill. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s the dreaded\u2026 ?\u201d we ask each other. Most of us think it is, but we can\u2019t say for definite. Only I have been tested \u2013 apparently. But should I believe that, when I was categorically told I hadn\u2019t been? We also know the test gives false negatives, though there is no data as to how often.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I hear a mosquito buzzing.

Everybody\u2019s sending me lists of great box sets and movies to watch, but I can\u2019t focus. Weirdly, the one thing I can concentrate on is Hilary Mantel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/24/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">The Mirror</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/24/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\">&amp; The Light</a>, longer than anything I\u2019ve ever read.

In the silence I hear a mosquito buzzing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear sheep baa-ing. It\u2019s my chest. I hear a motorcycle revving up, loud and antisocial. It\u2019s my chest. Sod this for a game of soldiers.</p> <p>Dr Lung phones to say my scan is back. He says there doesn\u2019t seem much to worry about. There is inflammation on my lungs, and secretions, but no sign of active infection. He wants me to have another lung test in three months to make sure they\u2019ve not solidified into something nastier. I phone my cousin \u2013 a retired GP who looked after me brilliantly 47 years ago when I had encephalitis. \u201cInflammation \u2013 yep, that\u2019s good. A bit of pneumonia will leave you with that. Secretions \u2013 yep, you get them after an infection. They are a positive sign \u2013 that you\u2019re over the infection.\u201d</p> <h2>6 April: precautionary measures</h2> <p>Boris Johnson is in hospital. We are told it is just a precautionary measure; that he\u2019s having tests after 10 days of symptoms including a high fever. A day later he is moved into intensive care \u2013 again, a precautionary measure. </p> <p>\u201cDo you think he will die?\u201d Diane asks.</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d I say with a certainty I don\u2019t feel.</p> <p>The number of Covid-19 deaths is rising relentlessly. My mum phones to tell me one of her oldest friends, Lydia, has died from coronavirus. Ten bus drivers have died in London alone. The first three doctors to die in the UK are all BAME Muslims. There are so many heartbreaking stories: 28-year-old pregnant nurse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/pregnant-healthcare-workers-pressured-into-covid-19-frontline\" title=\"\">Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapon dies</a>, but they manage to save her baby. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab</a>, a 13-year-old with no previous underlying conditions, dies without his family around him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9100336bdab34adaab3646f2a03bdd51649be072\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9100336bdab34adaab3646f2a03bdd51649be072/0_2177_5412_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A medicine spoon with red medicine in it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By now we\u2019ve passed 10,000 deaths with little fanfare or shock \u2013 just a hushed acceptance and numb inevitability. We are tracking France, we\u2019re told. But we\u2019re not: France includes deaths in care homes in its daily figures. Pound for pound, euro for euro, death for death, we are way ahead of France.</p> <p>On 12 April Johnson is released from hospital. The country breathes a collective sigh of relief \u2013 even those who say he\u2019s never knowingly told the truth in his life. He heads to Chequers to recuperate, while the rest of us remain in our primary residences. During this time of national crisis, the government has never seemed more determined to show there is one rule for some, another for others.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all misery. Far from it. Wonderful, uplifting things are happening. The Thursday night clap for carers is getting louder by the week. Ninety-nine-year-old war veteran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser\" title=\"\">Tom Moore</a> pledges to complete 100 laps of his garden in a bid to raise \u00a31,000. So far he has raised more than \u00a332m, clocked up his centenary and been awarded a knighthood. As we edge towards the end of April, the UK soars past 20,000 hospital deaths, and gets barely any nearer the promised 100,000 tests a day. Meanwhile the latest figures from the ONS, which incorporate Covid-19 deaths outside hospital, are horrifying: for the week to 10 April, the number of deaths is 41% higher than the official government figures.</p> <p>The aches come, the aches go, the aches return. As for the wheeze, I sound like an emphysemic canary. I phone the GP. Another locum, this time not so good. </p> <p>\u201cSo my chest is still bad. A lung scan shows inflammation and secretions, and I\u2019m worried about getting another urinary infection. I\u2019d like more antibiotics for my chest, just to see one last time if they make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUhum. I\u2019ll send the prescription to the chemist.\u201d</p> <p>Perfectly efficient, until it turns out I\u2019ve been prescribed an antibiotic that has not been in production for years.</p> <h2>May: songs of recovery</h2> <p>The weeks pass quickly. The government magically hits its testing target at the end of April, though it soon emerges that 100,000 tests a day is very different from 100,000 people tested in a day. By mid-May new figures will reveal that there have been more than 55,000 excess deaths (the number above the five-year average) during the pandemic \u2013 the highest total in Europe. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths will top 36,000 \u2013 the second highest in the world.</p> <p>As for me, I\u2019m just trundling on. I\u2019m much better than I was at my worst, but I\u2019m not fully well. Symptoms disappear and occasionally new ones emerge. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been dehydrated by night and rasping like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas by day. I feel embarrassed to tell people I\u2019m not fixed yet, so I say I\u2019m getting there.</p> <p>Our daughter Maya is autistic and a brilliant researcher. For weeks she\u2019s been nagging me to see a respiratory physiotherapist. She finds the number for one who lives nearby, rings it and puts the phone in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t come round,\u201d I say. \u201cNobody does face to face these days. It\u2019s pointless.\u201d</p> <p>Leo, the physio, says he can pop round in an hour. Everybody gets a bit uptight. Can he be for real if he\u2019s willing to do a house visit \u2013 and in an hour?</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not wearing a mask, I don\u2019t want him to come in the house,\u201d Diane says. The others agree.</p> <p>Leo, a likable Antipodean, arrives in full PPE with a spare mask for me. He tells me my breathing sounds awful. I want to cry with gratitude. He gives me tips \u2013 breathe through a straw as if you\u2019re smoking, to open the airways; steam your head over a bowl of boiling water for five minutes, then huff (as if trying to steam up windows). But, most important, he clap-massages my back and chest to drain the lungs. Nothing comes up. He says that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s all solid, and will take ages to come up. He shows the family how to do the massage.</p> <p>None of the 10-plus doctors I have seen suggested respiratory physio. Perhaps that\u2019s the Covid-19 mindset: they either tell people to go away or treat them as if they are dying. </p> <p>A letter arrives from Dr Lung about the scan. \u201cThere was a 10mm pure ground glass opacity within left upper lobe and this is non-specific appearance.\u201d I Google it and discover a new academic paper on Covid-19. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that GGOs aren\u2019t specific to Covid-19 and can be seen in so many different settings\u2026 in terms of Covid-19\u2026 GGOs on a CT scan are indicative of Covid-19-related pneumonia, or lung inflammation caused by the viral infection.\u201d</p> <p>Since Leo\u2019s visit, I have been wearing a mask. Three days later, in the middle of a furious massage-beating by Jimmy, who lives with us and is like a son, the first bit of mucus pops into it. It is thick, gluey and green. Just one globule, but it\u2019s a start. I show Alix the drop of mucus with pride. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d she says supportively. \u201cUgh. I feel sick.\u201d</p> <p>I send Leo a photo of what looks like a tiny alien, an ET of the lungs. He says it\u2019s good that it\u2019s come up, but it\u2019s bad mucus; the lighter the better. \u201cIf the colour doesn\u2019t lighten, you need to see your chest specialist,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even so, I feel triumphant. I\u2019m sitting on the front doorstep, writing, the crazy spring sun beating down, and I\u2019m thinking of my little green alien and singing myself songs of recovery: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjD3EVC1-zU\" title=\"\">The Only Way</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjD3EVC1-zU\" title=\"\">Is Up</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/05/how-we-made-d-ream-things-can-only-get-better-tony-blair-election-alistair-campbell-\" title=\"\">Things Can Only Get Better</a>. Songs for myself, the country, the world. I\u2019m going to beat this fucker, whatever it is. </p>",
  "<p>Nirmal Purja is someone who responds to a crisis by becoming completely calm. When the Nepalese mountaineer saw the line of about 100 people waiting to reach the crest of Everest on 22 May last year, he knew there was no way he could overtake the slower climbers. Mentally, he abandoned the record he was attempting, for the fastest climb between the neighbouring peaks of Lhotse and Everest.</p> <p>Poor weather at the start of the climbing season had meant there was only a very small window of time in which people could attempt the summit \u2013 just three clear days. In 2018, the year before, there had been 11 good days, allowing climbing companies to stagger their teams. Purja had known there would be queues, but was taken aback by the numbers.</p> <p>Purja, a 36-year-old veteran of the Royal Navy\u2019s elite Special Boat Service, has climbed Everest four times, and was philosophical. \u201cIt is what it is. I always try to stay calm on the mountain,\u201d he tells me, speaking from his home in Winchester. In normal circumstances, he would have been up Everest this year, but he is defusing the frustrations of lockdown by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Possible-Soldier-Fourteen-Peaks/dp/1529312248/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" title=\"\">writing a book</a> about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/01/nirmal-nims-purja-speed-climber-worlds-14-highest-peaks-everest\" title=\"\">climbing all 14 of the world\u2019s highest mountains</a> in just 189 days last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Summits can be a disappointment when you see that number of people taking selfies in such a spiritual place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He took a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/26/i-wont-be-joining-queue-everest-overcrowding-summit\" title=\"\">picture of the queue at the top of Everest</a>, which he later posted on Instagram, mainly as an explanation to his sponsors and supporters \u2013 a vivid image of the obstacle that had slowed him down. Then he tried to assess how he could help. He knew things could go catastrophically wrong, and quickly; this stretch of Everest, from the sheer rockface of the Hillary Step to the summit, was the most exposed part of the climb, with drops of up to 3,000 metres (9,842ft) on either side. As people queued, they got colder and used up unplanned-for quantities of their oxygen supplies. It was literally the worst place on Earth to get stuck in a queue.</p> <p>Looking at the line, with climbers travelling in both directions, Purja realised it would be impossible to rescue anyone who needed to be taken off the summit fast. Every climber was clipped to a safety rope, and the path is too narrow to allow the more experienced climbers to unclip and pass the slower climbers. The queue continued to build. Purja couldn\u2019t be confident that other climbers would be helpful in an emergency. \u201cIf you have to drag a body through that, no one would be able to give up the path to them. There <em>is</em> no path, and people are in their own survival state at that altitude, struggling to put one foot in front of another. Everyone is in that fine line between death and life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e4d7f852ea7942ad8bad5eddfb1b2b9537112e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e4d7f852ea7942ad8bad5eddfb1b2b9537112e7/1676_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nirmal Purja at the summit of Everest summit in May 2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nirmal Purja at the summit of Everest in May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: published with permission of Nirmal Purja</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Purja paused at Hillary Step and tried to quell flaring tensions between climbers; there were arguments about whether the people trying to get to the summit should be given priority over those trying to descend. \u201cI managed the queue for two hours. Rather than people fighting over who should go up first, it\u2019s better if it is managed systematically,\u201d he says. He worked out who had been waiting in critically cold conditions for the longest and prioritised them, and tried to calm the other climbers, taking off his mask to issue instructions.</p> <p>Purja\u2019s experience and military background meant that climbers were happy to be guided by him. Elsewhere, local Nepalese guides were finding it harder to convince their clients that they needed to turn back. There was a dangerous clash between the typically alpha-plus personalities of people who want to summit Everest and their guides, who are dependent on their fees for survival.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people are in stressful situations, they do shout,\u201d Purja says. \u201cYou can only get a few words out at that altitude: \u2018Move faster! Come off!\u2019 I disagree with it, but people come to Everest carrying a huge financial burden. Not only that, but they have spent more than two months and a lot of effort to be ready. That\u2019s why everybody rushes for the top.\u201d</p> <p>A year on, Thomas Becker tells me he remains disturbed by the behaviour he witnessed while queueing to reach the highest place on Earth. He is a lifelong climber, although it was his first attempt at Everest. He describes the experience as being \u201cvery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/jan/24/review-lord-flies-william-golding\" title=\"\">Lord Of The Flies</a>\u201d. At the worst part of the queue, he was stuck in a line of around 40 climbers, behind a woman who was struggling. He had never met her and didn\u2019t know her name, but was worried by how inexperienced she seemed, unable to use her ice axe. He spent several hours helping her, so that he could shuffle forward himself, patiently advising her where to put her feet and catching her when she slipped. Behind them, tempers began to fray and climbers started swearing: \u201cFucking get moving!\u201d, \u201cGet the fuck off here!\u201d, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21f6fa14899d3f96cd84c098ab671ab3f5b0d946\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21f6fa14899d3f96cd84c098ab671ab3f5b0d946/1_0_2695_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Becker, who teaches law at Harvard, climbing Everest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Becker, who teaches law at Harvard, describes queuing on Everest as \u2018very Lord Of The Flies\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Thomas Becker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Becker, a former rock guitarist who teaches human rights law at Harvard, was startled by the ruthlessness of his fellow climbers. Earlier in the day, he had discovered that someone had stolen eight of the oxygen tanks his team had stashed by their tents at base camp, which meant he was climbing the most dangerous stretch of the mountain with just two canisters instead of six. The theft was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, he says now, with polite understatement. \u201cThere is a code of ethics on the mountain that you don\u2019t steal anyone else\u2019s oxygen, because it could be fatal.\u201d He was also puzzled. \u201cThis is not the norm.

It became sad quickly.\u201d By the time he got to the summit, he had walked past a number of corpses. \u201cJust 10 minutes shy of Hillary Step, there was a guy attached to a rope who had passed away, dangling there.

People who know nothing about mountaineering were shocked by this contradiction between the mountain\u2019s reputation as a lonely and unattainable peak, and the banal reality of a rush-hour crush. But it was more than banal: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/walking-over-bodies-mountaineers-describe-the-carnage-at-the-top-of-mount-everest\" title=\"\">11 people died on Everest that May</a>, more than twice the number of climbers who had perished the previous year \u2013 a figure widely attributed to the crowded conditions and the extra physical stresses caused by waiting in temperatures of -30C, at an altitude where oxygen levels are not sufficient to sustain human life. Climbers call it \u201cthe death zone\u201d.</p> <p>But within the climbing community, people were less surprised. Last year\u2019s was just a more extreme version of the bottlenecks that have been troubling the mountain with increasing frequency. The deaths were not caused by the queue itself, they argue, but a different problem: the rising numbers of inexperienced climbers who view Everest as the ultimate selfie destination, and the proliferation of companies willing to take their money and let them have a go, regardless of their ability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ebaeae09a8c5c04c093ba535759d6725f44072d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ebaeae09a8c5c04c093ba535759d6725f44072d/0_76_3264_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Expedition leader Greg Vernovage with his Nepalese team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Climbers don\u2019t know the risks and aren\u2019t concerned with them,\u2019 says expedition leader Greg Vernovage, centre, with his team.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Greg Vernovage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are people who call up and ask: \u2018I\u2019ve never climbed anything. Can I go with your company? And I need a discount,\u2019\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.mountainguides.com/guides.shtml\" title=\"\">Greg Vernovage</a>, Everest expedition leader with International Mountain Guides, a well-established climbing firm. \u201cUnfortunately, there is probably a company out there now that will take them. It\u2019s very easy to jump on your computer and dig around for the lowest common denominator.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, 381 permits to climb the mountain were issued by the Nepalese government (a record number, 35 more than the previous year). The cost of climbing Everest varies wildly; cut-price operators will offer to take you up for as little as $30,000 (\u00a324,600) \u2013 a price that includes the $11,000 (\u00a39,000) permit \u2013 or you can pay $200,000 (\u00a3164,000) if you want to stay at the best hotels in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu and be taken by the most experienced guides. Last autumn, Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Tourism showed no sign of wanting to restrict the numbers of permits issued after last season, encouraging more people to come \u201cfor both pleasure and fame\u201d.</p> <p>There is suspicion that less well-established guides and companies find it harder to tell tourists they need to turn back if they see them struggling. \u201cJust like a kid thinks they can eat a whole bag of candy without getting sick, climbers just want to stand on top. They don\u2019t know the risks and they aren\u2019t concerned with them,\u201d Vernovage says. \u201cCompanies need to be a bit more forceful with clients. Just because you pay the money, that doesn\u2019t give you a ticket to be on the summit team. I\u2019ve had that difficult conversation with people.\u201d</p> <p>The cheaper firms have fewer backup staff, lower supplies of spare oxygen and less ability to manage things when dangerous situations arise. Purja, who runs <a href=\"https://www.nimsdai.com/\" title=\"\">his own climbing company</a>, attributes the higher number of deaths in 2019 not so much to the numbers on the mountain as to the growth of cheaper operators, who employ less experienced guides. \u201cWe have backup people to help clients who are struggling. If everyone had been climbing with that support, no one would have struggled.\u201d</p> <p>Four Indian climbers were among the dead last year, leading to speculation that lower average salaries in India result in these climbers choosing cheaper tour operators, with tragic consequences. Attempting the mountain is expensive, so climbers are sometimes older, at the end of their careers, with expendable income but less physical stamina.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw people take 14 hours to cover a distance that took me two \u2013 people who usually have nothing to do with mountains</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has been no climbing season this year. The view from the ground has been spectacular: the disappearance of a pollution haze means the snow-capped peaks of Everest have been visible from Kathmandu for the first time in decades. But the only people on the mountain are a small group of Chinese researchers and surveyors \u2013 there to place 5G masts, and to mark the 60th anniversary of the first Chinese ascent of the north side of the mountain. </p> <p>On 13 March, Nepal\u2019s government locked down Everest, announcing that no climbing would be allowed on the mountain because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Police have patrolled the roads nearby to prevent anyone approaching. The cooks, porters and guides who help international tourists attempt the summit have mostly returned to their villages. With the disappearance of a year\u2019s income, many have been pushed into destitution; a number of climbers have <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/climbing-community-fund-covid19\" title=\"\">launched fundraisers</a> to help Everest workers feed themselves and their families.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine, I\u2019m in England, I\u2019ve managed to get income from my book,\u201d Purja says. \u201cBut the community there is suffering.

As soon as he saw the queues at the top, he understood he was going to have to turn around. He was making an entirely self-sufficient attempt to summit, carrying his own kit and without oxygen \u2013 the most intensely challenging way to climb the mountain. \u201cThere are only a tiny fraction of people who can climb without oxygen,\u201d he says. He views its use as a form of cheating, \u201clike doping, like an enhancing drug\u201d. But without oxygen, it was too risky to wait in line. He abandoned his climb around 100 vertical metres from the summit. It wasn\u2019t the crowds that surprised him: \u201cYou don\u2019t go to Everest for a lonely adventure,\u201d he says. But he was dismayed by the slowness of the people ahead of him.</p> <p>\u201cI saw people who took 14 hours to cover a distance that took me two hours \u2013 these are people who usually have nothing to do with mountains. I have the feeling that they hear Everest is a nice thing to do and say: \u2018Let\u2019s do it!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18726993d51592540314ba1bfc4b8d97487bf8a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18726993d51592540314ba1bfc4b8d97487bf8a5/0_0_2500_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David G\u00f6ttler, who was climbing without oxygen and had to turn back because of the queues\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Most of these deaths were predictable,\u2019 says David G\u00f6ttler, who was climbing without oxygen and had to turn back because of the queues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David G\u00f6ttler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was this inexperience that caused the spike in deaths, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound hard or without feelings, because it\u2019s a tragedy for the families, but most of these deaths were predictable. It is surprising that there are not more of them, given how unprepared and naive people are. They pay the money and hire an agency, and think that this is a summit guarantee.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://eliasaikaly.com/\" title=\"\">Elia Saikaly</a>, a Canadian film-maker, was on Everest last year to make a documentary about a team of four women from Saudi Arabia, Oman and Lebanon. Like G\u00f6ttler, they made their ascent the day after Purja\u2019s photograph was taken, when the queues were still long. Saikaly had attempted Everest many times before, and succeeded on two earlier occasions. But he remains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2019/jun/04/death-carnage-chaos-a-climber-on-his-recent-ascent-up-everest\" title=\"\">troubled by what he saw that day</a>; he is now making a film about how his attitude to the mountain was changed by his experiences.</p> <p>There were between 25 and 40 people on and around the summit when Saikaly arrived at the tiny plateau at the top, a patch of mountain not much bigger than the surface area of a couple of ping-pong tables. He felt subdued as he arrived there. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do with it, to be honest. Summits can be a bit of a disappointment, when you see that number of people taking selfies in such a spiritual place,\u201d Saikaly says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the pure experience it once was. The loss of life is very challenging. It makes you question why people do this and why you are there. We celebrated quietly.\u201d</p> <p>Becker also had mixed feelings as he stood at the peak, contemplating his achievement. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an \u2018I found God\u2019 moment at the top that some people say they have. I was torn,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about climbing it since I was a kid. But I think the 13-year-old me would have found it upsetting to go to the mountain and see it like that.\u201d</p> <p>Becker says he felt alienated by the \u201calmost colonialist culture of must-conquer-the-mountains\u201d. Some of his fellow climbers had already conquered figurative mountains in their business careers. \u201cThey think, because of that, they can conquer <em>the</em> mountain. There are people who paid six figures to get to the top and so they think: \u2018I\u2019m going to get my money\u2019s worth. I must make it to the top of the mountain, who cares what happens?\u2019 I think it draws certain people who will be happy to go to the top, at almost any cost to themselves and others.\u201d</p> <p>As well as this nagging ambivalence, Becker was in physical difficulty: his attempts to ration his depleted oxygen supply had led to his tank freezing; his mask had frozen on to his face and beard, the condensation inside it creating a cascade of ice down his front; his goggles were frozen to his suit. Without goggles, he was worried about developing ice blindness in the glare of the sun on the descent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d9a658032b79849e0d6222c048e6f863092f83f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d9a658032b79849e0d6222c048e6f863092f83f/0_0_3088_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US guide Garrett Madison on Everest with flags and other climbers behind him\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It can be a good reality check; it reinforces the gravity of it all,\u2019 says US guide Garrett Madison of seeing dead climbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Garrett Madison</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of all he, like other climbers on Everest last year, was very shaken by the experience of having to walk past so many dead climbers. <a href=\"https://madisonmountaineering.com/garrett-madison/\" title=\"\">Garrett Madison</a>, a US guide who was climbing with Saikaly, says it is something climbers see every year, but remains hard to get used to. \u201cFor a first-time climber, it can be shocking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be a good reality check; it reinforces the gravity of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Conditions are so harsh at the summit that it is usually impossible to expend energy on carrying bodies back. \u201cIt is a major effort to bring a corpse down,\u201d Madison says. \u201cIt is not like you can just chuck them on your back and trot on down.\u201d</p> <p>Becker was unable to avert his eyes. \u201cThe first person had the same boots as me, the same scrawny build as me. It was scary \u2013 he looked like me. I imagined myself in that situation, and I very much did not want to be in that situation. I was just sad for this guy. I thought about his family \u2013 does he have kids or a wife, or parents? What are they going to think?\u201d</p> <p>Worse was a sense that some seemed unconsciously to revel in the danger. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that anyone saw a dead body and thought: \u2018Oh, this is great!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThere were some people who seemed upset about it. But there were others whose attitude was \u2013 and I\u2019m speculating \u2013 \u2018Wow, this is such a dangerous mountain, and I made it!\u2019 It almost made it more romantic that they made it to the top despite these deaths. That attitude was pretty uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the wake of last year\u2019s queues, there has been renewed discussion in Nepal about how better regulation of firms and climbers could be introduced. Some trekking firms would like firmer control of how many climbers can attempt the summit on a given day. A government panel recommended that anyone applying for a permit must in future show that they have successfully completed a 6,500 metre (21,325ft) climb, but the proposals had not been implemented before Covid-19 prompted lockdown. The damage caused to the country\u2019s tourist industry may have reduced the willingness to regulate.</p> <p>This April, a team of Nepalese soldiers had been due to mount an expedition to remove the mess that has been accumulating on the mountain for years: piles of empty fuel canisters, tents (the climbing company\u2019s logo carefully cut out before they were abandoned, to avoid responsibility), food wrappers and human excrement. But when climbing permits were cancelled, the cleanup operation was also abandoned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Last year there was a line of people quite literally dying because of the over-commercialisation of the mountain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No one is sure whether the crowds will return next year. Most climbers who were forced to cancel trips this spring would like to return in 2021, which means the queues could be heavier still, with two years\u2019 worth of tourists attempting to summit at once. But if there is a global economic slump, fewer people will have the spare money to fund this very expensive adventure travel.</p> <p>Purja hopes that climbers will come back, to restore the livelihoods of the Nepalese climbing community, but he also hopes the next season will be cleaner and less chaotic. Other climbers say last year\u2019s season has made them re-evaluate their attitude to Everest.</p> <p>\u201cLast year there was a line of people quite literally dying because of the over-commercialisation of the mountain,\u201d Becker says. \u201cPeople have come to think, if you throw money at it you can get to the top, which brings more inexperienced people to the mountain and more sherpas to work there. It does make me reflect on what kind of climbing I want to do, what\u2019s responsible and doesn\u2019t endanger myself and others. And to think about whether I am perpetuating this culture \u2013 the romanticisation of Everest. I worry that, am I in some way part of the problem?\u201d</p>",

More than half a trillion dollars worldwide \u2013 $509bn (\u00a3395bn) \u2013 is to be poured into high-carbon industries, with no conditions to ensure they reduce their carbon output.</p> <p>Only about $12.3bn is to go towards low-carbon industries, such as renewable energy, and a further $18.5bn into high-carbon industries provided they achieve climate targets.</p> <p>At these rates, the rescue packages would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders\">even less green than the economic stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis</a>, despite government rhetoric on a green recovery, and pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\">economists</a> and campaigners to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">use the stimulus packages to shift to a low-carbon footing</a>.</p> <p>The current and former governors of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey and Mark Carney, joined Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Bank of France, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/05/world-climate-breakdown-pandemic\">write in the Guardian of the need for a green recovery</a>. They said: \u201cThe economic recovery plans being developed today offer the chance to build a sustainable, competitive new economy.\u201d</p> <p>However, the first disclosures from the Bank\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility this week showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/airlines-and-carmakers-benefit-from-uk-covid-relief-scheme\">billions of pounds of taxpayer support are being funnelled to fossil fuel companies</a>. Airlines have taken up about \u00a31.8bn of the \u00a316bn already allocated from the funds, which could top \u00a367bn when fully disbursed, while carmakers have benefited by more than \u00a31bn so far and two oil service companies, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, are taking \u00a3600m and \u00a3150m respectively.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s failure to lead by example in greening its activities risks seriously undermining the UK\u2019s efforts to show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">global leadership</a> on climate through Cop26,\u201d said Fran Boait, executive director of the pressure group Positive Money. \u201cIt would be farcical if the institution underpinning Britain\u2019s financial system is still pumping money towards companies whose business models are utterly incompatible with global emissions targets.\u201d</p> <p>The European Central Bank has also propped up high-carbon industries in its lending, with as much as \u20ac220bn (\u00a3193bn) going to fossil fuel industries, according to analysis by the pressure group Reclaim Finance. The bank\u2019s plans will funnel money to 38 oil companies including big names such as Shell and Total, and several coal companies. \u201cThe ECB is simultaneously acknowledging climate urgency and refusing to act,\u201d said Paul Schreiber, campaigner at Reclaim Finance. \u201cThis stance is unbearable \u2013 we now know that the ECB is not neutral, but finances climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Governments are also continuing to subsidise the fossil fuel industry, according to an <a href=\"https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/view/?ref=133_133639-s08q2ridhf&amp;title=Building-back-better-_A-sustainable-resilient-recovery-after-Covid-19\">analysis by the OECD and the International Energy Agency on Friday</a>. Last year, $478bn of government support was poured into the production and consumption of fossil fuels by 77 economies.</p> <p>\u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary-general of the OECD club of rich countries, said: \u201cI am saddened to see some backsliding on efforts to phase out fossil fuel support. This rise in production subsidies seems set to continue in 2020 with some countries targeting state aid to fossil fuel and related industries. We should seize this opportunity [of the coronavirus recovery] to reform subsidies and use public funds in a way that best benefits people and the planet.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s role as president of Cop26 means the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/uk-urged-to-tie-green-recovery-from-covid-19-crisis-to-cop26-summit\">UK government has a crucial role to pla</a>y if these trends towards a bailout of the high-carbon economy are to be reversed and the world is to reach net zero emissions. The vital UN summit, postponed by a year to November 2021, is seen as the last chance to put the world back on track to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">meet the Paris agreement on climate change</a>, and avoid catastrophic levels of global heating. For Cop26 to be a success, the government must lead by example in setting out a green recovery, experts concluded.</p> <p>\u201cThe clock is ticking for the UK to show it\u2019s serious about a green recovery,\u201d said Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard bold and ambitious words from Boris Johnson and other ministers, but with the first stimulus package only weeks away we need to see the government\u2019s plans to support its ambitions. We need to take some big steps. Let\u2019s fire the starting gun on a real green recovery.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On the face of it, the two early TV hits of lockdown didn\u2019t have much in common. There was Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Tiger King</a>, taking us on a bizarre journey into the dark underbelly of American big cat breeding. And there was ITV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/quiz-review-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-charles-ingram-diana-drama\">Quiz</a>, an entertaining dramatisation of a small-screen oddity from our recent past. Perhaps all they shared was how little they had to say about our current situation. They hit a sweet spot of cultural nostalgia and detachment from reality. Both were too singular in terms of content to have much wider resonance, and, as we adjusted to a scary and unfamiliar new paradigm, that was just the ticket.</p> <p>There\u2019s an odd moment in Quiz when, at the height of what\u2019s essentially a fantastically trivial tale about possible cheating on a TV gameshow, 9/11 happens. To anyone watching the drama as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> death toll mounted, this felt jarringly familiar. Here was real life, poking its nose in where it wasn\u2019t wanted. Couldn\u2019t we even have an hour\u2019s worth of respite from terrifying global events? Apparently not. And this implied a question. The practical challenges presented to the television industry by the Covid-19 pandemic are self-evident. But what about the creative, emotional challenges? What kind of TV will viewers want once the cameras start rolling again?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips\">The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nostalgia is frequently the Very British response to challenging times. In 1981, as riots convulsed the nation, we hid in a country house as the genteel Evelyn Waugh adaptation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/30/your-next-box-set-brideshead-revisited\">Brideshead Revisited</a> was showered with Baftas and Golden Globes. In 2010, with austerity looming, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/from-downton-abbey-to-belgravia-a-brief-guide-to-julian-fellowes\">Downton Abbey</a> fulfilled a similar function. But the Covid-19 pandemic feels different: an open-ended battle against a faceless adversary. And lockdown has already felt like a nostalgia-laden experience. How many of us have revisited box sets, immersed ourselves in 30-year-old football matches, or compiled social media lists of formative cultural experiences? Surely, soon we\u2019ll be in the mood for something new?</p> <p>Dan Hassler-Forest is assistant professor of cultural theory and transmedia practice at Utrecht University. He has also written extensively on the interplay between culture and politics. He is cautiously excited about the post-lockdown possibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting time in terms of both media and politics,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we got a chance to be nostalgic until we were sick of it? Do we develop nostalgia for the pre-coronavirus recent past? Or are we brave enough to say that that kind of society was nice for a privileged group but not for everybody?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d533c6fe8e177601111bd34044558826d36b7593\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d533c6fe8e177601111bd34044558826d36b7593/0_121_2345_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The X-Files with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, first aired in 1993\" width=\"1000\" height=\"897\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new (para)normal ... The X-Files with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, first aired in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In short, how much of our old world will we even want to recreate? Already, Covid-19 has trumped a whole host of overfamiliar TV tropes. What price a new conspiracy drama in a post-virus world? It\u2019s telling that the genre really took hold in the 1990s with shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/19/when-good-tv-goes-bad-the-x-files\">The X-Files</a> offering speculative fun during a comparatively tranquil era in real-life current affairs. In 2020, such adventurous speculation may not be quite so welcome \u2013 or feel quite so harmless. \u201cThe wildest theories proliferate so quickly now,\u201d says Hassler-Forest. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for a screenwriter to keep up in terms of creating something more outrageous than these batshit theories about 5G or Bill Gates. It\u2019s straight out of 1970s science fiction and it might not be interesting as entertainment if it\u2019s part of our daily lives.\u201d</p> <p>So what kind of entertainment might offer solace? In terms of serious drama, there\u2019s increasingly an atmosphere of caution. Charlie Brooker has spoken of \u201crevisiting his comic skillset\u201d, and in a recent interview with the <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-05-04/black-mirror-6-update/\">Radio Times</a> wondered whether there\u2019d really be much appetite for a new series of Black Mirror. ITV, meanwhile, has delayed the broadcast of Honour, a dark drama about so-called \u201chonour\u201d killings starring Keeley Hawes. As Kieron Butler, a course leader in television production at Solent University puts it, by autumn \u201cthe country will need Strictly Come Dancing!\u201d A certain degree of emotional consolidation might be in order. There\u2019ll certainly be a yearning for warmth and familiarity.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>I\u2019d think a response to something like this would be much more along the lines of small, comforting, human television,\u201d says Hassler-Forest. \u201cOne thing we might look back upon as an early precedent is the reunion episode of Parks and Recreation, which was done from isolation. It\u2019s about little moments of human connection, reminding each other to take care of ourselves, resorting to a sense of small-town community and maybe taking a bit of television\u2019s old form as a cultural forum where we discuss contemporary issues rather than flee into fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>This process is happening in the UK, too. Butler speaks admiringly of ITV\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/04/isolation-stories-review-powerful-snapshots-of-lockdown-life\">Isolation Stories</a>, which he describes as \u201cmiraculous inside 45 days\u201d. He\u2019s confident that necessity will prove to be the mother of invention. Isolation and social distancing is provoking lateral thinking. Some of it will be inevitably daft. Like Snoop Dogs, a magnificently absurd-sounding Channel 4 update of Through the Keyhole, featuring inquisitive dogs equipped with GoPro cameras in the Loyd Grossman role. \u201cWhat a brilliant response!\u201d says Butler. \u201cOf course it\u2019s ridiculous, but so was The Masked Singer.\u201d Although whether Zoom will have shown us enough of the insides of celebrities\u2019 homes by the time of broadcast remains to be seen.</p> <p>The omnipresence of the Zoom conversation has interesting implications. Butler points out that the <strong>\u201c</strong>direct address to the audience, that use of low-tech that we use to communicate with each other, is becoming more acceptable on television. Lockdown dramas are informed by the pandemic but the style is written into their fabric.\u201d The visual grammar shares common ground with various forms of reality TV, too: what was Channel 4\u2019s The Circle, for example, if not a prototype lockdown drama? Might long experience of confinement and \u201cdiary room\u201d-style video communication with each other make us slightly wary of such small-screen entertainment once we reach the other side of Covid-19?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e2dbaea976dfa3388bcc79dfd0be230be0cecd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e2dbaea976dfa3388bcc79dfd0be230be0cecd1/49_148_2877_2876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Griffin in Isolation Stories\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phone/home ... Angela Griffin in Isolation Stories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often crises simply accelerate developments that were already under way. It\u2019s not impossible that a combination of empty primetime slots and talented outsiders with time on their hands might lead to a happy coincidence of fresh ideas and opportunity. Hassler-Forest cites the \u201ctremendous skill\u201d evident in video narratives constructed for online platforms.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing huge creativity from people who are isolated with their parents\u201d he says. \u201cTeenagers making 30-minute movies, basically. Very few of my students even watch much television. Most of the time they\u2019re on Instagram, TikTok or YouTube. So we might be looking at the wrong thing if we\u2019re still thinking about what television is going to be like in terms of responding to this.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s possible these developments might also dovetail with \u201clockdown brain\u201d, the reduced attention span that, anecdotally, seems to be a product of lockdown. Might we gravitate towards shorter, speedier entertainments with so much else weighing on our minds?</p> <p>Nevertheless, more traditional responses will still be called for. Grand statements will be required in respect of a crisis too all-consuming for television to avoid staring it in the face. As was the case around the time of 9/11, variations on the phrase \u201cit\u2019s just like a movie\u201d have become a cliche. But cliches are cliches for a reason: there is a sense that, from zombie dramas to post-apocalyptic thrillers, television and film have been preparing us for a cataclysm like this. Yet now, they seem somewhat inadequate. <strong>\u201c</strong>It\u2019s like we\u2019d already been told exactly what was going to happen and now it\u2019s happening,\u201d says Hassler-Forest. \u201cAlbeit in a slightly different, slightly more tedious form. It\u2019s familiar but it\u2019s less exciting than a zombie apocalypse.\u201d</p> <p>But will Covid-19 have to be incorporated into the fabric of our favourite shows? Will Succession\u2019s feuds now be conducted through face masks, at two metres\u2019 remove? If the possibility sounds strange, the fact remains that the pandemic is potentially too transformative not to acknowledge. Also, as Hassler-Forest points out, \u201cpeople will be eager to incorporate ideas and motifs that resonate with our recent experience. And watching any film and television today, it\u2019s striking how attentive you are to how close people are to each other.\u201d If social distancing is indeed our new normal, it\u2019s hard to see how television can avoid reflecting it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"633e221097edab0f1c3d5166a8a8d3a070d236c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/633e221097edab0f1c3d5166a8a8d3a070d236c6/0_75_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer in 24\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Circadian with \u2018em ... Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer in 24.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The search for deeper meaning will matter too. Back in 2001, The West Wing famously cobbled together a trite, sanctimonious response to the attacks in which characters lectured students (and by extension, viewers) about terrorism. But really, it was Jack Bauer who caught the mood. The first season of 24 was filmed before (but broadcast after) the Twin Towers fell. But subsequent seasons were happy to accommodate a newly bellicose yet paranoid tone. Various studies after 9/11 showed that psychological recovery from this national trauma was easier for people who felt they had found some sort of meaning in both the attacks and the United States\u2019s response to them.</p> <p>But agency is key. After 9/11, an enemy could be identified (or created) and retribution sought. There was a clear narrative and action to be taken. Covid-19 feels different. Unless you\u2019re a key worker, your best expression of heroism involves leaving the house as little as possible. While having a beer in front of a repeat of Minder is the kind of heroism most of us can get behind, it doesn\u2019t feel quite enough to scratch this emotional itch.</p> <p>The closest we\u2019ve come to heroes in recent months have been the people at the heart of national institutions. Not government but certainly the NHS. Fortunately, television has us covered in this regard. We can expect a response from Casualty. But shows such as Hospital and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/17/24-hours-in-ae-review-trauma-tears-and-triage-in-real-life-casualty\">24 Hours in A&amp;E</a> have probably been slightly ahead of the curve in terms of what they\u2019ve come to mean to viewers. They feel analogous to the weekly doorstep clapping that has punctuated the coronavirus crisis. They are essentially television celebrating, in a passionate yet oddly depoliticised way, the social contract.</p> <p>They are comforting as much for what they say about us \u2013 our sublimated longing for community and our pride at the idea of collective endeavour \u2013 as for what they say about the public servants they celebrate. Are these selfless life-savers in inadequate PPE our Jack Bauers? It would be comforting to think so.</p> <p>Inevitably, aspects of the small-screen reaction to the crisis will be lazy. As Hassler-Forest says, \u201cYou cringe at the certainty that every major series, once it returns, is going to do at least one episode entirely on Zoom. There will be screenwriters knocking those things out as we speak!\u201d And yet something more considered might be possible. The virus has pulled the rug from under us in many ways. But it\u2019s also reminded us of what\u2019s important. Just as, in political terms, the NHS is probably safer than it has been in years, so too is the BBC in particular and the concept of public service broadcasting in general. \u201cMaybe,\u201d says Hassler-Forest, \u201cwe\u2019ll be forced to think about what kind of world we want to build out of the wreckage?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>My dad was a tree man. He loved trees; he planted them; he was good with them. I remember a couple of his trees from our garden in north London \u2013 a walnut and a catalpa. Also known as an Indian bean tree (though it is neither Indian, nor produces beans), the <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/93435/Catalpa-bignonioides-Aurea/Details\" title=\"\">Catalpa bignonioides\u2018Aurea\u2019</a> has lovely, big, floppy, heart-shaped, yellowy-green leaves.</p> <p>It is still here, and the walnut tree, too. I have come back to the house of my early childhood, still occupied by the family who bought it from mine in 1975. Everything seems smaller than before, apart from the trees. The catalpa bears the scars of some surgery, and leans a little; my dad leaned a little in later life. Bloody hell, I think: if the catalpa I\u2019ve planted in my own small London garden gets to this size, it will fill it.</p> <p>But here, in our old garden, the big news is the walnut at the end. It\u2019s enormous, 20 metres high, towering over the shed that used to be my dad\u2019s office. It\u2019s girthy, too: if I wrap my arms around the trunk, my fingers don\u2019t meet. I\u2019m not generally a tree hugger, but I\u2019ll make an exception here; this tree isn\u2019t just the same age as I am, it was planted by my father.

(He was better at horticulture than personal finance.) As well as his family (my mum, sister, brother and me), he took three walnuts from the old tree.</p> <p>The new place, a rambling yellow timber-frame farmhouse, was impractical, virtually uninhabitable in winter, but beautiful. There was a big garden, in which to plant more trees. In March, I come back here, too, for the first time. It is nobody\u2019s home now, a place rented out for holidays. And there is no one here today, because the human equivalent of Dutch elm disease is sweeping through our own species, pushing mortality to the forefront of everyone\u2019s thoughts.</p> <p>I\u2019ve brought my own boys, eight and six, who never knew their grandfather \u2013 a sadness to me. Sometimes they ask about him; now they will get to meet a part of him. I remember him planting willows along the stream that ran past the house, just sticking cuttings into the ground. He wasn\u2019t supposed to plant here; the land was managed by a farmer who once caught my dad guerrilla planting, pulled his willows out, threw them in the river and threatened to throw my dad in, too. But it didn\u2019t matter to Dad whose land it was: a stream \u2013 certainly a stream his kitchen window looked out on \u2013 should have willows alongside it, and so he carried on planting. I\u2019m delighted to find many live on, and are quite big now.</p> <p> In the garden stands his <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/10338/liriodendron-tulipifera/details\" title=\"\">tulip tree</a>, so called because of the flowers it will bear in July. Plus a mulberry, another catalapa, then on into the orchard, a couple of pears and plums, mostly apples. The blossom is pushing through, blushing pink, bashful, hopeful and promising. My dad had a cider press and went through a brewing stage; it was cloudy, dark and dangerous. </p> <p>Not all the trees are still here. An oak my dad planted has been cut down to make way for a propane gas tank. The horse chestnut from which he hung a tyre on a rope for us has also gone; but that predated him, probably by at least a century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96d32ef34d0e1368b170d04c81818ebe34639b04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96d32ef34d0e1368b170d04c81818ebe34639b04/1042_190_4187_4952/846.jpg\" alt=\"Jack with a cutting from the quince tree.\" width=\"846\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack with a cutting from the quince tree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My boys\u2019 interest has a time limit. Jack, the eight-year-old, is into plants and growing stuff, so he lasts longer. He asks if we can dig up a few daffodils to take home. I think we can, because this used to be my home. Thomas is mainly impressed that there is space here to actually kick a ball about, which is what he does.</p> <p>Of the three walnuts that came with us to Suffolk from London, and were planted in pots, one grew and got planted out. And here it is, 45 years on, at the end of the garden \u2013 perhaps not quite as huge as its parent tree, but it will probably get there: the soil here is richer than London\u2019s clay. My dad was tall, too, but I overtook him.</p> <p>One more tree to see, round the front, not the biggest, but a favourite of his. Phew, it\u2019s still here, and still supported by his rope-stay-pulley system. It has already burst into life, though the fruit will come much later. Last year\u2019s quinces are still on the tree, black and shrivelled; holidayers don\u2019t have any use for quinces, it seems. I can see my dad up a ladder with a plastic bag in November. The quinces mostly got grated into pickling jars to which vodka and sugar were added. Quince vodka \u2013 quodka \u2013 was even more dangerous than the cider.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/04/special-branches-readers-on-the-trees-that-changed-their-lives\">Special branches! Readers on the trees that changed their lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When my dad died, aged 80, we scattered his ashes around his favourite tree. There was so much ash, even though he was little and crooked at the end. It went everywhere in the wind; I remember getting the giggles. The other trees got a sprinkle, too; I don\u2019t remember if the weeping ashes did, they would have if we\u2019d thought of it \u2013 because these were his ashes, and we were weeping, as well as laughing. My mother, sister, brother and I meet up every year and go for a walk on the day he died, 23 April: we call it Quince Tree Day.</p> <p>Can we take a cutting, asks my Jack, the gardener of the family, to take back to London? I don\u2019t know if we do it correctly, if it\u2019s the right time, or even if you can grow a quince tree from a cutting. But we cut off a thin branch. We\u2019re sure as hell going to give it a go.</p>",
  "<p>In only 48 hours, ants took over one of our new compost bins. Lifting the lid to chuck in some wilted celery stumps, I saw them seething over what looked like a heap of nude baked beans.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t baked beans but pupae, wrapped in beige silk. The larvae of black garden ants (<em>Lasius niger</em>) are one of several ant species that spin cocoons to pupate. It is thought that the casing protects against lethal fungal infections.</p> <p>Disturbed by this sudden uncovering, scurrying workers began to drag the pupae into the many tunnels they had built. When I looked later, the \u201cbeans\u201d had all gone.</p> <p>Although it seemed as if the ants arrived suddenly from nowhere, there must have been a small nest in the ground nearby. Black garden ants favour dry places that are warmed by the sun. They often build under stones or paving slabs that will heat up during the day and act like storage heaters at night.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colonies are adept at managing temperatures inside the nest. They form mounds of excavated soil granules, pieced with tunnels that absorb heat and aerate the chambers within. Workers move eggs, larvae and pupae so that the brood has the right degree of warmth. During the day, they carry it to the upper levels. As the air cools at nightfall, they take it deeper into the nest.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/flying-ant-day-virgin-queens-male-drones-mate-on-the-wing\">Flying ant day: when virgin queens and male drones mate on the wing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are one of the commonest UK ant species.
