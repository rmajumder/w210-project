  "<p>For the group of young teenagers travelling to France, it was a trip they had been looking forward to for almost a year. The youngsters could finally put school behind them at the start of the summer holidays, excited at the prospect of an action-packed adventure holiday in the Dordogne where they would enjoy canoeing, rock climbing, white-water rafting, assault courses and horse-riding.</p> <p>But today's tragic news that a British teenager had died and 17 passengers were injured, up to seven of them seriously, after their coach overturned on the way to the holiday, inevitably raised fresh anxieties about the risks and dangers of school trips.</p> <p>Two parties of children aged between 13 and 17, from Chadwell Heath Foundation school, Romford, Essex and the 41st Edinburgh Boys Brigade were travelling with the Hertfordshire-based school travel specialists PGL Travel. The company, which was set up 27 years ago, has a sound reputation as a specialist travel company and boasts an exemplary safety record.</p> <p>Guidance is issued by the department for education and employment for local education authorities placing a strict duty on their schools to look after the children in their care. That applies whether a school organises a trip itself, or whether - as in this case - it 'sub-contracts' it to an outside organisation.</p> <p>Suitable transport is one of the first considerations, for travel in the UK as well as overseas. British coaches are subject to strict safety regulations and the rules governing the transportation of children are even more stringent. </p> <p>All coaches which carry schoolchildren must now be fitted with seatbelts, although many already had them installed before their usage became compulsory.</p> <p>There are also firm rules about the hours drivers can do. With drivers needing, by law, to rest from time to time, coaches on long journeys will have two. As a back-up, drivers' hours are closely monitored by the tachograph - once dubbed by truckers as the \"spy in the cab\" - which records the numbers of hours that drivers complete and the speed at which they drive.</p> <p>But the worries about the threats of litigation from parents and the damage caused by bad publicity are understandably making head teachers less keen than they used to be about organising the kind of trips that are designed to build on what a child learns in the classroom.</p> <p>By coincidence, last week, a motion was discussed at the annual conference of the Professional Association of Teachers, highlighting delegates' concerns about the mass of red tape and bureaucracy involved in school trips. </p> <p>While acknowledging the need for many of the steps on health and safety grounds, the motion said: 'Conference believes that the level of regulation and bureaucracy involved in taking pupils out of school is so great that it is no longer considered 'worth the effort'\".</p> <p>Written consent, for example, is required by parents as well as full details of any allergies that a child might have, medication that they might need and permission for the teacher to act as guardian, while transport considerations and the need to check out premises and sites all add to the teachers' workload.</p> <p>The PAT rightly believes that school trips are important and should continue. The safety and welfare of children has always been of paramount importance and should continue to be so. The French tragedy is regrettable, but should not deter parents from sending children on valuable extra-curricular trips of this kind which can do so much to broaden their horizons.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/h_s_ev/index.htm\" target=\"_new&quot;\">Department of further and higher education</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/a-z/Out_of_school_Activities_ba.html\" target=\"_new&quot;\">DFEE on out-of-school activities</a><br> <a href=\"www.pgl.co.uk/\" target=\"_new&quot;\">PGL Travel</a><br> <a href=\"www.boys-brigade.org.uk/\" target=\"_new&quot;\">Boys' Brigade</a></p>",
  "<p>You tend not to associate the word \"politics\" with the phrase \"Edinburgh fringe comedy festival\", unless you're talking about the Scottish Assembly. So why am I taking my own brand of Chomsky-lite stand-up to the Edinburgh fringe this month? Political comedy is dead. The ideological battles are over. History has ended. There is no alternative. There is no conflict between the interests of workers and bosses - in fact, there aren't even workers and bosses any more. </p> <p>If there's one thing comedy loves more than rigidities, authoritarian pronouncements, lies, conformity, ideologues and the views of rich people in general, it is this: a world in which everything has been sorted out lovely and we're all working together like a team. (Two fellers pouring cement together, one fat, one thin. A sunny day. Pocketing his fob-watch, the foreman sets off for lunch, happy in the knowledge that when he comes back it'll all be finished.) </p> <p>Newsnight editor Peter Horrocks embraced this mood of togetherness when he told his staff in 1997: \"Our job should not be to quarrel with the purpose of policy, but to question its implementation.\" Everything has turned out nice - even if there are still some people who don't realise that the class war is over and believe there is a conflict of interest between bosses and workers. People like the International Herald Tribune, say, whose recent jubilant front-page announced: Rise In Joblessness Delights US Markets. And BusinessWeek with its headline: Thanks, Goodbye - Amid Record Profits Companies Continue To Lay Off Employees. (Two men whistling, and the gentle rumble of an approaching steamroller.) </p> <p>Everywhere people are angry, betrayed, working longer hours just to pay their bills, and hoping they never get ill or old or have kids who want to go to university. Nowadays political stand-up gets the kind of response in places like Barnstaple, Gravesend and Maidstone that five years ago you used only to get in Liverpool, Glasgow, Manchester or Sheffield. In as unlikely a place as the Hampshire market town of Petersfield, for example, I noticed people were particularly angry. I'd only been on stage 10 minutes before many of them were standing up, grabbing their coats and rushing out in a seething revolutionary mass. An insurgent mob demanding money from the theatre-owners themselves! </p> <p>The past 20 years have seen a rollback of a century's social progress and democracy. This presents politically involved musicians, writers, artists, film-makers and performers with a challenge: how to describe the Hydra of corporate-led globalisation. Or, to put this question strictly in terms of comedy: when the central fact of life is an unprecedented upward transfer of power and wealth from people to unaccountable private tyrannies, where da gags gonna come from? </p> <p>Well, firstly you can forget about conventional satire. Lampooning politicians is inherently reactionary. By attacking individual politicians, satire implies that were it not for these few \"rotten apples\" - bunglers or swindlers - then the system of corporate-led globalisation itself would be just fine and dandy. John Pilger has described conventional satire as a handy safety-valve. </p> <p>Satire has no fire in its belly and believes in nothing. Which is why the producer of a famous TV satire show told me that there is no such thing as poverty in Britain, nor are there \"systems\" or \"class interests\". (He then went on to moan how everyone thinks he is right-wing, but really he isn't anything.) </p> <p>Satire always ends up following the news agenda and replicating its institutional biases - for example, the habit of ignoring issues to talk about power-play, intrigues and the whole wretched soap opera of Westminster gossip. (Quite apart from the fact that separate studies show that 40% of all \"news\" items are laundered PR messages that come from \"issues management\" firms like Burson Marsteller and Hill &amp; Knowlton. ) </p> <p>I'm not saying that having a pop at individual politicians or CEOs is always pointless. Just that there's satire and satire. A great political comedian like Roberto Benigni never gives Fiat chariman Gianni Agnelli and media mogul Silvio Berlusconi the legitimacy those feudal lords claim for themselves. When Benigni does Agnelli's walk or Berlusconi's slow head-turn, their arch-grandiosity seems like a bubble they can go around in just so long as they never meet the real world. He gets laughs off them precisely because he shows them to be mere, witless, products of a rigged system. In Italy they call this system appartenenza; in Britain it's called the \"public-private partnership\". In both countries it means the same: a socialist nanny state lavishing corporate welfare on the rich and \"tough love\" capitalist market discipline on the poor. </p> <p>Same with Michael Moore. When the people's champ gives us the dope on corporate bosses and sweatshop kings, he never presents their greed as some kind of deplorable personal trait. Moore never suggests they should be replaced by some other CEO who is less greedy. A nice CEO! A gentle robber baron! To a union-man like Moore they are part of a process of exploitation (and part of that same system that BBC \"satire\" producers don't believe in). </p> <p>The Zapatistas define humanity as \"the struggle against de-humanisation, the struggle to walk upright in a world that keeps pushing us down\". This could be a description of Chaplin's Modern Times, right down to that see-saw floor of his rickety shack. Or Laurel and Hardy, or Steptoe, or Richard Pryor. The modern satirical idea, however, is somewhat different. Instead of misfits trying to conform, we have conformists trying to look rebellious. </p> <p>PJ O'Rourke, Jeremy Clarkson, David Aaronovich, Richard Littlejohn, Rush Limbaugh - all these self-styled \"iconoclasts\" are, in fact, high-priests of dominant and fashionable orthodoxy. These brave and rugged frontiersmen want to impress us with their subversive views, but when do we ever hear anything else anyway? All we ever get is the corporate-friendly view. Where are the acres of news space about grassroots alternatives to the free market? Where are the black feminists' syndicated columns? Jeremy Clarkson hurls manful defiance at the new green tyranny of endless eco-shows like, er, Top Gear, The Car's the Star, Grand Prix Highlights and The Farnborough Air Show. Listen, bubblecut: BP is in the_ govern_ment! </p> <p>Apart from TB, one characteristic that this neo-liberalism shares with other golden ages of political comedy, like the late 19th century, is that the gags just write themselves. At last week's demonstration against tube privatisation, Bob Crowe of the RMT described how a gas company is running the fire station, Virgin is supplying gas, Western Water is bidding for the tube, and non- emer gency ambulances are in the hands of a mini-cab firm. Not only has Dickens's Circumlocution Office been privatised but Podsnappery is flourishing too. In Dickens's description of Podsnap in Our Mutual Friend you can almost see Tony Blair or Clare Short when someone confronts them with one of those words that have been taken out of the dictionary, like \"class\" or \"imperialism\": </p> <p> Mr Podsnap settled that whatever he put behind him he put out of existence. There was a dignified conclusiveness - not to say a grand convenience - in this way of getting rid of undesirables_ Mr Podsnap had even acquired a peculiar flourish to his right arm in often clearing the world of its most difficult problems, by sweeping them behind him (and consequently sheer away). </p> <p>All year BBC economics correspondents and New Labourites have been saying that there is \"almost zero unemployment in the US\". A quick phone call to the Census Bureau or the American Bureau Of Labor Statistics might give them figures between 12m and 15m. Not including the 2m banged up. But that's not the point. In today's elitist cant, if the facts don't fit, they have to be suppressed for the ideology to survive. </p> <p>And this brings us to one of the major obstacles to doing a political comedy show: such is the state of British \"news media\", there is a real information problem. If, for example, you happen to have a hilarious yet rousingly defiant routine on the recent Bolivian water riots, you first have to: </p> <p>a) convince people that they've happened; and </p> <p>b) tell them what happened. </p> <p>And in doing this you run the risk of clogging up your act, over-loading it with stodgy chunks of background data. But the flipside of this is that there is sometimes an agreeable expectation when audiences can't quite see where the next gag's gonna come from - a tension I have been known to let build up for an hour. </p> <p>Ironically, one of the reasons the public don't have the facts is what Jeremy Hardy describes as the \"tyranny of humour\". Every news and current affairs show has its gonky comedy bit. I like to think that my stand-up shows are one of the few places people can escape this incessant humour, the wall-to-wall comedy of our chuckle-culture. </p> <p>Even as audiences queue up, an expectant grin on their vacant maws, I like to watch them through a crack in the dressing room door and think: I'll wipe that smile off your face. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert Newman's new show, Resistance Is Fertile, is at the Assembly Rooms (0131-226 2428) from August 12-17. He will be giving a series of free lunchtime lectures at the Stand (0131-558 7373) from August 14.</p>",
  "<p>Eusebio had been in Belfast before, and they talk about it even now. September 13 1967, and only the Black Panther's late goal stopped tiny Glentoran from dumping Benfica out of the European Cup competition in which they were to lose to the Ulsterman George Best and Manchester United in the final. </p> <p>The Portuguese striker was also a drinking buddy in those days of Willie Henderson, the Rangers right-winger, an unlikely pairing that was all the more inexplicable because it was wee Willie who called the shots - so much so that he once had Eusebio don a chauffeur's cap to ferry him from pub to bookie. </p> <p>That was a time when the Glasgow club's protestant heritage was rather overwhelming, to put it euphemistically. So Eusebio should have known the score, here of all places. He had played it perfectly, smiling as he lumbered to the centre circle, hand in hand with two delighted mascots. The crowd of 11,000 gave him a rousing ovation, as he meandered back to the sidelines, and he was genuinely moved. </p> <p>Eusebio applauded all four stands and then, before the overwhelmingly loyalist crowd, he instinctively crossed himself. Time momentarily stopped. Perhaps, after all, Northern Ireland really is changing. In times gone by such a simple gesture would have sparked a near riot. But no one murmured a word of discontent and the afternoon's entertainment was nicely set up. </p> <p>The pity was that Liverpool, clashing with Benfica in the decider of the annual Belfast Challenge Tournament, sometimes failed to reflect that mood. Several of their players engaged in pathetic, petulant skirmishes, with Vladimir Smicer a particular offender. </p> <p>Michael Owen was nasty, too. Fouled in his own half, he immediately reacted with a cowardly follow-through on his hacker Carlos Marchena. This may be sanctimonious but it seemed to typify the type of arrogance fuelled by wage packets too fat and adulation too overweening. </p> <p>Still, after two first-half misses, Owen did score a cracker, taking off to meet Markus Babbel's wayward right-wing cross. He was parallel to the ground and several feet in the air as he volleyed past Robert Enke from 20 yards. </p> <p><strong> Cruise control</strong><br>That put Liverpool 2-0 up just after half-time and, without looking impressive, they were cruising. Benfica, with their new signing Pierre van Hooijdonk continually dropping his head in that infuriating manner which signals disappointment that his team-mates fail to meet his own high standards, were looking pretty poor. </p> <p>They had gone behind to a Titi Camara diving header on 10 minutes, picked out by Smicer - who was replaced in the second half by Nicky Barmby - after a corner that never was, and made no inroads in a midfield in which Gary McAllister was the best player by a considerable margin. He played some lovely little backspin dinks, fine one-twos and through-balls and generally ran the show. </p> <p>But with Dieter Hamann anonymous and Jamie Carragher, holding in Steven Gerrard's absence, out of his depth, Liverpool were over-reliant on a 35-year-old Scot. His withdrawal was always going to scupper the side. So it was to prove when G\u00e9rard Houllier pulled him off after 65 minutes, exacerbating the imbalance by putting on a striker, Erik Meijer. </p> <p>Benfica began to dominate, with Karel Poborsky particularly impressive. His career with Manchester United guaranteed him Liverpool boos every time he touched the ball but his two-goal performance won him grudging applause when he was brought off just before the end. </p> <p>His first was a wonderful scissor-kick as he lingered unmarked at the back post and his second again exposed defensive frailties. Three players backed off him as he ran from his own half to finish beyond Sander Westerveld, with Carragher the main culprit. </p> <p>Liverpool held out for a draw and, having thumped Glentoran 4-0 in the first game, pipped Benfica to the silverware. It may be their only trophy come the end of the season. </p> <p>They were, as usual, hamstrung with injuries. Robbie Fowler is out for six weeks after damaging an ankle against Glentoran and Gerrard, Emile Heskey and Jamie Redknapp were all missing. But they need to improve considerably and will be grateful that their first Premiership fixture sees the relegation favourites Bradford City visit Anfield on Saturday week. </p> <p><strong> Exposed</strong><br>Houllier, who refused to discuss whether Middlesbrough's Christian Ziege is on his way, said: \"It was a disappointing result because we were in command of the game. We let it slip. This is the type of match we need to learn from to help us prepare for the league ahead. We exposed ourselves on too many occasions, and there is no way that we can afford to let two-goal leads slip.\" </p> <p>The other Saturday game in the four-team tournament saw the Irish league champions Linfield, who had lost to Benfica 3-2 earlier in the week, defeat the IFA cup winners Glentoran 2-0. The match doubled up as the Charity Shield decider and was of more immediate interest to most of those at Windsor Park. </p> <p>But they were pleased to see leading teams visiting Northern Ireland, a rare enough occasion these days with the tough qualification demands for Europe. Memories become all the more important, such as the time Glentoran's player-coach John Colrain's ninth-minute spot-kick pushed 45,000 Glentoran fans into dreamland and almost dumped Benfica out of Europe. </p> <p> <strong> Benfica</strong> (4-4-2): Enke; Calado, Madeira, Marchena, Escalona (Nunes, h-t); Poborsky (Miguel, 90min), Meira (Chano, 44), Maniche, Rojas; Sabry, Van Hooijdonk (Tomas, 70). </p> <p><strong> Liverpool</strong> (4-4-2): Westerveld; Babbel (Song, 62), Henchoz, Hyypia, Traore; Smicer (Barmby, 49), Hamann, Carragher, McAllister (Meijer, 65); Owen, Camara (Berger, 77).</p>",

  "<p><strong> Surrey</strong> struck a significant blow in their determination to retain the County Championship title when with substantial help from their spinners Ian Salisbury and Saqlain Mushtaq on Saturday they crushed third-placed <strong> Lancashire</strong> by 272 runs at the Oval. </p> <p>With <strong> Yorkshire </strong> limited to 10 points from their draw against <strong> Somerset</strong>, Surrey have opened an 11-point gap at the top, with Lancashire 19 points adrift in third place. Salisbury took five for 46 and Saqlain three for 45 as Lancashire, chasing 418, were toppled for 145, their first First Division defeat this season. </p> <p>Yorkshire were given no hope of chasing victory at Taunton after unbeaten centuries by Peter Bowler (139) and Keith Parsons (108) saw Somerset declare on 368 for three, exactly 400 ahead. </p> <p><strong> Hampshire's </strong> Alan Mullally returned five for 95 at Derby to give him career-best match figures of 14 for 188, but his efforts were still not good enough to secure a second win of the season as a career-best innings of 79 by Luke Sutton, together with Michael Di Venuto's unbeaten 78, enabled <strong> Derbyshire </strong> to cling on for a draw. </p> <p>The India leg-spinner Anil Kumble returned match figures of 10 for 105 but could not force a victory for <strong> Leicestershire </strong> over <strong> Kent</strong>, who had followed on 174 runs behind at Canterbury. </p> <p>In the Second Division, <strong> Glamorgan's</strong> promotion push was interrupted by a 10-wicket defeat by <strong> Gloucestershire </strong> at Bristol, where Alastair Bressington had match figures of five for 49 on his debut. </p> <p>In Colombo, Lance Klusener hit an unbeaten 50 to check a <strong> South Africa </strong> batting collapse against <strong> Sri Lanka</strong> yesterday on the first day of the third and final Test. When rain stopped play shortly before tea, South Africa had made 194 for seven after sliding to 103 for five.</p>",
  "<p>Faith in England remains measured in days rather than years. Two days earlier, an uplifting century by Alec Stewart had encouraged a mood in which the series, nay the world, was now a formality. One Brian Lara century later, and fears that defeat has become an awful possibility are impossible to ignore. </p> <p>West Indies' lead of 235, with four wickets remaining, might still prove vulnerable today if they are dismissed in the first hour, but few will challenge Lara's assumption that his side is the likeliest to be pressing for victory. </p> <p>\"There is not much life in the pitch, but there are a few lbw decisions around for bowlers who bowl straight,\" said Lara. \"It is going to be tough for England. We have shown a lot of character to fight back in the past two days and this is going to be their opportunity to do so.\" </p> <p>Dominic Cork, the most economical member of England's attack, kept Lara in check as successfully as anyone. But Lara's own estimate that he went into the match \"only 75% fit\" understandably failed to convince a bowler who had just received a close-up reminder of his talents. </p> <p>\"There was no way that you could sense from 22 yards away that he wasn't fully fit,\" said Cork. \"Probably it was more a case of match practice than match fitness. It was a good Test pitch and felt like a long day.\" </p> <p>The second new ball, which was envisaged as the source of England's recovery, turned out to be their greatest embarrassment. At 223 for three, West Indies led by 76 and the speedy dismissal of Lara then would have convinced England's bowlers that a benign surface could yet yield victory. </p> <p>Lara recognised it as \"the critical time\". Forty runs came from the next seven overs, and as the skies around Old Trafford lightened, the mood visibly darkened. Darren Gough huffed and puffed to little effect, while Andrew Caddick fretted over an absence of rhythm while all around him there was Caribbean carnival. </p> <p>To retreat to the off-spin of Croft, as his name suggests, implied a meagre, subsistence existence. Most striking of the variations he has added to his repertoire (and which will probably not prolong his Test career) is the one where he freeze-frames in his delivery stride for a full second, as if being observed on a dodgy satellite link. </p> <p>If only England could have freeze-framed the mood of Friday evening. Instead, after a summer of short, frantic Test matches, and one-day matches, the realisation gradually dawned that a five-day Test can sometimes be a reality. </p> <p>The reality yesterday was a committed, team-orientated Lara, as one West Indian supporter, with his name daubed in huge letters across her cleavage, clearly recognised.</p>",
  "<p>Football's entire transfer system could be scrapped if the European Union upholds a test case next month that would make the controversial Bosman ruling pale into insignificance by comparison and plunge the game into unprecedented chaos.</p> <p>Payments of transfer fees for contracted footballers would become a thing of the past with, for instance, Manchester United's Roy Keane, the Premiership's highest paid player, able to move any time, anywhere without the club receiving a penny in return. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, smaller clubs who have nurtured and developed rising stars and desperately in need of funds would receive nothing when their most prized assets move on. </p> <p>Until now, contracted players have been unaffected by the five-year-old Bosman ruling which changed the face of European football but only affects those who are out of contract and free agents. But the case now being studied in Brussels would, if upheld, extend Bosman to every professional currently employed in any EC country.</p> <p>The alarming prospect of an end to the transfer system as we know it was the biggest single revelation made by Fifa at its two-day congress in Zurich at the weekend. So anxious is the world governing body to prevent what it believes would lead to total disruption that it has joined forces with Uefa in a rare combined assault on Brussels. </p> <p>Fifa general secretary Michel zen Ruffinen says his organisation has received \"signals\" that the EU might be preparing to rule in favour of Italian club Perugia who have appealed against being forced to pay for a player it recruited from Belgium but who has now left the club. </p> <p>Perugia's ground-breaking case apparently hinges on the fact that under normal employment law, it should not have had to pay anything even though the player concerned was still under contract. </p> <p>In what is being widely viewed as a crucial test case for the future of the game, a preliminary hearing into Perugia's appeal is due to be held next month. If upheld, it could do away overnight with a system that has been in place for decades resulting in alarming ramifications.</p> <p>\"If we allow players under contract to leave without any compensation, it would be a disaster. It would kill football as we know it,\" Zen Ruffinen said. \"It would be impossible to police.\" The combined Fifa-Uefa group of experts is expected to hold its first meeting within the next three weeks to formulate an urgent recommendation to Brussels. </p> <p>\"This is a very dangerous situation and one we need to address very quickly,\" zen Ruffinen said. \"We may have to find some other kind of solution that binds a player to a club.\" </p> <p>Apart from potential transfer chaos, a global agreement that the World Cup should be rotated in future was the other most significant item to emerge from Fifa's 203-nation congress. </p> <p>Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that Africa may not be the only Continent bidding for the tournament when the principle of rotation begins in 2010. </p> <p>It was only after being assured that the African Continent would be in pole position for 2010 that South Africa agreed reluctantly to withdraw its threat to take the controversial 2006 vote, which it narrowly lost to Germany, to a civil court. </p> <p>But there is a growing body of opinion within Fifa that rotating the World Cup around the six Continents will not work. </p> <p>One proposal already being studied is to let any Continent bid for the event provided it has not held either of the last two. Under such a plan South America, for instance, would be permitted to take on Africa next time. </p> <p>\"Let's face it, we wouldn't even be talking about rotation if South Africa had won 2006,\" said Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer. \"Giving the tournament to only one continent each time stifles competition,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Wolves supporters could never be found guilty of being parochial in their choice of goalscoring heroes. </p> <p>After being sustained for more than a decade by a feast of goals from their Black Country boy Steve Bull, they readily welcomed the Hackney-born Nigerian Ade Akinbiyi as a successor. Following his departure to Leicester City they are urging their manager Colin Lee to turn to a man from the desert to avert a potential goal famine. </p> <p>\"Sign him up, sign him up\", they chorused at frequent intervals on Saturday as they were given their first sighting of Saudi Arabian striker Sami Al Jaber. Known as the Alan Shearer of his homeland, the 27-year-old Al Jaber is on a fortnight's trial at Molineux. He is also known to fans of his club, the Asian Cup winners and Saudi champions Al Hilal, as the Blue Wolf because of the colour of his shirt and his predatory instincts in front of goal. </p> <p>Those have resulted in him scoring 200 goals in 420 appearances for the Riyadh-based club and 44 in 80 games for Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>That tally of caps includes two World Cup finals and the match against England at Wembley this year. Despite those impressive credentials, it is a measure of Lee's determination to check out Al Jaber as thoroughly as possible that Wolves lost money on Saturday's match. </p> <p>They agreed to the Department for Education and Employment's demand that, because Al Jaber does not have a work permit, all proceeds from the game should be given to charity. </p> <p>If Lee does opt to make the 27-year-old an Old Gold wolf, Al Jaber's international record will not present any problems in securing a permit. </p> <p>And though Lee would not confirm that he is set to pay in the region of \u00a31.5m for the player, the manager appears to be leaning that way after studying videos provided by his agent Phil Graham and watching Al Jaber train and play in two friendlies. </p> <p>\"I think he has proved today he is a talent worth pursuing,\" Lee said after the match against Southampton. \"If you give him the ball in the right areas he is quite exciting and makes things happen. </p> <p>\"He's a clever player and his performance against a couple of strong Premiership defenders is worth fairly high marks. </p> <p>\"I have got another week to look at him and then we will discuss his value and decide whether we are going to take him on.\" </p> <p><strong>Power and pace</strong></p> <p>As yet Al Jaber has not demonstrated his goalscoring prowess in England, failing to score in a private friendly with Leicester City on Thursday and against Southampton on Saturday. It was not for want of trying against the Saints as he went close on three occasions. But the part he played in setting up Wolves' goal on Thursday and his approach play against Glenn Hoddle's men suggest there is more to his game than being a typical target man. </p> <p>Not that he is built like one: his height, physique and dark colouring bring to mind Ossie Ardiles. He is also very quick and resilient, emerging unscathed and unbowed by some crunching challenges from Talul Khahlej, Southampton\u00b9s Moroccan defender. </p> <p>It was Khahlej\u00b9s compatriot Hassan Kachloul who settled matters at Molineux with a 54th-minute goal after the Latvian striker Marian Pahars had cancelled out Andy Sinton's opener for the hosts. The defensive lapses that resulted in those goals will concern Lee but he need not be worried about Al Jaber's motives for wanting to become the first Saudi to play in England. If he does so then he will add to the ever-increasing number of nationalities on view in the Premiership and Football League but, unlike some of them, Al Jaber is anything but a footballing mercenary. </p> <p>By joining Wolves he would be exchanging the well-paid trappings of stardom in Riyadh, which include a villa with pool, playing in front of 40,000 crowds, and the desert sunshine, for cold January nights at such footballing outposts as Grimsby. </p> <p>It is an exchange Al Jaber, who says Marco van Basten was his favourite European player, will make gladly. It is also long overdue. </p> <p>\"Until a year ago we were not allowed to play for foreign clubs, he explained. \"The rule was ended because it was felt if players got experience of other leagues, especially in Europe, it would benefit the national team. </p> <p>\"Now one player is playing for a club in China and another in Holland. </p> <p>\"I hope to be the first to play in England because I want to widen my horizons and improve my game. I believe I can do it here with Wolves.\"</p>",
  "When the historians come to judge Labour's first term in office, they may well regard constitutional reform as its most radical achievement. A government condemned for control freakery in its handling of internal party management has in fact given away more power than any administration since Clement Attlee presided over the dismantling of the British empire. <p>Whether by creating a parliament in Scotland, assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland or a mayoralty in London, Labour has remade the landscape of the British constitution. This is no abstract achievement, of interest only to political scientists and anoraks. For the way a nation governs itself affects how it is governed: by changing our constitution, we hope not only to get a neater looking system but also better railways, schools or hospitals. </p> <p>Constitutions matter, and Labour's task for the second term is to sort out the confusion and outright messes left by the overhauls of the first - and then to reform some more. Devolution has certainly left a patchwork of confusion, duplication and redundancy. A second-term clean-up should seek to shift to Edinburgh those extra powers the Scots want and to give Wales (and, in time, Northern Ireland) much the same degree of autonomy - with the eventual aim of confining Westminster's workload to those decisions which affect the entire United Kingdom. </p> <p>Decision-making for England should, where possible, move away from Westminster and towards either local or regional government: that way, power would shift dramatically closer to where people actually live. Perhaps an even clearer case of unfinished business than devolution is the House of Lords. Labour's partial reform of the second chamber, by removing all but 92 of the hereditary peers, was a welcome first step - but it has created a new set of problems. The Lords continues to hold up the government's programme, except now Labour cannot dismiss it as an entirely fraudulent body, overwhelmingly selected by aristocratic bloodline. </p> <p>It has acquired a spurious legitimacy, even though it is barely more democratic than the blue-blood house it replaced. The government should move swiftly in the second term to put aside the timidly conservative proposals of the Wakeham commission and opt for a fully elected second chamber. It could be a much smaller body than the Commons, with members representing regions rather than constituencies - elected at different times from the lower house to ensure a different political complexion. That way it could do the job so sorely lacking in our current system of \"fused\" rather than separated powers: it could act as a genuine democratic check and balance, holding the executive to account. </p> <p>Its committees might scrutinise new bills and monitor the progress of ones that have recently been passed, to see if they work in practice. They might also interview and then ratify key public appointments, from cabinet ministers to senior judges. </p> <p>Chosen separately from the House of Commons, these committees would be wholly independent, entirely out of reach of government whips and unswayed by patronage from Downing Street. At last, we would have a legislature distinct from the executive, a feature of almost every advanced democracy but our own. </p> <p>Labour should extend the separation of powers in another, much less discussed direction: by peeling the judiciary away from the executive. At present, judges are appointed by an unelected member of the cabinet, the lord chancellor. Instead, Labour should honour its earlier commitment to an independent judicial appointments commission: that body could nominate new judges, who would then be ratified (or not) by the justice committee of a reformed second chamber. </p> <p>Nor can the Commons leave itself out of this process of change. So long as the executive is drawn from the majority party in the Commons, it is naive to expect the lower house to behave independently: the government, by definition, will always get its way in the end. More realistic is to seek reforms to the way the house works. </p> <p>In 1997 Labour promised a referendum on a new voting system for the Commons: it should honour that promise in the next term. It should also make good on all its rhetoric of modernisation by dragging Westminster's working procedures out of the Victorian dark ages. Labour should say yes to normal daytime office hours, yes to electronic voting - and yes even to breastfeeding in the chamber. </p> <p>One last piece of the constitution is left - and it is over-ripe for change. It is unrealistic to imagine any government altering the way we choose our head of state in a single term of office. </p> <p>But Labour can at least give a formal seal to the process of debate - a debate which is already under way in the country. The government should establish an \"unroyal commission\" to look at the monarchy and to imagine how Britain might choose its head of state once the Queen is no longer on the throne. This should be no panel of the great and the good, but rather a standing forum for dialogue - a kind of constitutional convention for the 21st century. </p> <p><b>Pledges</b></p> <p><b> 1.</b> A fully elected second chamber </p> <p><b> 2.</b> Referendum on a new voting system for the House of Commons </p> <p><b> 3.</b> Independent appointment of senior judges </p> <p><b> 4.</b> An \"unroyal commission\" to debate the selection of Britain's head of state </p> <p><b> 5.</b> Abolish \"Whitehall\" and move beyond the old rigid government department</p>",
  "Sir Robin Day, who has died aged 76, was the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television and strove throughout his career to assert balance and rationality into television's treatment of current affairs. <p>He was the youngest of four children by nine years. His father, a Lloyd George Liberal, was on the administrative staff of the Post Office. Robin was educated at Bembridge School, had an uneventful wartime period in the Royal Artillery, became a captain, and went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1947 at the age of 24. </p> <p>He made his mark at Oxford as a memorable president of the union. Then he had a brief spell at the bar, but decided after two years that the prospect of success was too distant. He spent one year with the British information services in the United States, was briefly employed, on a temporary basis, by BBC Radio. In 1955 he joined Independent Television News, at its launch, as one of its new breed of newscasters.</p> <p>ITN made him. It gave him, by his own account, his happiest four years in television. He was not an instant success. It was originally felt, by his colleagues as well as critics, that he was too unsympathetic and harsh in manner, but this view changed as he developed an entirely new style of interviewing.</p> <p>In the pre-Day era, interviews were almost always respectful, generally dull and stiff, often insipid. Day asked the direct question pointed like a dagger at the jugular. The turning point in his career was an interview with Sir Kenneth Clark, chairman of Independent Television, at a time when proposals were mooted to cut ITN's time and money. Day asked him questions about ITN's future which dumbfounded colleagues and television critics alike by their directness. It was unprecedented at that time that the person in ultimate charge should be questioned about his responsibilities by one of his own employees. The interview made a dramatic impact.</p> <p>There followed a number of historic interviews which established Day's reputation: with Egypt's President Nasser after the Suez war, when Day sought to pin him down on whether he accepted the existence of the state of Israel; with ex-US president Harry Truman: \"Mr President do you regret having authorised the dropping of the atomic bomb?\"; and notably with former British prime minister Harold Macmillan in 1958: \"the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public\" (Daily Express). </p> <p>This interview made Macmillan - forever known afterwards as - Supermac into a television personality and was probably the first time that television became a serious part of the political process. Day also made parliament come alive (years before it was shown on television) with his unscripted reports of the heated debates during the Suez war.</p> <p>In 1959 Day moved to Panorama, then the most prestigious programme on current affairs. The BBC never really made the best use of his talents, except at elections and eventually in Question Time. The fashion turned against \"talking heads\" and \"government by debate\" with which he, above all others, was identified. He was gradually sidelined, as a chairman who simply opened and closed programmes, or even not used at all. </p> <p>He described his pre-Question Time period at the BBC as 10 years in the wilderness. There was even a period of nearly two years when he never appeared on the box at all.</p> <p>In the early-1970s he became more deeply involved in radio, where he again proved an innovator with It's Your Line, a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people for the first time to put questions directly to the prime minister and other politicians. This in turn spawned Election Call. </p> <p>He also presented The World At One for eight years but he never felt that radio was his metier. He was not at his best reading from a prepared script, particularly towards the end of his time on The World At One and it is significant that in his memoirs he dismisses his eight-year contribution with a single sentence.</p> <p>General elections were the time when all the grand inquisitor's talents as cross-examiner were on full display, when the television public saw \"the scowling, frowning, glowering\" Robin Day \"with those cruel glasses\" (Frankie Howerd's description), as well as the relieving shafts of humour. But his most satisfying role in television came relatively late, in 1979, with Question Time. At last he was given his own show with an audience, which he had long asked for, though late at night, as a temporary, six-month \"filler\" and mainly as a way of giving him something to do. Its success in becoming, under his chairmanship, the most popular and effective current affairs programme on television reveals a great deal about his talents.</p> <p>Why did Robin Day become a national institution, one of the most immediately recognised persons in the land, outshining in reputation and respect other TV stars whose shows commanded far larger audience figures (and, as he much resented, far higher salaries)? It was because he had a unique combination of qualities. He was a very big personality in the true sense, with immense authority. He was extraordinarily witty. A collection of good Day jokes would fill a minor anthology. Question Time also brought out his charm and showmanship. </p> <p>He was inordinately proud of his Old Time Music Hall gifts and would insist on showing visitors to his flat videos of his appearances on the Morecombe and Wise Christmas shows and especially of his Flanagan and Allen rendering of Underneath the Arches on the Des O'Connor show, in which he out-starred and out-sang O'Connor. But, above all, he was one of the most well-informed, widely read and serious political figures in public life.</p> <p>Robin Day imbibed politics almost from the day he was born. His father brought him up to revere parliament and great parliamentarians. As a nine-year-old he was taken to hear Churchill speak (in the rain). Respect for parliament and the traditional institutions of British life, such as the monarchy and the legal profession was at the heart of his political philosophy all his life.</p> <p>It might be said that his interests were somewhat conventional and narrow. He was almost fixated by parliament and seemed to think that if someone had made a great parliamentary speech they had won a great battle, when in fact it was events outside parliament that were transforming British politics. His world was one of party politics and current events, rather than long-term trends. He was not particularly interested in industrial affairs or economics or developments in European countries. </p> <p>Gradually his private views became more and more conservative, at times rather narrowly nationalist, although he did not allow his personal prejudices to show in public or influence his professional performances. But within the boundaries of his particular interests he applied his formidable powers of argument and his extensive knowledge to devastating effect, in private as well as public.</p> <p>He believed passionately in \"government by debate\" and in the need for television to balance pictures of current events with reasoned analysis. Otherwise the powerful visual impact of television would distort and trivialise. </p> <p>He was equally dedicated to the principle that the interviewer had a duty to be well-informed. Many observers commented on his careful preparation. Few realised how assiduous he was. He would read every current biography and autobiography and nearly every government White Paper. Without research assistants to supply him with background briefings, he would generally be better informed than the cabinet ministers he interviewed. No wonder prime ministers treated him as their equal, and lesser mortals on the political scene regarded him with awe.</p> <p>Day's contribution to British public life was not confined to the media. For 25 years he campaigned tirelessly, and eventually successfully, for the televising of parliament, not in the interests of television but of parliament itself. He claimed that he was the first to present the detailed arguments in favour, in a Hansard Society paper in 1963.</p> <p>He also played a major part in the establishment of the National Lottery. When the Rothschild commission on gambling was set up in 1979, he wrote a letter arguing in detail for the kind of lottery we have today. Lord Rothschild wrote back questioning his arguments. Day replied refuting all criticisms. His arguments prevailed and the eventual report recommended the scheme Day had originally proposed. He followed up with endless letters to successive ministers with relevant responsibilities.</p> <p>In his private life Robin Day had two personalities. To those who did not know him he could at times appear aggressive and insensitive, seemingly interested only in those who were important because of their fame, public success or wealth. He sometimes found it difficult to talk naturally to intelligent women. He might, to some, have seemed the quintessential member of the all-male Garrick club, one of his favourite haunts.</p> <p>To those who knew him well he was the most stimulating, amusing, convivial and warm of companions. He was one of those rare people who was genuinely loved by his friends and will be sorely missed. He was prepared to take infinite pains on their behalf. He was also surprisingly modest. Despite his obvious success in public life, he frequently talked of his career as a relative failure, because he had not achieved anything solid. </p> <p>He regretted that he had never entered parliament and contributed to the real world of politics instead of playing a secondary role through television. He thrived on his public fame and was proud to be the first television star to be knighted, but privately seemed genuinely to feel that his achievements did not compare with those of others who had made their mark in the more traditional professions, especially the law, or by writing learned books.</p> <p>He married Katherine Ainslie, an Australian, then a law don, at St Anne's College, Oxford, in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1985. One of the tragedies of his life was that his eldest son had a fall as a child which caused multiple fractures to the skull from whose effects he never entirely recovered.</p> <p>Some years ago Robin Day had a coronary bypass and he suffered from breathing problems that were often evident when he was on the air. He had always fought against a tendency to put on weight. As an undergraduate he weighed 17 stone and claimed that in the course of his life he had succeeded in losing more weight than any other person.</p>",
  "<p>Considering the roaring success of Scotland's national opera and ballet companies (combined deficit last year: somewhere north of \u00a31.5m), it is only natural that this newly devolved nation should hanker after a national theatre too. Arts institutions are like Pok\u00e9mon cards: every country wants the complete set. </p> <p>Until recently only Nationalists of the Alex Salmond persuasion would lobby openly for a national theatre, while theatre pros were reluctant to back the idea on the record in case it seemed they were applying for the job of director. Here's the Royal Lyceum's artistic director, Kenny Ireland, back in 1997: \"I have no interest in running the Scottish National Theatre.\" </p> <p>But things change, and there is the whiff of opportunity in the air as the Scottish Executive tries to establish its pro-culture credentials. Anyone who is anyone in Scottish theatre showed up to a meeting at the Lyceum at the weekend to discuss the new plan, with the fragrant Siobhan Redmond chairing proceedings from the set of A Doll's House. \"This is the closest I'll ever come to playing Nora,\" she quipped, which must be an Ibsen in-joke. </p> <p>As one sceptic pointed out, Scotland already has shares in a national theatre - the British national theatre, which sits on London's South Bank. But up here everyone knows that it is really as English as Morris dancing. </p> <p>Now don't run away with the idea that a Scottish national theatre might have stalls, a stage and a crush bar. Oh no. This theatre will be rather more conceptual, and it's only tangible embodiment is likely to be a bus, which would take top-drawer theatre to Scotland's more remote regions. This would be a company of no fixed address, drawing on the combined talents of Scotland's theatre folk under the control of what is described as \"a mover and shaker\". </p> <p>Ireland, the undisputed heavyweight champion of Scottish theatre, can move and shake with the best of 'em but it's not clear if his hat is in the ring. Whoever does get the job would also need that key managerial skill of bangin' heids together. A national theatre made up of every theatre company in the nation sounds like a turf-war waiting to happen. </p> <p>Back on the streets, where the brows are somewhat lower, the Pleasance has been having a laugh. In the movie business they call it \"standee-jacking\". A standee is one of those lifesize cut-outs of movie stars used to promote the latest Hollywood blockbuster in cinema foyers. In Edinburgh at this time of year, Nicholas Parsons rates as A-list and the standee to advertise his live chat show was duly jacked. An anonymous call was received and at the agreed hostage drop, Parsons was returned along with a collection of photos taken during his AWOL day on the town. He looked particularly fetching in one of those tartan bunnets with integral ginger wig beloved of the Tartan Army. Ah, the first publicity stunt of August...</p> <p>This diary won't all be filth, we promise, but it's as well to get it out of the system early. And there is no finer filth in Edinburgh than a show called Sodom, which was dashed off by the Earl of Rochester, circa 1670. Due to its extreme profanity and hardcore stage directions, there is no record of this play having been performed in public. Until now. Naturally the Diary was ringside for this historic occasion, which featured simulated \"swiving\" and \"quiddling of the cods\". No fish were harmed. Our favourite couplet went something like this: \"They say he swives women into a trance/So will you when you see his lance.\" </p> <p>The Dairy is no scholar of Restoration comedy, but could it be that no one has staged this play because it's not very good? Strictly for public-school boys and textual analysts. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:guardiary@excite.com\">guardiary@excite.com</a></p>",
  "Arms and ammunition seized in Northern Ireland last night were connected to dissident republicans opposed to the Good Friday agreement, it is now believed. <p>One man was arrested by the RUC after a security operation on the M1 motorway in Northern Ireland last night, in which detonators, ammunition, a submachine gun and a sawn-off shotgun were recovered. </p> <p>The weapons were found in a Vauxhall Cavalier car heading towards Belfast. During the operation, police closed part of the M1 at Sprucefield Junction. </p> <p>Ulster Democratic Party leader Gary McMichael said: \"I am concerned that dissidents are moving weapons from the border areas into the city and fear that they intend to mount attacks on Belfast in the future.\" </p> <p>The find suggested that dissident republican terrorists were planning to carry out attacks in Belfast, he claimed. </p> <p>It was vital that security forces continued to concentrate on eliminating the threat posed by the renegades, added Mr McMichael, whose party has links with the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters and Ulster Defence Association. </p> <p>The find comes at the height of Northern Ireland's marching season, and was followed today by the parades commission's decision to delay a ruling on whether the disputed Apprentice Boys march on Belfast's Lower Ormeau Road can go ahead.</p> <p>Nationalists on the lower Ormeau Road objected to the \"feeder\" march by several dozen Apprentice Boys, which was to be followed on Saturday by a large march in Belfast.

  "<p>\u0095 The nexus between the News of the World and the Mirror in their campaign for Sarah's Law - a public register of convicted paedophiles - was unprecedented. No Mirror title has ever got so close to a Murdoch paper before. </p> <p>Though the Mirror stopped short of supporting the NoW's \"naming and shaming\" exercise, editor Piers Morgan recognised that it played the key role in galvanising public support and provoking the authorities into a debate they had long avoided. So Morgan was happy to take up the cry along with his former colleague, NoW editor Rebekah Wade. Evidence of how they happily coordinated their campaign emerged last week when the parents of murdered Sarah Payne were chauffeur-driven in a News International limousine from Wapping to the Mirror office in Canary Wharf for an interview. </p> <p>But why did the NoW's stablemate, the Sun, not jump on Wade's bandwagon? Surely it can't have anything to do with editor David Yelland's antipathy towards Wade? There must be many Sun readers wondering why their newspaper shunned the Sarah's Law campaign. Including, presumably, Mr Murdoch. </p> <p>*It is not in the least bit interesting that the Times's old-fashioned diary is to die. The fact that it will be replaced by \"an opinionated column\" by Giles Coren is a recognition of the Times belatedly catching up with a rival. Without wishing to doff the cap to my employers (on the other hand, why not?) Guardian readers have long enjoyed the pleasures of a bylined diary. Step forward, Matthew Norman, friend of Mandy, Ali and Mr Tony. </p> <p>There are also diaries graced with pseudonymous titles which do nothing to conceal their authors' identities, at least from the rest of Fleet Street's cognoscenti. So we know that dear Peter McKay masquerades as the Daily Mail's Ephraim Hardcastle, and that the charming Christopher Silvester wields the knife as Brutus in the Daily Express. Both are noted for offering us plenty of their opinions, though I sometimes wonder whether McKay slips in a thought or two from his editor. (Alan, is that how you wanted it phrased?) </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph's Peterborough column is always by-lined nowadays, an innovation rightly prompted by its best writer of recent years, Quentin Letts. At the Independent, its Pandora columnists come and go too fast to warrant fame. Perhaps that paper will soon imitate the Times's move into the 21st century. </p> <p>*Why, as if I didn't know, is everyone being so beastly to Tony Blair about his ban on christening pictures of baby Leo? Here is the dilemma he faces. If he decides to organise photo-calls at various points in the baby's life - christening, first birthday, first tooth - then he will be accused by his press critics of \"using\" the baby for political ends (not to mention usurping the royal family's role). </p> <p>On the other hand, if he refuses to allow any pictures of the baby, he is accused of being \"absurdly heavy-handed\" by censoring \"charming photographs\", to quote the Mirror. As Edwina Currie said on radio the other evening, Blair is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. An uncharacteristic piece of pomposity by Alex Chancellor in the Daily Telegraph echoes that point. He argued that \"no prime minister would carry his baby in public if he didn't want him photographed\". Really Alex! Is he supposed to leave it to his wife? Or a servant? </p> <p>* What is going to happen to the Express titles? Since United News &amp; Media sold off its television interests to Granada, the future for the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star has been a matter of intense interest, mainly to the journalists who feel they have been left in the dark. </p> <p>Does chief executive Clive Hollick want them or not? At the company's announcement of its interim results on Friday, the official line was clear. Well, sort of. Hollick said he had \"no plans\" to sell the papers. It wasn't an unequivocal statement that he won't sell, of course, so I sought out United's public affairs manager, Nigel Main. He repeated the Hollick line and talked of \"plans to drive the business forward\" and investment in web businesses.</p> <p>Which brings us to the company's web division, called Xilerate. Express staff haven't taken too kindly to the way in which this internet offshoot has been hived off into a separate division. It hasn't been much fun at the Express for 25 years, and it's even less amusing nowadays.</p>",
  "Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman has been chosen as democrat Al Gore's running mate in the US presidential elections - the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate in American history. <p>Now in his second term, Mr Lieberman won the biggest upset victory in the country by just 10,000 votes in 1988. Six years later, he made history by winning the biggest landslide victory ever in a Connecticut race for a US senate seat, with a margin of more than 350,000 votes - or 67 per cent of the vote.</p> <p>He is known chiefly for being one of the first senators to criticise the president, Bill Clinton, for his tryst with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \"Having criticised Clinton gets him points from the other side,\" said Howard Reiter, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut. </p> <p>His colleagues agree. \"A lot of problems [vice-president] Gore is having in attracting white men and suburban women come from the connection to the Lewinsky situation,\" said senator John Breaux of Louisiana. Mr Lieberman's decision to criticise Mr Clinton, a fellow Democrat, opened the floodgates for the Republicans to attack the president, who were previously not quite sure how to proceed on such a delicate matter. In choosing Mr Lieberman, Mr Gore is sending a not-so-subtle message that he is turning his back on his mentor on the issue of character.</p> <p>Mr Lieberman's denunciation of the president on the senate floor was considered significant as he was seen as a personal friend of Mr Clinton. However, White House aides scoffed at the notion that the two men were close. They did attend Yale law school at the same time and Mr Clinton worked on Mr Lieberman's state senate campaign. </p> <p>In 1992, Mr Lieberman returned the favour by being the first politician in the north-east to endorse Mr Clinton's presidential bid. But to call the two men friends was a stretch, White House officials said. </p> <p>In 1998, Mr Lieberman and conservative former education secretary William Bennett began handing out \"Silver Sewer awards\" to shame producers of sexually explicit and violent films, music, television programmes and video games. </p> <p>However, in his most recent financial disclosure forms, Mr Lieberman listed holdings of stocks in the broadcasting companies Fox and CBS - two firms awarded Silver Sewer status, leaving him open to the charge of being a hypocrite.</p> <p>Although he carved a niche for himself as a liberal reformer during his 10 years as a state senator, Mr Lieberman's move to the right gives him appeal among Republican voters and politicians. On social issues, Mr Lieberman is a liberal who votes for abortion rights, gun control and tax increases, but he is more conservative when it comes to issues such as defence spending and family values. </p> <p>In Connecticut, Mr Lieberman has gained admiration from Republican governor John Rowland, who recently called the senator \"a great friend of mine; while endorsing Mr Lieberman's senate rival.</p> <p>In endorsing his re-election in 1994, the New York Times wrote: \"Congress would be a better place if more of his veteran colleagues were as good. In only one term he has influenced the course of federal legislation for the benefit of Connecticut and the nation.\"</p> <p>He is the first ever Jewish running mate of a presidential candidate and is a strong supporter of Israel. However, in 1992 he supported F-15 sales to Saudi Arabia. Nathan Diament, director of the institute for public affairs of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, believes that Mr Lieberman is as much a centrist on Jewish matters as he is politically. \"He's not just tolerant, but feels a kinship with traditional and non-traditional Jews alike.\" </p> <p>On Israel, Mr Lieberman believes that it its counterproductive for the US to pressure too publicly, a sentiment that will hardly endear him to the Palestinians who think Mr Clinton sided too much with the Israelis in the recent Camp David talks.</p> <p>When the administration's Middle East policy collapsed at one point and the Jewish leadership fell to bickering, he organised a group of senators to warn Mr Clinton that \"public pressure against Israel\" would be \"a serious mistake - particularly unfair and counterproductive.\" </p> <p>Mr Lieberman has said he will vote on legislation and participate in important meetings on the Sabbath - but won't campaign. He skipped one of his state nominating conventions because it was held on the Sabbath. </p> <p>\"This election is a battle for who wins the American middle,\" Senate minority leader Thomas Daschle said before Mr Gore made his choice. \"With the Gore-Lieberman ticket, you see a real opportunity for Democrats to pick it up.\" </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://pages.cthome.net/hirsch/liebbio.htm\" target=\"_new\">Senate Joe Lieberman biography</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.reagan.com/HotTopics.main/HotMike/document-9.4.1998.4.html\" target=\"_new\">Senator Lieberman's speech on the Lewinsky scandal</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.jewishsf.com/bk980731/usvalues.htm\" target=\"_new\">Jewish Bulletin</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.issues2000.org/Joseph_Lieberman.htm\" target=\"_new\">Issues 2000</a></p>",
  "<p>Law firms in London are increasing the salaries of their first year associates by as much as 30% to stop poaching by Wall Street firms and dot.com start-ups. </p> <p>Recruits to elite law firms can command salaries of \u00a335,000 to \u00a340,000, but there is concern in the profession about the welfare of young lawyers, as employers demand higher returns to recoup the higher pay. The drop-out rate after two years in the job has increased dramatically, while a helpline set up by the Law Society's young solicitors group has recorded a significant increase in callers complaining of stress and being unable to cope. </p> <p>One City law firm has installed sleeping cubicles so that staff can work through the night, while others have onsite medical and dental facilities so staff do not have to leave the office. \"If you wanted to, you could stay here 24 hours a day,\" one recruit said. </p> <p>Sara Chandler, who chairs the young solicitors group, said that it was time big City firms addressed overworking. \"Firms are failing to regard their young solicitors as an asset that might get worn out. Remuneration is not the only aspect of their employment package,\" she said. </p> <p>The bottom line is billing targets: the hours per day a lawyer charges clients for work done on their accounts. To be profitable, solicitors have to bill up to three times their salary to also cover overheads, and as a result of the rises firms demand more billable hours a week than ever. </p> <p>A young associate at one of London's \"magic circle\" firms advised any graduate thinking of taking up the profession to read John Grisham's novel, The Firm, to get an idea of the working conditions. \"The hours are ferocious,\" she said. \"You hear about it before you start and think 'I can handle it', but it really doesn't prepare you for the reality. Higher salaries have increased the harshness of the regime. If you don't hit targets your job security is much less, and you're more likely to find yourself hauled before a partner. It's not the cosy world it used to be.\" </p> <p>The rises are a response both to US law firms and to staff joining dot.coms. According to the Law Gazette, the start was made by Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachi, a small law firm in California's silicon valley which raised first year associates' basic to $125,000 (\u00a383,000). The rest of silicon valley followed suit, and in weeks the revolution had spread to New York; these firms also raised salaries in their London offices, initially paying a \"mid-Atlantic rate\". </p> <p>A survey of 30 US law firms in the City found that newly qualified solicitors could earn up to \u00a3102,000 plus bonuses. In response English firms joined the bandwagon. Clifford Chance was the first, offering first year assistant solicitors an unprecedented \u00a342,000 base salary plus bonuses. </p> <p>But there is a penalty. A partner at one top firm said: \"It is turning them into wage slaves in the marxist sense. They thrive and get the money or, because the performance pressure is jacked up, they may get kicked out.\"</p>",

  "<p>Katie Tarbox, a young American writer, has been making headlines since May, when her autobiographical book, Katie.com, the story of her seduction by an online paedophile, was published in the US. The book is touted by her publishers as: \"An honest, eye-opening account of a young woman who was bitterly betrayed by the information age.\" </p> <p>But another Katie, this time a Londoner, is feeling bitterly betrayed by Penguin, the book's US publishers. Katie Jones, 28, owns the internet address Katie.com, which since May has been inundated with a flood of attention thanks to Tarbox's book. The victim of an unfortunate case of electronic mistaken identity, she is also the proprietor of UKChat.com, one of the most popular independent chat sites in Britain, generating some 40,000 visitors a day. </p> <p>The book describes in graphic detail how Tarbox met a 41-year-old serial sex offender in an internet chat room, and later met up with him in a Texas hotel room, where he molested her. Penguin's publicity machine won Tarbox a review of the \"cautionary memoir\" in People magazine. The New York Times called it \"a testament to the wonders of the modern adolescent\". CNN called Tarbox on to discuss the dangers of \"cyber-predators\". And America's grande dame of morning talk show hosts, Katie Couric of NBC's Today Show, advised parents and teenagers alike to use the book as a guide of what not to do on the internet. </p> <p>In the space of a single day, Jones' personal website had more than 100,000 visitors, and the south London internet entrepreneur started to get emails from hundreds of Tarbox sympathisers, sharing their own experiences of molestation and rape. Jones, who managed chat services for MSN and AOL before leaving to start her own online chat company in 1998, is worried that the stigma of paedophilia and chat-room abuse addressed in the book will seep over from her personal site into her business activities. </p> <p>\"Lots of people know me as Katie Jones, online community person, and I'm known in this industry as the person who owns and runs UK Chat. Now the domain name is always going to be associated with this book,\" she says. \"It's not mine any more, it's theirs, and they didn't even ask me if they could have it.\" </p> <p>Single-name domains such as Katie.com or Bob.com are increasingly valuable as good, simple web addresses are becoming more difficult to get hold of. Bob.com was recently valued at more than $1m. </p> <p>Katie.com used to house Jones' personal CV, pictures of her young son, and a link to her professional site, UKChat.com. But with the release of the American book, with its disturbing subject matter, Jones has closed the site indefinitely. \"I started getting emails from people wondering if I was [the subject of the book],\" she says. \"The site was attracting the wrong kind of attention from the wrong kind of people.\" </p> <p>Jones, through a US lawyer, contacted the book's publishers to inform them of her prior rights on the name Katie.com, but says the only response was a stiff reply insisting that she had no legal leg to stand on. </p> <p>This isn't the first time that two parties have squabbled over a domain name, but Jones' case is unique in one aspect. There are countless numbers of cyber-squatters who have registered domain names of large companies, and tried to extort large fees from the companies in exchange for relinquishing the names. A whole body of law now addresses the rights of companies to extend their trademark to web addresses. But no one has yet tested the right of web address owners to extend their trademark to other offline media. </p> <p>In November 1999, the US congress passed the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, which gave companies recourse against misuse of their trademarks in internet domain names. It expanded previous trademark law in the US, giving better protection against domain name piracy. The trouble for Katie Jones? For starters, Britain doesn't have the same expanded protection against cyber-squatters, and her use of Katie.com isn't a trademark, but for personal use. She is fighting Penguin on the grounds that her privacy has been invaded, rather than trademark infringement. </p> <p>\"It's a grey area of the law. There's no precedent for this,\" she says. \"This is a test case. You don't want to be a test case. It's a horrible thing, but this is an issue that needs addressing.\" </p> <p>Lawyers specialising in internet law say that while Penguin's move may not have been illegal under current law, in today's world, it was certainly clumsy. There's a certain naivety in publishing a book about the internet, with a web address in the title, and publicising the book online (from the website <a href=\"http://www.KatieT.com),\">www.KatieT.com),</a> and making no attempt to buy or secure the logical domain name. \"Why would naming the book KatieT.com devalue it in any way?\" Jones asks. </p> <p>Tarbox's editor, Laurie Chittenden, was au fait with the etiquette and practice of online chat rooms. In 1997 as an assistant editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, she hosted monthly, hour-long chat sessions on AOL called \"Ask the Editor.\" </p> <p>In one notable session, she met a young author, Franklin White, and later signed him to a six-figure, two-book deal. Chittenden told Publisher's Weekly that the online world is a good place to spot trends. \"To be on AOL and the internet, you're on the cutting edge of the ideas that are being transferred back and forth,\" she said. \"Years ago, you had the Parisian salons where people discussed philosophy and literature, and I see online newsgroups and chat forums as similar to this.\" </p> <p>Chittenden, Penguin, and Orion, the book's British distributors, did not respond to requests for comment, but it appears the book's name was changed between when the publisher bought rights to the book, and when it was published. In early publicity, the manuscript was called \"Girl.com.\" The enterprising assistant at Penguin who decided to look up that web address earned their wages, since any sympathetic reader pointing their browser to <a href=\"http://www.girl.com\">www.girl.com</a> would find something more titillating than Katie Jones' baby pictures and CV. </p> <p>Jones' lawyer, Jonathan Taylor with Townleys Solicitors, says she's in a dangerous position going up against the likes of publishing giant Penguin. </p> <p>\"Penguin retains America's leading First Amendment lawyer, and he's the person who's responded [to our complaint],\" Taylor says. \"They recognise it's a serious issue, and they're saying 'we've got the money to defend this to the hilt.'\" Taylor said that the first communique from Penguin's lawyers indicated that as Jones hadn't trademarked the name \"Katie.com,\" she couldn't expect to have exclusive use of the name. \"I can see this as being a legitimate analysis, but it's hardly a responsible attitude to take,\" he says. \"Yes there's freedom of speech, but not absolute freedom. To effectively print a book with someone's address on it goes too far.\" </p> <p>Jones and Taylor both feel they're at the mercy of a large multinational publishing concern with unlimited resources. \"If somebody wrote a book about dodgy booksellers, and called it Amazon.com, they wouldn't stand for it. They have huge resources and I don't have any,\" Jones said. \"I have every sympathy with this girl; clearly something awful happened to her. But at the same time, that doesn't justify them using my domain name, whether it was her doing or the publishers.\" </p> <p>Polly Sprenger writes for The Industry Standard Europe, which launches in October</p>",
  "<p>Bob Shennan, the new controller of Radio 5 Live, is making it very clear, in his quiet but insistent manner, that he has indeed landed his dream job. \"I feel I've been in training for it since I joined the BBC. I wanted it. It doesn't come up very often.\" </p> <p>Radio 5 Live has never looked back since the high-profile relaunch by Jenny Abramsky six years ago, and Shennan is only the third controller of the highly rated sports and news network, which now attracts more than 6m listeners a week. </p> <p>Abramsky, now reaping the rewards of her endeavours as director of BBC Radio (the most senior manager), first handed the baton over to the canny Roger Mosey - like her, a former editor of Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>Mosey, backed up by executives such as Steve Kyte, has introduced a range of changes, including the versatile Nicky Campbell in the mornings. But then the competition suddenly became more fierce, and more vociferous, as Kelvin MacKenzie's Talksport switched its priorities from chat to sport, in an attempt to woo advertiser-friendly, cash-rich young males. </p> <p>The thing that distinguishes Shennan from his two predecessors is that instead of coming from a news background he is a sports expert through and through - well versed in the tricky radio sports-rights market and in handling sporting stars. </p> <p>\"Just as Roger Mosey was absolutely the right person after Jenny - even though it was predominantly driven in audience terms by sport - I think I'm the right person now. I don't think it really matters what people's backgrounds are. It's how they want to move the radio station forward.\" </p> <p>At 38, he is swapping that unhappy billet, head of BBC sport production for television and radio, for the pleasure of running a service still in possession of the crown jewels of sport. And he is doing so as the BBC news empire loses control of 5 Live, allowing it to slot in alongside the other four national radio channels under Abramsky. This, says Shennan, represents a perfect opportunity for the station to redefine itself. \"I want Radio 5 Live to feel like a real radio station, not a BBC network made up of two strands, news and sport. </p> <p>\"When people come in to work here, I want them to feel they are working for 5 Live, as they do in Radio 1 and Radio 2. I want to blur the edges, smooth out the gear changes for listeners,\" he adds, referring to the abrupt shifts between hot news inputs and live sport. \"There is a bumpy sound to some parts of the schedule.\" </p> <p>The tension of being a hybrid and having to play two roles can't entirely be wished away with snazzier jingles or more sports news programmes. But Shennan sees strength coming from melding the two elements more carefully. For example, drive-time's Peter Allen co-presented the Open from St Andrews last month, and the breakfast show was broadcast from there in much the same way that the Today programme moves to Brussels or Washington for key political events. </p> <p>Over the past 18 months or so, Shennan notes approvingly that there's been a push to beef up the role of sports news. \"It's about making sure the whole of the radio station recognises the value of sport. I don't want there to be a sense that there are times when sport switches on and everyone in news goes home, or vice versa. It does happen. It's a very, very ambitious network with diverse tones of voice,\" he says. </p> <p>Shennan, educated at Lancaster grammar school, joined the BBC from Cambridge University armed with an English degree and a stint at Radio Hereward. A radio sports trainee, he rose to become head of radio sport as the first, unsuccessful version of Radio 5 Live stumbled onto the air. He is surprised at how slow the commercial operators were in the early days to spot the potential of radio sport. </p> <p>Given this pedigree, it is hardly surprising that Shennan is less keen on by-elections, prime minister's questions and rolling news. The news wing of Radio 5 is making fearful noises in private. Shennan, however, claims they have nothing to worry about. \"There is not going to be a huge shift or a dramatic move away from news. I want to evolve the station, not revolutionise it.\" </p> <p>Indeed, with digital radio expansion still some years away, 5 Live is unlikely to eliminate news or a commitment to breaking stories, such as the Paddington rail crash or by-election declarations. \"My role is to build a sense of one radio station. I want to make a strength of the fact that we have these two distinctive strands.\" </p> <p>The question of competition, specifically in the form of MacKenzie's Talksport, is one that he is keen to bring up: \"I am very alive to the challenges we face.\" </p> <p>Radio 5 Live gave an early demonstration of this new awareness when it finally took action this summer against Talksport's practice of covering events to which the BBC owned exclusive rights. After a year of hand-wringing, lawyers were employed when Talksport commentated on televised Euro 2000 matches. </p> <p>\"It's very sensible for the BBC to protect its investment, and increasingly, rights-holders will be pleased, rather than having to take action themselves. I see Euro 2000 as quite straightforward. We bought the rights to broadcast live and exclusive, and Talksport was not around when the whole process was negotiated. </p> <p>\"There were no national sports broadcasters when we launched. There certainly are now. Inevitably, we are challenged. The key part of our strategy is going to be maintaining that portfolio [of sports rights] in every way we can.\" </p> <p>Radio 5 Live, he agrees, already has a healthy budget of \u00a365m. Will it get more? It sounds possible. Negotiations are just opening for radio rights to the Premiership - 5 Live has them for one more year. </p> <p>\"We have to make sure we maintain the integrity of the output. We will bid competitively for Premier League rights. Holding on is very important for us,\" promises Shennan. </p> <p>But, as he points out, 5 Live has done well (certainly far better than television) in holding on to the crown jewels - cricket, the Open, Six Nations rugby, formula one and the FA Cup. </p> <p>But he could be inheriting the station as it peaks: \"There is still potential; it could go further. It will depend on a number of things working in our favour. Maybe sports audiences are quite close to their maximum.\" </p> <p>The key, therefore, is probably more attractive news programming and fresh thinking. Nurturing articulate sports stars with a background in professional sport is one of Shennan's pet projects. \"I want to develop new, key talent,\" he says. He points to the way Gary Lineker, Steve Cram and Clare Balding have been brought on. </p> <p>\"I want to introduce new voices. Ian Wright and Mark Bright - now that could be a strong team.\" He goes on to praise John Inverdale, one of Radio 5 Live's stars, who has been tempted across to television. \"He's not going to disappear - he's very symbolic of what 5 Live is about. He's a terrific journalist, with all-round knowledge, and a wonderful tone of voice.\" </p> <p>What Shennan's appointment means for David Mellor's Football 606 - already moved from its Saturday slot - is less clear. \"He's been a tremendous success at 5 Live. He's been here a long time, and he'll do it for the next season. But it's always my job to think about the future and refresh things.\" </p> <p> <strong>'No-one else does it'</strong></p> <p><strong> March 1994</strong><br> Five months after being given the go-ahead, Radio 5 Live is launched with a new 24-hour news and sports format, replacing BBC Radio 5. \"Nobody else does it,\" says its controller, Jenny Abramsky. Its \u00a330.2m budget includes an unprecedented \u00a31m advertising allowance. Personality presenters such as Ian Botham and David Mellor are among extra staff recruited. </p> <p><strong> August 1994</strong><br> First detailed listening figures show a gain of 500,000 listeners over 5 Live's predecessor, with 4.7m tuning in each week. </p> <p><strong> February 1995</strong><br> Talk Radio UK is launched, competing for the same listeners. </p> <p><strong> April 1996</strong><br> Radio 5 Live is named UK station of the year at the Sony Radio awards for its sports broadcasting in particular - \"so engaging that it makes listeners feel they are actually there at the event itself\". Sport provides the largest audience, with up to 800,000 listeners. </p> <p><strong> October 1996</strong><br> The editor of the Today programme, Roger Mosey, is appointed new controller of 5 Live. </p> <p><strong> March 1997</strong><br> Football presenter Danny Baker is fired for urging listeners to doorstep a referee and make his life hell. Talk Radio signs him up. </p> <p><strong> March 1997</strong><br> The audience for 5 Live's breakfast programme has risen to one-third of Today's 5m. Its listeners are younger, more regional and less upmarket. </p> <p><strong> December 1997</strong><br> \"There's enough sport around not only for 5 Live, but for us too,\" says the boss of Talk Radio, Peter Robinson. </p> <p><strong> April 1999</strong><br> Radio 5 Live loses winter Test cricket rights to Talk Radio. However, it has 5.2m listeners a week, up from 4.7m in April 1994. </p> <p><strong> August 2000</strong><br> Figures show a fall from 5 Live's record reach of 6.2m in the previous quarter to 5.8m. Slight share fall from 4.4% to 4.1%. Moves under Jenny Abramsky's control.</p>",
  "US vice president and Democratic party candidate Al Gore has selected Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman to be his running mate - the first Jewish vice presidential candidate in American history <p>Gore planned to offer Lieberman the job in a telephone call later today, according to several Democratic party sources. Lieberman has indicated he will accept. </p> <p>The sources said Gore made his decision after discussions late Sunday night and early this morning with top advisers, including former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who headed up his search process, his brother-in-law Frank Hunger, his wife Tipper and campaign chairman Bill Daley. </p> <p>The vice president and his running mate are expected to appear together at a noon rally tomorrow in Nashville. Lieberman, 58, beat five other finalists: Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina, John Kerry of Massachusetts; House of representatives minority leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and New Hampshire governor Jeanne Shaheen. </p> <p>The Gore campaign hoped Lieberman's selection would be a bold stroke heading into next week's Democratic national convention in Los Angeles. He trails rival George W Bush in polls after last week's Republican convention. </p> <p>A Democratic centrist, Lieberman would amplify Gore support of fiscal discipline and middle class tax cuts, the sources said. </p> <p>Gore considers his pick a respected voice of independence and integrity, and the sources drew a contrast to the Republican ticket's ties to special interests. Lieberman was an outspoken critic of President Bill Clinton's conduct during the impeachment controversy. </p> <p>Polls show Bush benefiting from the so-called \"Clinton fatigue.\" Gore's selection of an Orthodox Jew is a first. </p> <p>Because he and his wife Hadassah observe the Jewish Sabbath from dusk Friday to dusk Saturday, Lieberman is ostensibly prohibited from working then. The senator has interpreted this to mean he may still work during that time, but only to promote \"the respect and protection of human life and well-being.\" </p>",
  "<p>Thousands of troops have been deployed across the western United States as hundreds of wildfires yesterday burned out of control, apparently impervious to bombardments by flying water tankers attempting to halt the blaze. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton is due to visit areas stricken by what has been described as the worst outbreak of forest fires in half a century. The government is spending $15m a day (about \u00a310m) to support 20,000 civilian and military firefighters from 46 states and Canada. </p> <p>The national interagency fire centre (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho, reported yesterday that there were now more than 70 large fires engulfing more than 750,000 acres in 11 states, notably Montana, California, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming. </p> <p>Officials are alarmed that the blazes have come earlier than the usual fire season and that they are proving more difficult to contain. Some of the fires are thought to be so well established that they will only be extinguished by the arrival of snow in October or November. </p> <p>\"The northern Rockies is the hottest place in the country at the moment,\" said Lynn Pisano-Pedigo of the NIFC yesterday. She cited \"dry lightning\" as one of the main causes of the latest outbreak. </p> <p>The weather conditions that produce dry lightning are expected to continue for several weeks - a combination of high temperatures, low humidity and rainless thunderstorms. </p> <p>Temperatures have also been at record highs in many areas. Weather officials report \"triple digit\" temperatures in central California, making the land even more susceptible to the blazes. </p> <p>Hamilton in Montana is at the centre of the main blazes and yesterday residents were warned to remain indoors because of the thick smoke engulfing the area. </p> <p>More than 300 homes have been evacuated so far, and a further 300 were expected to be evacuated by late last night. </p> <p>A total of 16 large fires were raging in the state, covering 135,000 acres. In Nevada, a helicopter carrying a firefighting crew crashed near Elko, killing one member and injuring three others. </p> <p>In Colorado, the Mesa Verde national park was having to deal with a blaze that threatened the park's research centre and museum. More than 400 firefighters were trying to save the threatened parts of the forest, which is a popular holiday place, aided by helicopters and seven air tankers flying in to drop water on the blaze. </p> <p>In California, the US forest service reported that there were more than 100 wildfires blazing and that some were in areas of brush that have not burned in more than 100 years. Two hundred people were evacuated from Jackson, Wyoming, three days ago and have still not been able to return to their homes. </p> <p>Troops are being trained as temporary firefighters. More than 500 soldiers were dispatched from Fort Hood in Texas yesterday after training, to join 500 other soldiers and 500 marines fighting the fires in Idaho. A further 500 were sent to Montana to back up a beleaguered and exhausted fire crew. </p> <p>The head of the US forest service, Mike Dombeck, said yesterday that the situation was now so serious that Canadian firefighting crews were having to be brought in to help. </p> <p>Since the start of this year, there have been about 62,000 wildfires across the US. They have engulfed 3.76m acres of forest, almost double the 10-year average. </p> <p>One of the reasons for this dramatic increase has been that people are going deeper and deeper into forested areas in the search for seclusion. Wherever there are humans, there is the risk of fires - usually started accidentally, from cigarette ends and barbecues, but sometimes lit deliberately. </p> <p>It is now relatively common for people to start fires and then call the fire service and give themselves a heroic role in fighting the blazes. </p> <p>However, while it would make ecological sense to stop people living in such areas, there would be a political price to pay in restricting residential areas. </p> <p>Marines have been using various techniques to try to contain the blazes, ranging from bombing the fires from above with a mixture of slurry and water, to fighting fire with fire - burning swaths of undergrowth themselves to create firebreaks. </p> <p>But unless weather patterns change, they appear to be fighting a losing battle.</p>",
  "The best-known and loved English actor of the 20th century, Sir Alec Guinness who has died aged 86, was by nature an unostentatious and reserved man. Though he undertook a great variety of roles, all were informed, at heart, with the wisdom of the sad clown. <p>It was that spiritual severity, together with those clear, wide-open eyes - capable of melting in close-up on screen into the most reassuringly serene of smiles - which lent his performances force and authenticity. In his later career, he became something of an icon of spirituality and enlightened human understanding - especially after his 1977 performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars.</p> <p>His contract with George Lucas, guaranteed him two per cent of the profit: though the role had been much reduced, and he had almost left the production. The resulting financial security made this already fastidious actor even choosier about live stage roles. After Star Wars he appeared in only two West End plays, and was an unusual and sensitive Shylock at Chichester (1984). </p> <p>But Guinness was not the first great actor to find the ability and the inclination to learn parts after 70 much reduced. He had avoided the theatre for six years before starring as TE Lawrence in Rattigan's Ross in 1960. More than any other English star of his generation, he was equally at home on stage, in film and on the television screen - where he had an Indian summer as John Le Carr\u00e9's spymaster George Smiley.</p> <p>Guinness had an impecunious childhood, and a modest south-coast boarding school education. At 18 he found employment as a junior copywriter in an advertising agency. </p> <p>He describes in his discreet autobiography Blessings In Disguise (1985) how the acting bug had bitten him. On the recommendation of John Gielgud he contacted the formidable and eccentric Martita Hunt - the first woman he had ever met with silk trousers and painted toenails, he later wrote. She coached him for a RADA Leverhulme scholarship audition. But RADA was not giving the award that year, so he enrolled instead at the Fay Compton studio for as long as his money lasted (John Le Mesurier was a fellow student) and then went to work in the London theatre, debuting aged 20 in Libel! at the Playhouse.</p> <p>In his unpretentious and beautifully written book, he exorcised a long-suppressed anxiety about his origins. He was, he made clear, illegitimate - his name a mystery, his father probably called Geddes, the circumstances of his conception, vague. For the rest, Guinness told the tale of his life obliquely, its focus firmly on loved ones and friends rather than on himself. He was there, as it were, in reflection. </p> <p>Finally the question of his birth didn't matter to him, but in the beginning it must have. A reluctance to put himself in the spotlight - an almost neurotic discretion - was the mark of both his professional and personal style. In a 1953 monograph about him published by Rockliff, Kenneth Tynan wrote: \"Were he to commit a murder, I have no doubt the number of false arrests following the circulation of his description would break all records.\"</p> <p>While still only 20 he was a flowery Osric in Gielgud's Hamlet at the New theatre. Thereafter until the war, his career was spent at Old Vic, where he impressed with a modern-dress Hamlet in autumn 1938. </p> <p>He always denied having any technique as an actor - or knowing what technique might be. Yet he was proud of his gift. </p> <p>For Guinness the purpose of acting was to make-believe. The theatre was an act of faith, whose object was to tell the inner truth about situations and feelings, not to embroider falsehood with trickery and display. He was a master of disguise as he demonstrated in the Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), with an emotionally thankless multiplicity of roles. Denis Price, the villain at the centre, was the sort of charming role that Guinness later made his own, through a series of famous Ealing Studio hits. </p> <p>But the Kind Hearts gallery of family victims was consciously broad brush. Guinness was an actor, not an entertainer or vaudevillian. The spiritual core of Guinness's inner conviction remained the same - whatever game of disguise he might play.</p> <p>His conversion to Roman Catholicism followed an episode during the 1954 shooting of Father Brown (called The Detective in the US), in which he played GK Chesterton's cheery cleric. Walking back in the dark, still in a cassock, to the station hotel of a village near Macon after a drink in the local bar with Peter Finch, his hand was seized by a small boy, a complete stranger, who called him \"Mon p\u00e8re\" and trotted along beside him chatting in French. </p> <p>Despite his phony credentials as a cleric, Guinness felt strongly that the reality of this trust was important. When his 11-year-old son Matthew was temporarily crippled from the waist down with polio, Guinness had taken to dropping in on church and praying. Shortly after Father Brown, he joined the church of Rome.</p> <p>As an actor, he had acute and particular tastes, an infallible instinct for the apt moment, the ideal tone, the canny strategy. When he was Fool to Laurence Olivier's unsuccessful King Lear (1947), Guinness said that Olivier had been irritated that he had received the lion's share of the reviewers' favour. This was, said Guinness, a direct consequence of Larry's actor-managerish vanity. \"Every time Larry came on stage, the lights went up in his vicinity. All I had to do was just stay very close to him.\" Guinness, of course, couldn't fail to be noticed if only because he was doing so little so well.</p> <p>He knew his own vulnerabilities and exploited them with courage, to give some of his best performances. He had resented, for instance, Olivier's assumption in the mid-thirties that he was John Gielgud's boyfriend. Not because he could not have been, or was ashamed or offended to be cast in that role, but because he was not and they had no reason to assume it. In 1938 Guinness became a scrupulous husband and father - though his sexuality was complex.</p> <p>Typically he did not balk at playing the transvestite professional criminal Mrs Artminster in Wise Child (1967) with the then glamorous-looking Simon Ward. His Lawrence in Ross rang dangerously true to self. Being mixed-up, discreet, acutely intelligent and voraciously well-read fuelled the neurotic-but-muffled engine that drove him as an artist.</p> <p>Being so private a personality let him bring out the normally hidden interior aspects of Harcourt Reilly in TS Eliot's Cocktail Party. He played this role, the Unidentified Guest, at Chichester, the Wyndham's and the Haymarket in 1968 and 1969, as well as in Edinburgh and New York in 1950. His reading of Eliot's Four Quartets on radio was spell-binding. He was perfect material for Alan Bennett's Old Country (1977) and Habeas Corpus (1973). In the latter he devised and performed alone a typically self-revealing dance at the end.</p> <p>Tynan's fine portrait of him misinterpreted the diffidence and humility. Guinness, Tynan wrote, \"never will be a star in the sense that Olivier is\u0085He does everything by stealth\u0085He will illumine many a blind alley of subtlety, but blaze no trails\u0085His stage presence is quite without amplitude; and his face, except when, temporarily, make-up transfigures it, is a signless zero.\" </p> <p>The suggestiveness, the wish to avoid being domineering, was a different sort of contract with the audience's imagination. Guinness also wielded glacial fierceness and terror with authority.</p> <p>His greatness materialised without Olivier's showmanship, Richardson's abandoned cussedness, and Gielgud's resonant lyricism. Tynan admired but was inclined to patronise Guinness's poetry and versatility. </p> <p>At 24, in 1951, the critic was engaged by Guinness as Player King in his second Hamlet. Guinness invested much amour propre in this production. Tynan called it \"Hamlet with the pilot dropped\" and said it was cast with \"exuberant oddness\". Its failure turned out to be a major factor in Guinness's move away from the classics and Shakespeare and into films, ultimately television, and new plays. </p> <p>Tynan found Guinness less potent in the classical arena because he expected actors to perform like concerto soloists. I did not see Guinness's inspirational Richard II for Ralph Richardson's Old Vic company at the New theatre (now Albery) in 1947. His Macbeth at the Royal Court (1966) was certainly a quiet, clipped tragic victim without the expected sexiness and physicality, and handicapped by Simone Signoret's characterful, impossibly Gallic English as Lady M. (Gielgud's 1961 Stratford Othello was also criticised for lacking diapason.)</p> <p>In fact, Guinness was an actor for a new theatrical style, subtle and undecorated. From the 1960s in the West End he mostly created roles in new plays rather than challenging memories of Gielgud, Richardson or Olivier. He might have been a marvellous and unusual Lear, but when he took the role on radio it was underwhelming.</p> <p>Though his work in Alan Bennett's plays was superb, he was far less inclined, at the end of his career, to accept the sort of risks that Gielgud - secure in a theatrical dynasty - famously did with Pinter, David Storey and Julian Mitchell.</p> <p>He was always a bit of a social upstart in an English theatre world full of great families, a self-made actor with no advantages, spotted by Gielgud and Guthrie, but dependent on a very spiritual stillness and charisma. When in the mid-seventies I first met Guinness, who had long been an idol, he had a slightly grand shyness off-stage. Yet, of all the great British stage actors, his was the busiest film career, for which his modest way of acting was unrivalled.</p> <p>He was not only an actor. He was good at drawing and produced a charming, diffident design for his own Christmas cards each year. Like Caruso he was a natural at caricatures, especially of himself. He was also a very able author. </p> <p>His adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov, directed by Peter Brook in 1946, marked his return to the stage (as Mitya) after war service in the Royal Navy. Earlier, just before the war, his stage version of Great Expectations (later the basis of David Lean's film) had been directed by George Devine.</p> <p>After playing Herbert Pocket in Lean's Great Expectations, and Fagin in Oliver Twist, he went on to a series of glorious Ealing comedies - perhaps most memorably as the crook Henry Holland in Crichton's Lavender Hill Mob, and as Professor Marcus, another crook in Mackendrick's Ladykillers. </p> <p>His greatest film role was probably Colonel Nicholson in Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), where his quintessentially English stiff upper lip and obsessive unreasonableness under, eventually, dreadful Japanese maltreatment won him an Oscar and numerous other prizes.</p> <p>Further award-winning work included the artist Gulley Jimson in The Horse's Mouth, with his own screenplay based on Joyce Carey's novel. It was a pity that his brilliantly unpleasant Scottish impersonation of Jock Sinclair in Tunes of Glory (1960) was not followed by a lot of other good starring roles with the exception of Dorrit in Christine Edzard's epic Dickens adaptation. He settled mostly for lucrative supporting parts in various blockbusters, including Cromwell, The Comedians and The Quiller Memorandum. </p> <p>Some were quite distinguished - like Lean's Doctor Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia and A Passage to India. In The Fall of the Roman Empire, his Marcus Aurelius was one of the film's few redeeming features. Little Dorrit and his television appearances in Le Carr\u00e9's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and its sequels, were effectively his screen monument.</p> <p>Guinness was a charming, fascinating and elusive companion. He did not enjoy playing the star, though he liked the respect he got when visiting famous restaurants. He lived in a modest way ouside Petersfield from the mid-1950s, with a large garden that much occupied his wife Merula. He had a small circle of particular friends, many outside the theatre. For years he and Merula were close to Rachel Kempson and Michael Redgrave. He was knighted in 1959.</p> <p>If one visited him in his dressing room in the West End in the 1970s one might find a surprisingly broad collection of people there, many of whom were never destined to discover what the others' link with the great actor might be. He preferred to keep his friends separate: a one to one person. He liked good food and drink. His favourite London hotel for years was the Connaught, with its superb cuisine. He was essentially not a club man. Anybody outside his close immediate circle was intrigued by the Guinness enigma. </p> <p>But the reserve through which that attractive generosity and warmth powerfully shone was, for him, an impenetrable and necessary protection.</p> <p> <b>Related articles</b></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Guardian/0,4029,351439,00.html\">Sir Alec Guinness dies, aged 86</a> <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,351460,00.html\">'The shy introvert who shone on stage and screen'</a> <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/features/picturestory/0,6412,351451,00.html\">Picture gallery</a></p>",
  "<p>It can't possibly have been intentional. The August edition of Nova, which opened with a jokey and seasonal editor's letter - a postcard simply saying Deborah Bee is on holiday - arrived on the same day as the news that Bee's holiday was going to be an exceptionally long one. </p> <p>As is so often the case with new magazines, Bee is leaving the job after producing only a handful of issues. </p> <p>Whether she was as proactive about standing down as her employers IPC would like to make out is of course open to question. The industry rumour suggests that IPC was not happy with the millennial relaunch of the 1960s icon. There's nothing like a bad advertising audit to upset the company applecart, and Nova has seemed a little on the light side in pagination. But the magazine's publisher, Elaine Foran, insists it is \"definitely on budget\" - not just on target, in fact, but better than IPC had hoped in terms of both circulation and advertising. </p> <p>There is also the question of whether Bee was happy to go. She is still answering her phone but unable, she politely regrets, to answer any questions at the moment. </p> <p>Nova has not had an easy ride since it reappeared on May 4. The 1960s incarnation of the magazine is upheld by designers and journalists as a truly provocative, trail-blazing, mould-breaking publication, in which the images and layouts shouted as loudly as the campaigning words. </p> <p>Looking back over those old issues (it stayed the course from 1965 until IPC pulled it in the mid-70s), not many of them measure up to its shining reputation. The ones that do, however, where the directness and sheer courage of an idea is not naive but genuinely confrontational, are remarkable: a cover image of a black man with a single cover line asking if you would really want him to be your neighbour still sends a shiver down the spine. </p> <p>\"The idea of the relaunch stank from the start,\" says Chris Hemblade, acting editor of Time Out and former features editor of Scene, the now-defunct fashion magazine where Bee was editor. \"Every art director uses Nova as a model, an ideal. But this relaunch felt like a bunch of publishing executives wanting to bring back something they'd felt good about in the past. It was bound to be a poor imitation.\" </p> <p>The view from IPC is, as you'd expect, quite different. \"Everything Nova stands for is all the vogue again,\" says Julie York, the company's director of corporate communications. \"That 60s and 70s thing.\" </p> <p>Such literalism seems rather ingenuous from such a giant of publishing. The prevailing \"60s and 70s thing\" emerges from the fact that many current opinion- and taste-makers and media-ites grew up in the 60s and 70s. Their - our - take on the world is certainly informed by values from those decades, but it is liberally reinterpreted for the society we live in today. </p> <p>To be fair to Bee, her original plan wasn't to redo Nova. Bee, then editor of Scene, approached IPC along with Scene's features editor, David Roberts, and its art director, Gerard Saint, with an idea for an intelligent high-fashion magazine aimed at 18- to 25-year-old women. They reckoned there was a gap in the market and that they could produce a niche product to fill it. </p> <p>IPC had long toyed with the idea of a Nova relaunch - it nearly happened 10 years ago, but came out as Marie Claire instead. \"It was something being talked about,\" says Elaine Foran. \"And then Deborah came up with an idea that was so similar that we put the two ideas together.\" </p> <p>Now Jeremy Langmead is waiting to fill Bee's still-warm seat, and hoping to take over early in October. He has been the editor of the Sunday Times Style magazine for the past five years and sees Nova as \"a creative challenge\". </p> <p>Echoing the words of Bee, Roberts et al, he describes his reader as \"intelligent, twenty-something, fashion conscious - Stella McCartney or Chloe Sevigny\". (Let's hope he really means those who aspire to be SM and CS, or he might be terribly disappointed.) He is convinced that there is an elusive gap somewhere between Vogue and Elle. </p> <p>\"I feel confident,\" he enthuses. \"About having a market, knowing it's there. Vogue has got older - it's Lady Helen Windsor and Mario Testino. And Elle's gone much younger - it's the Denise Van Outen of women's magazines. So I'm pitching between the mummies and the dummies.\" </p> <p>Langmead's profile has recently been raised by the publicity surrounding a novel by his ex, India Knight, in which some claimed to see parallels between him and the heroine's husband. </p> <p>Mischievously witty, he is known for his skill and tact in handling contributors, having cultivated AA Gill as Style's restaurant critic and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson as a columnist. The Style section has a formidable record as a launchpad (alumnae include the novelists Helen Fielding and Wendy Holden). The experience of seeing his deputy Liz Jones - now occupying Tara P-T's old slot in Style with her Bridget Jones-style column - chosen as editor of Marie Claire might well have convinced him that it was time to move on. </p> <p>Langmead's suitability, according to Foran, is his experience. \"He can manage a large team and recognise good writing. And he understands how a fashion magazine works.\" </p> <p>He will undoubtedly take people with him, and Nova will inevitably shed a few more original staff. Fashion-pack gossip suggests that Venetia Scott, the fashion director, could walk, taking not just her husband, photographer Juergen Teller, but a whole raft of heavyweight names, including photographers Terry Richardson and David Sims and stylist Nancy Rhode. </p> <p>It's a group of people summed up by one insider as \"having enough clout to work between Vogue and iD, if they choose to\". If they go, a great deal of the title's credibility goes with them. But the idea of credibility hangs heavy here. And that isn't Nova's or anyone else's fault, but the problem in general with general-interest magazines, even those focused on fashion. </p> <p>For all the potential twenty-something readers out there, it's a group that has proven to be notoriously fickle and since it knows how to access information from a variety of places and media - television and the internet are huge providers - is less likely to be loyal to one magazine. </p> <p>When it does come to print, magazines seem to function better the more tightly they are bound to one subject. Outstanding among current successful titles are Mixmag, the dance culture bible, and Wallpaper, the aspirational design bible. Both offer finely honed content to readers according to a specific interest rather than a demographic evaluation. </p> <p>That, along with Nova's difficult heritage, has so far stood in the way of it relaxing into a comfortable role. An ex-employee of Frank, the Wagadon title launched in 1997 that took a stab at a similar market, says: \"It has made an effort to take on the values of old Nova - to be a strong, meaty, social read, dealing with bigger issues. But although we do want to be made aware, pulling it off in this context is very difficult.\" </p> <p>Under pressure to reflect the title's earlier interests, we get Celia Brayfield on why women are still underachieving in the 21st century. With no disrespect to the writer, it made me think I was back in the 70s being lectured by someone's well-meaning mother in a pine-filled kitchen in Camden. </p> <p>Langmead needs to hold on to his fashion team, which is what currently makes this product into the jewel in the crown that IPC wants it to be. He wants to get rid of the magazine's slightly irritable tone, and introduce a softer, more comforting voice. </p> <p>Twenty-something girls might be a prickly, strident bunch these days, but it's dangerous - and unwelcoming - to interpret that too literally. Magazines work by becoming familiar and friendly. </p> <p>There's a reason that the idea of \"curling up\" with them has become a cliche. By his own admission, Langmead wants to \"make it more bubbly, really heat it up\". At least it's already warm. </p> <p> <strong>Re-creation or poor imitation? Twenty-five years on and off</strong> Carolyne Ellis</p> <p> The original Nova was part of its time, it's a different time now, so it's difficult to do the same thing. Nova's strength was that it was irreverent, clever and quite shocking, and visually very strong. There are a lot of magazines these days and to succeed you must be different. <strong> Alexandra Shulman, Vogue</strong> </p> <p>It was a good idea to revive the title, but I don't know how relevant that style of journalism - provocative and groundbreaking then - is now. There's little that shocks today. The magazine was pretty much what we expected - edgy and niche. And if that's what they tried to create, then they've achieved it. <strong> Fiona McIntosh, Elle </strong> </p> <p>I love the [first] cover. It was a nice mix of the 60s and the year 2000. I love the model, I love the fashion - it's nice having a purely fashion magazine again. Some of it does try to please too much. It's a little bit prickly, not apologising about anything. It says, 'this is what we do and if you don't like it, that's tough'. <strong> Liz Jones, Marie Claire </strong> </p> <p>They've got a strong team and the cover and the logo are strong, too. But I felt that it fell between two stools: it was not for the London hipster and it was not mainstream either. I don't think it's a timely or a clever idea. I have been a big fan of the original, but for a first issue it fell short of my expectations. <strong> Johnny Davis, The Face</strong> </p> <p> <strong> From super Nova to not so super Nova </strong></p> <p> * The original Nova ran from 1965 to 1975 and achieved near mythic status. It re-wrote the rules of women's magazines and fashion journalism, becoming the 60s style bible. </p> <p>* Previously women's magazines meant knitting patterns and cooking recipes. Homosexuality and abortion were taboo. Breaking down cultural, moral and sexual prejudices became Nova's aim. One 1967 cover story dealing with homosexual law reform showed two men above the words: \"They consent in private\". A 1969 cover featured child killer Mary Bell. </p> <p>* Editor Dennis Hackett attributed Nova's success to its ability to appeal to both sexes: \"We were read by women and men. We had a 42% male readership - the highest of any women's magazine.\" </p> <p>* Contributors included home editor Janet Fitch, comic strip writer Peter Preston, cookery expert Elizabeth David, writer Penny Vincenzi and astrologer Patrick Walker. </p> <p>* But by the early 70s Nova was losing its editorial and innovatory edge. IPC decided to kill the title in 1975. </p> <p>* On announcing last November that Nova was going to be revived 25 years on, IPC insisted it was not a nostalgia trip - the free, incisive spirit of the original would be preserved but adapted to the concerns of 21st-century women. The mission statement burbled that Nova would set out to be \"fresh\" and \"contemporary\", and provided a profile of \"Nova woman\". Nova woman wore Prada, Gucci, Joseph and French Connection. She liked Kate Moss, Deborah Harry, Blind Date and Ewan MacGregor. She believed in fashion magazines not magazine fashion, sexual equality not feminism, drugs not drug abuse, details not packaging. </p> <p>* According to editor Deborah Bee there was a three-fold prototype: \"The triangle we had as our working model was the style press, which is incredibly cool, the fashion mags, which deal with the catwalk very well, and newspapers, which have the best writing. Our woman is right in the middle of that triangle and wants something from all of those.\" Editors of rival magazines - talking above to the Independent - responded coolly to her debut issue, however. </p> <p>* The Competition: Red (launched: 1998, circ: 180,000); Elle (launched: 1985, circ: 210,000); Marie Claire, (launched: 1988, circ: 450,000).</p>",
  "For the last 20 years, most of my August nights have been spent in Italy, of late in Umbria, halfway up a hill cloaked in oak woods. Spring is something that local people speak of with nostalgia, relegated to a day or two between snowfall and heatwave. If you blink, you miss it. Summer is now a season that runs from April to October. <p>The English are notorious for their dreary obsession with the weather. Yet I have found that wherever I have lived or travelled, in whatever culture, the weather is a subject of constant comment and frequent local analysis. Italians tend to commence every other conversation with a temperature check. In winter, it is cold, and in summer, of course, it is hot - \"fa caldo\". This is a phrase repeated so often and with such vehemence that an English tourist was heard to enquire \"Why is everyone so down on Aldo in the summer?\" </p> <p>Meteorological inanities aside, in summer Italy is deliciously hot. Living, as my family does, in a rambling terracotta refrigerator during the winter, we appreciate the near- magical transformation of our house into a pleasantly cool summer residence as much as any tourist could. </p> <p>April to October is the high season for tourism in Italy in general, and it is the high season for guests - dozens of them. Forty-four staying at any one time is our (pretty uncomfortable) record, 10 or 12 is the norm. There are regulars, first and foremost my eldest daughter and her family. And there is Otto, the one-time revolutionary, my oldest and dearest friend, who makes an annual pilgrimage to Umbria from Venezuela. Then there are over-lapping trails of family and friends, and friends of friends. Most of our guests are artists, but they don't have to be. The one thing they do have to be is good company in the evenings (we can all be as dull as we choose during the day); the other house rules are - not to be sick in the house; and not to get tired and emotional in the kitchen. </p> <p>When it comes to guests, I am a lot more Latin American than English. Some of our visitors have stayed for years on end and I have thoroughly enjoyed their company. During the day, though, I relax my duties as hostess, pulling the strings again each evening from dinner onwards. I am the designated cook. </p> <p>So summer evenings start, for me, with a trawl through the herb garden, gathering whatever I need for supper that night, carefully pulling taragon, parsley, chives, salads and so on, from between the rampant weeds that flourish among them. Gardening is a little more than a hobby - more, really, of an overriding obsession. Years of experience have shown me that its discussion is not to everybody's taste, so I'll let it go here with only a mention of its main contribution to every summer night in the guise of its heady fragrance. There is a long, high, hedge of honeysuckle and jasmine beside the house, there are pots of lilies and beds of mock orange, roses, lavender and rosemary. All these scents waft through the balmy twilight, although, the later it gets, the lingering smells are always those of the jasmine and the lemon flowers. </p> <p>Anyone who believes that living in the countryside is a haven of peace and quiet is mistaken. There is a nightly cacophony which breaks down, more or less, as follows. From afar, frogs croak with intermittent but almost deafening insistence. This is overlaid by cicadas, which are utterly tuneless but seem to be endlessly tuning up. There is, in the middle distance, the sound of water playing in the fountain. Then, nearer, the breeze in the cypress trees. </p> <p>In a huge oak tree behind the herb garden a nightingale sings to the delight of the new guests and the distaste of old ones. This is year three. This nightingale has five notes. I remember the pleasure I first felt on hearing it outside my window, blessed as any oriental princess by its clear song. Any song on a perpetual loop palls in the end, particularly if the loop is only a few seconds long. Often now, on summer nights, I ponder the wisdom and sanity of those Chinese emperors who sacked entire kingdoms in search of a nightingale. And, if there are any searchers left out there, they can have mine. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the younger children (either two or four 10-year-olds headed by my daughter, Florence, and grandson, Felix) have beaten a retreat after dinner, scavenged pro visions for their camp out on a garden terrace, and retired in good order to their adventure. </p> <p>Unless we others choose to go down to the lake, which is only four minutes away, but which I am usually too lazy to adjourn to, we are not unduly plagued by mosquitoes. But there are always one or two. Like the Carib Indians who lined up on the shore of Guyana to scare off Sir Walter Raleigh and his men, they seem to be constantly running around and lining up to give the impression of being legion. </p> <p> Against the backdrop of so many miscellaneous noises, there is always music - Cuban, Malian, blues, opera - whatever is topping the house charts that week. And over the music, there is talk, lots of it, from huge round-table discussions to splinter groups, with heated debates on everything from painting to malicious gossip. </p> <p>After about one o'clock, the group begins to thin. Since I sleep very little, I am often the last up. I like wandering around the house at night when everyone else is asleep. It is one of my favourite times for reading. </p> <p>In fact, I like summer nights so much that I decided to skip winter altogether and head off, en famille, to the Caribbean for six months. A lot of our regular visitors came out to stay with us, so the house-party feeling extended to the tiny island of Nevis. Despite having had a lovely time on that island paradise - who couldn't? - I found summer lovelier when preceded by some good, bracing cold. </p> <p>The mosquitoes were monstrous, and the entire island was beleaguered by wild donkeys which brayed, stampeded and fornicated astonishingly loudly from dusk till dawn. Island conversation, when the island is minuscule and lives for tourism, can get on to a loop only marginally longer than a nightingale's. Most of these churlish reflections were not uppermost in my mind during the months I lived on Nevis. They surfaced, gradually, while contemplating the hosts of fireflies around our house in Umbria. Having said that, I'd go back to the Caribbean any day, but only for a holiday strategically planned in, say, February, for a few weeks. Summer in Italy is too good to need to travel in the hopes of reproducing it. </p> <p>Although I love having guests, I don't go out very much. But for the last five years I have had a lot to do with the Umbrian film festival. This takes place in the first week of July in the small Renaissance hill town of Montone. </p> <p>We drop a huge screen over the facade of a palazzo in the main square and then sit out in the cafes watching movies until the wee hours. When our film festival is over, I do stir myself to sit out in squares around the neighbouring cities watching their selection of films alla Cinema Paradiso under the stars. </p> <p>Mostly, though, summer nights are spent at home, with motley concerts and shows put on by the household. The last one was an adult puppet show which was a cross between Little Red Riding Hood and Reservoir Dogs. It was put on by Gerrald, an elephant trainer, and was very good, but I cannot take any credit for it because my contribution was the refreshments during the interval. </p> <p>Had this been a piece about August days it would have had to include paroxysms of shopping, missed flights, visits to the accident and emergency unit and mountains of laundry. But August nights are another matter.</p>",
  "British professional orchestras are full of players who owe an incalculable musical debt to Harry Legge, who has died aged 86. His founding and conducting of the Edinburgh Rehearsal Orchestra (later renamed the Rehearsal Orchestra) provided a training ground that has never been surpassed. <p>Born in Liverpool, Legge had musical parents; his father was the city's director of education and, from a young age, Harry performed as a violinist with his amateur pianist mother. He was educated at Winchester College and Queen's College, Oxford, where he read zoology; with the Oxford Playhouse Company he made his conducting debut in The Beggar's Opera. </p> <p>After studying at the Royal College of Music, he taught at Oundle school. His second world war service included conducting light music for the home defence forces, before the Royal Army Medical Corps posted him to Lagos to run a hospital. A brief return to Oundle proved incompatible with increasing orchestral playing, and in 1949 he joined Sir Thomas Beecham's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as a viola-player. </p> <p>Legge remained in the orchestra until 1975, serving as vice-chairman from 1963-73, and was one of the principal contributors to the survival of the orchestra after Beecham's death. He was also a member of the English Sinfonia from 1964-97, and, in his capacity as chairman and later vice-president, was also involved in saving that orchestra from extinction. </p> <p>In addition to his professional playing, Legge conducted amateur orchestras throughout north London, starting from the Brent Symphony Orchestra, with which he gained valuable practical experience. From 1969-89 he conducted the National Youth Wind Orchestra. </p> <p>The award to Legge in 1982 of the OBE for services to music was thus thoroughly appropriate, but there was nothing formal or self-important about him. His deep love and understanding of music, his quick brain, his broad cultural background and his relentless energy surged along on a tidal wave of good humour and wit, which made even the most serious occa sion turn into a party. As he said once in a BBC interview: \"I enjoy my work because it is to do with the real love of music and not any other puffed-up reason,\" and this enjoyment was always close to the surface. </p> <p>Legge's finest invention, the Rehearsal Orchestra, has run each year since 1957 during the Edinburgh Festival. Each section of the orchestra is led and coached by a professional player, and students, amateurs and young professionals explore a wide repertoire of music, far broader than they could hope to meet in their college or local orchestras. The orchestra also holds weekend meetings in various parts of the country, where the time is usually devoted to a major large-scale work that players would rarely have the opportunity to experience. </p> <p>Legge's time spent playing under internationally famous conductors, most particu larly Beecham and Rudolf Kempe, meant that much of their expertise was channelled directly, with certain Harryish asides and diversions, to the players under his baton. His approach to the players, of whatever standard, was always professional; he expected the best that they could produce, and would not accept less. </p> <p>Harry's commitment to the music, and the underlying seriousness of his demands, was always accompanied by a twinkle in the eye, even if some of his comments were sometimes a little sharp- edged. </p> <p>As a bassoonist, and librarian in the early days, I was given a fair amount of gleeful abuse \"to frighten the others a bit\". He always knew how to get to the heart of a work and, without fussing about unimportant detail, worked on the essential points that would create a good performance in the short time available. </p> <p>The administrator Gillian Halse Noel worked closely with Legge right from the start, and shared his anxiety on the orchestra's first morning in Edinburgh. Would they turn up? Could they play? Faced with a full orchestra of unknown quantities, Harry, in his (now legendary) red shirt, brought down the baton, dreading a total silence. The first bars of Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture sounded, and so started an adventure of which Halse Noel recorded the first 40 years in Keeping Out Of The Rain (1997). </p> <p>The book's title came from Beecham's reason for agreeing to become the patron of a venture which might fill concertgoers' daytimes; but in its foreword, Sir Simon Rattle, a timpanist with the orchestra for a time, salutes its eventual, more substantial purpose: \"It gives musicians an invaluable opportunity to work and learn music at the speed they will have to reproduce in their professional lives.\" </p> <p>Harry was pleased and excited at the way the very first course went, and felt that the orchestra had tremendous potential. He said to Gillian, \"Wouldn't it be the most wonderful thing to leave footprints in the sand?\" Right up to the last weeks of his life, he was planning concerts, and had even hoped to get to Edinburgh this summer and conduct just a little; his excitement and his love of the orchestra never waned. </p> <p>He leaves his wife, Sue, and his sons, Christopher and Anthony, from his first marriage. </p> <p>Henry 'Harry' James Grenville Legge, musician, born April 24 1914; died July 19 2000</p>",
  "<p>A writer likes to know that his work is read: the Swiss journalist Hans Werner Egli, who has died aged 101, received the ultimate reader reaction when a furious Adolf Hitler denounced him and tried to have him sacked.</p> <p>In November 1940, Egli, then chief London correspondent of the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (NZZ), went to Coventry to witness the devastation wrought on the city\u2019s housing and cathedral by German bombing. He wrote: \u201cThe German attacks, as tended to be the case in London, did not, for the most part, hit war targets, but had the principal objective of terrorising the civil population.\u201d</p> <p>When the f\u00fchrer read this, he flew into a rage, as it brought home to him that German press reports of effective, accurate Luftwaffe bombing amounted to no more than whistling in the dark. It was only in 1945 that Egli had the gratification of learning that Hitler had instructed the German ambassador to Switzerland to demand his removal, though unsuccessfully.</p> <p>The son of an insurance clerk in Affoltern am Albis, in the canton of Z\u00fcrich, Egli attended the Realgymnasium in Z\u00fcrich, studied law and economics for a year at Z\u00fcrich University, and went to London in 1919 for a two-year course in international law and economics at King\u2019s College and the London School of Economics. This marked the start of his long involvement with Britain; in 1921, he married Helen Roe, and they had a son and daughter before divorcing.</p> <p>In 1924, Egli graduated from Z\u00fcrich University with a doctorate in law, but his legal career ran no further than spells as a substitute clerk at a civil court in Berne. A period as assistant editor of the Swiss Telegraphic Agency led to his return to London in 1926 to write for a number of Swiss newspapers, and in particular as economic correspondent for the NZZ.</p> <p>In this capacity, he repeatedly criticised Winston Churchill, as chancellor of the exchequer between 1924 and 1929, for seeking to maintain the gold parity of the pound with the 1913 exchange rate \u201cas if the first world war had passed the British economy by without leaving any trace\u201d. But in the 1930s, Egli became one of the first journalists to attach weight to Churchill\u2019s warnings about Hitler\u2019s aggressive intentions. In 1936, he started writing exclusively for the NZZ, continuing to do so until his retirement in 1974, and married the actress Selma Vaz Dias, with whom he had a son and daughter; Selma died in 1977.</p> <p>The Coventry episode was characteristic of the objectivity of Egli\u2019s war reporting, which kept Switzerland consistently well-informed, just as it often annoyed Germany. During the war, foreign journalists worked alongside their British colleagues in the Ministry of Information press room at London University. The foreigners\u2019 reports were censored on the spot, and if they spoke a single word to their editors outside the written script, the telephone line was cut off. Resulting disputes called for a journalists\u2019 spokesman, and, in this role, the Foreign Press Association (FPA) came into its own. Egli was much involved in these exchanges, becoming the FPA\u2019s president for 1945-46.</p> <p>With the end of the war, the FPA needed a new home, so Egli prodded friends at the Foreign Office into action, with a letter to the Times. This brought him a reproach for his \u201cunnecessary reminder\u201d, but also the offer of the rent-free use of 11 Carlton House Terrace, which enabled the FPA to develop into one of the world\u2019s leading foreign press centres.</p> <p>Egli worked ceaselessly for the Swiss community in the UK, becoming president of the New Helvetic Society (1947-57 and 1962-69), and president of the Federation of Swiss Societies in the UK (1949-58). Into his 90s, he spoke on all matters of Swiss concern and British-Swiss friendship - and still drove a car.</p> <p>He is survived by his partner of 20 years, Laura Kaufman, his four children, 11 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p> <p>Hans Werner Egli, journalist, born March 17 1899; died June 28 2000</p>",
  "No one ever accused Jesse Timmendequas, a paedophile on death row, of being an over-achiever, but his crimes are responsible for one of the most emotional debates in the United States. <p>The former labourer, 39, might be low on name recognition, but that of his victim is known even to those who have no knowledge of her abruptly curtailed life.</p> <p>Megan Kanka was seven years old when Timmendequas, a New Jersey neighbour living with two other paedophiles, abducted, raped and strangled her in 1994.</p> <p>The girl's parents believed that she might still be alive had they known he was living nearby and set about gathering 430,000 signatures to press for a change in the law.</p> <p>New Jersey responded quickly, and in 1996 Congress and President Bill Clinton obliged with the measure known as Megan's law: each state had to release \"relevant\" information about child molesters and violent sexual offenders to the public.</p> <p>It was left to each of the 50 states to decide how access to the information was provided. Civil libertarians argue that the law breaches the privacy of ex-offenders and makes them a target for retribution.</p> <p>\"People who have been convicted of crimes, who have served their sentences, should not be the subject of continuing punishment,\" said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).</p> <p>Some states make the information about the nation's 324,000 registered sex offenders available at local police stations, while in others people have to write requesting details or call a toll-free telephone number. Twenty-one states, most of them in the south and the mid-west, post details on the internet. But at least 10% of the information, which is supplied by the offenders, is thought to be incorrect.</p> <p>When the law was finally en forced two years ago in New Jersey after a series of legal challenges, the names and photographs of men whose details were meant to have been confined to the neighbourhood - an area which was not defined - turned up in the local media. Then a school counsellor who had never been accused of sex crimes was identified as an offender in handbills distributed close to his home.</p> <p>Many people were upset when it became clear that they would not find out about every sex offender but only those who were living nearest to them and were considered the most dangerous.</p> <p>Later, five bullets were fired through the sitting room window of a home above that of a man who had been to prison for raping teenagers.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a man hanged himself from a tree in Santa Rosa, California, after police warned his neighbours that he was a convicted child molester; another shot himself after officers in Seal Cove, Maine, distributed handbills saying he had confessed to having sex with a boy six years previously; an offender's car was fire-bombed in Los Angeles after he appeared on an internet list; and two men beat a convicted sex offender with a baseball bat in North Fort Myers, Florida, and threatened to kill him if he went near children in the neighbourhood.</p> <p>New Mexico was the last state to adopt Megan's law. \"This is mean-spirited voyeurism, and that's its only effect,\" said Denise Clegg, acting executive director of the state's ACLU. \"If there was a good case we would definitely challenge it.\"</p> <p>Even in New Jersey the operation of Megan's law is by no means settled, and it has been suspended twice under legal challenge in the past seven months. Now that it is back in use, prosecutors say they cannot act against those who misuse information about sex offenders because of a court judgment limiting the scope of warnings to those who receive it.</p> <p>Another, more strident measure against sex offenders that has received less attention is Stephanie's law, named after a 19-year-old killed in 1994 and adopted in various forms by at least 13 states. This law, born in Kansas, allows for the detention in mental institutions of those considered likely to offend again after their release from jail. In Illinois, for instance, more than 100 have been incarcerated in institutions in the past two years and none has been released.</p> <p>Amitai Etzioni, a professor at George Washington University and founder of the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics, said that neither law worked well. Megan's law deprived sex offenders of privacy without improving the safety of children unless adults were with them at all times. Stephanie's law did improve safety but removed the rights of released prisoners.</p> <p>\"Confine child molesters in special, guarded, child-free communities,\" he said. \"As a means of separating molesters from children, this would be more effective than Megan's law but less intrusive and costly than Stephanie's law.</p> <p>\"While some critics have compared this proposal to leper colonies, the communal custody approach is better than any of the alternatives.\"</p>",
  "The government yesterday closed the door on introducing a US-style \"Megan's law\" into Britain that would give the public automatic right to know the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders. <p>Although the News of the World threatened to resume its campaign of identifying people unless parents were given \"controlled access\" to the sex offenders' register, the home office minister Paul Boateng made clear that a public right to names and addresses is not on the cards. </p> <p>\"This is a law enforcement matter. The police and probation services have to be at the heart of determining who is and who is not given the relevant information. When it comes to names and addresses that is a matter that can only be disclosed by the police and probation services working together on the ground in multi-agency panels as they do now.\" </p> <p>Mr Boateng told BBC TV's Frost on Sunday. \"Decisions about whether or not people are told names and addresses is not a matter for newspapers, it is not a matter for ministers.\" </p> <p>In a swipe at the impact of the Sunday tabloid's campaign in creating a climate of vigilante attacks that culminated in a near-riot in Portsmouth on Thursday night, Mr Boateng added: \"Government concern has to be the protection and welfare of children and the maintenance of public order. The News of the World's approach on this issue of naming and shaming threatened both.\" </p> <p>He pledged that ministers would push ahead with promised changes to the paedophile laws, including closing loopholes in the register and introducing indefinite sentences for those who had severe personality disorders, the most dangerous, and those who posed a threat to children. </p> <p>But such changes in the law, already being considered as part of a Home Office review initiated before the News of the World campaign, will not extend to unlimited community notification as introduced in the US after the murder of Megan Kanka, seven, who was killed by a paedophile living in her neighbourhood. </p> <p>Vivienne Parry, a News of the World columnist, said the paper had no regrets and would start publishing names and photographs again unless parents were given access to the register. </p> <p>The paper has shifted its position from its demand two weeks ago for parents to be given the right to know the names and addresses of all paedophiles living in their area. Ms Parry said the paper now wanted controlled access by the public to information. </p> <p>\"If your child went to a nursery and you wanted to be sure that the nursery had checked out its employees properly, then you would be able to ask whether they had, and check. The nursery would be able to get access to that information without charge.\" </p> <p>Probation sources pointed out that new powers obliging those who work with children to check their staff have already been passed by parliament. </p> <p>Debra Shipley, the Labour MP for Stourbridge, who piloted the 1999 Protection of Children Act through the Commons, said last night: \"The government hasn't had enough credit for what it is doing. When I started looking at this problem, I was horrified at what I found.\" The offenders list at the Department of Health was out of date and abusers could leave prison and work with children, she said. </p> <p>Now the Shipley act, due to take effect in October, will prevent anyone convicted of serious abuse from working with children and will oblige employers to vet those who seek to work with children, although there will also be a right of appeal. </p> <p>The News of the World claimed that 300,000 people had signed its petition calling for controlled access to the sex offenders' register. The Association of Child Abuse Lawyers warned that giving the public controlled access to the register of child sex offenders could encourage vigilante attacks.</p>",
  "<p>Doctors paid a record \u00a377m in compensation to patients last year - almost double the amount paid out in 1996, when \u00a341m was distributed. </p> <p>The Medical Defence Union, which represents doctors in negligence claims, warned that the dramatic rise in cases could result in a similar situation to that in the US, where surgeons in high-risk areas of medicine become increasingly nervous about carrying out lifesaving procedures, for fear of being sued. </p> <p>Last night the MDU said the rise in payouts was due to higher awards and the fact that more patients were suing, rather than poorer care. </p> <p>Michael Saunders, its chief executive, said: \"The rise in litigation is not attributable to a fall in clinical standards - quite the opposite. But it is indisputable that the medico-legal climate has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. </p> <p>\"Patients and their relatives are bringing more claims, and the amounts awarded in compensation are getting higher, principally because of the increasing costs of caring for damaged patients. Recently a brain-damaged patient received \u00a33.5m in compensation from the NHS.\" </p> <p>Clinical negligence cases cost the NHS more than \u00a3200m a year, and the number of claims has doubled in five years. Gynaecology and obstetrics are one of the biggest complaint fields. The largest claims tend to be for babies brain damaged at birth, as courts can award the cost of lifelong care. </p> <p>Lawyers blame doctors for forcing up the costs of such cases, accusing them of trying to cover up for each other and requiring lengthy investigations to get at the truth. </p> <p>The British Medical Association said the increased threat of litigation could lead to more doctors moving into defensive medicine and becoming reluctant to undertake potentially lifesaving procedures. </p> <p>\"We could get a situation where doctors in high-risk categories decide not to undertake certain procedures for fear they would be sued,\" said a spokesman, Nigel Duncan. </p> <p>\"In America they have reached a situation where surgeons put notices outside their room saying they do not undertake such and such a procedure. This is something surgeons in this country have warned about for some time.\" </p> <p>Defensive medicine has been blamed for unnecessary surgical interventions, such as carrying out caesarean sections when natural birth would be safe. </p> <p>Last year the then health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched attacked lawyers who \"feather their nests\" at the expense of NHS patients. He signalled moves to stop medical negligence litigation spiralling out of control, and backed a \"no fault\" system, with no need for lawyers, to compensate genuine victims of dangerous doctors. </p> <p>The present system of protecting NHS patients was, he admitted, \"a bit of a shambles\". </p> <p>He said at the time that he wanted to streamline the complaints system, log \"near miss\" blunders and help doctors to learn from their colleagues' mistakes. </p> <p>More than 80% of medical negligence cases were rejected by the courts, although many were settled before they got to a judge, he said.

  "The controversial US national missile defence system could move a step closer this week when Pentagon officials are expected to advise President Bill Clinton to approve the first stage of construction. <p>William Cohen, the defence secretary, is expected to tell Mr Clinton that he should give the system - dubbed son of star wars in reference to the cold war programme worked on by the Reagan administration - a limited green light on the advice of key Pentagon advisers.</p> <p>The advisers were yesterday named by the Washington Post as Rudy de Leon, Mr Cohen's deputy, Jacques S Gansler, the department's under-secretary for acquisition, and Walter Slocombe and James Bodner, two policy advisers. They are all understood to believe that the president should approve the award of contracts this winter to keep alive the possibility of building the full system next year.</p> <p>If Mr Clinton gives the proposed $60bn anti-missile shield the go-ahead after meeting Mr Cohen later this week he would still be passing the buck to his successor on whether or not to embrace the plan. The decision, one of the first and most controversial facing the new president, is expected to feature heavily in the November elections.</p> <p>Washington's plans to erect a satellite-controlled defence shield designed to protect the US against long-range missiles launched by \"rogue\" states such as North Korea and Iran have been condemned in Russia and some parts of Europe, amid fears that they could reignite the arms race in Asia. Officials in Beijing have already warned that China would end cooperation on arms control measures and anti-proliferation efforts if the anti-missile shield were to be erected.</p> <p>The defence system itself has also come under fire, after tests last month failed to shoot down dummy warheads over the Pacific. An official report on the failure, expected to be released on Thursday, largely blames a malfunctioning 10-year-old circuit board for preventing the release of the missile from the rocket launcher and ruining a $100m test, according to yesterday's Washington Post.</p> <p>The Pentagon is understood to want to keep its options open as the country prepares for a new president. Its officials have argued that in order to have the anti-missile system in place by 2005 - when North Korea is expected to have built its own long-range missiles - construction of the proposed radar station would have to begin next summer. Construction contracts would then need to be awarded this winter to start work on the radar station to be built on a remote island in Alaska.</p> <p>This initial phase of construction would pay for materials which could then be used for other defence projects if the next president decides to veto the system.</p> <p>\"Much of the stuff you're going to buy is stuff the Army Corps of Engineers could use somewhere else anyway,\" an official told the Post.</p> <p>However, the go-ahead would represent a highly symbolic move for such a controversial project.</p> <p>The government's lawyers have warned that the system would contravene the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.</p> <p>Mr Cohen could still make a different recommendation to the president, although he is unlikely to reject advice from senior staff members.</p> <p>A spokesman for the defence department said the reports about Mr Cohen's recommendation were premature.</p> <p>Mr Clinton is also expected to weigh up a \"national intelligence estimate\" on how other countries would respond to the US decision, as well as the current state of the threat from North Korea, which has moved closer to South Korea, its pro-western neighbour, in recent months.</p> <p>George W Bush, the Republican party's presidential nominee, has already expressed a preference for \"a more robust\" national security system, without providing too many details of these plans.</p>",
  "The row over the refusal of Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, to free four IRA police killers under the Good Friday agreement intensified yesterday when a confidential Irish government memo revealed that they were eligible for release after all. <p>Lawyers for the four men, jailed in January last year for the June 1996 killing of Garda Jerry McCabe in Ardare, Co Limerick, will seek to use the report to bolster their case for release. They were convicted on the lesser charge of manslaughter after two prosecution witnesses refused to testify. </p> <p>The controversy is dominating political debate in the Irish Republic, where Sinn Fein could become a coalition partner with Fianna Fail at the next election. </p> <p>The row also highlights discrepancies between the British and Irish governments in application of the agreement's early release scheme. Any member of a terror group recognised to be on ceasefire, and who committed an offence in the UK before April 10 1998, qualified. </p> <p>But, unlike in Britain, the Irish rules are not set out in legislation. Mr Ahern is accused of double standards in demanding that police murderers in Northern Ireland be freed while insisting that the Garda killers be kept in jail. </p> <p>Jim McVeigh, the IRA's officer commanding at the Maze prison until the mass release 10 days ago, said that if he were a unionist he would be sickened at the hypocrisy of Mr Ahern and John O'Donoghue, minister for justice. </p> <p>He said the Shankill bomber Sean Kelly and south Armagh sniper Michael Carragher had been freed, and unionists detested them more than any other republicans. \"Bertie Ahern is saying a policeman's life up here is of less value than a policeman's life down there.\" </p> <p>Pearse McCauley, Gerard Sheehy, Michael O'Neill and Kevin Walsh were sentenced to between 11 and 14 years for the killing in an abortive armed robbery.</p>",
  "The Zimbabwean government messenger who delivered the official notice to a stunned April Davies last week quietly but dramatically tipped the scales in the struggle over Zimbabwe's farmland. Mrs Davies was told that her farm had been expropriated without compensation. The government took the land immediately and gave the elderly widow 90 days to get out of her house. <p>It was the first legal confiscation by Robert Mugabe under his considerable powers to take any land he chooses for redistribution to poor blacks. If Mrs Davies's farm had also been the last to be seized, or was one of just a couple of hundred farms, it probably would not make much difference to greater Zimbabwe. But if Mugabe now does what he says he is going to do, then his country is in for a rough time. </p> <p>Things looked bad enough when the government said that it intended to take 804 farms, but that at least left most of the commercial land still dedicated to producing vital tobacco exports. But now Mugabe has raised the bleak prospect of expropriating more than 3,000 farms - two-thirds of the white-owned agricultural land - and he says even that may not be enough. </p> <p>It is not certain that Mugabe intends to follow through on his pledge, but don't count on him backing down. Many Zimbabweans thought the land issue would quietly die after it was used to whip up anti-white sentiment, and support for Mugabe \"the liberation war hero\", ahead of June's parliamentary elections. But Zanu-PF's humiliating near-defeat has helped keep land top of the agenda. </p> <p>After the shock of the parliamentary ballot, there is no shortage of voices telling Mugabe that he cannot win the next presidential election in two years' time. Some of the doubters inside his party say that he knows it. But if Mugabe is on the way out, he has little incentive to drop his assault on the farms. And if he hopes to win another election, then it is a powerful issue to keep alive. </p> <p>Mugabe's constituency, those for whom he believes he governs, and for whom he fought a liberation war, are not the city dwellers who snubbed him so defiantly in June's parliamentary elections. Such support as he has is among the peasants and landless rural poor, whose lives have not improved measurably for all Zimbabwe's past economic successes. Now there are hundreds of thousands of blacks who expect to be given land, much of it good land. Why not one last gesture for the people who matter to him? And at the same time, exact revenge on the whites he so despises? For Mugabe, it is the opportunity to go down in history as the man who not only liberated Zimbabwe from the colonists, but finally righted a great historical wrong and delivered the land back to its proper owners. </p> <p>None of this may come to pass, but all efforts to prevent it so far have backfired. What began as the prospect of seizing a few hundred farms has increased to several thousand as Mugabe was denounced by Zimbabweans and foreigners as a tyrant out of step with a changing world. There is not much to be achieved by hurling insults at Mugabe. Peter Hain and Robin Cook tried it and did little more than harden the president's determination to snatch the land. In any case, to African ears, the tone of British official criticism still smacks of neo-colonialism. </p> <p>Mugabe's bitterness encompasses more than the whites camped on Zimbabwean soil. He is not alone among African leaders in being disgruntled at being forced to swallow the new ideology of globalisation and other western medicines that have prevented many governments of poor countries having any real say in the fate of their nations. Few have much to show for it. </p> <p>Thabo Mbeki's scepticism over the link between HIV and Aids is more than mere contrariness. He is deeply suspicious about western intentions on his continent. To the rest of the world, the 2006 World Cup debacle might have been farce, but in Africa it was understood as a racist conspiracy. Where Mbeki is not at one with Mugabe is over the economic cost of the land seizures. Mugabe famously tells those dignitaries who tramp to his door in the belief they can change his thinking what they want to hear, and then he carries on as usual. This is what happened when Mbeki turned up in Harare with a few heavyweight cabinet ministers in tow. </p> <p>They have good reason to be worried about what is happening in Zimbabwe. An economic meltdown has many implications for South Africa, not least because of the danger of large numbers of Zimbabweans heading south to search for work, and the damage the crisis does to foreign confidence in the region. </p> <p>At a press conference, Mbeki spoke of the need to establish the rule of law - which is code for ending the hundreds of illegal farm occupations by the war veterans. Under pressure to respond, Mugabe said he would get veterans off those farms not legally designated for seizure. Even the state-run Herald newspaper hailed it as a breakthrough. The South Africans seemed pleased. </p> <p>But Mugabe didn't mean it. Next day, he was denouncing his own newspaper for misinterpreting him, and promising to take every piece of white-owned farmland in the country if he felt like it. And he does feel like it. Mugabe has heard all the arguments, economic, legal, moral, against snatching farms but none is as persuasive to him as the case for redistribution. </p> <p>The moral question, the one for full compensation to the farmers, is the weakest. Theoretically they will get the cost of their homes and farm buildings. In any case, even those Zimbabweans who don't agree with what is going on speak with some bitterness about the manner in which the land was stolen at gunpoint and with considerable brutality little more than a century ago - not long when you see Ian Smith's old friend, the Queen Mother, getting her birthday card. That is no excuse for vilifying white farmers as Idi Amin hounded the Asians, or treating them with cruelty and brutality. Mugabe might want all the whites out of the country, but that is not the wish of most Zimbabweans. </p> <p>Then there is the legal case, but the west is hardly in a position to lecture Mugabe on the rule of law after decades of riding roughshod over the human rights of Africa by arming governments that commit genocide and propping up authoritarian leaders who plunder their treasuries. The only truly persuasive argument against the redistribution of the farms is the devastating impact the wreckage of the economy will have on the welfare of most Zimbabweans. The commercial farms bring in most of the country's hard currency and are the single largest employer. </p> <p>Mugabe and his government cannot fail to understand the consequence of redistribution of the country's most productive land to subsistence level farmers. At best, Zimbabwe will be able to feed itself. But the tobacco industry has already said that it will shut down if 3,000 farms are seized. Then there will be little hard currency to pay for fuel and electricity, and so little incentive for industry to stay around. </p> <p>A good proportion of the working population - farm hands to factory workers - will be out of jobs. If that happens, Zimbabwe will need all the subsistence farmers it can get. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:chris.mcgreal@theguardian.com\">chris.mcgreal@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Lobbying by the BBC has helped convince the government to resist pressure to abolish its governors, although their powers will be curtailed under proposals to be published later this year. </p> <p>Ministers are concerned that the governors are too closely associated with the BBC's managers, and not sufficiently independent to represent the viewers. They are likely to be placed under the control of an independent regulator which will oversee the entire broadcasting industry. </p> <p>Some of the BBC's commercial rivals had called for the governors to be abolished and for the BBC to be placed under the same form of independent regulation. The Commons culture, media and sport select committee remarked in a report last week that \"the views and roles of management and of the governors appear indistinguishable\". </p> <p>Ministers seem to have accepted the corporation's argument that, given its unique status as a semi-private organisation funded by public money, it should have its own layer of regulation. The government is understood to recognise the role they play in monitoring how licence-fee payers' money is spent at the corporation. </p> <p>Recently, the governors have made conspicuous attempts to assert their independence. They were critical of BBC1 in their annual report earlier this year, and are seeking reassurances on aspects of the BBC's plans to reorganise its television channels. The plan, being developed by the director general Greg Dyke and his director of television, Mark Thompson, envisages focusing BBC1 more on entertainment, more serious programmes on BBC2, and turning the digital channels BBC Choice and Knowledge into BBC3 and 4, respectively a youth network and a cultural channel. Governors want to be sure that factual and news programmes will still feature prominently on BBC1. </p> <p>No final decision on the governors' future status has been taken - the consultation process for the communications white paper, due to be published in the autumn, ended in June, and the responses are being considered by ministers at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry. </p> <p>Almost the entire broadcasting industry, in submissions to the consultation process, agreed that some form of single regulatory system should replace the plethora of regulators and watchdogs, such as the Independent Television Commission, the Radio Authority, and the Broadcasting Standards Commission. </p> <p>The BBC, however, in its submission said that its obligations to serve the public interest and remain independent of commercial and political pressures must be safeguarded. \"It is difficult to see how they could be combined within the oversight of a single regulatory body without compromising those characteristics which ensure that the BBC serves the public interest in a unique way,\" it said. </p> <p>Under the new system, it is likely that the governors will remain the first port of call for complaints against the BBC by viewers, and will maintain their role upholding editorial standards. </p> <p>However, the overall responsibility for ruling on new BBC services, such as channel launches and major changes to the schedules, is likely to be ceded to the new \"Ofcom\" communications regulator, which will oversee the entire broadcasting industry, and possibly the internet and telephony as well. </p> <p>There had been serious calls for the governors to be abolished completely. </p> <p>Michael Jackson, the chief executive of Channel 4 and a former controller of BBC2, said in a speech earlier this year: \"The BBC's board of governors is not an adequate or sustainable form of independent regulation.\" The expert panel that advised the government on the future of the BBC's licence fee, chaired by the economist Gavyn Davies, said the governors were not an adequate form of regulation for the BBC because they were too closely associated with its management.</p>",

  "<p>David Starkey is like a mischievous mechanic. There was the creasy-faced, steady pair of hands Peter Jay steering along the<strong> Road To Riches</strong> (BBC2, Sunday) towards his theory that the industrial revolution turned us all into consumers, when along came Starkey on a bus, ready to throw spanners into poor Peter's works like confetti. </p> <p>On the bus in Bath - destination, one can only presume: Contrary City - and continuing this surprisingly accessible yet thoughtful series, Starkey advanced the theory that it was consumers who drove the industrial revolution, not vice versa. In his distinctive diction - sounding like he's trying to work a toffee off his back teeth - he persuasively argued: \"Market first, smoke-stack industry second\". Bath was the Bluewater of the 1700s, and it was voracious consumer demand that built grim factories and dark Satanic mills, the call centres of their day. </p> <p>According to Starkey, vice and badness drove the economy - war, greed, dishonesty, promiscuity - and not the we-must-have-no-fun Protestant work ethic at all. For a moment, Jay looked a bit lost as his passenger questioned his navigational and driving skills. It was a joy to see. As was Bath, actually. Looks a lovely place. Bet the pair got themselves high tea and forgot their differences. </p> <p>The blokes featured in <strong> Movie Virgins </strong> (C4, Sunday) should probably get out more. Leon Herbert and Alex Jovy, two wannabe feature film directors, were so intent on making their respective movies, they seemed to have lost all sense of reality, not to mention their sanity. Leon had no money but was determined to make Emotional Backgammon, a film he billed as a glorious human interest story of love and loss - actually a clich\u00e9-packed, misogynist pile of nonsense. </p> <p>Surprisingly, it was difficult to warm to Leon, swanning round in Lily Savage cast-off chinoiserie dressing gowns in his north London flat, which made Gianni Versace's Miami mansion look like a minimalist temple. With serious delusions of grandeur, he said things like \"Women always leave you when they love you\" and \"I couldn't bear to shoot it on video\". Alex, meanwhile, was equally irksome. His film, \"a very commercial thriller set in London's clubland\" sounded equally appalling, though Alex had the edge on Leon because he said things like \"Kate Moss really likes the script\" and \"Mick Jagger would really like to play Damian\". (Whether he met the famous Kate and Mick or another Kate and Mick, from Sunderland say, we never found out). One of the All Saints was interested too, he half-pleaded on the phone. If there's a reason for this movie never to be made, there it was. </p> <p>Amazingly though, the pair progressed, with Alex getting a meeting with Fox Searchlight and Leon heading to Polygram in one of Jonathan Ross's old suits. By the end of the episode, Leon was all set to start filming (maybe next week he'll be dressed from a jumble sale at Latoya Jackson's) and Alex was in Cannes. He was supposed to be going waterskiing with Ewan McGregor. A veritable shoo-in to get Jude Law to star in his movie, then. If television adds 10 pounds, Movie Virgins proved it also magnifies character defects. It must be nice to have so much self-confidence. Or be so deluded. Fingers crossed they fail miserably. </p> <p>A pleasant success was <strong> The X Files</strong> (BBC1, Saturday). With David Duchovny taking both writing and directing credit as well as starring, it could have been some horrible self-indulgent Mulder-centric mush, but Duchovny's efforts were generous to everyone else concerned. Obviously, it was all about Mulder (roll on the series when he gets abducted and Scully actually gets some stories of her own and a chance to develop properly as a character), but with most of the episode set in Roswell in 1947 and concerned with an alien (or is he?) pretending to be a baseball player, Duchovny's Mulder only appeared intermittently. In a couple of tender and funny scenes with Gillian Anderson's Scully, he gave her the best lines and managed to wring another bit of sexual tension out of their closeness, just when you thought that was an over-furrowed field. </p> <p>There's something about Sunday nights that lends them to cosiness. What you need is something comforting, warm and fuzzy. In the absence of Pam Ferris from Where The Heart Is, <strong> Wildlife On One: Pussies Galore </strong> (BBC1, Sunday) was marvellous. So many cats scampering around was good enough, but then some kittens turned up! Bless.</p>",
  "Trade secretary Stephen Byers has not exactly set the Thames on fire with his summer series of speeches about government's relationship with industry. That is partly because he is still a political juvenile, forever consulting the script (Tony's book of Third Way apophthegms) before opening his mouth. It is also that Mr Byers cannot, as a loyal minister, ask hard questions about the boundary between his department and others. On one side there are agriculture and environment (which control regional development agencies), on the other defence, a major purchaser from British industry, and David Blunkett's responsibilities for skills and employment. <p>There is a further, profound reason why he does not cut a commanding figure. Mr Byers wants to lay down principles. They veer in a free-market direction. State intervention is a bad thing. But this is from an MP with a seat in the north-east. So he also notes the \"exceptional circumstances\" when emergency aid or sandwiches round a table in Victoria Street might be justified to stop a firm going bust. He is trying to be too schematic. In our post-socialist age, trade secretaries should revel in the sheer pragmatism of their position. Employees afflicted by impending closure of their factory or office must have recourse to political action. They must expect - demand - the government attempts to save their jobs. The alternative is some horrible fatalism, which in turn becomes a recipe for alienation or destabilising anger at the injustice of the economic system. Governments must, in Baden-Powell's words, be prepared. Stephen Byers, so typical of New Labour in this, wants to believe in the essential benignity of big business. Corporate boards are full of kind and gentle people, caring for customers, co-workers and the common good. As if. Governments will find it hard to counter the power of multinationals. Big companies will threaten to pull out of one jurisdiction and relocate to a more favourable one - to stop such leapfrogging is one of the very purposes of the European Union. Unless ministers are willing to carry a big stick and occasionally issue threats, they are effectively conceding the field to corporate capitalism, warts and all. </p> <p>Mr Byers's confusion about his role is understandable. We lack, these days, clean explanations of what the state can do to make private business more effective at creating jobs and income. Preaching about productivity to gatherings of great and good business people may not achieve a great deal. The DTI is shortly to issue its latest plan for the regulation of competition. Ministers will be invited to keep out, leaving decisions to neutral experts at the office of fair trading and competition commission, as if appraising mergers were merely technical. It is not. The shape of a market, like the rewards of directors, is a legitimate object of political concern. What is wrong with attempting, in any given market sector, to create a \"national champion\" with all that entails for corporate size? Or railing at boardroom greed? </p> <p>In his speechmaking so far Mr Byers has steered clear of training and personnel, keys to adding value in all organisations. Perhaps it is because he knows many companies take a dim view of improving staff skills. Finance capital does not have much time for human capital. So it is usually the state that educates and that, as Labour recognises, is a lifelong project. If Whitehall were rationally organised, the DTI, education and employment would occupy the same administrative space. But would Mr Byers command it?</p>",
  "It was the night before the German grand prix, and David Coulthard was doing the ironing. This is not something you would expect to read in connection with the great heroes of motor racing history. Who could imagine the Marques Alfonso de Portago y Cabeza - Ferrari driver of the 50s, Olympic fencer, bobsleigh champion and legendary lover - doing the domestic chores? <p>But the times are different, and so is David Coulthard, the courteous, unassuming and thoroughly sensible 29-year-old Scottish grand prix driver who hit the front pages three months ago when he pulled his fianc\u00e9e from the wreckage of a private jet in which the pilot and co-pilot had perished. Coulthard is different from the heroes of the mythical past, different even from his contemporaries. And different, some say, from the David Coulthard that he used to be. </p> <p>A year ago Coulthard would have stuffed his dirty washing in a hotel laundry bag and called down to get it picked up. If a friend asked him which hotel he was in, he would probably have needed to consult his key tag. This year, all that has changed. Instead of leapfrogging from hotel to hotel, now Coulthard parks a large blue and white motorhome - the colours of his racing helmet, patterned on the flag of St Andrew - in a corner of the pad dock. In the virtual world of Bernie Ecclestone's formula one, this looks very much like one man's way of restoring a bit of normality to his life. </p> <p>\"That's absolutely correct,\" he says, sitting in the office of his father's haulage company in Twynholm, a village half an hour's drive from Dumfries. And, with telling clarity, he recalls the decisive moment. \"One day, about two years ago, I was at a test session in France, at the Magny Cours circuit, and I felt absolutely lifeless. I remember finishing early and checking in at the hotel and asking at the reception, 'What is there to do in this area?' And the guy didn't have an answer for me because there was nothing to do. Magny Cours is in the middle of nowhere. I went to my room. I had a book to read but I had no motivation to do that, and there was no one that I particularly wanted to talk to on the phone. I thought, what am I doing? It just felt like I was giving away part of my life to ... nothing. That's when I decided to get the motorhome.\" </p> <p>Racing drivers don't often talk like this. More usually, they want you to know what a great time they had with a bunch of supermodels at that party in Milan last week, or how fast their new speedboat will go. Coulthard is indeed engaged to be married to a model, the very thin and very blonde Heidi Wichlinksi, and his current salary is around \u00a35m a year but he seems to have held on to the sort of self-questioning modesty that befits his solid upbringing in a village where the name of Seaman Thos W Coulthard RN is on the memorial to the victims of the 1914-18 war. </p> <p> \"I suppose this is slightly bizarre,\" he says, \"but last weekend at Hockenheim I was in the motorhome alone because Heidi was working, and I did some laundry. I did some ironing - I haven't ironed in a long time. I guess it doesn't sound very glamorous, but I thoroughly enjoyed ironing a pair of trousers and watching the telly and getting myself ready for the next day. I like organising my own little environment. I can invite into it those I want to be there and keep out those I don't.\" </p> <p> Along with the desire to reclaim a bit of his life this year came a deter mination to rid himself of the reputation for lacking a mean streak on the track, largely the result of his honourable behaviour in Australia in 1998, when he stuck by the terms of a pre-race agreement and moved aside to let his team-mate, Mika Hakkinen, win the race. \"I went through a period when I was perceived as being a soft touch, somebody who moves over, who is not hungry enough to win,\" he says. </p> <p>Some suggest the ordeal of the air crash added a final touch of steely resolution to his character. He is reluctant to discuss the event and its consequences, unwilling to do anything that might cause further distress to the families of the two men who died, but in any case such a melodramatic claim crumbles under scrutiny. Since the accident he has indeed won two races, but he had won at Silverstone immediately before it. </p> <p>Tall, slender and unusually square-jawed, Coulthard can look - sitting in his car during a practice session, wearing his flameproof balaclava - like a Burne-Jones knight on the eve of battle. He has been racing since his father put him in a go-kart at the age of eight, he made his formula one debut in 1994, as Damon Hill's team-mate, and he currently stands second in the championship, which intensifies the requirement for him to fit endless sponsorship commitments around his schedule. And now, in Twynholm, his father has opened a small David Coulthard museum. But the image side of the grand prix world is not his thing. \"I go through periods when I think that, other than on the track, this isn't really very much fun,\" he says. \"It's having to try to deal with the constant questioning when things aren't going very well, people poking you to try and get a response and perhaps taking you close to the edge emotionally.\" </p> <p>He lives in Monaco, like several of his rivals. \"It's a very closed, controlled environment,\" he says, with evident approval. \"When you're there you don't get any reminders that you're a grand prix driver. But every other Thursday, when I walk through into the paddock at a grand prix, and there are 1,000 cameras there, the reality comes back - this is the part of this world that I don't like, but I have to endure it because it gets me to the bit I do enjoy.\" </p> <p>As a man to whom being grown-up means being in control of his emotions, he dislikes leaping around on the victory rostrum but does it because that's what the photographers want. \"I think, why the hell do I have to be a showman? But then I realise that the reason you get the opportunity to do this is because of the public's dream that it must be fantastic to do this job, and they want to see that it's fantastic. They want to live it through you. I haven't quite sussed that part out yet, and I don't know if I ever will.\" </p> <p>One part he may be getting sussed out is the significance of personal conflict, a vital factor in formula one's vast box-office appeal. As a boy, Coulthard watched on television as Mansell, Prost, Senna and Piquet fought often ill-tempered battles. Now he and Michael Schumacher are indulging in an acrimonious run ning squabble of their own. Two years ago, after a couple of mid-race collisions, Schumacher accused Coulthard of trying to kill him. This season the German and the Scot have tangled again. \"It makes life a wee bit interesting,\" he says, without giving the impression that he enjoys it. </p> <p>So what does he really think of Schumacher? \"Two different things. As a man I think he's a decent guy, a family man, quite straightforward. Given the hero worship and his vast wealth, it would be very easy for him not to be quite as normal as he is, privately. Publicly, as a racing driver, I'm not entirely comfortable with his inability to realise that he does make mistakes and it's not always someone else who's entirely to blame. </p> <p>\"I had a conversation with him last year, and I said: 'In your home, are you always right and your wife is always wrong?' He went: 'No, no, that's different.' </p> <p>\"I said: 'It's not different. It's values. It's understanding what right and wrong are. I believe I have those values and you clearly don't. Now we can leave this room today and never speak to each other again, and I'll have a happy life and you'll have a happy life, but it would be a shame because we live in the same world, as competitors, and part of the enjoyment I get from competing is to look my fellow competitors in the eye. The human side is very important.' </p> <p>\"He had to agree on that and we shook hands and walked away. Until the next time we fell out.\" </p> <p>Their latest spat erupted when Coulthard complained about Schumacher's habit of weaving across the track. For a couple of races they didn't talk to each other but before the grand prix in Germany 10 days ago, Schumacher made an unexpected move. \"It was a bit like what happens after two kids have fallen out in the playground. Eventually the one who thinks that maybe he was a little bit wrong makes the gesture of coming back and saying, 'Do you want a sweetie?' As we were coming out of one of the corners in the forest, Michael tapped me on the shoulder and said: 'Do you think there should be a kerb on the outside of this corner?' There was absolutely no need for a kerb at that part of the circuit. But I took it as his gesture at trying to start the conversation again. And I accepted it.\" </p> <p>He will retire to start a \"normal life\", he says, when he loses the buzz he experiences before a race, when he gets \"as nervous as I did when I was 11\". But losing his nerve is unlikely to play a part. \"I think some guys will probably never get fear in their whole lives, and other guys will get it. I think in Damon's case, he came up against fear. At Hockenheim last year I remember him saying to me, 'I can't do this any more.' I was pretty shocked. I was thinking, God, we've still got a few races to go - if you're saying that, why not stop now? Why take the risk? There are considerable risks in doing these speeds, and if you don't see that as a challenge and a thrill, then it's got to be too frightening. I never want to put myself in a position where I'm frightened. I just don't do things that frighten me.\"</p>",
  "I am puzzled about the reasoning behind the idea that the existence of a public register would have prevented the tragic murder of Sarah Payne (Paper relents over drive to shame, August 5). It is not being suggested that she was the victim of a \"groomer\" - someone living in her locality who befriended her - but of someone who snatched her at random. <p>Knowing that someone in the neighbourhood has past convictions for child offences doesn't change anything for parents at large. Surely we all monitor who befriends our children and exercise caution over unrelated adults who want to spend time alone with them?

  "Exhausted, thirsty and dejected, Christian Nikei, his wife Maris and their friend were intercepted by a civil guard cutter within metres of their destination: Europe's southern shore. <p>Hauled on board the Spanish patrol boat from a flimsy rubber dinghy, they slumped in the cold early morning light, their journey over. </p> <p>They were the latest addition to the ranks of illegal immigrants caught this year - 7,000, according to the authorities in Andalucia - while risking their lives crossing the treacherous Strait of Gibraltar from Africa in search of a better future. </p> <p>They said they were political refugees from Sierra Leone, who had come by way of Mauritania, and had organised the journey for themselves. </p> <p>Christian looked fit and healthy in contrast to his two companions. His wife and the friend needed urgent medical attention. Their skin was burned by a mixture of petrol and salt water. It was quicker to take them in the patrol boat to hospital in the southern Spanish port of Algeciras. </p> <p>\"We won't be separated?\" Christian asked as he gazed at his wife shivering inside the cabin and his emaciated friend lying on the deck beside him, nearly unconscious. </p> <p>Their story seemed plausible but none of it was likely to be true, the sergeant in charge of the patrol, Antonio, said. </p> <p>Christian had been well briefed to say the things likely to make it possible for him to stay in Spain, he said. He had almost certainly used one of the mafias that charge up to 500,000 pesetas (\u00a31,850) a head to bring people over. </p> <p>Every night two patrol boats based in Algeciras, next to Gibraltar, set out to try to stop the human tide. One heads 30 miles east to Estepona, where the Costa del Sol begins. The other turns west, through the strait. </p> <p>Back and forth they trail, watching the radar screen, listening to the radio, but well aware that they cannot catch all the vessels hoping to sneak by. According to one police estimate, Spain stops fewer than a quarter of the illegal immigrants heading for its shores. </p> <p>\"We're not inhuman, but it's our job and we have to do it,\" said Pascual, one of the four paramilitary guards patrolling the strait on the night Christian was picked up. </p> <p>As a signatory to the Schengen treaty - the agreement by which a majority of EU members have sought to eliminate border controls between themselves - Spain has the thankless task of policing one of the main southern routes for illegal entrants: across the Strait of Gibraltar, where the gap between rich and poor is just 20 miles of hazardous water. </p> <p>The Spanish authorities say that at least 250 people have died trying to cross since 1998. An estimate in the Moroccan daily Lib\u00e9ration said over 3,000. No one really knows. </p> <p>Increasingly desperate, the Spanish government has toughened its controls. Under the old law illegal immigrants were entitled to stay in Spain after two years in the country with a job. Now the threshold has been raised to five years, and it will be harder to bring in relatives and easier to throw immigrants out. </p> <p>The law includes measures against human traffickers and fines of up to 10m pesetas (\u00a337,000) for employing illegals. </p> <p>Until the 1970's Spain was itself an exporter of labour. Now part of the affluent north, it is struggling to keep immigrants out while pressing the EU to invest more on the southern shores of the Mediterranean to stop them coming. </p> <p>Immigrants from Morocco and other parts of north and sub-Saharan Africa have been joined more recently by eastern Europeans and Pakistanis crossing the Pyrenees. </p> <p>Spain is torn between its need for labour and its fear of integrating newcomers in a society that has stayed remarkably homogeneous since the end of the 15th century when Jews and Arabs were expelled. Foreigners form only 2% of the population, about 1m people; just under half of these are northern Europeans living in the affluent coastal ghettos. </p> <p>One of a series of amnesties for illegal immigrants has just ended. The number of applicants for legal status was more then twice that expected: 180,000 will achieve legal status as a result; several thousand will be turned away. </p> <p>In December a new law provided for about 70,000 immigrants to settle each year. But the centre-right government, fearing a racist backlash, has retreated from full implementation. In the past year there have been clashes in Andalusia and Catalonia, where many immigrants do the jobs Spaniards no longer wish to take on. </p> <p>Civil guards patrol the notorious N340 coast road north of Algeciras to try to stop trucks and vans packed full of immigrants. \"It's only a matter of time,\" one said, \" before something happens here like the Dover disaster\" when 58 Chinese would-be immigrants were found dead in June of heat and suffocation in a lorry.</p>",
  "The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the reformist parliament yesterday to abandon its promise to expand freedom of speech and revive the banned progressive press. <p>It was seen as a step toward re-asserting clerical rule over participatory democracy. </p> <p>Ayatollah Khamenei's action runs counter to the hopes of millions whose votes in February's general election sent to parliament a majority of reformists who had run on platforms including a free press. </p> <p>Using his powers to intervene in the legislative process, the ayatollah issued a letter to the 290 MPs concerning a new bill meant to amend the restrictive press law. When the letter was read aloud in the chamber, scuffles broke out on the floor. </p> <p>\"If the enemies infiltrate the press, this will be a big danger to the country's security and the people's religious beliefs,\" he wrote. </p> <p>\"I do not deem it right to keep silent . . . The bill is not legitimate and not in the interest of the system and the revolution.\" </p> <p>Iranians have been waiting to see when and how the conservative establishment would try to use its overwhelming power to challenge republican rule. </p> <p>Under the constitution, the supreme leader, who is appointed by a body of conservative clerics, has the final say in all matters of state. But it came as a surprise that Ayatollah Khamenei intervened in such a blatant and public way. </p> <p>Some MPs voiced outrage and threatened to resign. Others said they planned to write to Ayatollah Khamenei in protest, and reformist sources said they were afraid that one of their colleagues could face criminal charges for protesting against the leader's action too vociferously. </p> <p>The Iranian press has given the reform movement a powerful voice; the ayatollah used a speech in April to label some newspapers, \"bases of the enemy\". </p> <p>For this reason, conservatives in the judiciary shut down these publications, beginning in April, and jailed at least half a dozen editors and commentators. Some were imprisoned for up to five years; others were released on bail but banned from involvement in writing or publishing. </p> <p>Yesterday the reformist MPs were poised to make such restrictive measures more difficult by passing a new press law which would require legal action to be taken against newspaper publishers, rather than against individual writers, thus lifting the threat of jail sentences from journalists. </p> <p>The law would have changed the composition of a press supervisory board, which licenses publications, to include more reformers. </p> <p>Reformist MPs knew that the extent of their power remained uncertain. Even if they had rallied a majority to vote for the bill, it could still have been vetoed by the Guardian Council, a body of conservative clerics and jurists charged with deciding if legislation conforms to Islamic law. </p> <p>It often uses this power to veto legislation it disagrees with for political reasons. </p> <p>Mohammad Reza Khatami, deputy speaker of parliament and the head of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the reformers' biggest faction, which functions like a political party, acknowledged the movement's limitations last week. </p> <p>Mr Khatami, the brother of President Mohammad Khatami, said the new MPs should lower their expectations for change. </p> <p>The parliamentary speaker, Mehdi Karroubi, a senior cleric approved by Ayatollah Khomenei to lead parliament against the wishes of the reformers, reminded MPs of the limitations of republican rule. </p> <p>\"Our constitution has the elements of the absolute rule of the supreme clerical leader and you all know this and approve of this,\" he said. \"We are all duty-bound to abide by it.\" </p> <p>To counter the gains that reformers have made through the ballot box in municipal and parliamentary elections, conservatives have asserted their power in the judiciary and law enforcement - the institutions they dominate. </p> <p>Many reformers now say publicly that it will take many years to achieve political pluralism. Mohsen Kadivar, a prominent cleric who was released from prison after being given an 18-month sentence, said it was unrealistic to expect freedom of speech in Iran to happen quickly. </p> <p>Mr Kadivar was jailed for a series of articles he wrote accusing the clerical establishment of behaving like the shah's regime. </p> <p>\"We are living in a third world country. There is a 2,500-year history of despotism,\" he said. \"It is natural that there should be resistance in the face of freedom. The judiciary respects neither the law, nor religious standards, nor public opinion. </p> <p>\"But the fact that they arrest their opponents, rather than kill them like they did before, is progress.\"</p>"
