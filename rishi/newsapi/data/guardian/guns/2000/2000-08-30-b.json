  "<p>Credit Suisse, the Swiss banking group, is to spend $1.2bn (\u00a3800m) on sweeteners to retain key staff at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, the smaller US rival with which it has agreed an $11.5bn takeover. </p> <p>The golden handcuffs which were being hurriedly put together yesterday, presenting scores of investment bankers in London and New York with the prospect of multi-million dollar bonuses, did little to calm anxieties about the scale of the job cuts. These are expected to amount to as much as 10% of the combined 26,000 workforce in the US and Britain. </p> <p>The bank tried to play down the extent to which job losses would be felt in London, where DLJ employs 2,000 people after a high-profile recruitment drive in recent years. Joe Roby, chief executive of DLJ, said yesterday: \"Each firm needs more firepower in Europe.\" </p> <p>The cuts are intended to achieve savings of up to $1bn by 2002 and expected to hit the areas of greatest overlap such as equity sales and trading as well as back office operations in the US and Europe. </p> <p>The retention package, which equates to half the combined group's annual profits, is expected to be directed largely at a few hundred bankers in DLJ's high-yield and corporate finance departments. CSFB will also pay out options to replace those from DLJ. </p> <p>But Wall Street was sceptical about the claims over job cuts. One analyst who refused to be named said: \"This is not going to be one of the cleanest or easiest of mergers we have seen in the financial services sector.\" </p> <p>Amy Butte, financial services analyst at Bear Stearns, said the deal was potentially \"ugly\" for banking staff. \"From DLJ's perspective this is not the best strategic fit because there is so much overlap.\" </p> <p>Both banks have expanded aggressively in Europe in the past three years. DLJ recruited Hector Sants from UBS to build an equity research group from scratch within a year of CSFB buying BZW, the British investment bank. </p> <p>The Swiss bank's success in integrating this business was underlined by supporters to ease concerns about yesterday's merger, which is said to have taken more than two and a half years to hatch. </p> <p>DLJ maintained a large degree of autonomy under Axa, the French insurer which owns 70% of it. Axa, which also announced its intention to buy the remaining stake in its US financial arm, is to receive $8.1bn for its stake. </p> <p>CSFB said yesterday that the new group would have topped the league tables for equity and high yield research in the first half of this year and ranked number three in advisory work. DLJ will increase the bank's assets under management by $120bn to $842bn. </p> <p>CSFB wants to enter the troika of banks - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch - which control more than 50% of the under writing and mergers business in the US. </p> <p>In a note to investors, Judah Kraushaar, analyst at Merrill Lynch, poured cold water on these ambitions when he described the merger as \"a relatively minimum threat to major US bulge bracket firms\". </p> <p>Only Pershing, DLJ's share clearing arm, will keep its name after the merger, the rest of the business being subsumed into CSFB. </p> <p>The Swiss bank's purchase of DLJ Direct, the group's online brokerage arm, means it will drop plans to set up its own online brokerage service for wealthy individuals.</p>",
  "<p>No one will have viewed Alan Smith's elevation to the England squad with greater interest than the new captain Tony Adams. To say that the wise old head of the back line is not the greatest fan of this precocious young striker would be an understatement. </p> <p>The scene is Elland Road, May 11 1999, the visitors are Arsenal. Smith, though only 18, is understood to have spent much of the match sledging the admirable Adams, using various aspects of the Arsenal's player's personal life as his subject matter. In the closing minutes Smith is butted by Gilles Grimandi and the Frenchman is sent off.</p> <p>Old pros have long memories. When the teams met the following season at Highbury Adams made his presence plain to Smith with, shall we say, a personally addressed and particularly lusty challenge. </p> <p>So when young Smith joins up with England today as a replacement for the injured Emile Heskey, it will be fascinating to know what Adams says to the new boy. Or maybe silence will suffice. </p> <p>In his short career Smith has always had something to say. Though respect for his betters has not been a theme. Indeed, during one on-field argument the teenager threw the ball into Peter Schmeichel's face. </p> <p>Smith's reputation as a purveyor of dubious tackles and petulant hostility grew worryingly last season, in which he was booked 10 times and sent off once. His manager at Leeds, David O'Leary, ended up concluding that he was \"a bit of a thug\". It all added to the Irishman's frustration. Smith had looked like a player to watch when he burst into the Leeds first team with a goal on his debut in a 3-1 win at Anfield in November 1998. Now what he did on the field was making people avert their eyes. </p> <p>When Manchester City showed interest in signing him in the summer, nobody could have blamed O'Leary for agreeing to the move just to end the hassle. But O'Leary is one of those managers who see difficult players as a challenge. He knew that if he could rid Smith of the bad parts, the good parts - and there were plenty - would be given the room to flourish. </p> <p>So over the summer the manager laid down the law. \"I had big words with Alan and hopefully we have sorted a few things out,\" he says. \"In his first season he did fantastically well but last year he was very disappointing. </p> <p>\"He had a niggling ankle injury but I think a lot of it was him trying to be a different person than he really is. In a way he was trying to show people how hard he was and he was becoming a bit of thug really. And I don't want them in my team. </p> <p>\"But I know Alan Smith and what he's capable of. He has great all-round ability. He can hold a ball up. He's a clever player and can lead the line tremendously well.\" </p> <p>O'Leary bases his faith not only on Smith's talent but on his age. \"I have to still remember that he is only 19. I had people in this club writing him off when he was 18, which is scandalous because he's a kid. He's going to make his mistakes and have his lows.\" </p> <p>O'Leary's little chat worked wonders. Smith has flourished in the early weeks of this season, scoring five goals in four games, and suddenly finds himself in the England set-up with his cockiness hopefully now channelled in the right direction. </p> <p>\"He has the sort of confidence that strikers need,\" says Kevin Keegan. \"That is not arrogance. It is saying, 'I know what I've got to do, I know if I get opportunites I'm capable of scoring goals'.\" </p> <p>There have been other signs that maybe at last Smith is beginning to grow up. When the two Leeds United fans were killed in Istanbul last season Smith, born and bred in Leeds himself, wrote on his website about how moved he was. It was a rare sighting of maturity in the teenager. What Keegan, O'Leary and Adams need now is to see plenty more examples.</p>",
  "<p>The government yesterday announced proposals for the testing of social workers to establish whether they have updated their professional training and have sufficient knowledge and practical skills to do the job properly. In a consultation paper on improving the quality of social care, ministers raised the possibility of a periodic MoT test for Britain's 25,000 qualified fieldworkers, similar to the five-year revalidation scheme proposed by the General Medical Council to check the competence of doctors. </p> <p>If the plan is adopted, the implication is that continuing professional development will become a condition of holding on to a job in one of the country's most overstretched workforces. \"It is no longer acceptable to assume that a qualification gained at age 25 or 30 will equip professional staff for the challenges they face 20 years later,\" says the paper, A Quality Strategy for Social Care. \"We will set out to encourage a step change in attitudes to, and participation in, post-qualification training.\" </p> <p>The pending scheme for registering professional staff with a general social care council (GSCC), already promised by Labour, could be used to ensure their skills are regularly updated, the paper suggests. Promotion to supervisory positions \"could be made dependent on the attainment of post-qualifying training\" and there could be a more widespread check on the skills of field workers. \"The government would welcome views on whether the general social care council should be asked to develop a formal re-registration scheme for professional staff, in the same way that the GMC has recently introduced such a requirement for doctors.\" </p> <p>The proposal was part of a radical overhaul of social work training, based on a report by JM Consulting, commissioned by the Department of Health in 1998 and published yesterday alongside the consultation paper. The consultants recommend \"a significant upgrading of several aspects of the qualifying education, with a greater focus on field experience, based on a national curriculum for social work training\". </p> <p>Instead of 80 colleges offering two-year diploma courses of variable quality, the consultants think there should be a much smaller number of centres of excellence offering three-year courses of degree standard. The consultation paper does not indicated whether ministers agree that social work should be turned into a graduate profession. But John Hutton, social care minister, sounded keen when he floated the idea at a conference in London in July, organised by the Guardian and the National Institute for Social Work. </p> <p>The paper raises the obvious worry that increasing entry standards might reduce the supply of newly qualified social workers. A possible solution might be to retrain other social care staff who were capable of more skilled work. </p> <p>Other proposals include a social care institute for excellence (Scie) to provide authoritative guidance on good practice. Ministers are canvassing opinion on whether it should be a not-for-profit voluntary body, at arms length from government; a statutory, non-departmental public body funded by government; or an adjunct of either the new national care standards commission or the GSCC. </p> <p>Hutton says: \"With up to 1.5m people relying on social services in England, we must have a system which is robust and of the highest quality... This strategy offers anyone who cares about social services a real opportunity to make radical changes. It must be grasped.\" </p> <p>Jo Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, says the profession should welcome graduate entry and a re-registration scheme to ensure that social workers were continually developing their knowledge and skills. \"Let's hold our heads up. Like the doctors, we should take responsibility for refreshing our skills.\" </p> <p>The current, two-year social work qualification is not enough to prepare staff for their first job and standards vary too much among institutions, Williams believes. \"But if we are going to make it three years, we have to be clearer about the skills and aptitudes that we need as employers. There will be fewer social workers, but they will be more skilled and better paid.\" </p> <p>John Ransford, head of social care at the Local Government Association, says employers will have to think more carefully about how a new intermediate grade might be created. It will be important to give people the service they expect without de-skilling or exploiting staff. \"We will work with government, rather than against it, to work out the detail.\" </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/scg/qualitystrategy.htm\">A Quality Strategy for Social Care paper</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/scg/training.htm\">The JM Consulting report</a></p>",
  "Irish travellers are a separate ethnic group entitled to the same protection under the Race Relations Act as other ethnic minorities in Britain, a court ruled yesterday. <p>The decision was taken by a judge presiding over the case of eight travellers, who are claiming racial discrimination against five London pubs they say refused to serve them because of their ethnic origin. </p> <p>Lawyers for Punch Retail, owners of three of the pubs, argued that the travellerswere not covered by the Race Relations Act so could not bring the case. But Judge Goldstein rejected the claims at a pre liminary hearing at Central London county court yesterday, saying Irish travellers had a shared history stretching back to the mid 19th century and should be given protection as an \"ethnic group\". </p> <p>\"Modern Irish travellers are guided by the culture and traditions which have been handed down by generations. They do not go around reading history, they practise it.\" </p> <p>He said that to exclude Irish travellers from protection under the Race Relations Act would leave three glaring anomalies - the appeal court had decided Romany Gypsies were covered by the legislation and the two groups shared many characteristics; it would fly in the face of the broad provisions against discrimination provided by the European convention on human rights and the group already enjoyed protection in Ulster under the Northern Ireland Race Relations Order. </p> <p>Four of the travellers, Patrick O'Leary and Michael, Margaret and Kathleen Kiely, were in court to hear the verdict, and said in a statement: \"We hope this success will encourage other Irish travellers to use the law whenever they are discriminated against.\" </p> <p>The travellers claim they were refused service in April 1998. Punch Retail was given 42 days to lodge an appeal before a trial date is set.</p>",
  "<p>Cricket's transfer market tends to be as busy as a butcher's on Boxing Day, although Chris Lewis and Phil DeFreitas have been known to boost business. In some respects this is a good thing: county followers can forge emotional bonds with their favourite players and may even wish them well if they do finally join another side (football fans treat former heroes who have moved on with more animosity than they treat each other). In other respects it is a shame, because this sort of idle speculation rarely gets put into practice. But, hey, this shouldn't stop us speculating. Because for every Marcus Trescothick and Jason Brown who has broken from the ranks, there are others who have faded into the background. A change of county might be just the answer.</p> <p>Top of the shopping list is Ben Hollioake. Three years ago, after driving Glenn McGrath to distraction by playing, missing and thumping his way to 63 off 48 balls in a one-day international at Lord's, he was hailed as the new saviour of English cricket. Now he is an increasingly marginal figure at Surrey. When he bowls, he looks like a one-man band trying to outplay the on-song duos of Martin Bicknell and Alex Tudor, Saqlain Mushtaq and Ian Salisbury. When he bats, he just looks like Saqlain Mushtaq. </p> <p>He has lost his way, but given more responsibility and careful man-management he can return. Edgbaston may be the place to go. It's a Test ground (somehow you can't imagine Hollioake strutting his stuff at Derby or Colwyn Bay), it's always accommodated allrounders, and it's got Bob Woolmer at the helm, a man who knows a bit about sports psychology. And assuming Adam stays put at The Oval, Ben wouldn't feel as if Big Brother was always watching.</p> <p>Owais Shah of Middlesex is another young cricketer who has never quite fulfilled his potential. And with Mark Ramprakash out of the England reckoning for the time being, Shah may find first-team opportunities in 2001 as limited as they have been in the last month. Shah needs to find a county with slots to fill in the top-order. Derbyshire's batting has been pitiful this year, but then so have their pitches. An even better choice would be Leicestershire - who will surely dispense with the services of Trevor Ward sooner rather than later - or Nottinghamshire, where the OAPs' garden party is crying out to be crashed.</p> <p>One player who will definitely be on the move at the end of the summer is Devon Malcolm, who is currently tearing his hair out in Northamptonshire's second XI. He's 37, but by his own reckoning is still fit enough to play county cricket. A trip to Canterbury, where the new-ball attack of David Masters and Martin Saggers has been short of penetration this season, might suit him. Kent have already approached Northants this season about the possibility of borrowing Dev on loan but were turned down. Another attempt would surely be more successful.</p> <p>Some of England's young bowlers, too, might find that pastures are greener elsewhere, although if they get any greener at Headingley, Matthew Hoggard will simply have to trundle in at 65mph, place the ball on the seam and watch the five-fors roll in. Hoggard is already flattered by Headingley: his 19 Championship wickets there this season have cost 22.58 apiece, while the 16 he has picked up at other grounds have come at an average of 31.06. If England really do believe he is a potential first-change bowler of the future, they should insist he leave Yorkshire and learn to bowl on wickets that make him work harder for success - like Taunton, Northampton, or Hove.</p> <p>The same goes for Paul Franks of Nottinghamshire and Steve Harmison of Durham: Trent Bridge and Chester-le-Street may make a seamer feel good, but the feel-good factor will soon disappear in a Test match at Lahore or Adelaide.</p> <p>Wicketkeeper Rob Turner may find his career prospects enhanced by leaving Somerset. Last year he was tipped as a future England player; this year he has faded badly. What about moving to Headingley, where Richard Blakey's powers are on the wane and the seaming ball would provide plenty of opportunity to practise his catching? Yorkshire are also a high-profile county, and although this should have nothing to do with selection, it invariably seems to.</p> <p>Of course, not all of these questions would arise if all the groundsmen were contracted to the ECB and the pitches were the same throughout the country. England may not yet be able to say who should play for which county, but they can certainly make the debate less relevant - and help their own cause - by getting the pitches in order. But rather like this sort of column, that, for the moment, must remain a dream.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

  "<p>The managing director of AltaVista UK, Andy Mitchell, resigned today after the debacle over the company's botched plans for unmetered internet access.</p> <p>The US internet portal last week abandoned schemes for unmetered flat-fee web access in the UK, after announcing its intentions to start the service to great fanfare in March.</p> <p>Altavista's package, which appeared to offer unlimited surfing time, was endorsed by the prime minister, Tony Blair, when it was first announced and many experts predicted a rash of similar offers from rival internet companies. </p> <p>When it announced its climbdown last week, AltaVista blamed rival BT for its failure, saying it could not risk subsidising a free, unmetered package for customers while BT charged by the minute. AltaVista's unmetered service was to be at an initial annual fee of \u00a360 and it had signed up 274,000 customers.</p> <p>Last week Mr Mitchell called the internet business in the UK a \"fiasco\". He said: \"A lot of people are dependent on BT for this service. Altavista alongside other companies are the symptom of, not the cause of, the problem.\" </p> <p>But Mr Mitchell admitted that he was \"absolutely remiss\" in not telling people sooner about the problems. BT denies that its charging structure was to blame, saying that it offered a deal which complied with the law.</p> <p>Today Pierre Paperon, president of AltaVista Europe, said: \"The mistakes in our planned internet access service probably made Andy's departure inevitable.\" Mr Mitchell only returned from holiday a few days ago. The company has appointed Stephanie Himoff as acting managing director. </p> <p>AltaVista is not the only company to have promised more than it could deliver. Lineone and Callnet0800 have scrapped their unmetered packages, while Virgin.net's has been delayed. However, Freeserve and World Online are offering unmetered packages. </p> <p>AltaVista is advising the thousands of people who signed up for the service to opt for one of its other offers. These either restrict how long users can stay online, or ask them to pay their telephone charges.</p> <p>AltaVista's complaints have found some support from the Consumers' Association, which said that BT's pricing regime made it difficult for internet service providers (ISPs) to offer customers the best deal. BT has dismissed AltaVista's claims as nonsense, saying it has had a flat rate wholesale package available since June 1.</p> <p>Analysts believe that AltaVista's withdrawal was prompted by its realisation that unmetered access would not be profitable. CMGI, the parent company of AltaVista, said earlier this month that it wanted to acquire ISPs in Europe which could include Britain. This may also have influenced AltaVista's decision.</p> <p>The telecommunications regulator expressed surprise at Alta Vista's grievance with BT, saying the American group had made no official complaint.</p> <p><strong>Useful link</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/internetnews/story/0,7369,357275,00.html\">Analysis by deputy Online editor Neil McIntosh</a></p>",
  "<p>The former management of HTV, the ITV franchise for Wales and the west of England, is planning to make a bid for the broadcaster when it goes on the block next month. </p> <p>Huw Davies, former group director of television at HTV, and erstwhile financial controller David Jenkins have secured backing for the bid and have already made an informal approach to the present owner, Granada Media. </p> <p>The franchise is to be put up for sale to satisfy regulators after Granada agreed to buy the ITV assets of United News &amp; Media last month. </p> <p>The former management of HTV is expected to face stiff competition from Carlton Communications and possibly SMG - which owns the Grampian and Scottish TV groups. </p> <p>The two executives involved are among the team which in June this year paid \u00a316.5m for Channel Television, the smallest of the ITV operators. They are likely to use the business as the vehicle for the bid. </p> <p>They have secured financial backing from Royal Bank of Scotland and Friends Ivory &amp; Sime, the fund management group. Mr Jenkins conceded that the Channel offer was not the favourite to win. </p> <p>\"It is a bit like David and Goliath, and we sure as hell won't get into a bidding war with Carlton because that's not sustainable. But we want to give Granada another option. The bottom line is what does Charles Allen want to do?\" </p> <p>The HTV franchise is expected to go under the hammer after the completion next month of the \u00a3450m deal between Granada and United News &amp; Media. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins also admitted that ownership of HTV in the event of winning the auction would only be likely to be an interim situation. </p> <p>\"Obviously consolidation into a single ITV company will happen but we have the opportunity to grow it further in the meantime,\" he said. \"We can make sure that it would be a singificant player within a bigger ITV.\" </p> <p>Some analysts believe that Mr Allen would prefer to do anything which does not strengthen Carlton's position as the second largest player in ITV. He may look favourably on parking the HTV business with SMG, in which Granada has an 18% stake. </p> <p>The agreement with United also included the licences for Meridian, the south of England franchise and Anglia Television. HTV pushed Granada over the 15% audience share limit imposed by law.</p>",
  "<p>When I wrote the book Earth in the Balance in 1991, terms like \"global warming\" and \"greenhouse gases\" seemed exotic, unfamiliar, and unimportant to the lives of ordinary Americans. That has changed dramatically - except for those who still want to pretend that no one cares. There is a powerful awareness of the danger, and a widespread determination that we must not and will not leave our grandchildren a ravaged planet ringed with a thickening layer of carbon dioxide concentrations. So we have to strengthen, not weaken, environmental protection across the board, from global warming to stabilising world population. </p> <p>Last November, under pressure from utility lobbies, the majority in Congress sought to write dozens of loopholes into the Clean Air Act, weakening enforcement of the law against old and dirty power plants. Instead, we need tough standards for soot and smog, with reasonable flexibility but a real timetable for implementation. In the Environment Decade, polluters should pay to clean up the pollution they've created rather than impose the burden on taxpayers. It was President Kennedy who, in speaking of a safer world, reminded us that \"we all breathe the same air\" - and if \"we all cherish our children's future,\" then we have an obligation to make it safe to breathe that air. </p> <p>As we realise and explore the interconnectedness of all the global environment problems we face - as we increasingly understand that they are not separate issues but interlocking strands in the rich fabric of the ecosystem - lots of snippets of data, including measurements of Arctic ice, counts of lost species, urban pollution measurements, and satellite records of sea surface temperatures, among others, help us put together an integrated picture of multiple stresses on the environment. We are coming to see that the solutions are not isolated either - that one depends on and reinforces the other. For example, reducing greenhouse gases will also reduce traditional air pollutants, and an effort to eliminate smog also inevitably limits carbon emissions. We have to move forward on all fronts at once. </p> <p>Saving the environment involves more than one policy, one presidency, one nation, or the work of one generation. The task is as small as the decision each of us can make to recycle or buy energy-efficient products, and as great as the imperative facing all the countries of the earth to limit carbon emissions, save rain forests, and repair the ozone layer - policies that in the end can be accomplished only on a global basis. One of our greatest hopes is young people, those who will inherit the earth and the challenge of restoring its balance - the ones who will live long enough to know surely whether this peaceful battle for the planet is finally being won. </p> <p>Today, our Global Learning and Observations for the Environment programme (Globe) has become history's largest environmental education programme for children in school. As vice president, I have fought for and won funding for Globe as one of the last small items to be approved each year in the federal budget. It is a beginning - in a sense, a pilot programme - that in the decade ahead must lead to universal environmental education. Globe is a pioneering effort to create a feedback loop that will bring the data that describe the evolving condition of the earth within the conscious authority of young citizens as well as scientists. </p> <p>In the decade to come, we have to find ways to secure a truly livable planet where 10bn people will live. In 1900, people had no idea how the earth might sustain the 6bn people we have now. Meeting that challenge evoked amazing technological advances and unprecedented environmental dangers. Our challenge now, which requires the education of us all and the raising of our collective awareness on a global basis, is to restore and save the earth even as we add still more members to the human family. This will not be easy or simple; there will be setbacks, and fierce resistance from those who profit from pollution. We will have to make new policies, develop new technologies, and think outside the conventional boxes. But the effort we are making is both a great challenge and a great adventure. It is nothing less than a commitment, for the second time in human history, to find and shape a new world. </p> <p>As I go back over what I wrote in Earth in the Balance and reflect on the progress we have made since it was first published, I can reaffirm that even though our environmental challenges are vast, we can meet them. We know that the crisis was made by our human carelessness, and it can and must be solved by our human initiative. The 20th century was many things, good and bad, but it was for much of its course a century of pollution. Since the 60s and the first Earth Day, in 1970, we have made some remarkable gains. Especially in the last seven years, we have laid the foundations to make the first decade of the 21st century the Environment Decade, for America and for the world. The agenda for that decade, discussed in this foreword and prefigured in these pages in 1992, is practical, essential, and fundamental. It will help the economy, not hurt it. And it can truly save the earth as we know it. </p> <p>This was my conclusion when this book was first published: \"We can believe in that future and work to achieve it and preserve it, or we can whirl blindly on, behaving as if one day there will be no children to inherit our legacy.\" The choice is ours; the Environment Decade is within our reach; the earth is in the balance.</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract of a new foreword to Al Gore's Earth in the Balance, published by Earthscan on September 14, (\u00a312.95)</p>",
  "<p>Their houses had been torched, they had no passport, no food, no money, but the Kosovar refugees streaming into makeshift camps in Albania in the summer of 1998 all had inside their shoes a little piece of paper with a name and a phone number - a sister in France, a cousin in the US. \"The first thing they all wanted was a telephone - to be able to tell their families they were alive,\" recalls Jean-Francois Cazenave, president of Telecoms Sans Fronti\u00e8res (TSF), a French organisation which establishes satellite communications in areas struck by war, floods or other disasters. </p> <p>The following summer, TSF was busy providing telephone access to refugees in Kosovo when the earthquake struck in Turkey. \"Within 24 hours we were in Istanbul. All the terrestrial networks were destroyed, but instead of having to drive 20km to find an acoustic drill or some other piece of equipment, we could use our satellite phones. We helped save 14 lives,\" says Cazenave. </p> <p>As man-made and natural disasters increase in severity and scope around the globe, communication is emerging as a new necessity in disaster relief work, alongside food, water, medicine and hygiene. In response, a new type of humanitarian aid focussing on communications is rapidly developing in partnership with technology companies. \"Communication is one of the most important aspects in relief work: you have to know what happened on the ground, what is needed, and plan the logistics of the operations,\" says Ian Bray, press officer at Oxfam. \"It is crucial not only during an emergency, but also after, to provide agencies and local people with the necessary contacts inside and outside their countries.\" </p> <p>The idea of providing satellite communications to displaced populations and aid workers came to Cazenave and his team two years ago after countless trips bringing food and medicine to Iraq, Croatia, Albania, Macedonia and Kosovo. \"We realised that many humanitarian operations were not as successful as they could be because of a basic lack of communication between aid agencies,\" Cazenave says. \"We also saw that for people directly affected by disasters, the need for communication was almost as vital as food.\" </p> <p>TSF assembled a small team of telecommunication volunteers, and after a trial run of satellite telephony in Albania, decided to use Inmarsat satellite phones, which are the size of a laptop, easy to use and work everywhere in the world. They started with just one satellite phone in Macedonia in July 1999. Now they have about 20 - about half of them in Kosovo, where they work under the mandate of the UN High Commission for Refugees. In just one year, the charity has provided over 130,000 calls, enabling refugees to contact their families anywhere in the world, ask for aid, receive documents and find relatives scattered by war. </p> <p>But satellite communications are very expensive and the needs immense - nearly 26m people were uprooted from their homes by conflicts and disasters in 1998, according to UN estimates. Because of its limited budget, TSF has to be very selective about where to go, Cazenave says. </p> <p>The internet is another tool used by the international disaster relief community to exchange vital information and get aid to victims faster. \"It is vital for disaster relief organisations to co-ordinate their efforts and make more of their limited resources,\" says Paul Mylrea, editor of AlertNet, a free internet news and communications service for aid agencies, run by the Reuters Foundation, the educational and humanitarian arm of Reuters. \"AlertNet grew out of the fiasco in Rwanda where a large number of relief organisations went, but found it difficult to find what was needed. Many couldn't do much and had to leave.\" The service, launched two years ago, provides fast and accurate reports from Reuters journalists at the scene, complete with a comprehensive background of the situation and pictures and graphics of the area.</p> <p>\u0095 Telecoms San Frontieres website: <a href=\"http://tsfi@wanadoo.fr\">tsfi@wanadoo.fr</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org\">AlertNet</a></p>",

The following measures are doing real and lasting damage to the UK's competitiveness in the new e-business world: </p> <p>1. IR35 - this vindictive tax measure is driving UK IT consultants out of the country in droves. I myself start a contract in New Jersey in October, leaving the UK precisely because of IR35. My skills - distributed database systems and the integration of large databases with the web. </p> <p>2. NICs on share options - bad policy which is inhibiting investment by high tech. companies. Real examples - Veritas has halved its investment in the UK because of this measure and Cisco is rumoured to have diverted its investment plans to Eire for the same reason. </p> <p>3. RIP Bill - it is simply stupid for the UK Government to attempt to go it alone in internet regulation - far better to wait for international agreement. As a consequence of RIP, four UK based ISPs have threatened to move offshore. </p> <p>Mr Allen, I suggest you resign in protest at the Government making your job impossible.</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> rmarriott1 - as you can imagine I get more email about those three topics than almost anything else. </p> <p>Let me take the RIP Bill first. The Government has amended the law as it went through Parliament, in response to all the points that were made. That's the essence of our Parliamentary system. I don't believe the Act is a threat to e-commerce in the UK. The Home Office has made clear that the burden on ISPs will not be excessive and the Treasury has agreed to additional funding. And the provisions on keys have been modified to make it clear that what's wanted is plain text. We do need to make sure we have laws in place to deal with paedophiles, terrorists etc. </p> <p>I'll answer on share options and IR 35 in a moment.</p> <p><b> rmarriott1</b> Obviously we need to make sure we have laws in place to deal with paedophiles, terrorists etc. My point is that internet as a global phenomenon can only be regulated at the supra-national level. Either this should be done through GATT or the WTO, or through a new body set up for the purpose. The reason ISPs are threatening to leave the UK is not because of the cost, but because of the regulatory disadvantage UK only action places them in. </p> <p><b>RealAlien</b> Mr Allan, In your response to the question re: the RIP bill, the bill itself shows how out of touch the Govt. is with IT and the Internet in general. </p> <p>Even the US has said that the powers in the RIP bill are excessive. Taking as examples our European partners, France and others have relaxed their laws, while the UK has greatly increased, are they then wrong or being complacent? In the global market, companies can and are going to countries that are seen to be reducing regulatory burdens. Sadly, the UK is increasing while our EU partners and the rest of the world are reducing theirs. The powers are not needed, and anyone with knowledge of the Internet will know that paedophiles, terrorists and criminals will not be deterred or even caught by the additional powers. It is merely an amateur attempt to regulate. </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> rmarriott1 and RealAlien - Most other countries have or are planning provisions to require ISPs to enable emails to be intercepted: we are not alone on this. Witness the interest in the US in the FBI's use of the so-called Carnivore system to plug into ISPs and intercept email traffic. The Dutch have passed legislation on this in very similar terms to our own.</p> <p><b>JosephSW</b><br> Dear Alex, </p> <p>I run a small IT consultancy (I am not a disguised employee), and have a real opportunity to join a new e-Commerce company in this country. </p> <p>The new company has been approached by a thriving marketing company to act as its e-Commerce partner. However, because of the new IR35 measures my existing business will not be able to afford to fund the initial startup costs... the company profit is being taxed at 52% before it can be re-invested for growth. </p> <p>Is it clear to you now that IR35 is killing new e-Commerce ventures in Britain?</p> <p><b>jrharding</b><br></p> <p>Mr Allen The danger of a _genuine_ business falling foul of IR35 is real and the penalties are horrendous (personal bankruptcy and even imprisonment) How are _genuine_ small business's supposed thrive in this environment?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> I promised to come back on IR35 and share options, though don't expect easy solutions. </p> <p>On IR35, the Inland Revenue have made it clear that if someone meets the tests for self-employment, then they won't be affected. I know some contractor groups have sent in model contracts which seem to meet that test, though others seem to feel this won't help them. We'll have to monitor how that works out in practice. It's not a question of attacking entrepreneurship: there was some genuine abuse by people avoiding employees income tax and NICs by becoming contractors even though the reality was that they were in the same position as before. The difficult bit is stopping that without hitting people who have genuinely set up businesses.</p> <p> <b>AlexAllan1</b><br> On share options, the Treasury made some changes in the last Budget. In many circumstances we now have very similar effective rates of taxation to the US. But I know there are areas where firms feel the new rules still discourage firms from using share options as a way of giving all their employees a stake in the success of the company. Stephen Timms, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, led a review of this and I'm sure will want to monitor how the new arrangements are working.</p> <p><b>rmarriott1</b><br> Mr Allen, thank you for your response on the IR35 issue, but you must realise that this is a dog's breakfast of a tax change. If there were real abuses to be dealt with, proper and genuine consultation with representatives of the businesses affected could have framed workable regulations. IR35 is arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory. Affected businesses are left in a state of dire uncertainty since the IR in their wisdom will not vet contracts until they have been signed. If a contract is affected by IR35 it is impossible to action it profitably. Mr Allen, are you in any way independent, or do you have to slavishly endorse every silly thing the Government does?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> On IR35, I'll make sure the Treasury see the comments posted here, and will discuss with them the arrangements for monitoring the impact. </p> <p><b>Nsedgwick</b><br> Alex, I think the IR35 comments cannot be expressed loudly enough. The new IR35 legislation is causing huge uncertainty and doing real damage to entrepreneurial Web/e-commerce/IT businesses such as mine. The PCG now has over 11,000 members who stand opposed to these draconian measures. In reality the number of legitimate businesses damaged by IR35 is much greater.</p> <p>Something must be done and quickly! NS. </p> <p><b>SysOut</b><br> You have used the arguments of paedophiles and terrorists to interfere with our rights and our privacy - those are the arguments of dictators - it is totally unacceptable. </p> <p>Were you to do the same with people's post - people receiving letters with envelopes which had been opened, you know very well what the reaction would be. </p> <p>This is immoral and disgusting - until now the speciality of police states. </p> <p>The fact that others (usa) do it, does not make it right or better - where is the moral backbone we expect? </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Sysout - I'm sure I won't convince you, but the law for some time **has** allowed the police or other agencies to get a warrant to intercept letters or phone calls. They can only do this when they have evidence that someone is engaged in crimes such as I mentioned. What the RIP Act does is extend this to other forms of communication.</p> <p><b>SysOut</b><br> Thanks Alex for your answer - I will remain, as I hope others will, vigilant of government activity in matters of data protection and privacy.. </p> <p><b>ALargeElk</b> A quick flick through http://www.parliament.uk shows that less than half of MPs can be contacted by email and only about 80 have their own homepages. Do you feel that 'to improve the democratic process', educating those at the top would be a good place to start?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> ALargeElk asked about MPs email addresses and home pages. I have had discussions with the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology and with the Hansard Society about this. They are keen to encourage more MPs to use the internet and are looking at ways to help them get online. Many MPs are interested but worried about how they would handle what they fear could be a flood of email. There is quite a lot that can be done to make handling emails easier, so I hope we will start to see more MPs publishing their email addresses. I was in Rutland yesterday and the (admittedly small!) Council told me that every one of them published email addresses on their web site.</p> <p><b>dsi</b><br> What do think about using the internet as a tool for those with disabilities, enabling them to get access to information they might not otherwise be able to get?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> dsi - there's certainly a lot that can be and is being done to help people with disabilities take advantage of all the opportunities offered by the internet. The Government's web site guidelines have been drawn up in consultation with the RNIB and others so as to make sure that Government sites are as accessible as possible to everyone. </p> <p>It's a great tool for communication, as you say.</p> <p><b>fmk</b><br> alex - do you believe your task is being needlessly undermined by daft reporting of minor security hitches which, if they happened in the real world, wouldn't merit a para in your local paper, but because they happen in the e-world, they are front page news (ref barclays this week)?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> fmk - I agree that far too much is made of some of these incidents, and it does all serve to make people fearful of doing transactions online. Clearly, firms need to have proper security procedures in place so that people can be confident their personal data won't be misused. But it's far more dangerous giving your credit card to a waiter in Soho than dealing with a reputable web site using SSL for example. </p> <p><b>Paulos</b><br> How and by when will the voting process change for the electorate. If not via the internet, is there not scope for voting via the national lottery terminals - it strikes me that apathy at the ballot box could be re-addressed in this day and age. What are you recommending to your boss? </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Paulos - I agree we need to think imaginatively about how we can make voting easier, so that more people will participate. I was in Australia for their last election, and they have compulsory voting. I don't see that going down well here, but what was striking was the way they made voting so much easier - people could vote anywhere in their State rather than just at a single polling station. Various experiments were made during the recent local elections here and we need to analyse what worked best. There' quite a lot more to do - a rolling electoral register where you can change your registration details online is one example of a service I believe would make things easier.</p> <p><b>meethoss</b><br> At this moment in time, it is very expensive to hire a company to bring E-Commerce in to your site, and very complicated to set it up yourself. Will you be providing any sort of solution to this? </p> <p>E-Commerce is a vital part of trading and many companies are not taking advantage of it due to the complications, expenses and lack of knowledge on the subject. </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> meethoss - it needn't be that expensive for small firms to add e-commerce to their sites. I guess I'd better not endorse individual companies, but I visited a firm in Yorkshire recently who had a really easy system for setting up and hosting e-commerce sites at a reasonable price. Local Business Links should be able to provide advice on what firms in any region are doing that.</p> <p><b>meethoss</b><br> In regard to your statement about voting on-line, I would like to point out the fact that the Internet is not the safest environment and is susceptible to attacks from \"crackers\" from all over the World. How would you ensure that the election was totally secure and that it could not be changed to influence votes for certain parties?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> meethoss - we'd clearly need to make absolutely sure about the security of online voting before we enabled that. I believe the technologies are or will be there, but they also need to command public acceptance. The Electoral Commission would need to be closely involved to rule out any possibility of fraud or manipulation.</p> <p><b>jrharding</b><br> Mr Allen </p> <p>Do you feel that the government is depending far too much on large consultancies for advice on IT. When its obvious they have vested interests in directing the government in directions which will be profitable for themselves?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> jrharding - we certainly want to make sure we get consultancy advice from a wide range of firms. The new Office of Government Commerce has a role to play in this. I'm very conscious of your point: a small consultancy firm recently explained to me that the bureaucracy and number of meetings involved in tendering for Government contracts made it impossible for them to afford to do so. We want to tap into innovative thinking in this area.</p> <p> <b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Thanks - I've got to sign off now. I've found it interesting and I'm sorry if I haven't been able to answer all the questions. </p> <p>You are welcome to email me on e-envoy@open.gov.uk - without interception!</p>",
  "<p>'London, UK, July 17 2000. Fifty hopeful broadband entrepreneurs aim to leave a central London hotel with projected deals worth between $1m and $10m...,\" puffs the press release from First Tuesday, the match-making club which new media types love to slate (but still be invited to, of course).</p> <p>Why should we care this time? Is it because broadband - the bandwidth technology which will enable video and film to be streamed down the phone line to our PCs and mobile phones - is the new path to profitability? The word that can throw the lifeline to floundering dot.coms and launch a flotilla of new start-ups in an otherwise suicidal market?</p> <p>Surely Channel 4's E-Millionaire Show, which culminated in a spectacular dot.bomb, was proof enough of what happens when an immature industry is over-hyped and sold to the public as lottery tickets? After its growing pains, the market has matured, as has, so we are told, First Tuesday which has announced a merger with Yazam, a first-stage investor, and is preparing for a relaunch in the autumn. </p> <p>So Thursday's event in the Park Lane Hotel was not the cattle market it used to be. The \"young pretenders\" have been put through two screening tests (only the top 10% to 15% of the 300 entrepreneurs who applied were chosen) and only half of the venture capital firms who registered have been invited. </p> <p>Lines of numbered tables are laid out with refreshments in the ballroom at which the hopefuls wait attentively for the VCs to sign their \"dance cards\". They have 10 minutes to entice their dates to a further meeting before the gong is sounded and everyone moves round one place. Almost civilised. \"Thank God. I was starting to feel too old for all of that networking stuff,\" confides David Phillips, 30-something CEO of music portal iCrunch. He is about to go into the third of his 10 pitches that day. </p> <p>After introducing his team, he launches into the routine. iCrunch, which aggregates and exploits digital music rights in the alternative European market, sees \"a natural extension from dance music to dance culture and being able to go deep and vertical in terms of the music and the lifestyle\", he explains. \"We then add value to it by bundling it with editorial, content and community.\"</p> <p>Phillips, a former AOL executive, is no web wannabe. Just 16 months old, iCrunch is working with 50 music labels, and has deals with HMV and EMusic. It is talking to \"everyone\" from telecoms companies to magazine publishers, including a major music channel with whom it is discussing \"a branded channel distribution deal\".</p> <p>The pitches are slick and seamless. Phillips disarms a question about competitors by comparing Peoplesound.com to the \"meat market\" of the early First Tuesdays. \"This is a more mature, filtered environment... We are getting in the new acts, breaking in the new talent.\"</p> <p>So where are the wannabes? Sometimes you can tell them by their overly-austere suits. DataKlick online marketing research's managing director, Lisanne Davie - aged 23, with punk red hair and a chin stud but tucked into a smart outfit - and her portly director of strategy, David Liley, could fit the description. Davie approached Liley with her idea nine months ago when he was running a web design agency and she was a junior telemarketing officer. He gave up his job to join her.</p> <p>DataKlick, however, is a serious contender. Its vision for making market research \"fun\" for its \"cohort of willing consumers\" is by paying them to take part in market research surveys (from 50p to \u00a33 for a few minutes) and using broadband multimedia streaming. Their company's competitive edge, they maintain, is that it is 20% cheaper than its rivals and can get results within two hours. The second VC they met today offered to write a cheque out for several million if they fulfilled certain criteria which they believe they can meet within six months. Flushed with excitement, they don't want to count their chickens but at this rate they could be floating in 18 months. </p> <p>By far the wackiest pitch was IndiaGeek.com, a broadband channel which according to a co-founder, Farrukh Dhondy, will provide \"satirical and innovative\" programming for the Indian diaspora. Dhondy, a columnist on the Asian Age and former Channel 4 commissioning editor, formed AMI Net last year with Shekhar Kapur, director of Bandit Queen and Elizabeth, and the CEO, Mohan Chopra, backed by money from \"friends and fools\". It has offices in London and Delhi. </p> <p>\"We are building for the day when the computer becomes the TV screen. Whatever John Birt says, the TV is never going to run successful interactive shows,\" says Dhondy. Despite the postmodern name, IndiaGeek claims to be coming up from grassroots. \"There's a new consciousness. Indians are obsessed with Bollywood and yet only one in 100 films succeeds - people are looking for something new.\" The web channel will stream short films, animations, drama, comedy and \"tasteful erotica\". \"Nothing is sacred. We're going to slaughter a lot of holy cows. We are going to do revelations, to take the cover off: corruption, cruelty, slavery, oppression, wife-burning - give India its first burst of investigative and observational documentary films.\" Free from government censorship, IndiaGeek can go where the Asian networks fear to tread.</p> <p>Dhondy believes they have no competition, \"because no one knows what to do with broadband. They see it as a dumping ground for Bollywood films or old TV shows. They are not exploiting the grammar of the net.\"</p> <p>IndiaGeek is hoping to close a deal for $3m in the next few months for a spring launch. From an investors' perspective, too, the day has been fruitful. \"I've seen six companies,\" says Thomas Kenney, of Nokia Ventures, who is over from the US to \"check out the cool technologies, applications, services for 3G mobile internet - investing at an early stage\". He has arranged second meetings with four start-ups. Kenney is \"surprised\" by the 2% brokerage fee that First Tuesday has introduced. \"In the States, if a VC agency asked for that it would be 'get outa here!'.\" But in Europe, he concedes, it is a different market. </p> <p>At the end of the day, no one is exactly walking out with a deal. If they performed well, they have a handful of business cards and invitations to meet up. The next generation of net entrepreneurs crawls into the lobby, exhausted, with their mobile phones beeping, but encouraged that when it comes to broadband a bit of the old dot.com fever still exists.</p>",
  "<b>So the police are having trouble hiring?</b> <br> Police numbers are falling - down by 1,678 last year - causing a double-headed problem for home secretary Jack Straw. First, he has promised repeatedly that police numbers would rise; instead the number of officers has slipped from 127,158 in England and Wales in April 1997, to 124,418 today. Second, levels of politically sensitive types of crime, such as violent crime, are rising sharply. So the decline in police numbers has become a political hot potato. <p><b>Why are numbers falling? </b><br> For all sorts of reasons. One factor is the devolved structure of Britain's police forces. By law the home secretary cannot determine the number of officers each force employs and some chief constables have chosen to spend any spare cash on new technology rather than extra manpower. Another cause has been a squeeze on police budgets - until recently some forces have had to sack officers rather than recruit them. This problem was partly solved by the comprehensive spending review, which provided extra funds for recruitment. But the most significant cause of the problem seems to be the fact that people simply aren't as keen to join the police as they once were.</p> <p><b>Why is this? </b><br> Money has something to do with it - police salaries have not kept pace with private-sector ones, particularly in the south-east, where the recruitment crisis is at its most serious. Officers can no longer afford to live in some of the areas they police. The reputation of the police has taken a knock, too - partly as a result of the report into the Stephen Lawrence affair and revelations about police corruption, but also through the way the police are portrayed on television. Ministers complain that programmes such as The Bill are simplistic and misleading.</p> <p><b>So what are they doing about it? </b><br> Launching an advertising campaign, for one thing, under the title Could You? Police. These are designed to show police officers as heroic public servants rather than dubious stick-wielders. The TV ads feature real-life heroes such as Falklands veteran Simon Weston and footballer John Barnes describing how despite their own success, they still admire the work done by the police. </p> <p><b>But the army's had ads for years. Are they really the answer? </b><br> Probably not - but they make it clear that the government has recognised the problem. The real solution probably lies in spending more money. Already the allowance given to officers working in London has been increased, leading to a 28% increase in applications to the Metropolitan police. The home secretary has also set aside cash to recruit 9,000 new officers across England.</p> <p><b>And that if that doesn't work? </b><br> It's been suggested that the police might recruit the next generation of bobbies from abroad - leading to a rash of speculation about a culture clash between unarmed British officers and their gun-toting European colleagues. In fact the police would only be adopting a practice which has long helped staff other public-service professions, such as medicine, and there seems to be little chance that the streets will be filled with French flics anytime soon.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police_rec/recruit/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Home Office: police recruitment virtual tour</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/new_indexs/index_police-resource.htm\" target=\"_new\">Home Office: police resources</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The Metropolitan police service</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,361105,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Straw may recruit abroad to boost police ranks</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/0,2759,339240,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Special report: policing crime</a></p>",

The Accelerator investors own poster sites, TV channels, radio and press operations.</p> <p>Mr McDanell said the market for fledgling new media and technology companies had reached sensible levels after the mania of last year and the first three months of 2000.</p> <p>\"There is still the potential for high returns, although not necessarily of the fantastic kind we were looking at the start of the year.</p> <p>\"This is a realistic time to invest,\" he said.</p> <p>\"People are not asking for crazy money in return for a small percentage in their company, and the whole approach to business has become more mature.\"</p> <p>The Accelerator fund will target both business to business and the less fashionable business to consumer markets but will require some demonstrable revenues streams before investing.</p> <p>Channel 5 announced its own plans at the start of the year to offer equity for publicity, accepting stakes in internet start-ups as a payment for promotion.</p> <p>Neither is the idea limited to media concerns.

  "William Hague today challenged the government to bring forward a bill to speed up the \"politically correct\" adoption process - or face one devised by his own party. <p>Speaking in Gravesend, Kent, the Conservative party leader said adoption must be made easier for childless couples. He argued that for too long youngsters in care had been let down by government, in homes and through a lack of education. </p> <p>Mr Hague told the Catholic Children's Society's familymakers section - which prepares traumatised children for adoption or for long-term fostering - how he would make adoption easier for childless couples. </p> <p>He said it was wrong that children in care sometimes had to wait three years before they could be adopted, despite there being a long list of responsible, stable, loving families who would take them on. </p> <p>\"Conservatives want to make sure that the first consideration in adoption cases is the protection of children's interests at the heart of loving families,\" he said. \"We want to tear up the politically correct rulebook that exploits children for the sake of an irrelevant social agenda. We need to act now for the sake of our children's future.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I am calling on the government to bring forward its own proposal for an adoption bill in the coming session of parliament. If they do not, the Conservative party will bring forward our own legislation by backing a private member's bill incorporating our proposals.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague said it was a \"shame on all of us\" that a quarter of the prison population was made up of people who had been in care. \"We let children down when we send three quarters of children in care into the world with no educational qualifications,\" he said.</p> <p>A document outlining the Conservatives' strategy described as a \"scandal\" the three years it can take for an adoption to go through. </p> <p>Every child in care for 12 months should have an adoption plan and youngsters should have access to charities, church organisations or another family. The Conservatives would also separate local authorities' ownership of care homes from their social services responsibilities. </p> <p>And they would abolish the government's home detention curfew scheme, preventing child sex offenders from being released into the community before they have served their sentences. The use of mandatory life sentences for first and second-time sex offenders would be increased. </p> <p>The government had said \"many of the right things\" on these issues, Mr Hague said, but it was letting young people down by failing to act now. </p> <p>But Mr Hague admitted that the Tories' much heralded \"tax guarantee\", the promise to reduce taxes as a proportion of national income, would not be featured in the party's draft manifesto. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said the Tories could not be trusted. \"Whatever guarantees William Hague tries to run away from this autumn, he can't run away from the fact that the Tories remain committed to cutting \u00a316bn worth of British public services,\" he said.</p> <p>Mocking Mr Hague's recent claims that he had once drunk 14 pints of beer a day, Mr Prescott said: \"As Billy the Fizz tries to recover from his 14-pint summer hangover, people will remember that you can't trust the Tories.\"</p>",

  "China has confiscated thousands of copies of a book containing a photograph of the Dalai Lama, in a fresh display of Beijing's hyper-sensitivity towards the exiled Tibetan leader. <p>Chinese customs officials confiscated 16,000 copies of The Clinton Years, which was printed in Hong Kong but had been sent for binding in southern China. </p> <p>A sharp-eyed official noticed that one of the 227 photographs showed Mr Clinton clasping hands with the Dalai Lama and ordered the book to be impounded. </p> <p>A photograph in the same book of China's president Jiang Zemin presenting Mr Clinton with a volume on the history of Tibet - as viewed by Beijing - did not redeem the offence. </p> <p>A first printing of 8,000 copies shipped to the US publisher Callaway Editions had previously escaped attention. The publisher was told by the Chinese embassy in Washington that it was China's \"consistent policy\" to control \"the political content of printed materials\" if they were printed on Chinese soil. </p> <p>The ban coincides with the exclusion of the Dalai Lama from next week's Millennium World Peace Summit of religious and spiritual leadersis being held in New York under UN auspices. China exerted strong pressure on the UN secretary-general to persuade the organisers to rescind their invitation to the Dalai Lama. </p> <p>However, a controversial visit to a parliamentary leaders' conference in New York by China's Premier, Li Peng, has gone ahead, despite protests by relatives of those killed or wounded in the 1989 Beijing massacre that he was responsible for their deaths. </p> <p>Callaway Editions says that Chinese customs has intercepted a second book on Himalayan art that contains an article by a known supporter of Tibetan independence. </p> <p>China has moved from a brief political \"thaw\" two years ago, when liberal arguments could be aired and published, to clamp down on a number of domestic publications.</p>",
  "Foreigners could be on the police beat as the Home Office considers plans to recruit abroad as part of a government drive to fill 9,000 extra places. <p>Only citizens of the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the Commonwealth are currently allowed to join the police and the move would need new legislation, which is being mulled over by the home secretary, Jack Straw.</p> <p>The proposal to enlist officers from outside the UK comes as the government launches Britain's first ever national police recruitment campaign devised with the help of M&amp;C Saatchi. The \"Could You? Police\" campaign will run over three years and is being backed by a number of celebrities, including Simon Weston, John Barnes and Patsy Palmer. </p> <p>Advertisements will run on national TV, newspapers, radio and in cinemas to provide forces in England and Wales with high-quality recruits to help them fill the 9,000 extra police places being offered over the next three years.</p> <p>Since the 1997 general election, the number of police officers has dropped from 127,158 to 124,418. Throughout the 43 forces, 5,391 officers joined in 1998-99, but 6,104 left, a net loss of 713. </p> <p>The Metropolitan police have been the worst hit, and in a bid to stem the exodus Met officers are now paid around \u00a36,000 a year more than elsewhere, a fact that rankles home counties forces. </p> <p>Essex police have resorted to TV advertising during breaks in programmes like The Bill and Prime Suspect 5 to attract viewers interested in law and order. </p> <p>Mr Straw said the two main purposes of the advertising campaign were to improve the numbers and calibre of those seeking to join the police and to emphasise the importance of what was involved in being an officer. </p> <p>\"We need a modern, extremely capable and highly regarded police service,\" Mr Straw said. \"That is why we are attaching so much importance to the new police recruitment campaign. It is vital that our forces attract the highest quality recruits to continue the fight against crime in the years ahead.\"</p> <p>A total of \u00a3667m has been earmarked for the recruitment drive, but police forces have been told by the Home Office they will only get cash for new recruits if they meet crime targets and the requirement for more Asian and black officers. Police forces have been told to employ an extra 8,000 officers from the ethnic communities by 2009. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, was sceptical about the latest effort to boost police numbers, claiming that the government had failed to fulfil past promises to raise police numbers. </p> <p>\"I have heard it all before. Jack Straw exactly a year ago said he was going to recruit another 5,000 officers,\" she said. \"Since then what has happened is that the police force had declined even further.\"</p> <p>Ms Widdecombe suggested that one of the reasons why people left the police force early was because the job often did not live up to their expectations, with officers being required to undertake inappropriate chores, such as escorting wide loads on the roads.</p> <p>But the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, welcomed the recruitment drive:\"Extra money from Labour for more police officers is better three and a half years late than never. We need to recruit many more full-time, part-time and special police officers. And we should now consider also giving financial incentives to encourage people to make policing their career.\"</p>",
  "<p>The official Sydney Games website may be fined for violating anti-discrimination laws, after a blind fan was unable to retrieve Olympic information from the site. </p> <p>Australia's human rights and equal opportunities commission said <a href=\"http://www.olympics.com\">www.olympics.com</a> had discriminated against Bruce Maguire, 42, who has been blind since birth, in failing to conform to internationally recognised standards which enable the blind to navigate the web. </p> <p>In a stinging 23-page verdict, the discrimination inquiry commissioner William Carter found that the Sydney organising committee for the Olympic Games (Socog), which is responsible for the site, had broken the law. He warned that it faced a fine and a compensation award if it did not upgrade its site before the Games begin on September 15. </p> <p>But Socog remains adamant that a revamp of the site to be completely user-friendly for the blind is not possible. Its lawyers pleaded \"unjustifiable hardship\", claiming the changes would cost A$2m (\u00a3780,000) and would take one employee 365 days to implement, although another estimate put the figure at \u00a315,500. \"IBM's advice to us is that it's not feasible to meet Mr Maguire's demands,\" said a spokesperson. </p> <p>The case is an embarrassment for the Olympic sponsor IBM, which built the site and sponsors the world wide web content-accessibility guidelines. </p> <p>Maguire said Socog's behaviour was \"outrageous\" and it had showed contempt for blind people and for the commission. The site's key failing is the absence in many areas of \"alt\" tags, text descriptions of maps and images which can be converted into braille.</p>",
  "Stephan K\u00f6rner, the Czech-born professor emeritus of philosophy at Bristol and Yale universities and fellow of the Royal Society, has died aged 86. Over a period of 35 years and in 14 books, he made a sustained and major contribution to the theory of how our belief systems relate both to one another and to everyday experience and practice. His best-known work is on Kant, known as a minor classic and still read by students. <p>Born in Ostrava, in what is now the Czech Republic, Stephan K\u00f6rner received a doctorate in law from Charles University in Prague, practised law briefly, and served in the Czech cavalry before coming to England as a refugee in 1939. He took a doctorate in philosophy at Cambridge University, where he studied under Richard Braithwaite, and attended Wittgenstein's famous classes. After taking his doctorate, he fought in France. </p> <p>He joined the philosophy department at Bristol in 1946 and was appointed professor and head of department in 1952. Then, in 1955, he published two quite different books: Conceptual Thinking, written for specialists, and Kant, one of the first post-war books to attempt to make the ideas of that difficult philosopher accessible to English-speaking students. In 1957, he edited a highly significant volume, Observation and Interpretation, arising from a conference in Bristol which had brought together many leading physicists and philosophers of science. </p> <p>The activity of this period foreshadows much of his subsequent work. The central topic of Conceptual Thinking (1955) is of great importance, and K\u00f6rner's treatment of that topic was in advance of its time. He draws a fundamental distinction between exact and inexact concepts. Exact concepts, such as the mathematical concept of a triangle, have \"sharp boundaries\"; inexact concepts, in contrast, always have \"borderline cases\", and are typically exemplified by concepts applying to sense experience (concepts like red or tree) and legal concepts (conspiracy or fraud). But although such concepts are \"inexact\" in this precise sense, that does not mean that we need abandon the attempt to be clear and precise in our reasoning about them. </p> <p>K\u00f6rner's preoccupation with the articulation of our system of concepts led him in his book on Kant to emphasise those features of Kant's project that were directly related to his own. In particular, he saw the centre of Kant's philosophy to be his attempt to derive the possibility of intelligible experience from \"built in\" features of our conceptual system. </p> <p>But K\u00f6rner's central objection to Kant's metaphysics was that Kant held there to be only one conceptual framework for the rational understanding of experience, whereas K\u00f6rner held that, in fact, there can be a number of competing conceptual frameworks. </p> <p>Very much the same issues provide the central theme of his textbook on the Philosophy of Mathematics, which focuses on the metaphysical question of how applied mathematics is possible. For K\u00f6rner, the exact concepts of pure mathematics arise from the idealisation of those inexact concepts which can be applied to experience. Thus using a stretched string to draw a circle leads to the definition of the ideal Euclidian circle which, of course, can't be drawn exactly. Once we are safely within the ideal world of pure mathematics we can travel wherever exact reasoning leads us; the problem remains, however, why, when we drop back to the world of experience, our mathematical discoveries turn into correct predictions. </p> <p>To his students, K\u00f6rner made even the first steps in philosophy seem to be the most important. But he did not follow philosophical fashion, and this perhaps restricted his immediate influence. </p> <p>Stephan was a strikingly handsome man capable of displaying elaborate and formal Central European manners. But what is more to be recalled is the quality of his often droll humour, and his sweetness and generosity. His devotion to his wife, Ditti, was one of the most endearing things about him. They were both deeply committed to a clear-eyed view of life and death. They chose to die together. He is survived by their son and daughter. </p> <p> <b> Stephan K\u00f6rner, philosopher, born September 26 1913; died August 18 2000 </b></p>",
  "<p>Does correct spelling matter? Jane Austen never got her \"ie\" words sorted out (all her remaining manuscripts talk of \"Love and Freindship\"). In the few examples of his signature that we have, Shakespeare spells his own name differently each time. And Daniel Defoe was all over the place: \"equall\", \"goeing\" and \"Britton\" from one typical paragraph in a letter (even though he was writing to the prime minister of the day). The correspondence of many a famous author reveals that it has always been the task of the publisher's operative to get the spelling right. Even vice-president Dan Quayle famously misspelt potato while visiting a school in Trenton, New Jersey in 1982. Great minds think of higher matters. </p> <p>So anyone hostile to David Blunkett's latest directive about the importance of spelling has any number of precedents to prove that eloquence and expressiveness are not to be fettered to minute arrangements of letters. Many famous writers would have faltered in front of the list of 600 crucial words that the minister of education has just issued to secondary schools. (The list inescapably includes \"secondary\" itself). Blunkett's department has decreed that these words should be known by the end of the first year at secondary school. </p> <p>This looks like a symbolic statement, as well as an effort to have teenagers who can manage \"Wednesday\" and \"February\". In the recent past, attention to spelling has not seemed an important aspect of the teaching of English. Many university teachers can testify that it is possible for a student to have wobbly spelling and yet achieve A grades in English GCSEs and A-levels. Even more strikingly, such an intelligent bungler often has no idea that he or she is getting it wrong. It sometimes seems as if a series of English teachers have not wanted to quibble over the merely trivial errors of the cleverest pupil in the class. </p> <p>I remember this suspicion being confirmed when I was asked by a newspaper to look at the essays of a candidate who had just received an A in GCSE English literature and was attempting a supposedly \"harder\" O-level practical criticism exam from the 70s. In fact, to the paper's disappointment, she had no problem with the old-style exam. Her answers showed admirable literary sensitivity and employed an impressive vocabulary - definitely A grade. Yet they were also littered with spelling mistakes. </p> <p>This might be evidence for the arguments of the anti-pedants. There are indeed highly intelligent English students - articulate, widely read, responsive to literary language - who are poor spellers. Of course, if they do not discover this until university, the whole thing becomes rather embarrassing: \"Your grasp of Milton's prosody is excellent, but here is a list of your spelling mistakes.\" A few years ago the examiners of first-year exams in my department included in their postmortem report for students a list of the common spelling mistakes in that year's exam scripts. This was posted on the main noticeboard, as was usual for these reports. Although meant to be helpful, the effect was weirdly condescending. As if to say: \"You idiots - you can't even get these right - how laughable.\" The practice was abandoned. </p> <p>Those who will find Blunkett's comparable list a gross imposition on those learning to express themselves creatively, might point out that the use of correct spelling is a fairly recent invention. Before there were dictionaries, there were no correct spellings. Accurate modern editions of great works from before the mid-18th century will let you see this in a moment. It is a nice irony that academics actually campaign for modern paperback editions that do not \"correct\" the spelling (and punctuation) of the great names of English lit. It is one of a secondary-school teacher's usual quandaries, whether to use the version of Macbeth that has the right (but wrong) spellings, or the wrong (but right) ones. </p> <p>Spelling became a preoccupation of the educated only after the publication of Samuel Johnson's great Dictionary of the English Language in 1755. Even if the noble lexicographer sometimes chose arbitrarily between competing representations of the same word, his decisions became authoritative. The very fact of his book, expanded and amended by others, made the idea of correctness possible. This is why Becky Sharp, the rebellious anti-heroine of Thackeray's Vanity Fair, throws a copy of Johnson's dictionary out of the coach window as she leaves her young ladies' finishing school. Down with pedantry! Yet we later find out that when she needs to write begging letters, her spelling and grammar are unimpeachable. </p> <p>Why worry, so long as we know what someone means? There, sadly, is the rub, for error-strewn spelling still tends to give the impression that someone does not know what he or she means. An examiner needs a strong faith in creativity not to flinch from the confusions of \"there\", \"their\" and \"they're\" that afflict many a 15-year-old. Distinctions of meaning are often behind spelling difficulties. The most sophisticated spellcheck programmes cannot keep from coursework submissions the confusion between a thing being \"dependent\" on another, and a person being a \"dependant\"; or between a \"discreet\" person and a \"discrete\" object. </p> <p>Spelling reformers, the revolutionaries of the language world, would solve everything forever, matching letters to sounds and losing these distinctions. They would not worry that someone who writes \"impeckable\" (yes, it happens) fails to grasp something about the derivation of the word, from the Latin for \"sin\". Or that the very many English A-grade students who put \"playwrite\" miss a grammatical logic (how can someone be an anything-\"write\"?) and an old idea of authorship (a playwright being not an inspired genius, but a manufacturer, like a wheelwright or a shipwright). </p> <p>And when we come to truly common words - items like \"although\", \"remember\" and \"women\" - on the Blunkett list, getting them wrong inescapably signifies an incapacity to retain what you read. Caring about spelling does look like caring about words. So, outside the exam room, what matters is knowing when you might not know. </p> <p>I will never forget the letter I once received as an admissions tutor from a candidate wanting to study English. Wishing to vaunt an enthusiasm for the classics, it began with a kind of inverse aplomb: \"I am currantly reading the novels of Jane Austin.\" The writer had had all the time in the world to check his spelling, but he was in a hurry to make his pitch. In kamikaze spirit, he even began it, \"Dear Dr Mullen.\" </p> <p>John Mullan is lecturer in English at University College, London.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the scenario. At the conclusion of their annual shindig in Jackson Hole last week, the world's central bankers decided on a job swap. For the next year, Alan Greenspan would take up the reins at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt with the rest of the federal reserve board, while Wim Duisenberg and his colleagues at the ECB would take up residence in Washington. </p> <p>There is little doubt about what Mr Duisenberg would do faced with US inflation rising at 3.6% a year: he would put up rates in October whatever the consequences for the presidential election in November. But the more interesting question is what Mr Greenspan might do with the European economy if he were in the hot seat tomorrow. The markets are assuming that an ECB rate rise of 0.25 basis points is a certainty, with a half-point increase to bring Euroland inflation back under its 2% ceiling by no means ruled out. </p> <p>But the ECB has put itself in something of a bind. Higher interest rates are supposed to make the euro more attractive to investors by offering a higher rate of return, and this, in turn, should lead to lower inflation. If, after all the hawkish talk of the past few days, the ECB fails to raise rates, the euro will tumble. Yet, it may still tumble even if rates do go up, and the more rates are raised the further it may fall. Why? Because markets these days are less concerned about a currency's yield than about the prospects for growth that it offers. Dealers could easily conclude that higher European rates will choke off Europe's recovery, widening the growth deficit with the booming US economy. If that is the interpretation put on the ECB's decision, the euro will fall not rise, making Europe's alleged inflation problem even worse. This, indeed, seemed to be the way markets were heading yesterday when despite a concerted attempt to talk up the euro, the single currency fell below 90 cents against the dollar. </p> <p>So how would things stand were Mr Greenspan in charge? In the absence of a surge in European productivity to match that in the US, he might conclude that there is no alternative but to raise rates. But, in fact, Mr Greenspan's give-growth-a-chance strategy predated by several years any hard evidence of an improvement in US productivity growth. Were a similar line to be adopted tomorrow, there would be a short-term risk of the euro falling to a new record low. But over the medium term, the euro-dollar rate relies on the relative growth rates of Europe and the United States. Mr Greenspan seems to understand this. The question is: does Mr Duisenberg? </p> <p><strong> Gag exchange </strong><br> </p> <p> It was not wholly expected - participants in the battle for control of the great London Stock Exchange each turning up with a bag of gags. </p> <p>But that is what we got yesterday as Sweden's OM Gruppen, effectively a technology company which specialises in trading systems, tabled its unsolicited \u00a3808m takeover bid. </p> <p>First, we had the Swedes talking about saving the \"crown jewel\", which might be transformed into the future Microsoft of the UK with the right sort of visionary management. Then came the pooh-poohing from inside the exchange, claiming that all this technology is \"not state of the art, not difficult stuff\". </p> <p>In may not be, but if the London exchange had managed to do anything other than botch each and every systems project over the past 15 years its officials might not be in the pickle they are today - actively encouraging a \"white knight\" takeover by Frankfurt's Deutsche B\u00f6rse. </p> <p>What is clear is that we are witnessing the final act of so-called Wimbledonisation of the City. We invented the game, but now watch foreigners take all the trophies. </p> <p>The process has taken three centuries, most vividly illustrated over recent years by the steady capitulation of the City's great family-owned merchant banks which, having survived so many wars and plagues and scandals, finally succumbed to primarily American and German buyers. With capital having gone global, they just did not have the stomach for risk. </p> <p>These buyers, of course, now speak for a good portion of the ownership of the London exchange. And the big investment banks, as we now call them, simply want a market system that allows the most profitable (and global) clients to move in or out of equities with the minimum of fuss and at the lowest possible cost. </p> <p>Against this bloc vote are the small stockbrokers, many of them still British owned, who, in a straightforward sort of way, fear for their jobs. They just cannot understand why London is looking to give anything away while it continues to enjoy such a dominate role in equities across Europe - especially if the technology is such a cinch. </p> <p>The debate, and the education programme, have only just begun.</p>",
  "<p>Who believes that some people should not have access to services because of their sex, race, age or disability? Who believes that councils should not provide best value - highest quality at lowest costs? No one, I hear you say. So why aren't equal opportunities an integral part of every council's approach to meeting their new best value duties? </p> <p>Under best value legislation, councils must rethink what they provide and how, in consultation with their local communities. They must involve local residents, businesses, and people who use the services, in seeking out problems and solutions. These reviews provide an opportunity to tackle issues of equality and to devise services that better suit the requirements of all those who use and need council services. </p> <p>Research by the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) for local government and the Employers' Organisation suggests that relatively few councils are integrating equalities issues into their best value programmes and that the numbers don't seem to have increased significantly since last year. Far from being mainstream, there is a real concern that equality is being sidelined. </p> <p>Equality of opportunity is the only way to ensure access for all to a range of services, and councils are under moral as well as legal duties to develop additional or alternative services to meet the diversity of needs in the community. </p> <p>The good intentions of many councils, published in written statements, to incorporate equalities policies into their strategies and review guidelines, don't happen in practice. Too many councils fall down because effective action on equality is limited to specific services, such as leisure or caring for the elderly, and not taken on across the whole council or through all the stages of planning and design of future services. </p> <p>The 35 or so councils chosen by the government to pilot best value schemes have shown that real changes can be delivered. In Southampton and Northamptonshire, involving older people in reviews has led to new services. Camden and South Norfolk councils have increased the use of their leisure centres by traditionally disadvantaged groups. The city of Bradford involved young people and Asian women in their best value review to produce action plans to improve community safety and reduce fear of crime. </p> <p>Most councils are still at an early stage in their best value programmes. We should hope that a combination of their desire to do the right thing, and legislation and pressure from community groups will ensure that best value delivers service improvements for all. </p> <p>\u0095 Frances Carter is head of best value at IDeA.</p>",
  "Study a map of Sierra Leone and you might find it difficult to imagine that the Revolutionary United Front is losing its war. <p>Four months ago, the government's authority barely extended beyond the capital and the last means of escape, the international airport disturbingly far across the Sierra river. Beyond that, RUF rebels were largely in charge except in a few city enclaves vulnerable to attack. </p> <p>The rebels are no longer such a threat. Freetown is more secure than at any time for years, and the RUF's hopes of seizing power have been dashed. Their founder, Foday Sankoh, is in prison and his force is increasingly factionalised. The diamond mines that have funded its war will not be such an asset if an international agreement to permit only the sale of government-certified gems works as it should. </p> <p>But that does not mean the government's remit has been extended much further than Freetown and the other enclaves. Territory newly liberated by the British-backed Sierra Leone army has not so much fallen under government control as fallen into a new form of chaos where groups such as the West Side Boys, who abducted 11 British soldiers on Friday, are free to rob, rape and kill. </p> <p>This was not part of the British plan to galvanise the government, its army and the UN into confronting the RUF instead of backing down in the face of its attacks and breaches of last year's peace accords. </p> <p>The original intent was to build a single force using experienced troops from the old Sierra Leone military, militias such as the West Side Boys, and thousands of soldiers newly trained by the British. </p> <p>This new army was to be thrown into battle against the RUF while a strengthened UN peacekeeping force secured the captured territory and freed up Sierra Leone's army to continue advancing. The strategy had the added advantage of bringing the West Side Boys and other groups of young fighters, often high on drugs or drunk, under government command. </p> <p>To some extent, it has worked. The army is beginning to look like a credible force and has won several important battles against the rebels. The RUF is generally in retreat and its attacks in the west are not as frequent or sustained. Some of its soldiers have surrendered, others show a reluctance to keep up the fight. Above all, there is no real prospect of the rebels seizing power as there was in May when Britain sent more than 1,000 troops to defend Freetown. </p> <p>But neither the government nor the UN can offer even a reasonable guarantee of security more than about 30 miles beyond Freetown, even on the long, looping main road to the airport on which the West Side Boys seized the British troops. </p> <p>And while the West Side Boys are a relatively small and desperate militia, another private army is a much greater threat to security in what is claimed to be government territory. The civil defence force, more popularly known as the Kamajors, are a major force in southern cities such as Kenema and Bo where some residents describe them as imposing a reign of terror. They control large parts of the major highways south where young fighters regularly extort bribes, rape and sometimes murder those on the road. </p> <p>Like the West Side Boys, the Kamajors rely on copious amounts of alcohol and drugs to fight, and they believe that charms and mirrors ward off bullets. And like the West Side Boys, the Kamajors are supposed to have fallen under government command but remain a renegade force. </p> <p>Their leader, Sam Hinga Norman, who is also Sierra Leone's deputy defence minister, flew to Kenema a fortnight ago to tell his men to end their lawlessness. They took little notice. </p> <p>The situation will not be helped by the impact of diamond certification, as Kamajors, rebels and others mining the valuable gems try to unload their wares for fear of not being able to sell them in future. </p> <p>Part of the problem lies with the UN. While its peacekeepers are more willing to fight the RUF to defend certain towns, they remain essentially passive when it comes to ensuring the security of liberated areas. UN soldiers do not touch the Kamajors' roadblocks and do little to help the victims who are caught at them. </p> <p>One UN official said the abduction of the 11 British soldiers by the West Side Boys clearly demonstrated that \"it is a jungle out there and the idea that we can control things is completely wrong.\" </p> <p>That is a vacuum the RUF might just galvanise itself to step back into. To counter the threat, the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, wants to boost the peacekeeping force to 20,500 men. He told the security council on Friday that the RUF still poses a threat that \"should not be underestimated\". </p> <p>\"The RUF is believed to have a strength of several thousand fighters. It is relatively well-equipped and, in spite of divisions between some groups, maintains a relatively well established system of command and control,\" he said.</p>"
