  "<p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to define precisely what a football manager is for, apart from slagging off referees and doing Marcel Marceau impressions in his little rectangle of rage by the touchline. </p> <p>Surely Chelsea have blown the gaff in appointing not a manager to succeed Gianluca Vialli but a head coach. Even more than Vialli did, Claudio Ranieri will leave the management side of things to the board and the backroom staff. His job is simply to produce a team capable of getting Chelsea back on to the gravy train of the Champions League. </p> <p>At least Chelsea have reverted to giving the job someone with a wide knowledge of running football teams. Ruud Gullit and Vialli were excellent players but neither had experience of dealing with the contrasting, often polyglot personalities that make up the modern dressing room, and with both this proved a fateful flaw. </p> <p>As for league titles, whatever happens at Old Trafford this morning, Ranieri will doubtless realise eventually that the winning of championships is simply not in the genes of his new employers. </p> <p>Chelsea are the light opera of English football, always have been and always will be. Giving a seriously qualified Italian the job is akin to making Beniamino Gigli the lead tenor in the Gondoliers. For Chelsea Village read the town of Titipu. </p> <p>Never mind, it should be fun while it lasts. And at least Ranieri knows his place in the Stamford Bridge scheme of things. Elsewhere the roles of the men who are still called \"manager\" are becoming confused. </p> <p>At an increasing number of clubs, the manager may pick the team but the plc calls the real tune. His position in the transfer market, already weakened by the Bosman ruling, is now threatened by the possibility that, if the European Commission gets its way, the transfer system may soon disappear altogether. </p> <p>Increasingly those clandestine meetings with prospective signings in Post Houses just off the M6 belong to a vanished age. Agreeing to buy a player for a certain fee has become little more than a declaration of intent. Negotiating a player's salary and bonuses, with agents, chief executives, wives, fathers and mothers-in-law all having their say is when the business really begins. </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is the most successful manager in modern British football, one of the nearest things the game still has to a manager in the old sense. In team matters, Fergie's writ runs large through the corridors of Old Trafford just as Sir Matt Busby's once did. </p> <p>He has a presence even when he is not present, like Brian Clough at Derby County and Nottingham Forest, Bill Shankly at Liverpool, Don Revie at Leeds United, Bill Nicholson at Tottenham and Stan Cullis at Wolves. Yet even Ferguson's powers are limited on the business side of things and he cannot sign whom he likes when he likes for as much as he likes. </p> <p>The old-time managerial figures are gradually fading away. Ron Atkinson talks much sense about football in the media and John Bond is always good for a word or two about the game but it is 20 years since this pair were archetypical, larger-than-life figures strutting their stuff at the Manchesters United and City. </p> <p>How many modern football managers are really managers by the old definition? Few if any. </p> <p>Herbert Chapman, who brought honours and glory to Arsenal in the early 30s, was an impresario; more of a showman than a football technician. At that time clubs tended to have secretary-managers, men responsible for the paper work as well as pinning up the weekly team sheet. Alf Ramsey was among the last of these before he left Ipswich to become England manager in 1962. </p> <p>The last time managers held maximum power over their players was in the days of the retain-and-transfer system when at the end of each season clubs would publish a list of those they wished to keep and those who were to be let go. </p> <p>It was an antiquated and iniquitous practice which allowed Charlie Mitten, then the manager of Newcastle United, to describe George Eastham as having \"long pockets and short arms\" when the player refused to re-sign at St James' Park because he wanted to join Arsenal. </p> <p>Eastham and his case are a crucial part of the players' struggle to win freedom of contract and work for whom they please. The managers, however, are now threatened with a situation likely to rob them of the last vestiges of the control over team-building which they once had. </p> <p>Already subject to the whims, fancies and migratory habits of a growing army of players of assorted nationalities, the manager has become a cog in the machine rather than the man who presses the button. </p> <p>His type may still exist in the personalities of managers such as Ferguson, Jim Smith at Derby, George Graham at Tottenham and Harry Redknapp at West Ham. But the future lies with the super-coaches - Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, G\u00e9rard Houllier, Peter Taylor and Glenn Hoddle - and the gentle days when a Tony Waddington could scrounge around for good players just past their peak and sign them up to give Stoke City a team worth watching are long gone. </p> <p>Then again, looking at all the thirtysomethings Ranieri has at Chelsea, maybe not.</p>",
  "The appeal court's judgment, paving the way for the separation of the conjoined twins Mary and Jodie, makes new law in ruling that doctors may kill one child to save the other without falling foul of the criminal law. <p>But it should allay the fears of the anti-euthanasia lobby that a ruling in favour of separating the twins would give doctors free rein to end life. </p> <p>The judges have expressly limited it to cases where X cannot be saved without killing Y, where Y, by continuing to exist, would inevitably kill X, and where X is capable of an independent life but Y is not, whatever the medical intervention. </p> <p>In short, the ruling covers twins such as Mary and Jodie but no other type of case. </p> <p>The three judges were faced with what may be the most difficult conundrum of their careers. Both twins would die without an operation; with an operation Jodie could be saved, though Mary would die. </p> <p>The law forbids the sacrifice of an innocent life to save another. So how could the operation take place? </p> <p>It was never an option, as some medical ethicists argued, to leave it to the parents. Yesterday a court in Northern Ireland intervened to order a blood transfusion for a 15-year-old girl undergoing a transplant after she and her father refused it. Doctors cannot operate without parental consent, but parental refusal is not always the last word in law - as an adult's refusal would be. </p> <p>If parents refuse and doctors believe an operation is in a child's best interests, they ask the court to decide and the court cannot shirk its task. </p> <p>The Children Act, under which the case was brought, makes the interests of the child paramount. But what if there are two children whose interests conflict? In such cases, the court has to strike a balance. </p> <p>Mary would die anyway, but Jodie could survive with normal intelligence and a reasonable quality of life. She will need some reconstructive surgery and further operations in her early years but doctors believe she may eventually be able to walk unaided. The balancing exercise required the operation on Mary to go ahead. </p> <p>But would the criminal law allow it? Could there be a justification which would sanction what is essentially murder: taking one life to save another? </p> <p>The only pronouncement lawyers could find came in the dissenting judgment of Justice Bertha Wilson, in a Canadian supreme court drug importation case in 1984. She said: \"Where necessity is invoked as a justification for violation of the law, the justification must, in my view, be restricted to situations where the accused's act constitutes the discharge of a duty recognised by law. </p> <p>\"The rule of proportionality is central to the evaluation of a justification premised on two conflicting duties, since the defence rests on the rightfulness of the accused's choice of one over the other.\" </p> <p>In this case the doctors had conflicting duties to both twins but Mary was \"designated to die\" no matter what. In the Canadian case, however, Justice Wilson went on to say that necessity could not justify an act of homicide. </p> <p>\"It seems to me the law must allow an escape through choosing the lesser of the two evils,\" said Lord Justice Ward. The law did not allow an innocent person's death to be caused by act or omission. But Mary, while legally innocent, was harming Jodie by \"draining her lifeblood\". If she could speak, Jodie might have told her twin: \"Stop it, Mary, you're killing me.\" </p> <p>It was as if a six-year-old boy, also legally innocent because he would be below the age of criminal responsibility, started indiscriminately shooting in the playground, he said. </p> <p>Lord Justice Ward had no doubt that it would be lawful to kill him in defence of the others. He could see no difference between that scenario and the one in which doctors in effect exercised self-defence on behalf of Jodie in separating her from Mary. </p> <p>\"The availability of a plea of quasi self-defence, modified to meet the quite exceptional circumstances nature has inflicted on the twins, makes intervention by doctors lawful.\" </p> <p>Lord Justice Brooke, in an exhaustive review of the criminal law, looked at the case of the two marooned sailors who were convicted of murder for killing and eating their cabin boy. Doing so had kept them alive long enough to be rescued; otherwise they would have died too. But the court ruled this was not enough to exonerate them. </p> <p>The twins' case was not so clear-cut, said Lord Justice Brooke. The defence of necessity would protect doctors if the act was needed to avoid inevitable to and irreparable evil, no more was done than was reasonably necessary for the purpose, and the evil inflicted was not disproportionate to the evil avoided. All these requirements were satisfied in this case. </p> <p>Lord Justice Robert Walker acknowledged that whatever light earlier cases could shine on their dilemma, \"in truth there is no helpful analogy or parallel to the situation which the court has to consider in this case\". It is \"unprecedented and paradoxical\" in that each twin had the right to life, but Mary's dependence on Jodie would lead to both twins' death. The operation would not be unlawful because while Mary's death was not the purpose or intention of the surgery. \"She would die because tragically her body, on its own, is not and never has been viable.\" </p> <p>Doctors have operated on conjoined twins in the past, including pairs where one twin was doomed to die, but the thought that they might be accused of murder presumably never occurred to them. </p> <p>The appeal court has extended the common law slightly to cover circumstances never before been canvassed in court. But making new law to deal with unforeseen circumstances is part of the job of the higher courts. </p> <p> <b>Leading figures in appeal hearing</b></p> <p> <b> Jodie</b> </p> <p>A \"bright, alert baby\" whom doctors believe will be able to lead a \"relatively normal\" life if separated. There is concern that she has not grown as quickly as she should because Mary is taking nourishment from her. If no operation took place, she would eventually die as her heart is beating for both children and cannot support such pressure indefinitely. </p> <p><b> Mary</b> </p> <p>Lives only because of her physical attachment to Jodie. Has severe brain damage. Without an operation, she would die when Jodie's heart gave out. Counsel for her argue that she has as much right to life as her sister and there is no proof that she is suffering. </p> <p><b> Parents</b> </p> <p>Cite their Catholic views as reason for not giving permission for the operation. \"We cannot begin to accept or contemplate that one of our children should die to enable the other one to survive. That is not God's will.\" </p> <p><b> The doctors</b> </p> <p>Have reached the conclusion that it is better to save one life rather than lose two children. If the twins deteriorate they will not be able to operate because of legal proceedings. </p> <p><b> Catholic church</b> </p> <p>Believes permission for an operation will enshrine in law the \"dangerous\" principle that it is permissible to carry out a wrong act in order to accomplish ultimate good. Archbishop of Westminster made a submission to the court - though not asked to do so by the parents. </p> <p><b> ProLife Alliance</b> </p> <p>Granted leave to make its submissions to the court. Agreed with the parents that the operation should not go ahead. Supports an offer from an Italian archbishop of a \"safe haven\" for the twins and their parents. </p> <p><b> Attorney general</b> </p> <p>QC appeared for the attorney general to argue the criminal law aspects of the case. Concluded that the doctors do not stand to be convicted of murder or manslaughter for carrying out the operation. </p> <p><b> The judges</b> </p> <p>Two admitted they were losing sleep over the case. Arriving at court yesterday, Lord Justice Ward described the case as \"excruciatingly difficult\". </p> <p> <b>Conjoined twins information sites:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm\" target=\"_new\">Twinstuff.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com\" target=\"_new\">Conjoined twins</a></p>",
  "The following is an extract from Lord Justice Ward's summary. Lord Justice Brooke and Lord Robert Walker agreed. <p> The unique and the crucial feature of the case is that the twins share a common aorta. That enables Jodie's heart to pump the blood she oxygenates through Mary's body as Mary's heart and lungs have no capacity to sustain life. She would have died probably in the womb but certainly at birth but for the life-sustaining support she received from her sister. </p> <p>The sad fact is that she lives on borrowed time, all of it borrowed from her sister. She is incapable of independent existence. She is designated for death. </p> <p>Doing the work for two imposes a terrible strain on Jodie's heart. It is common ground that her heart will fail and she will suffer a cardiac arrest. She is not expected to live more than three to six months, or perhaps a little longer. Mary's death will inevitably follow hers. </p> <p>It is not in dispute that the twins can be separated without significant risk to Jodie. That will leave Jodie living a more or less normal life, not without its problems, of course, and no one will shoulder the burden of those difficulties more than these devoted parents, especially as the facilities at home do not match the services they can enjoy here. </p> <p>The separation will result in certain death for Mary within minutes of the common aorta being severed. Thus in deciding whether or not to consent to this operation the parents have had to confront the cruel reality that surgery will save Jodie but it will kill Mary. They could not bring themselves to give that consent because their girls are equal in their eyes and in their love. They sincerely believe that it was God's will that they be born with the afflictions they have and that they should be left to live their lives joined together as they are for so long as God in his mercy shall ordain it. </p> <p>The hospital, on the other hand, could not in conscience suffer a life to be lost and, although they were fully entitled to submit to the parents' wishes, they are every bit as entitled to invite the court to decide that critical question of life and death. That is what a court is for. </p> <p>The case has raised acute moral and ethical questions and those principles and the religious foundations for them have been well presented to us by the Archbishop of Westminster to whom we are indebted. They have rightly become the subject of huge public interest and public debate. </p> <p>It is, however, necessary to stress the obvious. This is not a court of morals but a court of law and our decision has to be taken from a solid base of legal principle. So I turn to the law. It is a trite medical law that every person's body is inviolate and that it is an unlawful assault to operate without consent. </p> <p>In the case of a young child, it is not only the right but it is also the duty of the parents to give consent on the child's behalf if it is in the best interests of the child to do so. If the parents refuse, the hospital cannot operate but it is entitled to invite the court to override the parents' refusal and to give approval for the operation. </p> <p>This introduces principles of family law. Again it is trite that the court's duty when determining any question with respect to the upbringing of a child - and that includes the child's medical care - is to make the child's welfare the court's paramount consideration. So what is best for the child dictates the outcome, subject always to this: the court cannot approve a course of action which may be illegal. </p> <p>Thus four crucial issues arise. </p> <p>1. Is it in Jodie's best interests that she be separated from Mary? </p> <p>2. Is it in Mary's best interests that she be separated from Jodie? </p> <p>3. If those interests are in conflict can the court balance the interests of one against the other and so allow one to prevail against the other and if that is permissible, how is that balancing exercise to be undertaken? </p> <p>4. If the prevailing interest is in favour of the operation being performed, can it be lawfully performed? </p> <p>There is, however, a preliminary issue both in civil law and criminal law, namely whether or not Mary is a live person in her own right. The medical evidence is overwhelmingly to the effect that she is and the law supports that conclusion. I am delighted that is so. Old notions of \"monstrous birth\" are to [be] deprecated in the 21st century. </p> <p><b> Best interests</b><br> </p> <p> As to Jodie's best interests, Johnson J. found and was right to find that the operation would be to her benefit. The experts from the Great Ormond Street hospital for children, who provided a second opinion for us, confirm that Jodie should be able to live a fairly normal or at least a not intolerable life... In my judgment it is overwhelmingly in her interest that she be given the chance to live a normal life with a normal expectation of life. It is certainly not in her interest to be left to die. </p> <p>Determining where Mary's welfare lies is more difficult. The judge found, and I agree, that her state is pitiable and will never improve. There is no reliable way to test whether she is in pain for she responds to pain and pleasure in the same way. Nevertheless the judge accepted evidence that it was \"an horrendous scenario\" to contemplate that Jodie should struggle to drag Mary behind her, something which would have to hurt Mary. The real issue of difficulty for me lies in the judge's finding that the remaining few months of her life if not separated would \"be simply worth nothing to her, they would be hurtful\". This led him to conclude that \"to prolong Mary's life for these few months would be very seriously to her disadvantage\". </p> <p>Whether these remaining months will be hurtful or not is not the important question in this case. What is of real importance and public interest is the assessment that her life is worth nothing... The sanctity of life doctrine is so enshrined as a fundamental principle of law and commands such respect from the law that I am compelled to accept that each life has inherent value in itself however grave the impairment of some of the body's functions may be. I am satisfied that Mary's life, desperate as it is, still has its own ineliminable value and dignity. In my judgment the learned judge was wrong to find it was worth nothing. </p> <p>He also erred in his finding that to prolong Mary's life would be seriously to her disadvantage. He wrongly characterised the nature of the treatment. No treatment was here being proposed to prolong her life in the way [Hillsborough victim] Tony Bland's artificial support systems prolonged his. Surgery would amount to a positive act of invasion of her bodily integrity with no medical or other benefit flowing from it... In my judgment it cannot be in Mary's best interests to undergo surgery which will terminate her life. </p> <p>That places the court on the painfully sharp horns of dilemma. The court's duty is to put the welfare of each child paramount. It is in the best interests of Jodie that separation takes place; it is in the best interests of Mary that it does not. There is an irreconcilable conflict and the court cannot fully honour its separate duty to each child to do what is best for that child. In my judgment the only solution is to balance the welfare of each child against the other to find the least detrimental alternative. In my view the parents take an unduly pessimistic view of the prognosis for Jodie. Their personal hardship in coping with her with such disabilities as she will have to bear command great sympathy but the difficulties for the parents and the difficulties for Jodie cannot outweigh the right to life to which their child is entitled... </p> <p>So I have to balance the welfare of one child against the other. Into each scale goes their right to life. This right is universal: we all share it equally. The scales remain in balance. I am not entitled to value the quality of one human life as worth more than another's and I do not do so. But it is legitimate to look at the actual condition of the children as they are and assess their legitimate expectations when determining whether it is worth treating them. The worthwhileness of the proposed treatment is a legitimate factor to weigh. For the reasons given the treatment is not worthwhile for Mary for one cannot escape from the fact that Mary has always been fated for early death: her capacity to live has been fatally compromised. Though Mary has a right to life, she has little right to be alive. She is alive because and only because, to put it bluntly but nonetheless accurately, she sucks the lifeblood of Jodie and her parasitic living will soon be the cause of Jodie ceasing to live. </p> <p>Jodie is entitled to protest that Mary is killing her. Nobody but the doctors can help Jodie. Mary sadly is beyond any help. The best interests of the twins is to give the chance of life to the child whose actual bodily condition is capable of accepting the chance to her advantage even if that has to be at the cost of the sacrifice of a life which is so unnaturally supported. I am therefore left in no doubt at all that the scales come down heavily in Jodie's favour. I am wholly satisfied that the least detrimental choice is to permit separation to take place. </p> <p>But it remains subject to the analysis of whether the operation is lawful. Two features seem to me to be important. The first is that the doctors are placed under a legal duty to do what is best for their patient. That at once places them in a position of impossible conflict. They are under a duty to Mary not to operate because it will kill her but they are under an equally powerful duty to Jodie obliging them to operate because not to do so will kill this twin... In those circumstances it seems to me the law must allow an escape by permitting the doctors to choose the lesser of the two evils. The doctors must conduct their balancing exercise in the same way as the court has had to do. The answer is the same. </p> <p>There is a second reason why it seems to me that the proposed operation will not in any event offend the sanctity of life principle. This is not an absolute rule. It demands only that life is to be protected from unjust attack. In a joint statement by the Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops in the aftermath of Bland they stated that because human life is a gift from God to be preserved and cherished, the deliberate taking of human life is prohibited except in self-defence or in the legitimate defence of others. The archbishop defines the principle in terms that human life is sacred and inviolable so that one should never aim to cause an innocent person's death by act or omission. </p> <p><b> Helpless</b><br> </p> <p> The reality here, harsh as it is to state it and unnatural as it is that it should be happening, is that Mary is killing Jodie. To label Mary as an \"unjust aggressor\" is wholly inappropriate for the sad and helpless position in which Mary finds herself. This unique happening cannot be said to be unlawful. But in my judgment it does not have to be unlawful. The six-year-old boy indiscriminately shooting all and sundry in the school playground is not acting unlawfully because he is too young for his acts so to be classified. In my judgment, however, and this is a judgment on a question of law, not morality - though, for what it is worth, I personally would think the position is the same - that child may be killed in legitimate self-defence. I see no difference in essence between that resort to self-defence and the doctors coming to Jodie's defence and removing the threat of fatal harm to her presented by Mary's draining her life blood. </p> <p>I conclude, therefore, that the operation can be lawfully carried out. </p> <p>The Human Rights Act 1998 looms over us. The rights it guarantees are as much in conflict with each other as the doctors' duties and I do not believe that the court in Strasbourg would come to any other conclusion. </p> <p>I would therefore dismiss the appeal but, lest it be thought that this decision could become authority for any wider proposition such as that a doctor can kill the patient once he has determined that a patient cannot survive, it is important to restate the unique circumstances for which this case is authority. They are that it must be impossible to preserve the life of X without bringing about the death of Y. That Y by his or her very continued existence will inevitably bring about the death of X within a short period of time and that X is capable of living an independent life but Y is incapable under any circumstances, including all forms of medical intervention, of viable independent existence. As I say at the beginning of my judgment this is a very unique case. </p> <p><b>Conjoined twins information sites:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm\" target=\"_new\">Twinstuff.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com\" target=\"_new\">Conjoined twins</a></p>",
  "<p>The latest plastic card fraud figures are enough to make you abandon convenience and go back to paying for goods and services by cheque and cash where possible. But there are ways of protecting your cards. </p> <p>Credit and debit card fraud increased by 53% in the year to May 2000 to reach total losses of \u00a3226m, according to figures from the Association for Payment Clearing Services (Apacs). </p> <p>The major growth area is in counterfeit cards and in fraud on mail order, telephone or internet transac tions where the card is not physically presented to the retailer. Counterfeit fraud grew by 104% during the year to cost \u00a368m while card-not-present fraud grew by 146%, costing \u00a340m. </p> <p>\"The most worrying counterfeit method, 'skimming', involves copying genuine data from the magnetic strip on one card, without the cardholder's knowledge, and putting it on to another card,\" says Melanie Hubbard of Card Watch, the banking industry's campaign launched in 1992 by Apacs to reduce plastic card theft and fraud. \"This can happen where corrupt staff have access to customer cards and the information is usually then passed higher up the ladder of organised crime.\" </p> <p>Andrew Brown of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) says: \"Organised criminals may use sophisticated methods of card crime as a comparatively low-risk way of raising revenue that later funds other more violent crime. The penalties for card crime are often substantially lower than, for example, those where revenue is raised directly through the sale of drugs.\" </p> <p>A key way to protect your cards from skimming is to keep a close eye on how they are being handled and not to let them out of your sight when making a transaction at a retail outlet, hotel or restaurant. </p> <p>An unscrupulous shop assistant, for example, can quickly and easily record all the data on your card using a simple magnetic strip reader costing around \u00a350. Once put through a computer, the details can then be copied on to a blank card using another cheap and readily available gizmo for use by fraudsters. </p> <p>Geoff Wortley, fraud investigator for the UK's largest credit card provider Barclaycard, says alarm bells should ring and you should contact your card provider immediately if you spot a retailer swiping your card for a second time into a separate machine at the point of sale. </p> <p>And to play safe in restaurants, don't let the waiter take your card away but get up and pay at the cash desk yourself. </p> <p>Further protection is also in the pipeline from card providers. The banking industry is gradually replacing existing cards with so-called 'smart' cards containing computer chips full of infor mation which is, so far, impossible to copy and transfer to forged cards. Apacs says that by the end of 2002 most of the bank-owned infrastructure will have been upgraded in the UK and smart cards will be the norm. </p> <p>Banks and retailers are also considering introducing a new verification system - already used in France - where consumers will type their special four-digit personal identification number (pin) into keypads at the point of sale, either instead of or as well as signing receipts. Fraudsters would then only be able to use stolen or forged cards if they had also acquired a cardholder's secret pin, something which should be memorised and never written down or revealed to anyone else, even bank personnel or the police. This also applies, of course, to cash machine pins. </p> <p>The main cause of card-not-present fraud is where criminals somehow acquire your card details (the number and expiry date) and use them to buy goods and services via mail order, by phone or over the internet. </p> <p>Contrary to the fears of many consumers, internet transactions account for a very small percentage of the rise in fraud losses. \"Most of it is to do with mail order where you can carry out an increasing number of quite high value transactions without you or your card being present,\" Mr Wortley says. </p> <p>\"In fact, there's nothing more technologically sinister about card fraud over the internet than there is about card fraud via mail order or phone,\" says Ms Hubbard. </p> <p>Again the credit card industry is working with retailers on new fraud detection and prevention measures. By April next year, retailers will have access to two new ways of checking that the online or phone purchaser is the genuine cardholder. </p> <p>First, they will ask users to give three security digits which are printed only on the signature strip at the back of a card. So, unlike the main card number which can be found out through other means such as via computer programmes which appear on certain internet websites, you will only have access to these security digits if you have physically got the card. </p> <p>Second, there will for the first time be a system in place which will allow retailers to check whether the address they are given to send goods out to is the same address as that of the cardholder. </p> <p>In the mean time, self-protection is the name of the game. The main security guidelines are: </p> <p>\u0095 Keep a record of all mail order, phone and internet transactions and check them against your card statements. Query any unfamiliar transactions immediately with your card issuer. </p> <p>\u0095 Guard your cards as carefully as you would cash. Don't think of them simply as pieces of plastic that can be replaced. </p> <p>\u0095 Use cards discreetly at cash machines. Beware of \"shoulder surfers\", who are out to observe your pin number and card details. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't give your card information to unsolicited callers. Only give details to merchants if you called them. </p>",
  "<p>Diamonds are famously a girl's best friend. But what about sapphires - will the blue tinged stones be an investor's best mate? It's yes if you believe an offshore sales outfit working from the Costa del Sol, with a brass plate registration in Geneva and an ultimate owner currently residing in Florida. Over the past few weeks it has been heavily mailing potential UK investors. </p> <p>It's no , however, if you take notice of almost everyone else and heed warnings that virtually all of your capital could be at risk. In reality, your investment may be little better than flushing your cash down the toilet. </p> <p>Windsor Cairns, whose coat of arms prominently features the letters WC, is the company currently selling the stones to investors. It mailshots potential UK investors through several mailing lists it buys, including one from an organisation specialising in punters looking for get-rich-quick opportunities. </p> <p>In its literature and via telephone sales staff, Windsor Cairns makes a number of claims designed to sell sapphires as an investment. It promises \"lucrative financial opportunities for the novice and sophisticated investor.\" </p> <p>Those who bite are first sent glossy brochures - one including the line \"that one by one, the world's most renowned deposits of blue sapphire are running out or not running at all.\" The shortage message, although denied elsewhere, is a vital element of the WC sales patter. </p> <p>Potential customers are asked to return the free inquiry form and are then phoned - ostensibly from Geneva but actually from the Costa del Sol - by Windsor Cairns. </p> <p>The Windsor Cairns sapphire investment trail takes in half the world - from the mines in Sri Lanka, via Spain where the phone centre is located, to Geneva, the registered address, and then to the Florida base of the US entrepreneurs behind the secretive Swiss firm and thence to the Bahamas, the current domicile of Ms Jamie Duncannon who signs letters to customers, with a Geneva letter-heading. </p> <p>Avery Brooks, an American, is one of the individuals working on the Costa touting the scheme to British investors. He repeatedly tells prospects that he has a masters degree in finance but refuses to divulge the name of the college or university when asked. Brooks admits he has only been \"a few months\" in the gemstone business. But he is a tenacious salesperson. </p> <p>Here, we examine claims made by Windsor Cairns and compare that with what independent experts say both here and in Sri Lanka. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 1: </strong> Windsor Cairns offers a \"secured, tax-exempt investment\" which will \"safely realise returns of 50% or more annually.\" The investment, it adds, has seen a \"30-year bull market with no downside price correction.\" There are also charts showing how precious stones have soared in value. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> There is no \"safe\" investment which returns 50% or more annually - independent financial advisers are at a loss to find any investment no matter what the risk that has regularly offered this much. Even if sapphires had advanced at half that pace, a \u00a31,000 purchase in 1970 would be worth more than \u00a31m now. </p> <p>Brooks says this claim is based on auction house returns which he cannot name and on \"figures from a previous company in this field\" which likewise remains anonymous. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 2: </strong> \"We're looking for political and economic factors. The demand for sapphires has never been greater. There are serious problems with the Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka; they declared a civil war in May and it's getting worse and worse by the day,\" says Brooks. Brooks says the civil war has caused disruption in the market place and this has led to \"tremendous volatility in markets\". </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Sri Lankan news sources report clashes between the Tamil Tigers and government troops almost daily. Most result in heavy loss of life. But the Tamil activity is largely confined to the Jaffna peninsula in the island's north - the sapphire mines are in the south where there is no Tamil activity. The Sri Lanka gem and jewellery authority says the mines are unaffected. And the market is now receiving substantial supplies of quality stones from Madagascar. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 3: </strong> Sri Lanka produces \"the finest investment grade sapphires\". At the same time, Brooks says demand for sapphires has never been greater. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Just what this is based upon is unclear. Dr Roger Harding, director of London's respected Gemmological Association and Gem Testing Laboratory says there is no such thing as \"investment grade\" sapphires. He also doubts that demand is at an all-time high relative to supply. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 4: </strong> Brooks offers a 2 carat stone at \u00a34,025, a 1 carat \"museum\" quality stone at \u00a33,600, and a 0.75 carat stone at \u00a31,500. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Dr Harding says \"museum quality\" is a salesman's term not recognised in his industry. A US website - Simply Sapphires - sells pairs of 1 carat stones for $150 (around \u00a3110). </p> <p> <strong> Claim 5: </strong> Brooks appeals to the investor's greed by offering a \"tax-free\" gain. He tells prospective customers that to save VAT and import duties, the stones are kept sealed in plastic in a vault in Geneva Airport's tax-free zone. </p> <p>\"You can have physical delivery if you want but that will cost a lot more with further expenses when you want to sell. It is money that will be wasted from your profits. More than 99% of our customers use the Valimpex tax-free zone,\" he says. \"You also have a special international capital gains tax allowance,\" he adds. </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> It is true that if you never import the jewels, you do not pay duty and VAT. But there is no such thing as an international CGT allowance. Leaving them in a tax-free vault means you never see the stone so you cannot get an independent valuation. </p> <p> <strong> Claim 6:</strong> Brooks says sapphire investment is \"more liquid than unit trusts.\" </p> <p> <strong> Counterclaim: </strong> Unit trusts can be sold overnight for cash. Selling a gemstone could take months and there are charges. </p> <p>Dr Harding says investors should take all these claims with \"a pinch of salt.\" </p> <p>He says: \"Sapphires have done no more than keep up with inflation over the years and the prices quoted would have to be exceptional quality even for someone to spend time examing them. There have been periods in the past when offshore operations tried to sell stones which the purchaser would never see. In those cases, the stones turned out to be worth about a tenth of their sales price.\" </p> <p>The watchdog Financial Services Authority says Windsor Cairns is outside its jurisdiction and that investors who send cheques to unregulated concerns do so at their own risk. There is no comp- ensation scheme if they lose out. </p> <p>Other enforcement agencies admit they are powerless to act due to the way Windsor Cairns splits its functions across international borders. </p> <p>In a second phone call Brooks admits \"our published information is not indicative of the returns. There are a number of unscrupulous individuals in my market. This is not an investment, more a collectable that we keep in a tax-free zone.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Jamie Duncannon was not available for comment. </p> <p><strong>Shoot-first policy to cope with the cowboys</strong></p> <p>The Financial Services Authority says you should always check that a company is authorised before sending any money for an investment. Other ways to avoid trouble with cowboy firms include: </p> <p>\u0095 Insist on having all documentation before you sign or agree to anything.

  "<p>New Zealand took total command of the second Test on day three in Harare as Zimbabwe's batting line-up collapsed and were forced to follow on. </p> <p>The Kiwis had posted an impressive 465 in their first innings thanks mainly to Chris Cairns' superb century, and the hosts were six for one at stumps second time round, having been skittled for 166 in their first reply. </p> <p>After Gavin Rennie had fallen to Cairns the previous evening, Grant Flower and Stuart Carlisle steadied the ship for the Zimbabweans and led their side to 76 for one this morning. </p> <p>But Cairns made the vital breakthrough once again when he had Carlisle caught by Mathew Sinclair at third man. </p> <p>Alistair Campbell was snared for a duck by Shayne O'Connor, who finished the day with three for 43 off 28 overs, one run later - and Grant Flower was next to head back to the pavilion with the score on 118. </p> <p>Flower fell one run short of his half-century when he lost patience and flashed outside the off stump to be caught by Adam Parore after 286 minutes at the crease. </p> <p>Grant's brother Andy continued to play his shots but lost Guy Whittall for nine just before tea. </p> <p>The hosts were in trouble at 146 for five, and the dismissal of Andy Flower - trapped lbw by Craig McMillan for 48 - sparked another flurry of wickets. </p> <p>Zimbabwe slumped to 166 all out, losing their last five wickets for only 20 runs, and their misery was complete when O'Connor had Rennie caught by Craig Spearman for one before the close of play.</p>",
  "Britain's most dangerous sex offenders could be held indefinitely in prison under new plans being considered by the Liberal Democrats. <p> Simon Hughes, the party's home affairs spokesman, said the use of \"indefinite sentences\" would not necessarily mean prisoners gained longer sentences, but there would be a more controlled release of them into society. </p> <p> Serious sex offenders would be given a minimum tariff, but it would be up to judges to assess whether satisfactory arrangements had been made for them to be let out. </p> <p> Mr Hughes' call for a review of the current sentencing policy came as the party addressed an issue which has been a national preoccupation following the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in July. There has been strong pressure for a \"Sarah's law\" which would allow parents access to the sex offenders' register. </p> <p> Earlier this month the government ruled this out, but introduced other proposals, including fingerprinting and photographing offenders on their release and life bans on them contacting their victims. </p> <p> Indefinite sentences are not an option at present unless a serious sex offender has re-offended, but the Home Office is looking at applying this to a small number of extremely dangerous sex offenders under separate legislation. </p> <p> Yesterday Liberal Democrats called for \"serious consideration\" to be given to this measure, and called for the victims of sex offenders to be told where and when their abusers would be released. Proposing the motion, Gary Glover said: \"Victims of serious crimes should not be terrified day after day, week after week by fear of meeting offenders.\" </p> <p> Delegates also called for sex offenders convicted outside Britain to be placed on the register when they enter this country, and for the public to have access to this. But there was condemnation of the News of the World and its recent campaign to name and shame paedophiles, widely criticised by police and probation services at the time on the grounds it would drive offenders underground. </p> <p> \"It didn't take the News of the World to make the world aware of this problem,\" said Mr Hughes. \"The News of the World were entirely irresponisble and entirely self serving.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>BLUE TWO</strong></p> <p>A new display has appeared in the window of Chelsea's of Chelsea, the fashionable West London boutique. Said to encapsulate the virtues of 'Strength' and 'Determination', 'Passion' and 'Commitment', it is filled with images of Celestine Babayaro diving headlong into challenges, and Marcel Desailly impressively fending off a Bradford front line. Installed by the new boss, it's been praised for its dream-like qualities by some critics, while others wonder whether they haven't seen it somewhere before. </p> <p>Describing the piece ahead of tomorrow's stupidly early Premiership encounter with Manchester United, new man Claudio Ranieri said: \"In sport you can lose but the fans have to be proud of the team fighting to seek victory until the last minute.\" As the crowd applauded he went on: \"I want to see how hard my players will play and fight during the match\", adding: \"We need to realise who has the right ability and spirit to be part of the future, who wants to die on the pitch and who doesn't.\" Actually, that last bit was Gianluca Vialli after last season's 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford, but you get the general idea.</p> <p>So the Chelsea boys will have to pull their finger out or else or else Ranieri will sign another multi-million pound foreigner. Following yesterday's spurious link to Ajax's Danish winger Jesper Gronkjaer - substantiated on onefootball.com by quotes from Gronkjaer's agent which he never actually made - the Blues are today in talks with Celta Vigo over winger Gustavo Lopez. \"He is a player we have looked at for some time,\" Colin Hutchison said of the Argentine international. \"No fee has been agreed, it hasn't gone that far.

You wouldn't ever catch him standing in an empty room trying to start a fight. Or a fire, come to that. So we're not surprised that he's sensibly and rationally decided to put Ugo Ehiogu's not-quite-as-upwardly-mobile-as-planned \u00a39m move to Middlesbrough on hold until this weekend's fixture between the two teams is out of the way. After all, if he didn't, this already tense fixture would be a Paul Merson-shaped powderkeg waiting to explode - and who wants that? Not John, that's for sure.</p> <p>\"Middlesbrough have been on to us about Ugo,\" a clearly not-to-be-hurried Gregory explained. \"We have been talking to them, but I am not going to rush this through for the weekend,\" he yawned, filing his nails with an insouciant flourish. \"I certainly don't want to do that as I don't want to be in the position where Ugo is playing against us.\"</p> <p>Let's hope Gregory's level-headed approach is catching on at Villa Park: if chairman Doug Ellis keeps calm, he'll find it much easier to talk West Bromwich Albion out of the \u00a34.5m he is contractually obliged to pay them when he sells the 27-year-old defender. Ehiogu joined Villa from the Baggies for \u00a340,000 nine years ago, and as part of that deal Albion are entitled to 50 per cent of any sell-on fee. Ellis, however, is seeking to negotiate a compromise involving \"a lump sum and a smaller percentage\".

Once again, Uefa meekly appeased them.</p> <p>For a while, an uneasy peace held. Until today that is, when the G-14 announced they are to form an association, and basically go legit. This is bound to precipitate new demands for even more Big Cup cash. So what was Uefa's response to these never-ending demands? Did they offer Luxembourg to the G-14 as lebensraum? Or cave in completely? Well, surprisingly, no. Instead, they decided to strike back - as only Uefa can - with a bureaucratically worded letter. </p> <p>\"If you form an association, you will be breaking Uefa and Fifa statutes and taking an opposite position which carries a sanction of being outcast from football's structures,\" a scary letter to every club in the G-14 said today. It may not sound much, but for Uefa this is bold with a capital B - threatening, as it does, to expel the clubs from all football should they go ahead. </p> <p>But seeing as the G-14 are already committed to their plans, a classic football fudge is also a possibility. Perhaps a European Super League will be set up with the big clubs getting even more big money. Perhaps an increasingly powerless Uefa will remain - nominally at least - in charge. Perhaps.

David Hopkin and Ian Nolan are ruled out for Bradford, although Benito Carbone and Dan Petrescu are set to return. Marian Pahars, who scored the winner at Valley Parade last season is doubtful because of a hamstring injury. Uwe Rosler stands by. </p> <p>Coventry v West Ham. Youssef Chippo, who took a finger in the eye from a team-mate during Coventry's goal celebrations in the Worthington Cup, is fit to play. Kaba Diawara goes straight into West Ham's squad after signing on loan. He will provide cover for Paolo di Canio and Frederic Kanoute, who both have hamstring problems, while Davor Suker has a groin injury.</p> <p>Derby v Leeds. Craig Burley played one hour for Derby's reserves this week and is set to make his first start of the season. However Leeds captain Lucas Radebe, who trained for the first time today since his neck injury in Barcelona, will not be risked until Tuesday's match against Besiktas at the earliest. </p> <p>Ipswich v Arsenal. Ipswich defender Titus Bramble has recovered from a hip injury but James Scowcroft and Fabian Wilnis face late fitness checks. Tony Adams, Robert Pires, and Patrick Vieira all miss out for Arsenal. </p> <p>Liverpool v Sunderland. Robbie Fowler will have to be content with a place on the Liverpool bench despite scoring five in the reserves in midweek. Sunderland manager Peter Reid is set to name the side that beat Derby.</p> <p>Man Utd v Chelsea. Teddy Sheringham is likely to be recalled as Andy Cole's partner in place of Dwight Yorke. Meanwhile Chelsea are still without Ed de Goey, Gustavo Poyet and Mario Stanic through injury, while Celestine Babayaro is away on Olympic Games duty. </p> <p>Middlesbrough v Aston Villa. Middlesbrough will be without Christian Karembeu, who has a knee problem, as well as Gary Pallister and Steve Vickers. But on-loan Gary Walsh remains in goal. David Ginola, who has been taken off in each of his two appearances this season, will start for Villa.</p> <p>Newcastle v Charlton. Newcastle's new \u00a32.25m signing Lomana Tresor Lua Lua goes straight into the squad but striker Carl Cort is a doubt after suffering a minor reaction to a hamstring problem. Charlton's Richard Rufus has recovered from the injury that kept him of the Worthington Cup defeat at Stoke. </p> <p>Tottenham v Man City. Ramon Vega will make only his second start this season alongside Chris Perry. Mauricio Taricco remains doubtful with a groin injury but Tim Sherwood is likely to return in midfield.

  "\u0095 Where is it? This year's Labour conference - and next year's, too - is held in Brighton. These days, conferences have become so large that only a few towns can cope with holding them. Blackpool used to be one of them - but New Labour crossed the town off the list. <p>\u0095 When is it? The conference begins on Sunday afternoon, when Tony Blair holds a question-and-answer session. This is nominally with delegates, but Mr Blair will have more than half a mind on how his answers will go down with the electorate.</p> <p>\u0095 The conference ends on Thursday 28 September with a rendition of the red flag and - on past form - a barnstorming speech by John Prescott. The same day will bring the guest of the week: Nelson Mandela flies in to cheer up the party faithful.</p> <p>\u0095 Who's going? The 720 Labour party delegates expected to attend make up only a fraction of the 4,000- 5,000 people likely to turn up for at least part of the week. Trade Unions account for around 400 people, and MPs, MEPs, Members of the Scottish Parliament, peers, Welsh Assembly and National Policy Forum members make up another 700. On top of them come hundreds of journalists, lobbyists and exhibitors. Older Labour activists complain that they feel excluded at an event that increasingly resembles a trade fare.</p> <p>\u0095 The key moment will be Tony Blair's address to the conference. Last year, he abandoned staccato soundbites for a potent attack on what he called the \"forces of conservatism\" stalking Britain. This year he'll speak days after falling victim to those same forces in the petrol crisis. Will he cave in to popular demand for cheaper fuel, ride out the storm by pointing to Labour successes in other areas, or tackle the demonstrator's demands head on? How he handles the situation will say a lot about the nature of the next general election.</p> <p>\u0095 Expect other highlights to include Gordon Brown's speech. He too will have to respond to claims he should cut tax on fuel - but will also speak against the background of claims he lied over what he knew about donations to the Labour party.</p> <p>\u0095 The full agenda of the conference will be published on Sunday. With it will come a guide to the hundreds of events on the conference fringe. The petrol crisis will certainly be a talking point here - even if it is ignored on the floor of the conference itself.</p> <p>\u0095 Expect complaints about government policy from backbench Labour MPs worried that they may lose their seats - and their jobs - in a year's time. Watch out too for the vote on reform of the House of Lords - there is a good chance that conference will vote for a fully elected upper house, against Tony Blair's wishes.</p> <p>\u0095 No prizes for guessing the hate figure of the week. William Hague will come in for plenty of criticism - not least because focus groups show that mention of his name is more likely to deter people from voting Tory than encourage it.</p> <p>\u0095 Protest of the week will come from truck drivers who may try to blockade the conference to highlight the rising cost of fuel. Will they prove more effective than last year's demonstration by the Countryside Alliance? It filled the streets of Bournemouth with hunting horns and tweed, but left Labour policy unchanged.</p> <p>\u0095 Everyone will have their ears open to catch the song of the week: in 1997 Labour bopped to D-Ream's \"Things Can Only Get Better and last year Tony Blair entered the hall to give his speech to the sounds of Fatboy Slim's Praise You. With the Tories ahead in the polls, no doubt this year's choice will be a little more sombre.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Current totals (from their initial \u00a3100 kitties):</strong> <br> Scott Murray = \u00a3112.61 <br>Paul MacInnes = \u00a387.02 <br>Sean Ingle \u00a374.50 <br> Football Unlimited punters' collective = \u00a367.50</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong></p> <p>Chelsea to beat Manchester United \u00a35 @ 4/1</p> <p>Logically, there is really only one winner of this match, and it ain't Chelsea. United are already three points clear of their nearest title challengers - let's not patronise Leicester fans by pretending they'll stay the distance - and the way they're beginning to play doesn't auger well for those who like a bit of excitement come May. Factor in Chelsea's abject form and United's home record - they haven't been turned over at Old Trafford since 1999 - and you're looking at a home banker.</p> <p>But are Chelsea really such a long shot? There's no need to list names to prove the quality they possess, and last week's home defeat at the hands of Leicester will surely come to represent the nadir of their season. Claudio Ranieri's players will run out tomorrow morning with something to prove to their new manager - who can't have failed to improve rock-bottom team spirit - so if United hit a couple of bum notes, hosts and visitors alike could be wearing shocked expressions come 1.15pm on Saturday.</p> <p>OK, it's unlikely - but at this price I think the visitors are worth a pop.</p> <p> <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p>Preston to win at half time against Sheffield Wednesday. \u00a35 @ 3/1 </p> <p>For a split second last Saturday afternoon I was in ecstacy. I had backed a certain Mr K Phillips to score first against Derby and midway through the first half the radio commentary switched to the Stadium of Light. \"Sunderland have opened the scoring,\" the breathless pundit said, \"and the goal has gone to Kevin Kilbane.\" A crushing blow, particularly when Phillips went on to score the winner. But that brief moment will remain with me, and I won't be frightened to make such bets again.</p> <p>There is the bit of the bonkers in this week's wager. The bookies have obviously decided that this Saturday will be the first day of Sheffield Wednesday's season. They have them at evens to beat David Moyes' well-drilled Preston side, despite the fact that the Owls are yet to win at Hillsborough and have lost three of their four home matches. </p> <p>I think Preston could win the match outright at 9/4. But the odds are better on North End having the advantage at half-time, and with new US striker Brian McBride making a favourable impression plus the possible return of leading scorer Jonathan Macken, it's a possibility. So while a half-time bet is risky, I have plumped for it all the same. And we'll see what the commentators have to say about that.</p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle</strong></p> <p>Manchester United v Chelsea to draw @ 9/4; West Ham to beat Coventry @ 7/4; Aston Villa to beat Middlesbrough @ 7/4 and Blackburn to draw with Bolton 9/4. Four \u00a31 trebles and one \u00a31 accumulator.</p> <p>Value stalks me. I see it everywhere; it whispers to me, even in my dreams. And, most of all, it's there in Blue Square's betting slip. Or at least I think it is. Because every time I see a bet that seems to offer the 'v' word (like Villa to beat a Middlesbrough side who haven't won at home all season and have Karembeu and Pallister out), I think: yeah, let's do it. But then - almost instantly - the crushing doubts start, and I scramble for a safety net.</p> <p>That's why I've picked four value-heavy bets and permed them within an inch of their lives. That way, I figure, if one fails and the other three come off, I'll still win big money. Well, it sounds rational enough to me, as do the bets themselves. Coventry haven't won at home all season so why should they be favourites against West Ham? Bolton have won all four of their away games in the league so why can't they get a point at Blackburn? And Chelsea, for all their problems, have a new manager and a great record at Old Trafford, so a point isn't out of the question, is it? Is it?</p> <p>Last week Blue Square's Patrick Murray suggested my smug-o-meter (as if I possess such a thing) was out of control for the 21 minutes where it looked like my treble would come off. Not likely Patrick, not likely. Because I wasn't watching my bets I was watching my team. And they, alas, didn't win either.</p> <p><strong>Football Unlimited Punter's Collective: Ben Taylor, contract manager</strong></p> <p>Aston Villa to beat Middlesbrough @ 7/4, Liverpool to beat Sunderland @ 2/5, Tottenham to beat Manchester City @ 4/7. \u00a35 treble.</p> <p>A nice little treble to kick things off with - so, I should look for 'value' and ignore trebles eh? We'll see.</p> <p>The problem here is that I'm a Villa supporter, and it's an unwritten rule that you shouldn't back your own team. Still, let's be honest, Boro are a pretty poor bunch and we thumped them 4-0 at their place on Valentines Day last season. If you need further evidence, Julian Joachim scored twice that night. Enough said??</p> <p>Liverpool won't be much value but are winning games at Anfield and showing some pretty good stuff as well.

  "A behavioural psychologist trying to find the real Tony Blair among his many conflicting smiling postures would be inundated by choice. <p>He could be tempted to see the prime minister as a rightwing social democratic entryist who succeeded in capturing the victory-starved Labour party from within, unlike those who had left to establish the Social Democratic Party as a rival show. </p> <p>With the help of his Svengali, Peter Mandelson, Blair pursued a policy friendlier to Europe, stripped Labour of its long-dead Clause IV, and made plans for a Labour-Liberal Democratic alliance.</p> <p>Under this scheme, there were to be two seats in the cabinet for the Liberal Democrats, to help block a feared leftwing veto. Only Labour's massive 179-seat 1997 majority (instead of the 30 predicted by Mandelson) blocked this part of the project.</p> <p>A plot-sniffing rightwing psychologist might favour a rival scenario. As the son of Leo Blair (a leader of the pre-war Glasgow young communists), Tony Blair, with the help of Peter Mandelson (who, at 18, sold the Morning Star at Kilburn station) has brought more leftwingers into government than even Harold Wilson. </p> <p>The Foreign Office is the most leftwing ever, with Robin Cook and Peter Hain ruling the roost. At International Development we have Clare Short, who like leader of the Commons Margaret Beckett was in the hard-left Campaign Group until 1988. </p> <p>And there are two other former semi-Trotskyist northerners in the Cabinet: Stephen Byers and Alan Milburn, who once hung out in Newcastle's Days of Hope socialist bookshop, known locally as \"Haze of Dope\".</p> <p>The conflict between these scenarios leads to a more realistic synthesis: that the PM, apart from his Anglo-Catholicism, has no rooted ideology whatever and is a political weathervane subject to any puff of hot air from one of Philip Gould's focus groups. </p> <p>A leak in July revealed Blair's insecure reaction to Gould's doom-laden over-interpretation of the fears of Middle England: \"We should think now of... locking up street-muggers,\" responded the barrister-PM. \"Something tough, with immediate bite.\" And then the fatal: \"This should be done soon and I... personally should be associated with it.\"</p> <p>What other government chief would come up with plans for on-the-spot \u00a350 fines for hooligans or putting 3m DNA prints on a police database, without consulting either the police or his own home secretary? Apart from undermining cabinet responsibility, this suggests a man without a fixed political ideology apart from a scaled-down Clintonism. </p> <p>Well to the right of the recent Democratic convention in the United States, Blair favours a new self-made entrepreneurial elite, particularly if multi-ethnic and contributing generously to Labour party funds (but without Ecclestone-like demands).</p> <p>The absence of thought-through ideology undermines the prime minister's serious achievements in office, such as devolution. Having, in theory, devolved power to Wales and London - as well as Scotland - Blair muddied his monument by trying to impose Alun Michael on Wales and anybody-but-Ken on London. </p> <p>His achievement in Northern Ireland was undermined by pulling the rug from under the wildly popular Mo Mowlam in favour of massively unpopular Peter Mandelson. Similarly, the House of Lords has been shorn of all but 92 of its hereditary peers without any early guarantee of even a substantial elected minority.</p> <p>Geneticists might find such fluidity a hereditary trait. His father, Leo Blair, made the jump from pre-war Young Communist League to the Conservative ethos he swallowed whole while in a wartime officers' mess. When he became a law lecturer after the war, he hoped to become a Tory MP and was only stopped by ill-health. </p> <p>But Leo made sure his son went to suitable schools, Durham Choristers and Fettes, the grandest and strictest Scottish public school.</p> <p>In fact, Leo Blair was not the prime minister's father's real name. Born illegitimately, Leo was given up for adoption to a family of leftwing Clydeside shipriggers, the Blairs. His adoptive grandmother, Mary Blair, was so attached to Leo that she blocked off all later contact with his real parents, claiming he had died in the second world war. </p> <p>Although young Tony stood as a victorious Tory candidate at 11 in a 1964 mock-election at Durham Choristers school, he was slow to develop an interest in politics. </p> <p>At St John's College, Oxford, at the end of the turbulent 1960s, he showed no outside interest except in playing guitar in the rock group Ugly Rumours and listening to the idealistic Catholicism of a visiting Australian.</p> <p>The Tories, who have tried to tag him an early leftwinger, an anti-European with CND sympathies on the basis of his 1982 byelection contest in Beaconsfield, are miles wide of the mark. </p> <p>Once Blair decided, as a young barrister, on a career in Labour (with the encouragement of his chambers chief Derry Irvine, now lord chancellor, and his room-mate Cherie Booth) he had to adopt the political garments required by Labour's then-tiny selection panels. (Famously, Richard, now Lord, Marsh had borrowed a CND badge to secure his selection for Greenwich.) </p> <p>Far from being aligned with the left, Blair adapted himself to their tastes too, but considered party activists to be a \"small group of utterly unrepresentative people\" who \"hijacked the party\" and almost \"tipped it into extinction\". </p> <p>This explains his utter insensitivity to Labour activists in later years. Blair and Harriet Harman had no qualms about sending their children to posh, selective schools, against which Labour workers had been agitating for years.</p> <p>To compensate for this abrasiveness, in office Blair has delivered on his promise of making New Labour a party for which the disillusioned ex-Tories in Middle England could vote. The petrol crisis may have changed all that.</p> <p>And Labour has another problem: 30,000 members have left since 1997. Can the party summon up enough door-knockers to enthuse ex-Labour voters? Even Mo Mowlam is giving up in disgust. Tony Blair will need more than his smile to continue his success.</p> <p>\u0095 One of Britain's best-known and best-informed political biographers, Andrew Roth is the author of Parliamentary Profiles, a renowned series of reference books which has kept track of the doings and sayings of Britain's MPs over the last four decades.

  "Conjoined twins Jodie and Mary, who both faced death if they were not separated by surgeons, must be operated on, the court of appeal ruled today. <p>In a dramatic and long-awaited decision, the three judges sitting in London said doctors should go ahead with the procedure to divide the pair. </p> <p>The operation will condemn \"unviable\" Mary to an almost certain death but save the life of the healthier Jodie. </p> <p>Their devout Roman Catholic parents from the Mediterranean island of Gozo, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had asked the three judges to overturn a high court ruling last month giving surgeons the go-ahead for the operation.</p> <p>But after more than three days of deliberation, they disagreed with the parents and upheld the court's ruling. Solicitors for the parents and Mary were given permission to appeal to the House of Lords.</p> <p> Earlier today, one of the judges had described the decision as an \"excruciating dilemma\".</p> <p>Lord Justice Alan Ward commented on the immense problems posed by the case as he arrived at the London court today and said he believed it was inevitable the decision he and his fellow two judges would eventually make would split the nation.</p> <p>Lord Justice Ward said: \"It has been excruciatingly difficult. One's heart bleeds for the family. Fifty per cent of the population will agree with the decision - 50% will think we have gone potty,\" he said.</p> <p>Doctors admit the operation to separate the two children is bound to result in the death of \"unviable\" Mary, but say it could save healthier Jodie and offer her the chance of a full life. </p> <p>In an unprecedented recent hearing which drew worldwide attention, Lord Justice Ward, sitting in the appeal court with Lord Justice Brooke and Lord Justice Robert Walker, starkly said the court had been asked to decide: \"Do we save Jodie by murdering Mary?\" </p> <p>The case raised for the first time ethical and moral questions which could have a profound impact on the law, particularly with regard to unlawful killing. </p> <p>Critics have already suggested it could provide a way of introducing euthanasia in such tragic cases \"by the back door\". </p> <p>The twins, given false names to protect their identity, were born at St Mary's hospital, Manchester, on August 8, after their parents, who are from a Mediterranean community, came to England to give them the best chance of survival. </p> <p>Following the births, the parents took advice from friends and a priest and decided that separating the twins was \"not God's will\" and nature should take its course, even if that meant the loss of both children. </p> <p>All sides agreed that Mary will have a short existence. She has just a primitive brain and lives only because she is attached to her \"bright and alert\" sister and relies on her heart and lung functions to oxygenate her blood. </p> <p>The court was originally told doctors expected both would die within six months without the operation. But during the hearing new evidence raised \"the horrible spectre\" that they could survive longer, possibly for years, joined together with Mary slowly draining away Jodie's life until both died. </p> <p>However an emotional plea was made to the court by the Archbishop of Westminster for \"innocent\" Mary to be allowed to live out her tragic existence. </p> <p>The Most Rev Cormac Murphy-O'Connor said Mary possessed the same \"basic worth and dignity\" of every human being, adding: \"She has done nothing which could justify killing her\". </p> <p>He rejected the argument that Mary's horrific disabilities made her life \"futile\". He argued the wishes of the parents, who had the best interests of both children equally at heart, should be respected, and the family should be allowed to leave the country, if necessary, and take up an offer of care in Italy.</p>",
  "<p>The new controller of BBC1 has described the decision to approach Mariella Frostrup to front an edition of Panorama as a \"joke\", apparently without realising that the presenter had already been signed up. </p> <p>Lorraine Heggessey said Ms Frostrup would not be appropriate because presenters of the BBC's flagship current affairs show should have \"serious journalistic credentials\" - Ms Frostrup is more known for her velvet-voiced TV commercials than hard-edged journalism. </p> <p>Yet on the day the interview appeared, the BBC confirmed that Ms Frostrup would present a Panorama investigation into the phenomenon of Big Brother-style reality television programmes. The gaffe is an embarrassment for Ms Heggessey, who was only appointed to the position last week. </p> <p>The BBC attempted yesterday to limit the damage caused by her comments, saying she had not been involved in the decision to approach Ms Frostrup. But some BBC figures privately welcomed her remarks, since they appear to display her commitment to serious journalism on BBC1. There had been fears that the channel would become too entertainment-led, under plans to reposition the BBC's television stations. </p> <p>In the interview with the Daily Telegraph, Ms Heggessey was asked about the idea to approach Ms Frostrup, which was first revealed by the Guardian. She replied: \"Mariella's a talented broadcaster but I'm not sure she'd be right for Panorama. I don't know if anybody really did suggest it, but if they did, it was probably said as a joke. The presenter should always be someone with serious journalistic credentials.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the BBC confirmed that Ms Frostrup would present an edition of Panorama as a \"one-off\". She said: \"Lorraine has not yet started as controller of BBC1, and this is not her commission. The decision was taken before she was involved.\" </p> <p>Ms Heggessey was making the point that \"people with the right credentials\" should front all programmes. </p> <p>The BBC insisted Ms Frostrup, with her background in arts and cultural programming - she is a former presenter of a film review show on Channel 4 and fronted the BBC's Edinburgh festival coverage - made her suitable to report on the impact of programmes like Big Brother. </p> <p>The decision to approach Ms Frostrup, made at a time when the BBC is attempting to revive Panorama's flagging ratings, raised eyebrows among senior figures at the programme. </p> <p>In unpublished comments during the same interview, Ms Heggessey did not deny reports that the BBC might reduce Panorama's length from 40 minutes to half an hour. The annual run has been cut from 38 to 30 programmes and the budget increased by \u00a3100,000 in an attempt to revive the show.</p>",

  "George W Bush wasn't supposed to be campaigning in Florida today. The Republican party wasn't supposed to be spending more than $5m on political advertising in Florida this month. <p>When the two main parties did their calculations for the 2000 election, Florida was firmly assigned in the Republican camp.</p> <p>Not any more.</p> <p>The Sunshine State has turned into the surprise state in the 2000 election. With Bush's brother Jeb now installed as its governor since 1998, most of the pundits originally assumed that Florida would revert to the Republicans in the presidential contest after going for Bill Clinton four years ago.</p> <p>Florida's 25 electoral college votes were seen as one of the key building blocks in George W's march on Washington.</p> <p>But it hasn't worked out that way. As the national polls have moved his way over the past month, Al Gore's long-time belief that Florida was winnable has seemed to be increasingly plausible.</p> <p>Three polls in the state this month have produced three different results - one had Gore up by four points, another had Bush ahead by two, while the third had them tied at 41 per cent each.</p> <p>But the disagreement in the polls only adds to the recognition that Florida is \"competitive\".</p> <p>Florida is the largest state in the US of which that can be said.</p> <p>The only larger states are California and New York, both of which are leaning to Gore, and Texas, which is a banker for Bush.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Florida was predictable too, voting the Republican ticket in four straight elections, until Clinton showed that it was not a lost cause to the Democrats in 1996.</p> <p>That's still the case now. Which is why Dubya is working a full Friday in Florida today, with stops in Sarasota, Tampa and Miami.</p> <p>If Florida swings to Gore, then it's all over for Bush. His schedulers had him in the state last week, and now he's there again this week too.</p> <p>To make sure that Bush doesn't get a free run today, the Democrats have directed Joe Lieberman down to Florida today too, to keep up the pressure and eat into Bush's air time.</p> <p>This is classic US electioneering. Every day you are tied down on defence is a day you let your opponent have a day on the attack somewhere else.</p> <p>Gore, meanwhile, will be piling up the votes today in Pennsylvania, a state which used be counted as a toss-up, but where he is now commandingly ahead.</p> <p>Florida is not just important for the presidential election. It also has a key Senate battle.</p> <p>The state's Republican senator Connie Mack is retiring, so there is an \"open\" contest between Democrat Bill Nelson, a genial centrist, and Republican Congressman Bill McCollum, who became a national figure as one of House of Representatives' Clinton impeachment trial \"managers\" last year.</p> <p>For Clinton, therefore, this is a grudge election, and it is one of the few states in which the president intends to make his presence felt during the campaign.</p> <p>Florida also matters a lot in this year's party battle over control of the House.</p> <p>If the Democrats are going to fulfil their second biggest ambition on November 7, they must pick up at least five seats around the US in order to retake the Congress.</p> <p>That would enable them to install Dick Gephardt of Missouri in the Speaker's chair that was captured by Newt Gingrich in 1994 and is now occupied by Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert.</p> <p>Of the 20 or so Republican-held House seats that really matter this time, three are in Florida.</p> <p>There is McCollum's old district around Disney World in southern Orlando, fellow impeachment manager Charles Canady's seat just east of Tampa (Canady is retiring), and Clay Shaw's ocean-front Costa Geriatrica seat, which takes in both Palm Beach and Miami Beach.</p> <p>Shaw's seat, in particular, could be affected by a new factor - as could the statewide races - as Florida's many Jewish retirees from up north grab the chance to vote for Mrs Lieberman's boy Joe.</p> <p>Florida was one of the first Southern states to move solidly away from the Democrats to the Republicans.</p> <p>Though never a classicly \"southern\" state, Florida could now be one of the first to mark a swing back to the Democrats in the region.</p> <p>There is evidence of that swing in neighbouring Georgia, too.</p> <p>But it's the presidential contest in Florida that really matters in the big picture. It explains why Gore has been to the state three times since the Democratic convention.</p> <p>It explains, above all, why Bush - who is enjoying a better few days in the campaign - is back there again today.</p> <p>No Republican since 1924 has won the White House without also winning Florida.</p> <p>Do what Dubya does too. Keep your eye on Florida. It is the state that Bush simply cannot afford to lose.</p>",
  "<p>\"It is just as if,\" said Vaclav Havel, \"we were preparing for civil war.\"</p> <p>Even from his perch up at Prague castle, the Czech president has not failed to notice what is happening down in the city.</p> <p>Schools are closed, hospitals have cancelled all non-urgent operations, the post office says it can't guarantee deliveries, pensioners have been paid to go on holiday away from the city, and others have been warned to stock up on medication and food.</p> <p>A cordon sanitaire has been established in various parts of Prague, and many taxis, convinced that they'll be unable to make money, have said they'll flee to their country cottages.</p> <p>\"And all this so that a bunch of bankers can meet in the comfort of our usually peaceful city,\" said Honza Novak, 77, as he bought a bulging bag-full of instant dumpling mix at Prague's Havelska market.</p> <p>He totally expects that he and his invalid wife will be trapped in their house during \"the siege\".</p> <p>The authorities are preparing for a war of sorts.

When the government put in its bid to host the conference five years' ago, \"Remember Seattle\" was not part of either the activists' or bankers' lexicon.</p> <p>As a result, politicians have been fuelling scare stories and warning people to get out of town or risk facing a situation of armageddon-like proportions.</p> <p>Even the interior minister, the youthful Stanislav Gross, 30, whose career could be on the line if his security plans fail, admits they might be going rather over the top.</p> <p>\"We hope that the biggest criticism the outside world will be able to levy at us at the end of the conference,\" he said, \"is that we over-prepared.</p> <p>\"But we'd rather be safe than sorry.\"</p> <p>As a result, 11,000 police officers - more than a quarter of the country's force - will be on duty, backed up by a reinforcement of 5,000 troops.</p> <p>Water cannons that have not seen the light of day since protests in the run-up to the Velvet Revolution of 1989, are being rolled out, and tear gas equipment has been borrowed from the German neighbours.</p> <p>Jiri Suttner of the police presidium has even advised police officers to think about taking out special insurance at their own expense, in case of serious injury.</p> <p>Hospitals have been teaching their staff what to do in the effect of a biological weapon attack.</p> <p>Yesterday, the National Nuclear Safety Office announced it had drafted in 25 experts and senior officials who will monitor the level of radioactive and toxic substances in the air, \"in case a qualified expert opinion is needed next week,\" a spokesman explained.</p> <p>Throughout the duration of the conference, sanitation officers will check noise levels and the quality of water and food.</p> <p>Demonstrator groups committed to non-violent direct-action say that authorities' scare stories are being used to give them a bad name.</p> <p>\"We hope to create an atmosphere that is festive and celebratory, but that also demonstrates our outrage at the unjust, misguided policies that the IMF and World Bank force upon the world,\" explained Ms Dvorska.</p> <p>Mr Havel has remained one of the few level-headed politicians throughout. \"It's not the demonstrators who are provoking the agitation but the authorities which are constantly informing the press about their preparation,\" he said earlier this week.</p> <p>But the panic continues. The windows of an outlet of Benetton on Na Prikope in central Prague were being boarded over this morning, like many other shops in the vicinity.</p> <p>And workmen at the Intercontinental Hotel were busy building a brown hardboard shell for a rather vulnerable glass atrium that juts out towards the Vltava river.</p> <p>And little wonder, when a headline in the country's leading tabloid hysterically instructed readers to \"barricade your doors and windows\".

  "<b>Dear Derek,</b> <br> Well, what a result! A clutch of medals to kick off the Olympic Games and in... cycling. Whoever would have credited it? Well, probably you for one, since the sport was among those bolstered by a huge dollop of Lottery cash. Which only goes to show that if you throw enough money at a problem it soon goes away. Or does it? <p>If the answer to decades of sporting near misses and spectacular national carpetings is a hothouse, where the chosen few are guided, groomed and whipped into shape, where does that leave the next generation of would-be medal-baggers? Wishing they could be so lucky, I expect. Yvonne McGregor\u0092s sprint for the women\u0092s cycling individual pursuit bronze medal was as agonising to watch as it was inspiring \u0096 I don\u0092t know many 39-year-olds who could run for a bus, let alone career round a velodrome on a bike. But why start a funding programme with athletes at the peak of their careers? Surely the money would have been far better invested at the other end of the spectrum, where the facilities are rank, where there\u0092s never any hot water in the changing rooms and where the kids \u0096 on whom future Olympic medals depend \u0096 will avoid going for anything more energetic than a fag.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Janette Wolf,<br> Editor, SportsCore </p> <p><b>Dear Janette,</b><br> Yes, the medals won by our cyclists have got Great Britain\u0092s Olympic campaign off to a flying start \u0096 as have those from our representatives in shooting, judo, canoeing and the equestrian events. But we hope that it\u0092s only a start. We are, after all, only half way through these games, and, of course, the paralympics are still to come.</p> <p>I am glad you agree that our top-level athletes should be supported. For too long, we have asked our brightest and best sportsmen and women to rely on natural talent and nothing else; juggling training, competition and full-time work. One of the most frustrating parts of my job in the past was to receive letters from potential winners or their parents saying they were giving up because they were broke and could not continue. Most other successful sporting nations provide financial support (of one form or another) to their athletes and, if we are to compete on the world stage, we must have similar systems in place here.</p> <p>You are right, however, to stress the importance of looking beyond our current crop of top-level athletes. In addition to funding those \u0093at the peak of their careers\u0094 our world class programme is beginning also to support the next generation of medal-winners \u0096 those who we want to see win in Commonwealth and Olympic games in the next decade. Now I bet you want us to go further and support those who just want to take part on a recreational basis, especially in schools.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Derek Casey</p> <p><b>Dear Derek,</b><br> Revitalising sports provision in schools is exactly what I had in mind. But I regard this not as a \u0093further\u0094 step as you put it, but as the first one, the most important one, the one you make before you set off for more ambitious destinations like Sydney or Greece.</p> <p>The main reason for this is that we have to provide all children with a sound level of sporting literacy. I\u0092m not talking of those who\u0092d know a Wisden from a jar of Marmite. I\u0092m referring to those basic skills which are the building blocks of sporting activity, whether it is simple hand-eye co-ordination, flexibility or fitness. Imagine, some children pitch up at secondary school not knowing how to stop a ball with their feet. Is it any wonder that the Premier League sides are all packed with foreign imports?</p> <p>We cannot possibly expect to excel in sport on an international stage while our schools have poorly-trained teachers, playing fields that vanish, and where there is a general expectation that it is up to parents to support their kids\u0092 sporting ambitions. I realise of course, that this is hardly your fault, and your scheme to fund national sports co-ordinators will undoubtedly help to raise awareness and hopefully enthusiasm. But what is needed urgently is better all-round sports education within schools.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Janette</p> <p><b>Dear Janette,</b><br> Aren\u0092t we supposed to be arguing with each other? The journey to the top of the medal rostrum does begin with the first PE lesson, where the basic skills to which you refer are taught. And the most important person in British sport is the PE teacher. I believe teachers are doing an excellent job, but often need more training and certainly more resources. Some teachers spend fewer than 10 hours on PE during teacher training, and many that I have spoken with have told me that they feel less confident during lessons as a result. And of course, school sport teaches children so many life and social skills, such as working with others. What better way can youngsters gain the confidence to deal with everyday life?</p> <p>We are working with partners to ensure that teachers get the best support in terms of practical skills and ideas. The TOPs scheme, funded with \u00a37m of Lottery money, provides schools with a range of sports equipment and training in its use. Every primary school in the country will be part of this by July 2001, complementing the new School Sports Co-ordinators.</p> <p>School sport v top level sport? No, it is not a competition between the two. They both feed off each other, the first providing the base; the second, encouragement to youngsters to get involved through watching a role model. I believe sport can also help social and economic regeneration, but I haven\u0092t heard you say much about sport in the local community.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Derek</p> <p><b>Dear Derek,</b><br> The basis of our (delightfully polite) argument as I understand it, is to question whether we should go for instant medal gratification by showering money on our Olympic athletes, while local schools and clubs are reduced to having a whip-round every time they want to fill the holes in the Astroturf. Judging from the media euphoria and the evident relief of BBC presenters, it has been money well spent.</p> <p>I believe however, that this is a short-term and unrealistic approach to raising standards in this much-frustrated, sports-mad country of ours. Yes, it will give youngsters role models in all sorts of sports, but how are they going to emulate this new band of heroes if there are no local facilities, or their own skills have been so poorly nurtured that even one-to-one coaching with Andre Agassi wouldn\u0092t ever make a decent tennis player out of them? </p> <p>Sport performs all sorts of important social functions, as you say. It also promotes life skills like team spirit, self-confidence and a generally healthy approach to life. But if we are ever going to turn our base metal into gold with anything like the panache of Australia or the US, then we are going to have to invert the current funding pyramid so that youth sport gets the lion\u0092s share and gets it first.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Janette</p> <p><b>Dear Janette,</b><br> I have every sympathy with what you say about better facilities. I find it incredibly frustrating when I travel the country and see people still using Victorian baths, sports halls and swimming pools that are no longer of a quality which the community deserves, and clubs crying out for better facilities and equipment.</p> <p>You advocate inverting the pyramid so that more money goes into community sport. In fact it already does, and we mustn\u0092t forget that the cornerstone of sport and recreation is the \u00a31bn per year that local authorities invest in the running of sports centres and the like.</p> <p>The Lottery has allowed us to provide new facilities in partnership with local authorities and the voluntary sector. Participation has doubled in areas where we have funded facilities. We still have much more work to do with young people, in inner cities and deprived rural areas, both to provide recreational sport and to identify local talent. Published figures show that there is a shopping list for swimming pools and sports centres alone, worth some \u00a33-4bn. We agree there\u0092s a long way to go. </p> <p>I\u0092m sure that our collective ambition must be to provide opportunities in schools, access to sport in the community, ways of identifying talent and providing support for top performers. </p> <p>We started this discussion talking about the Olympics and my view is that, at the end of the first week, we can be cautiously optimistic that Lottery funding has made a difference. At the same time, we can also be cautiously optimistic that programmes with schools, local authorities, governing bodies of sport and other partners will pay off in the long-term.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Derek</p> <p>Links: <a href=\"http://www.sportscore.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sportscore.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.english.sports.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.english.sports.gov.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Picture a 1940s Los Angeles detective checking out why those cars have been parked on Paseo Miramar outside the German guy's villa for so long. You probably think noir. You probably think Philip Marlowe. You probably don't think RB Hood. </p> <p>Yet when it came to working the beat in the city that knows how to keep its secrets, Hood was the man. As the special agent in charge of the FBI division in LA throughout much of the 40s and 50s, he had the job of coordinating everything that could be found out about some of the most celebrated foreign exiles ever to make their way to the United States. </p> <p>In the 40s, his job was to spy on Bertolt Brecht, Erich Maria Remarque, Thomas Mann, his brother Heinrich, and dozens of other celebrated refugees from Hitler's Germany, many of whom had come to Hollywood in search of work. Everything that Hood and his fellow G-men found out about them would eventually find its way to FBI chief J Edgar Hoover in Washington. And now their reports have found their way into Alexander Stephan's extraordinary new book documenting the secret surveillance years. </p> <p>During the 30s, dozens of German artists, writers and musicians - many, but not all Jewish - fled the Third Reich and eventually found their way to the US. Though they were exiles from fascism, they remained objects of official suspicion, especially if they had leftwing politics or associations. When the second world war ended and the cold war began, the official suspicions grew stronger not weaker. The FBI called these exiles \"Communazis\" because they believed that though they were refugees from one form of tyranny, they might also be in league with a second form. </p> <p>The fact that the US government kept files on writers as famous as Brecht and Mann is not a new discovery. But Stephan has used American freedom of information law to unearth more than 10,000 pages of new material which vastly extend what is known about the surveillance operations. Everything from the way the writers lived, their conversations, their friends, their private lives and loves - and even the details of the books they were writing - formed part of the steady stream of information sent back to Hoover. </p> <p>Hood and his team of agents were interested in everything that the German writers were up to. They tapped their phones. They opened their mail. They kept watch on them. And they interviewed the writers themselves, their circles and their casual acquaintances - mostly without the Germans having the faintest idea of how closely they were being monitored. </p> <p>When one of the writers met a Russian, or someone who might have contacts with the Russians, Hood kept a note of it. It was Hood who checked the cars outside Lion Feuchtwanger's villa by the ocean. It was Hood who got to know when Heinrich Mann's wife Nelly was stopped for drunken driving in Beverly Hills. It was Hood's men who broke in to Leonhard Frank's house on a fishing expedition for evidence of communist sympathies. And it was Hood's men who searched the luggage of Brecht's mistress, Ruth Berlau. </p> <p>Why the FBI kept track of the German exiles is easy to explain. \"The communist movement\", raged Hoover, \"stands for the destruction of our American form of government\". More surprising was the thoroughness of the surveillance - a thoroughness which in other circumstances might be described as Germanic. </p> <p>Relatively uncontroversial exiles such as Franz Werfel, the Austrian Jewish playwright who married Gustav Mahler's widow Alma, got the same treatment as overtly political writers such as Brecht, who was identified in FBI files as \"a propagandist of communism and sovietism\". </p> <p>Parking your car in the street near the Communist party offices in Los Angeles would merit an entry in Hood's files, as Johanna Kortner, wife of the exiled actor Fritz Kortner, never discovered when she did it inadvertently one day. Writers such as Heinrich Mann, who wrote almost nothing in his late years in the US, would be assiduously documented with the same thoroughness as Feuchtwanger, who continued to write and publish his novels from California, and whose bids for American citizenship Hoover blocked with repeated and ill-concealed glee. </p> <p>By far the biggest fish in Hood's net, however, was Thomas Mann. The author of Buddenbrooks, Death in Venice and The Magic Mountain was, by a considerable distance, the most famous and eminent German writer of his era, as well as the most celebrated of all the exiles who set tled in the US. As the winner of the Nobel prize for literature and a major public figure, Mann was a hugely influential voice. Any attempts by him to become involved in organisations of which Hoover was suspicious - or attempts by such groups to recruit him - were carefully tracked and recorded by the FBI, as well as by other American security organisations and by the state department. </p> <p>The portion of Mann's career in the US which most alarmed the watchers was an attempt to form a German exile organisation in America, with Mann as its leader and figurehead. In 1943, the office of strategic services (the forerunner of the CIA) tried to frustrate such a move. \"Thomas Mann is extremely important and useful for any group which might be needed later,\" the OSS recorded, and managed to convey their views to the novelist, who duly backed away from the plan. Mann was in a category of his own. He seems to have been too major a figure to be placed under routine surveillance of the kind to which both his brother Heinrich and his son Klaus - as well as Feuchtwanger and Brecht - were subjected. </p> <p>Klaus Mann, the author of Mephisto, was a particularly frequent FBI target. Even his postman was recruited as an informant. Klaus attracted attention partly because of his leftwing politics, but also because of his homosexuality. The files unearthed by Stephan refer to Mann as \"a well-known sexual pervert\" with \"communistic sympathies\". </p> <p>The bureau's files contain some very detailed surveillance. When Klaus Mann stayed in the Bedford Hotel in New York, an informant identified only as \"T3\" reported that a soldier \"with fair complexion and dirty blond hair\" stayed overnight with him regularly. \"Informant advised that the only suitable sleeping place in Mann's room is a single bed\", the files report. \"Informant further advised that quite a number of 'longhairs' go in and out to see Mann.\" </p> <p>The FBI snoopers speculated that Mann may have had a sexual relationship with his sister Erika, one- time wife of WH Auden. \"Confidential informants\" told agents that the two were having an affair, one file reports. Erika Mann was described in the files as having her hair cut \"in a short mannish bob with a part on the right side\" and to be close to a group of political actors who were \"members of the Hebrew race\". </p> <p>In the end, though, Erika Mann turned the tables on her watchers. She became an informant as early as 1940, and for much of the next 15 years cooperated willingly with dozens of inquiries about members of the German exile community, some of whom she too suspected of pro-Nazi connections. </p> <p>It was an approach which landed her in increasing difficulties as the cold war developed. When the two Soviet spies Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean defected to Russia in May 1951, Mann was hauled in by the FBI, who suspected that, with her connections, she might have useful information about Burgess in particular. But she had not even heard of the defections until the FBI agents told her about them. </p> <p>\"Erika Mann seems to have talked with US agencies like the FBI more openly and for a longer period than any other exiled writer,\" Stephan concludes. No such thing can be said of Bertolt Brecht's case, on which Stephan has unearthed more than 400 pages of new documents. \"He is of sufficient importance to international communism that the Bureau should be aware of all his activities and contacts,\" says one document. In another, dated April 1943, special agent Hood sent a memo to Hoover to start internment proceedings against the poet and playwright. In a third, offering a curious tribute, the OSS classifies Brecht as \"a gifted dramatist\" and a \"poet of expressionistic vigour\". \"Subject is a writer of communist and revolutionary poetry and drama,\" Hood reported to Washington. \"Is looked upon by German communists as their poet laureate.\" </p> <p>Hood was as assiduous as ever, sending Hoover English versions, translated by FBI linguists, of one of Brecht's longhand poems. \"The poem specifically refers to a United States steamer which was destroyed by its crew since they were paid too small wages,\" Hood informed Hoover. Brecht's play, Die Massnahme, was also translated inside the bureau for Hood to send to Hoover. \"A self-styled 'educational play' which advocates communist world revolution by violent means,\" Hood reported. </p> <p>Many of the new documents on Brecht show how seriously the FBI took the links between the poet and the so-called Free German exiles in Mexico, many of whom were unable to get into the US, and Moscow. \"It is recommended that the following subjects be placed in the National Censorship Watch List for 90 days,\" petitioned Hood: \"1. [name blacked out], 2. Bertolt Brecht, 1063 26th Street, Santa Monica, California, 3. [name blacked out].\" </p> <p> In 1945, the FBI began tapping Brecht's phone calls and mail. The records show contacts with Hollywood greats such as Charles Laughton, Charlie Chaplin and Billy Wilder - as well as conversations about a friend's plan to store some furniture in Brecht's garage. The contents are often banal, and even merely take the form of a list. \"A letter postmarked February 7 was received by Brecht fromWH Auden, 16 Oberlin Avenue, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania\" is all that one entry tantalisingly contains. Others are poignant. \"Love, I am so glad that you are fighting so courageously,\" Brecht is reported to have written to his lover Ruth Berlau after she had given birth to their child (who soon died). \"Don't think that I do not want to see you when you are ill. You are very beautiful then too.\" </p> <p>Stephan takes a lenient view of the story which he has unearthed. Not one of the exiles \"was murdered, tortured, deported back to Europe and turned over to the Gestapo\", he writes. \"Nor do the files indicate that agency interrogations had a direct negative influence on a writer's career\". The catalogue of sins committed by the FBI and the other agencies was modest, he judges. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Stephan believes the last word should lie with the great American jurist Justice Louis Brandeis, who wrote in 1928: \"The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Communazis: FBI Surveillance of German Emigr\u00e9 Writers, is published by Yale University Press in October</p>",

  "<p>Telecoms regulator Oftel has issued \"tough\" guidelines on the roll-out of broadband internet access in the UK, amid mounting criticism that BT is holding up the process. </p> <p>BT said it is seeking clarification on the guidelines, particularly the demand that its exchanges be made available within four months. A spokesperson said this should apply only to four trial exchanges, which will be ready by January. </p> <p>The news represents the latest bout of uncertainty in a process that this week saw Oftel bow to pressure from telecoms operators and select 360 BT exchanges for the installation of broadband equipment.

I am determined to implement it as quickly as possible so that all companies can compete fairly to deliver these revolutionary new high-speed services.\"</p> <p>Edmonds has gone back to the drawing board after admitting earlier this week that Oftel should have been firmer in its handling of the process and submitted proposals sooner.</p> <p>The announcement comes as operators' complaints over BT's behaviour reach a crescendo, with RSL Communications and Global Crossing withdrawing from the bidding process and Colt Telecom demanding a quicker roll out. </p> <p>US telecoms group WorldCom yesterday also stepped away, citing \"commercial and business reasons\", while denying any frustration with BT.</p> <p>RSL said the broadband internet market was wide open for BT, because initial access for rival operators is restricted to local exchanges.

  "<p>Every so often a no-budget independent film sneaks out that is so fresh, it makes everything else at the cinema look old hat. Swingers, a sharply observed twist on the romantic comedy that Jon Favreau wrote when his career as an actor was stuttering, was one of those films. Its release in 1996 spawned catchphrases (\"You're so money!\"), a revival of lounge clubs in Canada, and countless homages as twentysomethings were inspired to tell their own tale. </p> <p>Among the many such scripts Favreau has received in the past five years was Valerie Breiman's Love and Sex, a study of one woman's contorted relationship history that so caught his attention that he agreed to star in it, opposite Famke Janssen. He soon discovered just how autobiographical Breiman's script was: while directing, she developed a habit of rushing on set and telling her actors: \"No, it happened more like this.\" </p> <p>Breiman's film lacks the verbal and visual inventiveness that made Swingers such a delight, but this never impinges on Favreau's performance: he inhabits his character, Adam, like it's his favourite pair of pyjamas. Favreau has nothing but admiration for Breiman: \"I don't think anyone is getting the new independent voice particularly right,\" he says, with the authority of one who is certain he has, \"and it's rare that you come across a strong, personal, well-written film like Love and Sex.\" </p> <p>He sounds like Breiman's agent, but genuine too - a quality that emerges repeatedly. When he describes his co-starring role in Love and Sex as \"a really good second fiddle\", he radiates an unassuming geniality that you wouldn't expect from a Hollywood player. On film, his old-fashioned niceness recalls romantic heroes of the black-and-white era: watching him bantering with Janssen, he makes you think of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan in The Shop Around the Corner. His characters aren't perfect - \"I don't mind playing guys who look foolish,\" he says - but they are essentially good, something that is important to him. </p> <p>\"I would never want to do a rape scene, for example,\" he says. \"It's hard to weigh in on the subject because of the movement towards censorship, but there's a moral imperative in film-making to realise that some people are looking to the screen to learn their lessons. I certainly did.\" </p> <p>He was born in New York in 1966, and although his grandmother, father and - before her death when Favreau was 12 - his mother were all teachers, he dropped out of university. He moved to Chicago, and eight years passed in a frustrating haze of adverts and minor parts. Favreau is grateful that fame was elusive: \"Prince William,\" he says, \"is 18, he's on the cover of magazines, and he hasn't done anything. I feel sorry for him. At 30 I was in a movie that brought me a lot of attention, I'm getting to do what I want to do and this is the price I pay for it. And then, I'm in a relationship with a woman I probably wouldn't have met if it hadn't been for Swingers, because that was how she approached me: to discuss that film.\" Doesn't he feel like he's stepped aside from real life? \"Yeah,\" he grins, \"but I never liked the other life that much anyway.\" </p> <p>Favreau's career reads like a boy's fantasy. He was Courteney Cox's millionaire boyfriend in Friends and Cameron Diaz's fiance in Very Bad Things. He's been an astronaut (Deep Impact), a football player (The Replacements, yet to be released here), even Rocky Marciano in a made-for-TV biopic. \"Boys get into acting because they want to meet girls,\" Favreau smiles, \"but it's also to be like a little kid playing cowboys and indians.\" </p> <p>At the moment Favreau is editing Made, about two boxers from LA getting swallowed up in New York's crime underbelly, which he has written, produced, starred in and directed. This behind-the-scenes control allows him to help other wannabe actors to break into cinema. On Made, that hopeful is none other than Sean \"Puffy\" Combs. </p> <p>Favreau's praise of the buffoonish rapper is unsurprisingly effusive, and it's hard not to laugh when he innocently describes Puffy as \"a man who brings a lot of life experience to what he's doing\", including his role in Made as a New York crime don. Puffy's involvement did mean that New York's clubs were delighted to accommodate Favreau's cameras; on the downside, his time with Puffy proved to him that his Swingers-style party days are numbered. \"It was interesting to get a taste of it,\" he says, \"but I couldn't hang out with him every night. I can't keep up with him that well.\"</p>",
  "<p> With their stunning bad taste and cheerfully offensive excursions into racial and sexual comedy, the Farrelly brothers have given much amusement, and in the process become Hollywood's licensed jesters in their own carefully delineated field of non-PC entertainment. Me, Myself &amp; Irene, starring Jim Carrey, is their new venture. Broader than broad, it is written, produced and directed by Peter and Bobby, with credits for Mike Cerrone and Bradley Thomas on script and production. </p> <p>And they give us everything we hope and expect of them - plus a bit more. Frantic masturbation scene involving a sweet young woman? Check. Pointlessly violent assault on a defenceless animal? Check. Jokes involving racial and minority groups? Check. But there's one group in particular to be offended - retards! (I am quoting the exquisitely provocative formulation used by Matt Dillon in There's Something About Mary.) Peter and Bobby raise the issue of those who are, as they say, mentally challenged and appear to add a raucous challenge of their own. </p> <p>The brothers get away with most of these flourishes on account of their sheer insouciant conviction and comic brio, plus the unspoken understanding that the jibes are a slap at white liberal condescension. But it isn't obvious that the gags about crazy people quite come off - of which more in a moment. </p> <p>Jim Carrey gives us his usual body-popping, face-squeezing, crowd-pleasing masterclass in physical comedy. With his open, innocent expression, buzz cut and air of perpetual perplexity, he looks like no one so much as Dick York in the 60s TV show Bewitched. </p> <p>He plays Charlie Baileygates, an all-American white-bread regular guy and Rhode Island state trooper whose life is shattered when his bride falls in love with the, ahem, vertically challenged African-American limo driver who ferries them home from the church. She runs off, leaving Charlie with three black triplets, and Charlie is in denial about his feelings, until they boil over 15 years later in the form of a bizarre split personality. Or, as this film insists on putting it, schizophrenia. Thereafter Charlie's Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with a young woman called Irene (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), who is on the run from corrupt federal officials led by the sinister Lt Gerke (a reliably excellent Chris Cooper). </p> <p>There is a scene at the very beginning of this film in which the Farrellys' horrible genius is deployed to its fullest. On his wedding day, poor, inoffensive Charlie inadvertently offends his small black driver, who erupts with rage and ends up attacking him with what look like martial-arts nunchakas. Naturally, only a real nincompoop could object to this scene; in its sheer excessive outrageousness, it is brilliant, but it also functions unmistakably as a little pre-emptive strike at any uptight bores who are thinking of whining about offensiveness. Here is a funny black midget, it is saying, and here is a joke about someone accidentally offending him. OK? </p> <p>Then there is the uproarious scene in which Charlie and Irene find a dead cow in the road; trying to carry it out of the way, Charlie discovers it is actually still alive but in agony. So he tries to kill it, first by emptying his pistol into its head and then by strangling it, while the persistent beast moos merrily away. It's inspired in its own delirious way, and let down only by the fact that it is obviously some sort of animatronic cow. </p> <p>The inevitable self-pleasuring scene comes when Irene enters Charlie's hotel room, dismayed to find him with an official police photo of her, surrounded by sticky crumpled tissues and an absurdly large dispenser of hand-cream. This hardly has the inventiveness of the legendary Cameron-Diaz-hair-gel sequence from There's Something About Mary, which was actually a comment of tactless inspiration on the way modern media encourage male consumers literally and figuratively to jerk off over female images like the miraculously beautiful Diaz. But it does have that bull-in-a-china-shop aptness, an acknowledgement of the open secret of adult male masturbation rarely found in any other film of any genre. </p> <p>But now we come back to the \"schizophrenia\" issue, which has had mental health charities up in arms. The split-personality device gives Carrey an opportunity for his usual bravura dual-character playing, in the tradition of the Nutty Professors of Jerry Lewis and Eddie Murphy, and Steve Martin in All of Me. His condition is repeatedly described as \"advanced involuntary schizophrenia\". Do the Farrelly boys realise that \"schizophrenia\" is an ignorant solecism here? Worryingly, the answer isn't clear. </p> <p>The classic definition of a gentleman is someone who never gives offence accidentally. Something similar applies to the Farrellys' brand of non-PC mischief if it is to be successful. But here it looks oddly as if the brothers have simply blundered. Here their sophistication, and their attack radar for mealy-mouthed liberal sensibilities, have gone a bit wrong. </p> <p>The gag rate of Me, Myself &amp; Irene falls off exponentially in the last half of the picture, and there's a bit of straining to make the plot ends tie up. There's a lot of crazy energy and debonair disregard for the rules of liberal good taste; but when the laughs fall away and the comedy-nous falters, these things get very wearing indeed.</p>",
  "<p>The director of Get Carter, one of the hardest, seediest, most brutal depictions of poverty-backdropped criminal life ever committed to celluloid, lives in a lovely cottage deep in rural Dorset. It is hidden away down a rough dirt track, and is surrounded by a large garden with hammocks and apple trees. \"I'm a small man, and quite a gentle one,\" says Mike Hodges, whose most recent film, Croupier, has become an unexpected US success, two years after FilmFour made it clear that they weren't going to help their own product find a distributor in Britain. \"I don't think I've ever punched anyone in my life. But after the success of Carter, women treated me differently. I had criminals come up to me and say, 'Well done for telling it like it is.' I wanted to hang my head and hide.\" </p> <p>Hodges' career has been coloured by a discernible lack of pattern. Having started off on World in Action documentaries, he is best known for two films at the opposite end of the spectrum: the violent reality of Get Carter, the story of a bitter man seeking revenge against villains; and the camp fantasy of Flash Gordon, telling the story of a hunk battling Ming the Merciless. He has also made the sci-fi drama The Terminal Man, Pulp, starring Caine again, and the comedy Morons From Outer Space. </p> <p>\"People should come out at the end of a film not being conscious of the director,\" says Hodges. \"Obviously someone like Hitchcock has an immediately recognisable style, but I've always felt that the pot pourri of the film-making process should dictate how the film should be; that the film itself will tell the director what is needed.\" </p> <p>So what kind of films would be in the video collection of a director with such an eclectic style? Documentaries figure heavily. \"In the mid-90s there were three excellent ones from America, the first of which was Crumb [Terry Zwigoff's film about cartoonist Robert Crumb's family]. It was so detailed, such an incredible portrayal of the couch grass of emotions between this extraordinary family, it makes most other documentaries seem terribly superficial. Then there's Hoop Dreams, again shot over a long period of time so that the film-makers became part of the woodwork and everything was allowed to emerge naturally; and When We Were Kings. I was working in the States in the 70s when TV was in control of the networks, and the only time you would see anything political was on the Sunday morning documentaries. I suppose those three came out of that tradition. And I keep a lot of documentaries here because they always prove useful as source material.\" </p> <p>Hodges does not use these classics for borrowing, though. \"All this cross-referencing I find a little embarrassing. For Carter, I drew on my experiences in the navy, where I met a really seamy side of British society. The ports we went to were poverty-stricken, and when I shot Carter 15 years later, I went back to North Shields. It was perfect for a hard visualisation of what Jack was like. It had to be a ruthless, uncompromising film and you couldn't romanticise the world it was portraying.\" </p> <p>A little different from the world of Flash Gordon, then. \"That was based on a comic strip so it had to be like a strip cartoon, and he's the perfect American hero, very dumb indeed. But I was making it with Dino de Laurentiis and an Italian set designer who was completely out of control. He created a set for Arborea, with trees the circumference of this room, and he would say, 'Eesn't eet fantasteec?' And I would say, 'But where am I supposed to put the camera?' He didn't look at the script once.\" </p> <p>Other films in the Dorset living room include Truffaut, early Godard, Billy Wilder and John Huston. \"And there's no one to replace the great film-makers like Bergman, Kurosawa and Fellini. I did the English version of a Fellini film called The Ship Sails On, and had to go out to Rome to meet him. A born director. We sat down at a restaurant for lunch, about 10 of us, and he'd say, 'No no, this table isn't in the right direction.' So we'd all get up and move it, then he'd change his mind and we'd move it again. He was a charming reprobate, and absolutely hopeless when it came to telling the truth.\" </p> <p>Hodges admits to being out of touch with modern directors. \"Spielberg and Lucas have done enormous damage to the film art. The music tells you how to emote and feel, it's a button being pushed, it's Pavlovian. I like some of the Coen brothers films, and Scorsese I really admire. Woody Allen's are wonderfully made but rather too smart for me. I didn't like American Beauty. There's a very good film called Happiness which made American Beauty look ludicrous.\" </p> <p>Hodges was prepared to give up film-making after FilmFour boss David Aukin told him that the only thing he liked about Croupier was the end credits, but its subsequent success in America has revitalised him. \"They're so starved of films with any intellectual content that they went for it,\" he says.</p>",
  "There will be a full public inquiry into the crimes of Harold Shipman, the doctor convicted of murdering 15 of his patients by lethal injection, the health secretary Alan Milburn said yesterday. <p>The high court had ordered Mr Milburn to reconsider his decision to hold the inquiry in private and it is likely that the hearing - expected to take months - will be held in Manchester later this year. </p> <p>A chairman has yet to be appointed after Lord Laming, who would have chaired a private hearing, stood down. </p> <p>The families of Shipman's victims and eight national newspapers successfully ar gued that there should be a judicial review of Mr Milburn's decision and in July, Lord Justice Kennedy ruled that holding the inquiry in private would breach section 10 of the European convention on human rights. The health secretary was asked to reconsider. </p> <p>The Department of Health said yesterday the inquiry would be held under the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act which gives the chairman legal powers to compel witnesses to appear and recover any documents. Similar hearings were held following the Aberfan and Dunblane disasters. </p> <p>It will look at how Shipman was able to murder patients undetected for years, how he obtained drugs and how he was able to cover his tracks by altering medical records and ensuring patients were cremated without postmortem examinations. </p> <p>Ann Alexander, the solicitor representing 150 families, said she was confident the inquiry would be able to investigate the background to Shipman's murders with the rigour needed to ensure questions were answered and that lessons were learned. </p> <p>But it is unlikely that Shipman, serving 15 life sentences in Frankland Prison, Durham, will be invited to attend the hearing. </p> <p>In January, Shipman, a former GP in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was convicted of the murder of 15 patients by lethal diamorphine injections. </p> <p>Inquests into the deaths of two more patients have recorded verdicts of unlawful killings. A third inquest into the death of Elizabeth Mellor will take place next week. </p> <p>The death toll from Shipman's killing spree could be as high as 200. </p> <p>Ms Alexander said the outcome of the inquiry could have widespread implications for family doctors, coroners and for the police. </p> <p>\"The health secretary has obviously taken the sensible course of action and we will make absolutely sure that no stone will be left unturned,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The inquiry will establish how he was able to get away with killing so many of his patients for so long. It will look at the systems GPs operate within - what controls are in place and how they get hold of drugs.\" </p> <p>She added that the public inquiry would also look at how Shipman was able to kill three more women after an initial police investigation in March 1998 had cleared him of any wrongdoing. </p> <p>Ms Alexander said the relatives of all of the former doctor's victims wanted to hear for themselves what those involved in the Shipman case had to say. </p> <p>She added that she felt sorry for the families who had been through a long criminal trial, then had to wait almost a year before getting a public inquiry. </p> <p>Jane Ashton-Hibbert, whose grandmother Hilda Hibbert, 81, died at her home in Hyde while being treated by Shipman in 1996, said she was delighted with the news. </p> <p>\"I am very pleased and I am glad it is going to be a 1921 Act inquiry,\" she said. \"It is going to be very thorough - it's going to have teeth. I think we feel that if it is in the open, people are more inclined to speak freely.\" </p> <p>Helen Blackwell, whose mother Bertha Moss, 68, died five years ago, said the public inquiry was vital. </p> <p>\"We need to get it out in the open and to know what went wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>During the summer, Sir Richard Branson telephoned this office in something of a lather. He took issue with a piece of commentary which implicitly questioned his motives in bidding to run the national lottery. </p> <p>His lawyers, Slaughter &amp; May, were on the case, but Sir Richard could not wait. </p> <p>\"Who wrote it?\" he demanded. \"I did,\" came the hesitant reply. </p> <p>\"No you didn't. Tom Bower wrote it.\" </p> <p>\"No, I wrote it.\" </p> <p>\"Well, you must have spoken to him.\" </p> <p>\"No, we've never spoken.\" </p> <p>At that, Sir Richard softened. The lawyers were called off. He had convinced himself, unnecessarily, that Bower, an investigative author whom he had accused of libel, was teasing out titbits of information ahead of publication of his biography of Britain's Best Loved Entrepreneur. </p> <p>Ever since it became known that Bower was targeting Branson, there had been a frisson of excitement in the world of Virgin watchers. This was the author who lifted the lid on men like Maxwell and Fayed. If there was any dirt to be dug on the Virgin empire, Bower was the man to dig it. The book was finally published yesterday (Branson, by Tom Bower; \u00a317.99, Fourth Estate) and just a quick read explains Sir Richard's paranoia. </p> <p>This is 380 pages of unrelenting hostility, charting the businessman's story from his pushy mother to his current, desperate pursuit of the Big Game. It is an addictive read, packed with sex, money, tantrums - top quality tabloidese from beginning to end. Yet it tells us precious little we did not already know about Sir Richard and his business dealings over the past 30 years. </p> <p>Yes, he duped customs and excise with a mail order record scam back in 1969. Yes, he uses a web of offshore trusts and companies to avoid British tax. And yes, he likes women and has pursued them with some energy. </p> <p>Two years in the making, the most serious allegation thrown up after 250 interviews concerns the move to take the Virgin group off the stock exchange and back into private hands 12 years ago. </p> <p>The \"explosive\" revelation is that while Virgin's investors were offered cash for their shares which valued the business at \u00a3248m, Sir Richard had already agreed a deal with a Japanese media firm named Pony Canyon to buy a stake in the newly private Virgin at a price which valued the group at \u00a3377m. </p> <p>The implication is that Sir Richard held back material information, possibly breaking the City's takeover panel code. If Virgin's shareholders had known about the Pony Canyon transaction, they might not have accepted the price offered by Sir Richard - even though this was double the Virgin share price be fore the move to take the company private. </p> <p>This is a grey area of the law. As Bower knows, the City always distrusts management buyouts such as this; big shareholders assume the managers know more about how much the business is worth. They almost expect to be ripped off. </p> <p>Bower has failed to deliver proof that Sir Richard is unfit to run the lottery. He has produced an ugly portrait of the man - but he has not penetrated the complex web of Virgin's offshore trusts. A missed opportunity, perhaps.</p>",
  "<p>The world's two largest tobacco manufacturers are being sued over allegations that they are actively involved in organised crime. </p> <p>Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are accused of widespread smuggling and money laundering in a writ filed by a consortium of Colombian states. </p> <p>The notice, filed in the US district court in Brooklyn, New York, claims the companies \"directly and indirectly\" smuggled cigarettes into Colombia. </p> <p>The pair, it alleges, took part in racketeering activity which included money laundering, wire fraud and mail fraud. </p> <p>Their actions, states the document, have deprived the republic of Colombia of billions of dollars in taxes, while expanding the market for contraband cigarettes. </p> <p>A copy of the writ obtained by the Guardian alleges the defendants created a \"sophisticated and clandestine smuggling operation\" which operated throughout the world. </p> <p>\"Defendants have conceived, directed, controlled and implemented an international conspiracy to defraud the plaintiffs and deprive them of money and property, in order to increase their profits and market share.\" </p> <p>The US law firm acting on behalf of the Colombian states, Speiser, Krause, Nolan &amp; Granito, refused to comment. </p> <p>A New York legal source said that the action was being taken under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and the writ would be served on the companies over the next couple of days. They will then have around 20 days to respond. </p> <p>Clive Bates, of anti-smoking group Ash, said he was pleased legal action was being taken against the companies. </p> <p>\"We want recognition that tobacco companies are intimately involved in large scale smuggling,\" he said. </p> <p>Last night, British American Tobacco said it had not been served with a writ, and insisted that any such action would be \"defended vigorously\". </p> <p>A spokesman said the company had always worked closely with the Colombian states to eradicate smuggling. </p> <p>\"We reject the US court action and a law suit which al leges actions, including smuggling, as completely without merit,\" he said. \"It is also noteworthy that neither the Colombian government nor the Colombian customs authorities have supported the action by the plaintiffs.\" </p> <p>At the time of going to press no comment had been received from Philip Morris. </p> <p>Morris, whose brands include Marlboro and Virginia Slims, and BAT, which is behind Dunhill and Lucky Strike, are two of the leading forces in an industry riddled with controversy. Recent years have seen an unprecedented number of lawsuits filed across the world against manufacturers. </p> <p>British American Tobacco already faces an official inquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry into allegations it actively encouraged and profited from cigarette smuggling after a cross-party committee of MPs agreed to demand an investigation. </p> <p>Earlier this year a jury in the US ordered five of the world's largest companies - including Philip Morris and BAT's US arm Brown &amp; Williamson - to pay a record $145bn (\u00a397bn) for harming the health of hundreds of thousands of smokers in Florida.</p>",
  "By sunrise today the first mass will be over and villagers will disperse to homes and workplaces. This evening they will return to the church to hear if their prayers have been answered. <p>Judgment day has come but the villagers have been praying for different outcomes. The God they worship has not spared them the tormenting uncertainty over the fate of the conjoined twins Mary and Jodie. </p> <p>Some defy the priest and secretly pray that this afternoon's ruling by three British court of appeal judges will overrule the parents by allowing the separation to go ahead, killing Mary to save Jodie. Others pray that nature will be allowed to take its course, even if it means both girls will die. </p> <p>Others pray for a miracle, for the whispers to be true: in the past few days a rumour has spread that Mary does have a functioning heart after all, and could survive without Jodie. </p> <p>There is no such evidence but this community, whose location cannot be disclosed for legal reasons, is in awe of the dilemma confronting the twins' parents. </p> <p>Here there is no oak-panelled court room, just cacti, a sea breeze and sunbaked fields, but the arguments that ripple through the community are the same as those convulsing Britain's philosophers, ethicists and law lords. </p> <p>Here, 95% of the population is practising Catholic and churches sprout from the surrounding hills. Mass is said six times a day, grottoes of the Virgin Mary adorn street corners and abortion is illegal. </p> <p>Appearing drawn and pale in her living room, the babies' paternal grandmother spoke falteringly. She has been in regular telephone contact with her son but refrains from asking details to avoid upsetting him further. </p> <p>\"It is out of our hands now,\" she said. \"We can only wait to see what happens. It has been so difficult, so difficult. We cannot do anything more except pray.\" </p> <p>Half a mile away the maternal grandmother, hanging washing in a garden of fig trees, shook her head and refused to speak. Neighbours said she has become a virtual recluse. </p> <p>A life-sized statue of the Virgin Mary clutching an infant Jesus gazes out across the dusty, deserted street where the family lives. </p> <p>A neighbour sweeping her porch questioned whether the birth was a manifestation of God's will. \"It is horrible, it just breaks your heart. No family should have to go through that,\" she said. </p> <p>\"We have been counting down the days [to the ruling] but don't know what to expect. It doesn't seem right that judges make the decision.\" </p> <p>But the compassion was tinged with resentment. Mary, the weaker twin, has no viable separate biological existence because she lack lungs and a heart. If they are not separated Jodie will die from the strain of supporting Mary. </p> <p>The more time elapses the more likely it is that Jodie will become permanently brain damaged, which her parents said would make it almost impossible to rear her on the island. </p> <p>In a written court statement, the parents said that if they returned with Jodie alive but seriously disabled, some superstitious islanders would regard her as punishment for an earlier sin. </p> <p>The neighbour said that was nonsense. \"Decades ago perhaps, but not now, there is very little stigma left, if any. For years we all took turns looking after a friend's daughter who had Down's syndrome.\" </p> <p>Disabled children are no longer hidden and brought to festivals, she said. A respite centre for disabled children and their parents is due to open this year and the hospital several miles from their home is well-equipped and has a paediatrician who is confident of treating all but the most serious cases. A paediatric cardiology unit is 20 minutes away by helicopter. </p> <p>Tapping his nose, another local said of the written statement: \"If it helps them win then OK. Just don't go thinking we are all primitive.\" </p> <p>Despite the court ban on naming the family or the area in which they live, everyone here knows who they are, right down to newly arrived tourists. A newspaper which started a website poll on whether Mary and Jodie should be separated recorded 70% in favour of the operation, despite the opposition of the Catholic church which says no life should be taken. </p> <p>The parents' main argument is that the surgical separation of the twins would kill Mary and wilful killing is against their religious beliefs. </p> <p>Sitting in a pew near the altar of his Romanesque church, the village priest claimed the congregation had responded positively when he preached against separation. </p> <p><b> Immoral</b><br> </p> <p> \"It is the same principle as organ donation,\" he said. \"Transplants are valid and moral when the donor is dead, but Mary is not dead. She is alive, she is a human being. It is wrong to kill her, no matter how good the intention. </p> <p>\"No one knows how long the twins might live. First the doctors said six months. Now some say two years. Should Mary be denied that? And what if the rumour is true, what if she does have a heart of her own?\" </p> <p>In the square outside the church, a cafe terrace hosted two groups of male villagers discussing the case, their arguments were punctuated by long silences. </p> <p>A budding consensus that Jodie should be saved broke down over whether Mary's resulting death would be an unintended effect, and thus acceptable, or euthanasia - effectively murder. </p> <p>One man said both deaths would be tragic but that the two innocents, baptised in Manchester, would be guaranteed eternal peace in the kingdom of heaven. Those on either side shook their heads but said nothing. </p> <p>They agreed to meet again today for evening mass. A friend of the family stood up to leave. \"We can talk all day about what the parents should do, and what we would do if we were in their shoes, but the truth of it is we don't have a clue. Only if it happens to your own blood can you know.\" <br><br><b>The judges </b></p> <p>The three judges hearing the case of conjoined twins Jodie and Mary have, in effect, the awesome responsibility of ruling which of the sisters has the greatest claim to life. </p> <p>Yet the legal system makes it almost impossible for the public to examine the judges' personal or religious views - views which might influence their outlook. </p> <p>British law insists that a judge's \"religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, age, class, means or sexual orientation\" should not be a factor in deciding whether he or she is fit to hear a case. It could be said that as they base their decisions on the law rather than their beliefs then their own faith is irrelevant. </p> <p>But some observers have argued that as religion has played an important role in the case - the parents have said they cannot agree to the operation to separate the twins because of their faith and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy-O'Connor has been allowed to make his submissions - the beliefs of the judges could be relevant. </p> <p>All three judges have religious backgrounds, though they have declined to talk about their beliefs. They are also family men with 13 children between them and the senior judge, Lord Justice Ward, has twin daughters. </p> <p><b> Lord Justice Ward</b> , 62, is a former pupil of the Christian Brothers college in Pretoria, South Africa. The college offered what it describes as \"holistic education based on Catholic traditions\". He married in a Church of England ceremony in Somerset in 1963 while at Cambridge University and was called to the Bar the following year. </p> <p>He had one son and two daughters by his first marriage and was divorced in 1982. He remarried the following year and had twin daughters in 1984. From 1988 to 1995 he was a judge in the high court's family division and has been a lord justice in the court of appeal since 1995. </p> <p>At times he brought religion into the hearing. He said: \"It was not God's will that [Mary, the weaker twin] should live because it was not born with the capability of living.\" He also said that one law we have was \"handed down from Mount Sinai - thou shalt not kill\". </p> <p><b> Lord Justice Brooke</b> , 64, is from a family with a strong Anglican tradition. His maternal grandfather was a canon and his uncle a former dean and rector of St Albans. His brother, the former Northern Ireland secretary and Conservative party chairman, Peter Brooke, was chairman of the National Conference of Student Christian Movement and a lay adviser to St Paul's cathedral. </p> <p>A father of three sons and one daughter, Lord Justice Brooke is a former chairman of the Law Commission who became a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1996. </p> <p>He brought religion into the case when he pointed out that much of today's law is founded on case law made by judges \"long ago\" who based their findings on Judaeo-Christian principles. </p> <p><b> Lord Justice Walker</b> , 62, was educated at one of Britain's most famous Catholic schools, Downside in Bath, which was founded by Benedictine monks in the 17th century. He married in Hampstead register office, in north London, in 1962 and has one son and three daughters. </p> <p>Seen by insiders as the most \"intellectually rigorous\" of the trio, he practised at the Chancery Bar between 1961 and 1994 before being promoted first as a judge of the high court chancery division and since 1997 has been a lord justice of appeal </p> <p><b> Steven Morris</b></p>",
  "<p>Lord Melchett's surprise victory in Norfolk crown court has run a coach and horses through Michael Meacher's patiently crafted solution for dealing with the British public's virulent opposition to genetically modified crops. Contrary to expectation, the jury cleared Lord Melchett and 27 other Greenpeace campaigners of criminal damage on Tuesday despite their own admission that they had destroyed a GM maize crop. What now lies in ruins is the government's approach of allowing farm-scale crop trials, but banning commercial growing of GM crops until the trials are complete. The verdict is a green light to protesters and signals to farmers that such is the public distrust of GM, their fields have little or no legal protection. </p> <p>What will be worrying Mr Meacher is that the ban was effectively a voluntary agreement by the seed companies. Given that the GM seeds had already got EU approval, they have every right to sell them in this country and they would have the backing of European law to do so. They sensibly know such a route would be a public relations fiasco. For the politicians, it would be a disaster, a dangerous conflation of two of the British public's pet hates: GM and Brussels. The task ahead for Mr Meacher is how to keep the seed companies on board. </p> <p>The bigger political challenge - which looks near impossible - is how to convince the British public that, at the very least, it should allow scientists the opportunity to find out what impact GM crops have on the environment. Norfolk crown court's jury showed how profound the public's unease is. There is little point arguing that this depth of feeling obviously owes much to the catastrophe of BSE, or that other agricultural innovations in the past 50 years - such as the use of pesticides - have caused far worse environmental damage. The opposition is stubborn and incidents such as the GM rape crops inadvertently planted earlier this year and then destroyed only reinforce the belief that this technology is impossible to control. </p> <p>Once again, sharply on the heels of the fuel crisis, the limits of government power have been starkly exposed by a small, committed group who can call on unexpected reserves of support among the general public. In a final irony, it was the very group that last week defied the law outside oil refinery gates, the farmers, who this week are busy asserting the rule of law.</p>",
  "The night in Belgrade belongs to the dogs - 60,000 of them now run wild because people can no longer afford to feed them. The city authorities are so broke that they frequently run out of drugs to put them down. So the dogs are clubbed to death instead. In the early morning the smell of freshly rotting rubbish hangs in the streets. <p>Yugoslavia's presidential elections take place on Sunday and the polls predict that Vojislav Kostunica, a previously unknown lawyer, will beat Slobodan Milosevic - despite the election rigging that Milosevic is famous for, and despite the fact that in Serbia nobody ever wins elections except Milosevic. But if Kostunica wins, it's likely that Milosevic will simply use the media he controls to declare victory anyway. He could do that as early as 10 o'clock on Sunday night, just two hours after the polls close and even before the polling boxes make it to the central sorting office. Welcome to Serbia 2000, where Serbs again will be left with no option but to go out on the streets. But the question is how many still have the energy left to go out and protest again. </p> <p>In the winter of 1996, 50,000 people came out to protest against the rigged local elections, and the police special forces crushed them. They were crushed again in March this year when they came out against him on the anniversary of the war in Kosovo. And on Sunday, Milosevic fights not just for his political future, but to avoid spending the rest of his life in the Dutch seaside prison where the international court in the Hague sends its guilty men. \"If we win, it will be great,\" said one of his long-time party workers. \"If we lose, they will lynch us.\" </p> <p>There are 120,000 police at Milosevic's disposal, and all holiday leave has been cancelled. They will do the job they have done in previous protests. </p> <p>On Planet Serbia, closed off from the world, hundreds of thousands of people have turned the frustration and anger of Milosevic's last 12 years of rule into hatred for both him and his wife. He has been the force behind the three bloody wars - in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo - as he tried to use nationalism to secure his own political future. Milosevic, the puppetmaster of the Balkans, has led his people into the wilderness, turning Serbs into international outcasts. A million of them were driven from their homes in those wars, and before their eyes, Yugoslavia, once the wealthiest, healthiest and most beautiful country in eastern Europe, has shrunk from 250,000 square kilometres of sea and mountains to a violent ghetto a quarter that size. </p> <p>Milosevic will be 60 next birthday. His only vices - apart from an obsession with remaining in power - are whisky and Cuban cigars. Both he and his wife have tragic personal histories. His father, a teacher, shot himself when Milosevic was 21. His mother, also a teacher, killed herself 10 years later. But a former Yugoslav ambassador once said that \"in his presence you can feel his strength of personality. You just feel yourself shrinking down in the armchair when he begins to talk. He is a powerful man\". Richard Holbrooke, who chaired the Dayton peace talks in 1995, said he had a great sense of humour; even the waitresses in the Dayton airbase canteen were charmed by him. </p> <p>He met his wife, Mira Markovic, at school in Pozarevac. Her mother was tortured and executed by the Gestapo in 1944 as one of Tito's partisans. They have two children: Marija, a 34-year-old former journalist; and Marko, a 26-year-old former racing driver who runs his own Milosevic mafia in their home town. </p> <p>In the foyer of a Belgrade police station a nurse is trying to sort out her papers and wants to know if there are any jobs in England so she can get out of \"this madhouse\" before the elections. Behind the desk a fat, almost friendly policeman is frowning into his big yellowing ledger. He sits behind chocolate-coloured tinted glass; a full ashtray and grubby overflowing trays of carbon-copied identity papers. It's like being in eastern Europe in 1989. </p> <p>Kostunica, who presents the first real political challenge to Milosevic, is a former communist but a man with clean hands and no past. The only dirt the regime has managed to get on him is to accuse him of keeping 17 cats - which, according to an editorial in Milosevic's paper Politika, shows that, like the average cat, he is untrustworthy and selfish. The editorial also said that he is supported by \"Gays, lesbians and feminists\". </p> <p>On each of the 10 floors of my apartment block \"Gotov Je\" - he's finished - is plastered above the door of the lift. The opposition movement now claims to have 100,000 activists campaigning against Milosevic, but he is far from finished. Until election day he is fighting for his political life, primarily through the TV station he took over 13 years ago when he first came to power. </p> <p>We are watching the news in a top-floor flat. Outside, across the city's skyline, most of the damage done in Nato's 74 days of bombing has disappeared. The news begins with an eight-minute item about the reopening of the chemical plant outside Belgrade. We see a crowd of slightly distracted looking workers shouting \"Slobo, Slobo\". The next 12 minutes are election speeches from around the country with \"Slobo, Slobo\" being chanted constantly in the background. The captain of the national volleyball team calls on people to vote for Milosevic. One hour into the news and they move on to the 100,000 houses that Milosevic will build in the next 10 years. </p> <p>Sylvia, the mother of the house, stands up. \"I can't watch it. I hate him. I could kill him with my bare hands.\" She is 40 years old and has a masters degree in engineering. \"He stole the best years of my life. We have no money, my car is 13 years old. I survive by smuggling sanitary towels and chocolate from Romania. If he wins again there is no future for us.\" </p> <p>Sylvia escapes to the kitchen. The news goes on about another new electricity plant being opened; then finally there's a mention of the opposition. They are all \"fifth columnists\" and \"traitors\". The hour and 48 minutes of Milosevic propaganda mentions his name more than 40 times and ends with the news that he is leading the \"global battle against the agents of fascism\". </p> <p>Milosevic controls all the media, allowing only a few independents to preach to the converted in Belgrade. The rest of the country receive only his message, and it has worked. The latest polls say that Milosevic could legitimately poll more than 1.5m votes and Kostunica is expected to win by as few as 700,000. But Milosevic is free to fix the ballot in Serb regions of Kosovo and the sister state of Montenegro. </p> <p>His biggest supporters are among the old former communists who hark back to Tito, like 64-year-old Dorde Erdeljan and his 61-year-old wife Stava. They say they watch the news every night - never miss it. \"If it wasn't for Milosevic being so strong we would have had Nato troops on the streets of Belgrade,\" says Dorde. \"Kostunica's coalition are traitors who would betray our country.\" Instead of blaming Milosevic for the hardships of the past 10 years, they point to sanctions and a western conspiracy. \"Look at what happened in Britain over the petrol prices - your country would have collapsed in six months if you had to put up with what Serbia has been forced to suffer.\" </p> <p>The only dissenter on the street is Dobrivoic Radanovic, a 50-year-old former boxer and mechanic. \"Of course I'm voting for the opposition. The only people who won't are the old, the army and police.\" </p> <p>\"What will happen then?\" </p> <p>\"Nothing. People will protest and that will be it. The police will crush them and that will be it. We are a special people, the Serbs. The Turks ruled us and we got used to being oppressed.\" </p> <p>Jovan Dulovic works for the small independent magazine Vreme. He specialises in police affairs. \"The special intervention force can be in Belgrade in a few hours. They are the cream of the force, usually athletes and young guys who do weights. In any normal country of our size the police force should be about 30,000; here we've got 120,000. If the people keep going on the streets, the police will beat them. I don't expect them to do anything immediately - he will wait to see how the protests go. Then if they continue it will be very brutal.\" </p> <p>Milosevic is on the campaign trail, appearing at organised mass rallies. On Monday night, the TV broadcasts a ceremony showing 10,089 people gathering to join his party. Each was presented with a red rose and given 100 German marks for turning up. \"We are living through some sort of tragic comic opera which might look funny but it is very, very dangerous,\" says Lubodrag Stojadivovic, a former spokesman for the Yugoslav army who was sacked for writing an open letter protesting about political interference, especially by Milosevic's wife in the army. </p> <p>I think it is possible that the police will be used in a massive and brutal way. If that doesn't work his last card will be the army, but that is a very dangerous card to play - no matter what the generals say, the soldiers will not go against the people.\" </p> <p>The town where Milosevic and his wife began their lives looks like a pleasant place in the early autumn. All along the main street there are white banners in red letters that read \"Choose people not Nato\" and \"For Yugoslavia\". There's not a single poster or banner for the opposition in sight. The chestnut trees in the square were turning red when Markovic went there last week to address a public rally calling on her town and her nation to support her husband. </p> <p>\"Only about 2,000 people turned up,\" says Mile Yeljkovic, a journalist with Beta, the independent newsagency. \"Even those people were bused in. I heard afterwards that she was in tears, she couldn't believe there were so few people.\" </p> <p>On Sunday, and in the days that follow, Serbia will find out what they already know - that Milosevic will play God to the end. He has no choice. Perhaps that's why this city of Belgrade on this warm September day is full mostly of exhaustion and despair. \"Pandora's box has been opened and the only thing left inside for us now is hope,\" said a beautiful student, plastering opposition posters on a baker's wall. She is 19, and not so tired. </p> <p><b>Life and times of Milosevic</b></p> <p><b> Born:</b><br> August 29 1941, in Pozarevac, Serbia. Following the suicide of his father in 1962, Milosevic was raised by his mother, who also killed herself in 1973. </p> <p><b> Early years:</b> <br>Graduated in law from Belgrade University in 1964 and pursued a business career. He was chief of the state-owned gas company Technogas 1968-78, and member of the board of directors of Beobank (United Bank of Belgrade) 1978-82. </p> <p><b> Political career:</b> <br>Joined the communist party of Yugoslavia when he was 18. Entered politics in 1984. In 1987 he became leader of the Serbian communists. Elected president of the Serbian Republic in 1989. The following year he turned the League of Communists of Serbia into the Socialist party of Serbia and was returned to power in the election of December 1990. </p> <p><b> Croatia:</b><br> Serb forces bombard cities including Dubrovnik and Vukovar as the conflict escalates in 1991. Croatian independence recognised by the EC the following year. </p> <p><b> Bosnia-Herzegovina: </b><br> International recognition of the area as an independent state in April 1992 leads to civil war. Thousands of Muslims massacred by Serbs at Srebrenica in the summer of 1995. Milosevic agrees to peace in the Dayton accord in November of that year. </p> <p><b> Kosovo:</b> <br>The 1998 offensive by Serb forces against the Kosovo Liberation Army leads to the 78-day bombing of Serbia by Nato forces, March to June 1999, which ends when Milosevic agrees to withdraw his troops.</p>",
  "Edited extracts from Charles Kennedy's speech in Bournemouth yesterday: <p>Potentially, politics is at a crossroads. We saw that last week. The opinion polls have recorded that this week. That's been the backdrop for this, I think, one of our most successful conferences ever. Politics is about leading. But politics is also about listening. The events of the past 10 days, have demonstrated, graphically, that the current government, neither leads nor listens enough. </p> <p>People want a better level of political dialogue. Just look at the crime debate. Ann Widdecombe and Jack Straw. They're competing in a dismal Dutch auction. Going for lowest common denominator politics. Over-claim. Over-blame. Over-reach. Undermine the entire point of the political process along the way. </p> <p>Let me be quite clear. I'm not one of those who believe that all Britain's problems began on the first of May 1997. But Labour's poverty of ambition is quite remarkable. With a parliamentary majority - of 179, they behave like John Major did - with a majority of three. </p> <p><b> Ethical</b><br> </p> <p> It's all about what will play well in the opinion polls. Britain was promised an ethical foreign policy. Britain demands legislation on the arms trade. But instead we get arms sales to Indonesia. </p> <p>And all too often, they seem scared of their own shadows. Remember that leaked prime ministerial memo? What was it he said? \"A sense that the government ... are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\". </p> <p>So I ask you, Labour voter last time, maybe for the first time was it? Did you believe, that things could only get better? And have they? Millions of people believed it. Millions of people are disappointed. </p> <p>The Conservatives won't improve these things for you. But the Liberal Democrats can. We can improve a lot on Labour. They are continually terrified to be called the party of boom and bust. That old Labour habit of splashing out in their first years in power, and then having to cut back at the end. Gordon Brown certainly hasn't done that. He's cut back and now he's splashing out. Bust followed by pre-election boom. We said that wasn't good enough. I'd like to think he saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat. </p> <p>Now what of the Conservative party? Today, I want to address the millions of previous Conservative voters, who feel that William Hague's party offers them - nothing. I share many of the values, the beliefs, the concerns, of the people who used to be called One Nation Conservatives. Tolerance, decency, fair play. </p> <p>If you believe in those things, and you look at your party. And it's not got room any more, at the top table, for the likes of Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten. Then your party's got no room for you. </p> <p>To you, I say this. You have friends in the Liberal Democrats. Come and talk to us. You will be very, very welcome. What's gone wrong with the Conservative party - oh, so wrong - is not even so much the individuals, it's the issues and the instincts which today guide William Hague's Conservative party. </p> <p>William jumps in with both feet, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons. Desperate for a headline, desperate for a quote. Desperate to get attention. He's the world's first unpopular populist. </p> <p>So how come the Tories have come up in the polls? I know the answer. It's not William's popularity. It's the people round about him that the country's warming to. It must be John Redwood, Michael Portillo and Ann Widdecombe the country loves. </p> <p>Just look at what William's been up to this year. January -patient's guarantee. Ditched. February - tax guarantee. Ditched. March - the moral case for low taxation. Ditched with the tax guarantee. April - bogus asylum seekers. May - Romsey. June. He was quiet in June. Perhaps he had a 14-pint hangover. Or perhaps it was that Romsey hangover. </p> <p><b> Record</b><br> </p> <p> Remember their record? Recessions. Crime doubled. Larger class sizes. Fewer nurses. Pensions slashed. Interest rates - through the roof. Arms to Iraq. BSE. Cash for questions. Sleaze. It must never, ever, be allowed to happen again. </p> <p>William Hague is not the serious leader of a serious political party. That's the serious point. We are serious. Our pur pose is here in this document. It's the F word. Freedom. That's why we're in politics. We want politicians to promote freedom for all. So people can make the most of their lives. I am determined we will get our message across. </p> <p>But as part of that, it is vital, absolutely vital, that we persuade people, that for every area where government can do more, there's an area where government should be doing less, or doing different. </p> <p>We would scrap a range of regulations, that burden small businesses. We will cut bureaucracy in schools. </p> <p>Tax and spend? Every party taxes and spends. But our priorities, are the people's priorities. That's what freedom means. It's not left of Labour. It's not right of Labour. It's ahead of Labour. </p> <p>It's also honest. Where there is a cost, we say how we will pay for it. Saying that if necessary, we will pay for better schools, by asking everybody to pay just 1p more on the basic rate of income tax. And to fund decent pensions, we will ask those fortunate enough to earn over \u00a3100,000 per year, to pay a little more. </p> <p>On health: Nurses and doctors - more of them. Prescription charges - abolish them. Eye and dental check-ups - free once again. Schools and colleges, cut class sizes for all 5 to 11 year olds. Abolish tuition fees for higher education. </p> <p>And what about the pensioners? Forgotten and insulted by Gordon Brown. So we will give pensioners more, above inflation. \u00a35 extra every week for every pensioner, If you're over 75, it's going to be \u00a310 extra. If you're over 80, it's going to be \u00a315 extra. Now that will make a real difference. </p> <p>We say that a clean environ ment relates to health. To poverty. To transport. To education. To civil liberties. We understand that, instinctively so. And again, we're honest. We're clear, fuel taxes should be used, to improve the environment. In the months and years to come, we have got to get that message across. Positive gain, not pain. </p> <p><b> Single currency</b><br> </p> <p> And let me say something about the single currency. As pro-Europeans we are not in favour, of rushing into the euro head first. </p> <p>We don't believe Europe is perfect. And we will work to see that reform takes place. But we do believe that Britain can and must lead in Europe. Lead reform in Europe. </p> <p>That's why, earlier this year, I asked a panel of experts, to report on what the government should be doing. And if the government chooses to ignore the experts, British businesses will lose, British workers will lose, British consumers will lose. So those of us in favour of the euro, must go out there and argue the case. We cannot sit on our hands. </p> <p>This has been an outstanding year for the Liberal Democrats. The local elections - our biggest ever share of the national vote. Sandra's triumph in Romsey. At the next election, I believe we will win more votes, and more seats. 1997 was a staging post. It wasn't a high water mark. </p> <p>So we must go into the next election, and tell people about our message of freedom. The difference between the Liberal Democrats and the disaster of William Hague's Party. The difference between the Liberal Democrats and the disappointment that Labour has become. Go out there and tell it to people as it is. What you see is what you get. This is what we will deliver. A truly modern, truly free, 21st century Britain. A Liberal Democrat Britain.</p>",
  "Britain's most dangerous sex offenders could be held indefinitely in prison under new plans being considered by the Liberal Democrats. <p>Simon Hughes, the party's home affairs spokesman, said the use of \"indefinite sentences\" would not necessarily mean prisoners gained longer sentences, but there would be a more controlled release of them into society. </p> <p>Serious sex offenders would be given a minimum tariff, but it would be up to judges to assess whether satisfactory arrangements had been made for them to be let out. </p> <p>Mr Hughes' call for a review of the current sentencing policy came as the party addressed an issue which has been a national preoccupation following the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in July. There has been strong pressure for a \"Sarah's law\" which would allow parents access to the sex offenders' register. </p> <p>Earlier this month the government ruled this out, but introduced other proposals, including fingerprinting and photographing offenders on their release and life bans on them contacting their victims. </p> <p>Indefinite sentences are not an option at present unless a serious sex offender has re-offended, but the Home Office is looking at applying this to a small number of extremely dangerous sex offenders under separate legislation. </p> <p>Yesterday Liberal Democrats called for \"serious consideration\" to be given to this measure, and called for the victims of sex offenders to be told where and when their abusers would be released. Proposing the motion, Gary Glover said: \"Victims of serious crimes should not be terrified day after day, week after week by fear of meeting offenders.\" </p> <p>Delegates also called for sex offenders convicted outside Britain to be placed on the register when they enter this country, and for the public to have access to this. But there was condemnation of the News of the World and its recent campaign to name and shame paedophiles, widely criticised by police and probation services at the time on the grounds it would drive offenders underground. </p> <p>\"It didn't take the News of the World to make the world aware of this problem,\" said Mr Hughes. \"The News of the World were entirely irresponisble and entirely self serving.\"</p>",

  "<p>Collapsed talks between <strong> British Airways</strong> and <strong> KLM Dutch Airlines</strong> , after the two failed to agree on the structure of a joint airline, is the latest disappointment for BA. </p> <p>Rod Eddington - who, according to one profile of the new chief executive, was nicknamed God at university due to his academic and sporting prowess - has become the latest BA boss to hit turbulence. BA has fallen from the dizzy heights of profitability to losses. </p> <p>A few months after Bob Ayling became head of BA on January 1 1996, the airline announced record pre-tax profits of \u00a3474m. A lucrative alliance with <strong> American Airlines</strong> was looking likely and Mr Ayling had embarked on a \u00a31bn cost-cutting programme. Even after privatisation BA was still a national institution, the country's only flag carrier. </p> <p>Then came the problems. In 1997 staff morale hit an all time low following a three-day cabin crew strike. The incident cost the company \u00a3125m. </p> <p>Graffiti on the walls at BA's headquarters summed up the mood: \"First we had King, then we had Marshall, now we are just Ayling.\" </p> <p>More public embarrassments were to follow.

Mr Ayling had worked hard to join the two companies. It would have given them control of 70% of flights across the north Atlantic. Opposition from regulators and other airlines meant that it failed. </p> <p>In February 1999 BA reported its first loss since it was privatised in 1987, falling \u00a375m into the red.

  "Yugoslavia's army chief ratcheted up the tension yesterday ahead of Sunday's election by claiming that Nato countries planned to send in special forces to help rivals of President Slobodan Milosevic seize power. <p>General Nebojsa Pavkovic's assertion sounded like a pretext for Mr Milosevic to clamp down on protesters or declare a state of emergency if he loses on Sunday - as all opinion polls predict he will. Voters will be choosing a federal parliament, local mayors and the Yugoslav presidency. </p> <p>The army knew of a plan, Gen Pavkovic said, under which there would be disturbances on Sunday \"provoked by special units of foreign armed forces who would be infiltrated into Yugoslav territory on that day\". </p> <p>They would come from the Serb part of Bosnia, from Montenegro and from Kosovo. They would dress in Yugoslav army and police uniforms, he said, and would stage provocations \"under the guise of extending aid to the 'victors' - the opposition\". </p> <p>\"Threats are being addressed to our country at the moment and as a serious army it is our duty to make all the preparations to prevent any surprises,\" he added. </p> <p>Although the general also said the army would accept a genuine opposition victory, he is a Milosevic loyalist. Mr Milosevic has called the vote a choice between \"patriotism and treachery\" and the hint of military action worries western policymakers. </p> <p>European Union foreign ministers offered voters a massive inducement this week to oust the president by announcing that foreign sanctions would be lifted if there was \"democratic change\". </p> <p>The chief opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, is a moderate nationalist who has walked a careful line in recent days by strongly criticising the United States while showing more sympathy for European positions. But he still calls for the unconditional lifting of sanctions and has denounced Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia last year. </p> <p>While western governments can offer an end to sanctions, they cannot agree on what to do if Mr Milosevic \"steals\" Sunday's election by declaring victory on the basis of fraud and ballot-rigging. </p> <p>Diplomats are uncertain how the president will play the election and are unwilling to speculate on his options or their reactions. The only certainties are that Mr Milosevic called the polls early thinking he would win easily because of the opposition's disunity, and that he is as surprised as any one by his opponents' strength. </p> <p>The International Crisis Group, a think-tank that aims to strengthen the capacity of the international community to anticipate conflict, and which has good contacts in Washington and London, this week outlined four scenarios for Sunday's poll. </p> <p>Fearing defeat, the Yugoslav president may call it off after \"provoking some sort of internal crisis through a staged terrorist attack or simulated military coup, or major disruption in Montenegro\". This is unlikely, says the ICG, because it would damage his image of being confident and in control. </p> <p>Scenario two, is \"the big steal\" in which he cheats. A third option is that he plays by the rules on Sunday and accepts defeat knowing that under the constitution he need not hand over power until his mandate ends next August. In the meantime he transfers all power to the Serbian presidency and organises an election victory in Serbia next spring, leaving Mr Kostunica to inherit an empty shell as Yugoslav president. </p> <p>The last option is again that Mr Milosevic accepts a Kostunica victory but over the next few months allows Montenegro to secede, thereby destroying Yugoslavia and leaving Mr Kostunica with no role. </p> <p>Like most observers, the ICG believes the \"big steal\" is the likeliest. All will depend on the opposition's reaction, it says. </p> <p>The opposition might accept cheating in the presidential vote while using its new strength in parliament and town halls to consolidate power for the long haul. Alternatively, it may mount street protests and confront the government, but Mr Kostunica has repeatedly said he does not want bloodshed.</p>",
  "The first evidence emerged yesterday of vote rigging for this Sunday's crucial presidential election in Yugoslavia, as fears grew that President Slobodan Milosevic would use any tactic to stay in power. <p>The discovery of a completed ballot slip containing a vote for the president adds to concerns that fraud on a massive scale would enable Mr Milosevic to overcome the lead of his chief rival, Vojislav Kostunica. </p> <p>The slip was found in in the letterbox of an electoral monitoring group, the Centre for Free Elections (Cesid). The slip, bearing the official stamp, carries the name of the five candidates for president. Slobodan Milosevic is circled. </p> <p>\"We are deeply concerned. Is it possible that those ballots are circling Serbia?\" asked Slobodanka Nedovic of Cesid, who was told by election officials that they would \"discuss the problem tomorrow\". </p> <p>Many in Belgrade are not surprised by the find. Milan Nikolic, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: \"They will use every means possible because they are in very bad shape.\" </p> <p>Analysts say Kosovo provides fertile ground for dirty tricks - 300 polling stations will be open, but it will hard for non-governmental groups to verify the results. A second area of concern lies in the two electoral districts in southern Serbia: Prokuplje and Vranje, and in Montenegro. </p> <p>In addition, several hundred thousand ethnic Albanians remain registered to vote in Yugoslavia and analysts fear their votes could be appropriated. </p> <p>The Kostunica coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (Dos), is taking strenuous measures to curb voting fraud. </p> <p>Its campaign manager, Zoran Djindjic, said almost every polling station in Serbia and Montenegro will have a Dos member on its electoral board, but that the coalition had been denied such representation in southern Serbia and Kosovo. </p> <p>He said Dos was unable to monitor much of the election process. \"The voting lists are made by police. The polls are controlled by the government. The courts are controlled by the Socialist party [of Milosevic] and Yugoslav United Left party [of Mr Milosevic's wife].\" </p> <p>He said the authorities turned down an opposition request to follow ballots from the polling station to the headquarters of the federal election commission and to watch the data being put into computers. </p> <p>An application by Cesid for its observers to check the polls was also rejected. Cesid staff have been targeted across Serbia, with secret police raiding offices and making arrests. </p> <p>\u0095 Judges in Belgrade yesterday sentenced Tony Blair, foreign secretary Robin Cook and ex-defence secretary Lord Robertson to 20 years in prison for crimes against humanity committed during the Nato bombing campaign.</p>",
  "Madeleine Bunting is right to highlight cases where nuns have been convicted of abusing children (In the name of God, September 20). However, she should have told us something of the positive side of the altruism and idealism that is part and parcel of the calling. <p>Our agency, working with all children and families, irrespective of faith, has five nuns on the staff.

Are we now to assume that the Catholic church believes that victims are liars and that all priests and nuns are innocent?

  "A serial rapist was yesterday convicted of his third sex attack across a 17 year period, after a law change allowed evidence from five previous rape trials he has faced to be laid before the jury. <p>Nicholas Edwards was jailed for life for the rape of a 23-year-old woman in 1998, after the Old Bailey heard it fitted a pattern consistent with five previous attacks over 14 years. </p> <p>In an unprecedented move, the judge, Leonard Gerber, allowed the jury to hear evidence from four woman who went to court claiming Edwards raped them only to see him acquitted, and from a woman whom he was jailed for raping. </p> <p>Before the trial began, the House of Lords agreed to make a significant change in English criminal law to allow the \"similar fact\" evidence to be put before the jury. But civil liberties campaigners last night warned that the Lords' judgment risked increasing miscarriages of justice. </p> <p>In the charge he faced and in his previous trials, Edwards, 39, had claimed the woman had consented to sex, and juries had to decide between his word and that of the woman. </p> <p>The Old Bailey jury did not hear from another woman whom Edwards had been convicted of raping at knifepoint in 1981, and another whose allegations he was cleared of, as they could not be traced. </p> <p>Edwards was yesterday convicted solely for his attack on a young mother, Miss D, whom he raped in August 1998 in his flat in Sydenham, southeast London. </p> <p>As in previous rape allegations against him, Edwards approached the woman and initially appeared charming. </p> <p>As in at least one other allegation, he called her a \"bitch\" during the attack and ordered her to strip before pinning her under him and forcing her to have unprotected intercourse. </p> <p>With Miss D, Edwards's mood changed in a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" way immediately before the rape, matching the testimony of the five other women. </p> <p>Miss D, who had a five-month-old son, was left so traumatised that she was unable to breast feed her child. </p> <p>She also bathed in bleach and Dettol to try and \"wash him away\". </p> <p>Detective Sergeant Paul Astbury, who led the gathering of evidence, said Edwards had used knowledge gained from his previous trials to rape in a way that minimised his chances of being convicted: \"As he was planning them, he was formulating his own defence ... knowing exactly what it took to get off, knowing exactly what was required for the police to prove his guilt. </p> <p>\"He is one of the most dangerous individuals I have come across. Without the similar fact evidence, the chances of securing a conviction would be less than average.\" </p> <p>Privately, police officers believe he could have raped far more than the eight known about. Another two women have come forward since the Old Bailey trial began. </p> <p>The prosecutor, David Perry QC, reading a victim impact statement from Miss D after the verdict, said: \"She cannot kiss her boyfriend on the lips. She has never kissed anyone on the lips since the rape. She still suffers from flashbacks and nightmares and thinks she has changed since. She cannot get the face of the defendant's face out of her head and has become depressed.\" </p> <p>A 42-year-old woman, Miss R, who saw Edwards's acquitted of charges of raping her in a churchyard in 1991, said she had to testify at the Old Bailey: \"It has got him off the streets before he cannot attack other women. When I heard he had struck again, I wanted to do something to help put this man behind bars. </p> <p>\"He turned from a charming individual into a monster.\" </p> <p>Mary Cuneen, director of policy for the civil rights group Liberty, said: \"The House of Lords judgment goes too far. The facts of this case are obviously horrendous. In effect you are judging somebody's guilt not on the basis of the evidence of the offence they have committed, but on the basis of other matters. </p> <p>\"Clearly there is a strong interest in prosecuting rape cases properly, but there is a danger that the House of Lords has not had proper regard for the principles of general fairness.\" </p> <p>The Lords dismissed defence arguments that allowing similar fact evidence to be heard would be prejudicial. </p> <p>Judge Gerber said Edwards should serve a minimum of seven years imprisonment for attacking Miss D before he could be considered for parole: \"You humiliated her and have not shown one iota of remorse.\" </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Jim Webster appealed for any other women with information about Edwards to contact the police. <br><br><b>History of violence</b><br><br><b> August 25 1981 </b> Raped woman in car in High Wycombe.

  "As Nicholas Edwards last night began a life sentence, the fact that he was no longer a danger to women was of little comfort to the victims whose lives he damaged. <p>One had an abortion, one is still haunted by the memory 16 years on, another was never able to breastfeed her child, another is on anti-depressants, another cannot kiss or be kissed on the lips. </p> <p>The legal system that Edwards exploited to get away with a campaign of rape pulled out all the stops to convict him of the eighth sex attack charge he has faced since 1981. </p> <p>Edwards had asked the jury at the Old Bailey to believe that so many women were accusing him of rape because he was \"unlucky\". </p> <p>In a totally different sense to what he meant, he was right. Less than one in 10 rapes reported to police result in conviction. Researchers believe those attacks which are reported also represent a tenth of the real total, meaning the chances of Edwards being convicted yesterday were less than one in100. </p> <p>For 17 years he carried out a string of sex attacks, exploiting his knowledge of the legal system through his seven previous rape trials to gain acquittal. There was inconclusive or no medical or forensic evidence supporting the women's claims. </p> <p>Detective Sergeant Paul Astbury, who built the case against Edwards, said: \"I think the only purpose in his life was sex.\" </p> <p>Police found it hard to piece together a coherent picture of his life. Edwards claimed to have fathered six children, but was never part of a stable family unit. </p> <p>\"What is more frightening is he has integrated into society perfectly normally, he's held down a job, he's fathered children,\" said Mr Astbury. </p> <p>Edwards's family were noticeable by their absence from the three-week trial, with one of his daughters attending briefly. </p> <p>From the witness box Edwards bragged of having lost his virginity at 13. He claimed, police believe falsely, to have slept with 2,000 women, and of having six children with five women. </p> <p>His counsel, Richard Benson QC, said that Edwards had \"the morals of an alley cat\". </p> <p>But Mr Benson continued: \"No matter how much you want to doctor him, you cannot convict him of rape. His 2001 sexual scalps weigh so heavily on his belt it's a wonder whether he can stand up straight. </p> <p>\"If he's right about his 2000 women sexual odyssey, he's little more than a walking Viagra tablet.\" </p> <p>But there was no levity when his victims testified. They sobbed as they recounted their ordeals. </p> <p>He was convicted for his first rape, committed in 1981 at knifepoint in his car in High Wycombe. He was charged with a total of five rapes carried out while he lived in the town, and for another three after he moved to London, where he worked as a welder. </p> <p>The prosecution strategy that led to the groundbreaking House of Lords ruling was masterminded by Treasury counsel David Perry, representing the crown. </p> <p>With consent the key issue, it allowed him to argue to the jury that his case relied on more than Miss D's word against Edwards's. It allowed him to say the attack on Miss D fitted Edwards's method of raping. </p> <p>Mr Perry listed 18 similarities between the various rape cases, among them the fact that Edwards maintained they all consented to sex; that victims spoke of him \"engineering\" the initial meeting; that he took them out on a date; that they described him as \"friendly and charming\"; and that he \"flipped\" very quickly from being pleasant to an \"aggressive and intimidating person'\" </p> <p>Edwards also ordered the women to strip; the victims all talked of being \"frozen\" with fear; Edwards was always in control of the situation, ordering his victims to move their bodies as if it was normal intercourse; Edwards never used contraception; once intercourse was over \"he reverted to his former self\" and there was conversation from him as if nothing untoward had happened. </p> <p>Twice Edwards called the victims \"bitches\", twice he said there was no point in them screaming because no one would hear. Two women, one a virgin, said they were raped in the same south London churchyard. </p> <p>Mr Perry said: \"If the defendant is telling the truth you may think he is a very unlucky man. </p> <p>\"Does lightning strike seven times? In the Guinness Book of Records the record for lightning striking a man is nine times and that may be so. But we are not talking about natural phenomena, we are talking about human behaviour. </p> <p>\"The statistical probability is that each of these women are not going to make identical allegations.\" </p> <p>Sue Lees, of the University of North London, has studied the crash in conviction rates in rape cases and Edwards's career as a sex attacker: \"Juries do not expect serial rapists to be nicely dressed, ordinary men, and don't know about the tactics serial rapists use. </p> <p>\"The balance of the courts is in favour of the defendant, the victim can't meet the prosecution beforehand, and past convictions cannot be introduced except at the discretion of the judge.\" </p> <p>The legal device used to introduce the evidence of past attacks of which Edwards was cleared will present prosecutors with new weapons in cases against serial rapists and serial paedophiles. </p> <p>Considering the rape of Miss D, the jury decided there was too much coincidence in the torrid life of Nicholas Edwards. </p> <p>Several women said that after raping them, he used the identical words, \"I suppose you are going to call this rape\". That is what the jury did.</p>",
  "<p> \"I was only nine when the Velvet Revolution brought an end to the former regime. It's largely just a few flashes in my memory, but I do remember the strange atmosphere that pervaded as we watched TV and saw events unfold. </p> <p>\"I put a Czech flag up in the window, as I was feeling a bit patriotic although my parents were afraid the authorities would get angry. It was an experience that helped to shape my personality. </p> <p>\"As we prepare for our demonstrations now, I have similar feelings: in 1989 the protest led to the toppling of a bunch of rulers who were responsible for huge damage and a lot of suffering. </p> <p>\"Those who led the revolution were largely ordinary, like Vaclav Havel, and people thought he could solve their problems, but he has become part of the power machine and is now detached from ordinary people. </p> <p>\"So now, in 2000, we're also hoping to bring a regime to its knees, but this time we want to shift the initiative to the hands of the ordinary people: this is direct democracy. </p> <p>\"I was drawn towards Marxism because as I grew up I was always hearing people denounce it. So, when I was 15, I picked up Das Kapital, and realised Marx was right in his criticism of capitalism. At school I soon began to recognise that the teachers were interpreting our history simply through the eyes of private capitalism and distorting the truth just like the former regime. </p> <p>\"My parents - my father is director of a bakery, and my mother who used to be a clerk at an agricultural cooperative is now unemployed - think I'm a bit of a dreamer. They always tell me my ideas are great, but say it would be impossible for them to be realised. My brother is 17, and doesn't remember the revolution, so he doesn't have the privilege of having lived in the two worlds - of state capitalism and then private capitalism - so he doesn't really understand my ideals. </p> <p>\"I feel great about what's happening in Prague now. There's a great sensation you get from this solidarity from people all around the world who have joined us in the fight. I get a sense of what we could become as a movement. But at the moment we're not strong enough to take control of our lives for the whole year, so we'll just have to make the most of this brief taster.\"</p>",

  "<p>Why does Andrew Lloyd Webber generate such loathing? A friend, on hearing that I was interviewing him, told me she would never speak to me again if I said he was a good composer. He was, she insisted, a borrower of other people's tunes and Rachmaninov should have got a royalty for Aspects of Love. Victor Lewis-Smith, the scabrous TV critic of the London Evening Standard, said much the same thing this week, adding for good measure that Lord L-W was \"plug ugly\". </p> <p>The latter can be quickly dealt with: he isn't particularly. He would be the first to admit that he is no oil painting, but then neither is Lewis-Smith. The music is trickier. There are clearly many influences on Lloyd Webber's tunes and you often feel you've heard them somewhere before, but nothing has ever been proved and litigants who have pursued him on grounds of plagiarism have always lost. </p> <p>Lloyd Webber's new show, The Beautiful Game, opens next Tuesday at London's Cambridge Theatre. It marks a key moment in his career, because his last two shows - Sunset Boulevard and Whistle Down the Wind - failed to set the West End on fire and only two years ago he appeared to be on the point of abandoning musicals. \"I thought I'd write an art book or something,\" he said. </p> <p>That was before a dinner with Ben Elton that, in the best let's-do-the-show-right-here traditions, changed everything. \"I thought I was beginning to tread water a bit with Whistle Down the Wind,\" Lloyd Webber told me when we met at the Really Useful Group's really lovely office in Soho. \"So when Ben said he would be interested in writing with me it was a breath of fresh air. If musical theatre is to have a relevance, from time to time we have to take on subjects that are challenging, or we might as well be doing nothing but revivals. You can't go on looking back, and maybe I'm guilty of having looked back a little bit myself in one or two of my recent things. Now I feel refreshed.\" </p> <p>In late 1998, Lloyd Webber had approached Elton to provide some new material for Starlight Express. Elton said no to that but suggested, as the wine flowed, that they collaborate on a contemporary piece. Lloyd Webber recalled seeing a TV programme about a group of Irish youngsters who played in a non-sectarian football team and, a few weeks later, Elton turned in a 40-page synopsis. </p> <p>Lloyd Webber has taken some stick for \"stealing\" the story of the Belfast-based Star of the Sea team, for whom the hunger striker Bobby Sands played as a boy. The accusation is academic since there is no copyright on a life story, but Lloyd Webber may be sensitive to it as he says he does not recall the precise programme that triggered his interest. </p> <p>\"I remember seeing a documentary about young children in northern Ireland,\" he says. \"Apparently there were several documentaries and I can't remember which one it was. I thought if you have something like a team, it's a bit like the pub in EastEnders - you've got a forum in which things can happen. It's not really about football at all. It struck me that there was just possibly the germ of an idea there. I have a hundred ideas like this all the time; this happened to be the first one I mentioned to Ben and he happened to pick up on it.\" </p> <p>The musical follows the lives of the teenage players and their girlfriends as they grow up during the Troubles. There is a murder, a riot and an on-stage kneecapping. Critically, much will hinge on whether the bleak storyline, Elton's jokes and Lloyd Webber's lush music cohere. The story of young love in a divided community echoes West Side Story, and such comparisons might not favour Lloyd Webber, but it is a serious attempt to write a musical of and for our times. \"We tried not to trivialise it and went for a tougher ending,\" he says. \"We were very keen not to go for a sentimental ending.\" </p> <p>Lloyd Webber once said that he didn't mind people hating his music, but he did dislike those who questioned his integrity. It's a fair point. The art is a legitimate target - can complex politics be got across in a few anthemic songs? - but the intention is not. He has been criticised for latching on to the trendy subject of football, but, as he says, that is only a starting point for the show. In any case, he is no latecomer to the game, having supported Leyton Orient since he was a boy (his mother used to drop him off at the ground while she taught piano to impoverished pupils in east London). </p> <p>Lloyd Webber has the look of a man who thinks he has a hit on his hands, but doesn't want to tempt fate by saying so. \"It's going the same way as Cats went. The box office took off last week. It's one of those shows that might have a lousy first night for some reason, and it might not fly, but it has had a couple of preview nights when it has flown.\" </p> <p>Lloyd Webber looks a great deal happier than he did in 1997 when troubles were coming, as ever, in battalions. Polygram had bought a majority stake in his company and was threatening to take full control, which would have meant him losing his lucrative copyrights. Sunset Boulevard had underperformed, hitting the Really Useful Group's profitability. Then, as the election loomed, he became a national laughing stock when he was reported (wrongly, he insists) as saying that he would leave the country if Labour won. Wags put much of the huge Labour majority down to his intervention. </p> <p>The real crisis was the potential loss of the copyrights. \"That would have taken control of the company away from me,\" he says. \"We had to stop that somehow and due to various twists of fate we were terribly lucky and pulled off the impossible.\" The company is now entirely his again, though he says he is hands off. </p> <p>\"We have very good people here and if they want to do something I let them get on and do it. For example, they're developing a musical with the Pet Shop Boys at the moment. This is written up in the press as Lloyd Webber produces Pet Shop Boys, but of course it isn't. What we're thinking of doing, to allow the young people here some space, is having a wholly owned subsidiary with a different name, so that Really Useful doesn't produce anything other than mine. There are a couple of plays they've optioned, and that appears in the press as me doing it. But plays are not my forte.\" </p> <p>Lloyd Webber is both composer and businessman: he writes musicals for a West End that is now largely owned by his company. The Really Useful Group's travails in the mid-90s made him realise that the days of the blockbuster were over. The Beautiful Game is accordingly less extravagant than some of its predecessors, a return to the relative simplicity of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He thinks Sunset Boulevard, a perfectly good show in his view, was sunk by its extravagance. \"There were places where it could never make money. It shouldn't have been done. You can't have a show that will only work if it's playing at 90% capacity.\" His rule of thumb now is that investors should recoup their money in under a year with a show running at 85% capacity. </p> <p>Sorting out the politics has been almost as difficult as regaining control of the business. He denies that he threatened to leave the country if Labour were elected. What he actually said was that a high-tax regime would cause technicians to leave, and that in turn would make it hard for him to work here. He was ennobled by John Major and still takes the Conservative whip in the Lords, but he says he is a most reluctant Tory. </p> <p>\"I knew John Major and liked him a lot, but I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the future. I think that, despite the glitch that is happening at the moment, this government has done pretty well. I'm not a particular fan of the opposition. I voted with the government on section 28 because I felt very strongly that that was wrong; so I don't know that I am necessarily a natural conservative. I'm lucky in one sense that I'm not in the House of Lords as a working peer. I'm an honorary peer and I took the Tory whip because I knew that John Major must have had a huge hand in it. In my heart of hearts I know that I'm a cross-bencher.\" </p> <p>He enjoys making occasional interventions in public affairs. He wrote to the Telegraph last week to suggest that the Dome be burned in a conflagration that would attract paying spectators (his old collaborator Tim Rice called him to say the letter was the best thing he had written since Evita). He also wrote a column for three years for the Telegraph - he gave it up to write The Beautiful Game - and says he misses it. </p> <p>Perhaps he is loathed because, like Melvyn Bragg, he won't stay in his artistic box. He is composer, entrepreneur and public figure: bright, opinionated and uncompromising. He is also, of course, extremely rich, with a personal fortune of \u00a3420m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He and his third wife, Madeleine, own a stud; they have racehorses; he has the world's finest collection of pre-Raphaelite paintings; he once shelled out \u00a318m for a Picasso. </p> <p>Artists are supposed to be broke; he manifestly isn't. Artists are collected; he collects, with the obsessiveness of the small boy who adored trains. He is a curious and interesting figure: steeped in serious music yet in love with musical theatre; rich enough not to fret about politics but fretting anyway; oddly delighted to have won an award at the Newbury show last weekend for his organic peas; and anxious enough to run out into the street in the rain to give me the name of a horse of his that he thinks will win at Ascot tomorrow. Crystal Music. That's the horse, not a comment on the show, just in case my Lloyd Webber-loathing friend was worrying.</p>",
  "David Aidley, who has died aged 63, was a member of a small group of animal biologists and biophysicists who came together in the 1960s in the newly-founded University of East Anglia (UEA) with a brief to design and establish a school of biological sciences fully integrated in all its teaching, research and administrative activities. <p>When he arrived at UEA in 1967 as a lecturer, Aidley immediately saw, and supported throughout his career, the advantages of a \"school\" structure. While completing his book, The Physiology Of Excitable Cells, he realised the importance of a sound physico-chemical understanding, and was influenced by the discussions he had with colleagues in the school, and the ease with which such boundary crossing could occur. He entered into the early debates about the structure of the school and its courses with knowledge and enthusiasm. In discussion, he was wise, steady and reliable. </p> <p>Aidley's academic background had been traditional. He attended Manchester grammar school from 1948 to 1955, leaving with a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge, where, and after two years of national service in the RAF, he read the natural sciences tripos, with zoology as his specialist subject, graduating in 1960. His postgraduate research in the general field of insect neuro-muscular physiology was supervised at Cambridge by JWS Pringle and AL Hodgkin. His first job was as a demonstrator in zoology at Oxford University in 1963, and he received his PhD a year later. </p> <p>Aidley was an excellent teacher; his practical classes, based on the profligate use of plasticine, were a delight. The extent of his interests was amazing. In 1967, he joined the Amazon expedition of the Alpha Helix, a research vessel from the Scripps Institute, La Jolla, California. On that trip, he became interested in insect sound production and hearing. In 1973-74, he went to the International Centre of Insect Physiology in Nairobi, where he carried out research on the physiology and migratory behaviour of the African armyworm, a pest of grasses. He also developed his interests in ornithology and bird migration, and he and his wife, Jessica, did a lot of field work together. </p> <p>This period in Nairobi triggered a deep interest in African biology, and he returned in 1980-82, first as a visiting researcher in ornithology, and latterly as visiting professor and head of department at Bayero University, in Kano, Nigeria. </p> <p>Aidley's books are also a delight. He had a most unusual talent for explaining difficult scientific concepts. His style was graceful and his aim in identifying the crucial experimental evidence was unerring. His most notable achievement remains his first book on excitable cells, now in its fourth edition. He recently launched another specialist book (written with PR Stanfield) called Ion Channels: Molecules In Action, which was well reviewed and is proving popular. In between, Aidley wrote several reviews, an elementary text (with RD Keynes) on nerve and muscle, and edited a book on animal migration. </p> <p>He was a keen bibliophile and, as chairman of the university library committee, devised a programme of budget cuts based on sound psephological principles, which he published in the British Journal of Academic Librarianship. He also wrote Analyse Your Diet, a computer programme for students to analyse their daily intake of nutrients and consider the implications, which sold well commercially. </p> <p>Although he was still \"living with questions\", Aidley was a Christian, who believed that man's role on earth was to serve others, as he did, genially and diffidently. </p> <p>His first marriage, to Patricia, ended in divorce. His marriage to Jessica in 1971 was a deeply happy partnership and they had four children: Richard, Timothy, Kate and Jack. They all survive him. </p> <p>\u0095 David John Aidley, biologist, born February 5 1937; died August 24 2000</p>",
  "At least one Nato country is expected to dispatch troops to Sierra Leone to bolster the crumbling United Nations peacekeeping force following India's decision yesterday to withdraw its 3,000 soldiers and abandon command of the operation, according to western diplomatic sources. <p>The Indian pullout comes amid bitter infighting with the Nigerian contingent, and follows accusations of weak leadership and fears that the mission could collapse because of poor quality troops and equipment. </p> <p>The UN security council has already agreed to increase the size of the largest peacekeeping operation in the world to 20,500 troops. With the withdrawal of the Indians, about 10,000 new soldiers now have to be found to serve in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>The sources said that a sizeable number is likely to be drawn from one or more eastern European members of Nato and from Latin America, but that agreements with the governments concerned have to be finalised. </p> <p>Britain has ruled out joining the UN force in Sierra Leone although it has more than 200 soldiers there to train the new army and to provide security. </p> <p>The decision to bring in European and Latin American troops is a marked shift away from the UN security council's - and consequently the British and American - policy of encouraging regional peacekeeping forces in Africa. </p> <p>It comes amid accusations that western nations are not prepared to risk the lives of white soldiers in Africa, and much hand wringing by world leaders at the millennium summit earlier this month over the dire state of peacekeeping on the continent. </p> <p>Although the Indians say their withdrawal is routine and expected, it follows a stinging attack by the force's Indian commander, General Vijay Jetley, on the sizeable Nigerian contingent in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>In a confidential report first made public in the Guardian, Gen Jetley accused Nigerian political and military officials at the top of the UN mission of \"sabotaging peace\" in favour of national interests, and alleged that Nigerian army commanders illegally mined diamonds in league with Revolutionary United Front rebels. </p> <p>After the report was published, the Nigerian army called for Gen Jetley's immediate resignation and said it could no longer work with him. But the general's comments reflected considerable concern within the UN mission about the conduct and intent of the Nigerian army which has plundered Liberia and Sierra Leone during earlier military interventions. </p> <p>The Indian withdrawal could be a blow to the British strategy in Sierra Leone of pushing the UN into confronting the RUF through a peace enforcement role while trying to keep the Nigerians from taking control. But it might also prove an opportunity if it can be used to persuade other European armies to join the peacekeeping force and provide the quality of troops and equipment now lacking. </p> <p>The Jordanian contingent - whose troops were strongly criticised for fraternising with the West Side Boys who abducted 11 British soldiers last month - has added to the pressure for western involvement by saying that it too may pull out unless at least one Nato country sends troops. </p> <p>Britain's minister for Africa, Peter Hain, who ruled out direct UK participation in the peacekeeping mission yesterday, said that the UN force would not be allowed to collapse. </p> <p>\"All options are being explored with member countries, including Nato countries, but Britain is very overstretched in Kosovo, with Iraq and in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"There will be a fully fledged UN peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone. It will be a better force with an improved command structure.\" </p> <p>The Sierra Leone army has occupied the village of Magbeni, one of two West Side Boys bases stormed by British troops earlier this month.

  "The troubled Manufacturing, Science and Finance union is being asked to impose an emergency \u00a33m savings package to balance its books in the wake of a year of overspending and huge payouts to staff. <p>A confidential report from the union's accountants, HW Fisher, which was discussed by the union's finance and general purposes committee yesterday, calls for the union to impose \u00a33m savings and introduce a virtual freeze on most activities until the end of this year. </p> <p>One senior MSF officer told the Guardian: \"We are facing a financial catastrophe\". The accountants' report offers a series of unpalatable options to prevent the union going permanently into the red. </p> <p>These include selling either the union's Dublin headquarters, housed in the former American embassy, or its residential training institution, Whitehall College at Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, and imposing big cuts on staff by reducing the headcount from the present 375 to a maximum of 300. </p> <p>Proposals discussed include scrapping an autumn campaign on health and safety issues in the workplace; wholesale cancellation of union publications until the end of the year; reducing union training courses at the college, including new ones on equal opportunities for women and ethnic minorities; banning officials from travelling to meet one another on union business; and cancelling meetings of sector committees to discuss industry issues. </p> <p>The cuts arrive as Roger Lyons, the union's general secretary, has come under fire for alleged lavish expense claims, and for losing and then having to settle a series of employment tribunal cases, which have cost members \u00a3900,000. </p> <p>Allegations were made by one \"whistleblower\", Marcia Solomon, who won a \u00a350,000 settlement for unfair dismissal, that Mr Lyons and Nelson Mendes, head of the finance department, fiddled thousands of pounds in expenses. </p> <p>Mr Mendes is on sick leave, and according to a national executive report is not likely to work for the union again. </p> <p>The union has instructed lawyers to fight an unfair dismissal case being brought by Bryan Keegan, former chauffeur to the general secretary, which is due to be heard in January. </p> <p>Lawyers are also being asked to take action to close down a website run by MSF member David Beaumont, which details Mr Lyons' alleged expense claims, lists articles in the press on the lifestyle of the general secretary, and reports on tribunal cases. </p> <p>The union is having to pay back \u00a3600,000 a year to the banks to cut its overdraft and needs to put aside \u00a3750,000 fully to fund its pension scheme. Earlier this year the union's pension trustees in their report indicated \"dismay and anger\" over Mr Lyons' failing to consult them on a \u00a3200,000 payout to three senior union staff who took early retirement. </p> <p>Minutes of MSF's finance committee and national executive for the last four months - obtained by the Guardian - revealed a steadily deteriorating financial situation as the union lost a series of tribunal cases. </p> <p>Last year the union was running a \u00a3182,000 surplus each month. By last April the surplus had dwindled to \u00a34,000 a month, falling to \u00a32,200 a month in May. </p> <p>The national executive was told in June by HW Fisher that to remain viable \"on an income of \u00a326m, the union should be generating a 'basic' surplus of \u00a31m per annum as a minimum level for an efficient organisation.\" </p> <p>The report added the union could not continue to pay \u00a3600,000 off its overdraft by selling property, and that pension contributions would have to increase from 6% to 19% to protect the scheme. </p> <p>The July finance committee was told that savings of \u00a32m were urgently required - but the committee told the accountants these savings were now not enough and ordered them back for a rethink. </p> <p>Other changes being implemented include new expenses forms, which for the first time require NEC members and the general secretary to obtain counter-signatures. </p> <p>Paul Talbot, secretary to the finance committee, said last night: \"These recommendations from the accountants are good housekeeping measures. Our aim is to bring more management control into the union without stopping our frontline activities.It is part of ongoing discussion on how we run our finances over the next three years.\" </p> <p>The union insisted that its finances were stable.</p>",
  "Like the old grandfather clock in the corner, the US presidential election swings back and forth. At first, the Republican George W Bush had a dominant lead. But when he faced a more daunting challenge than the Democrats' Al Gore did in his primary for the party nomination, the latter took the lead. <p>Then, it was Vice-President Gore who stumbled and went strangely quiet in the post-primary period; Mr Bush regained the advantage. </p> <p>At the Republican convention in early August, Mr Bush took a decisive lead, only to hand it back when the Democrats met later that month. The seminal event of the campaign, so far, has been Mr Gore's magnificent convention speech accepting his party's nomination. </p> <p>Auditioning for the presidency, Mr Gore delivered a speech devoid of oratorical flourish but so laden with substance that it resembled a president's annual state of the union address. </p> <p>Mr Gore took America on a tour of his agenda. He proposed important initiatives in areas from education to child care to help for the el derly to health reform to crime fighting to environmental protection and, in the process, touched on a dozen other popular themes. </p> <p>Now, one month later, the echoes of Mr Gore's speech still sound in the race, staking the vice-president to a small but so far enduring lead over Mr Bush. </p> <p>For his part, Mr Bush has countered by \"triangulating\". This was the strategy Bill Clinton used in 1996 to steal the other side's issues. With all the basic Republican concerns basically solved - such as eliminating the deficit (the US has a surplus), cutting crime (down 50%), and reducing dependence on the dole (also cut in half) - Mr Bush has crossed into Democratic turf to find his issues. </p> <p>His convention emphasised his commitment to education and he recently unveiled a plan to pay for medicine for the elderly. The logic of the Bush strategy is that if he can draw even with Mr Gore on the issues, he will win on image - the calculation being that barring a transplant of DNA, Mr Gore cannot win the personality battle. </p> <p>The flaw in the Republican approach, so far, is Mr Bush's huge proposed tax cut. Seeking to reduce tax payments by $1,300bn (\u00a3865bn) in the next 10 years, the nominee is betting his house that voters want their taxes cut first and foremost. But most surveys show they are far more apt to favour spending on education, gun control, police, and help to impoverished areas. </p> <p>Either side can win this contest. But it is worth noting that not since 1948 has the candidate who is behind at this stage come back to win the election. </p> <p>Richard Nixon in 1960, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, and Gerald Ford in 1976 all came close, but none won.

  "<p>Rivers and canals in England and Wales are probably cleaner than they have been since the industrial revolution, with 92% classed as good enough to support fish life, according to the Environment Agency. </p> <p>This 1999 figure is a big improvement on 1990, the year after water privatisation, when 85% of the 25,000 miles of rivers and canals were classified in the top two categories of \"good\" or \"fair\". </p> <p>If Scotland and Northern Ireland are included the figure is 95% in 1999, compared with 92% in 1990. </p> <p>Since privatisation, water companies have been forced by EU legislation to invest heavily in sewage treatment plants and other clean-up measures which have resulted in higher water bills but better water quality. Hundreds of miles of rivers now have fish life where there was none nine years ago. </p> <p>Rivers in the \"poor\" and \"bad\" classifications have probably been devoid of almost all life for decades, many of them in the old industrial heartlands of Britain, where chemicals used to be indiscriminately poured into the nearest stream. </p> <p>In 1990, 2.3% of all rivers were still in the \"bad\" category - meaning about 575 miles of rivers had no life - but last year this figure had gone down to 0.6%, around 150 miles. </p> <p>The biggest improvements have been in industrial areas of the midlands and northern England, where around half the rivers and canals have improved by one grade or more. The net improvement, taking into account the fact that some rivers have deteriorated over the same period, is equivalent to upgrading 40% of the total river and canal length in the midlands and north. </p> <p>The quality of rivers is one of the government's 15 indicators of \"quality of life\" in Britain, which it pledged to improve. Water companies are due to spend another \u00a37bn over the next five years making further improvements. </p> <p>The environment minister, Michael Meacher, said: \"Clean rivers are not only a vital source of water for drinking and industry, they also support a wide variety of wildlife and are enjoyed by millions for recreation. </p> <p>\"The billions being invested in cleaning up our rivers are really bearing fruit. These are the best ever water quality results, and they reflect the government's commitment to delivering a cleaner, better quality environment for everyone to enjoy.\" </p> <p>The south west of England and Wales have the highest proportion of high quality rivers, with respectively 97% and 98% of river and canal length classified as good or fair. </p> <p>The Environment Agency chairman, Sir John Harman, said: \"The survey shows real improvements in the quality of many urban and semi-urban rivers, creating real amenity for people in areas where river environments have in the past been poor, or in some cases, lifeless, polluted eyesores. </p> <p>\"However, we cannot be complacent. Around 8% of rivers in England and Wales are still graded poor or bad. Planned investment over the next five years should tackle many of these problems.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The agency has a website, <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">www.environment-agency.gov.uk</a>, where users can enter a postcode to discover the quality of rivers in their given locality.</p>",
  "Burma's ruling junta blocked pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from leaving the capital, Rangoon, by train yesterday by confining her to a station waiting room and refusing to let her and members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) buy tickets. <p>Ms Suu Kyi, who was kept under house arrest for two weeks earlier this month after being prevented from travelling to rural areas by car, and nine party colleagues were told that all the tickets to Mandalay had been sold. </p> <p>This was blatantly not true as several of the trains that left for Burma's second city, 375 miles to the north of Rangoon, were far from full. </p> <p>Ms Suu Kyi, who was travelling to Mandalay to check reports that NLD activities there were being restricted by the military regime, was still at the station well after the last train left at 9pm. </p> <p>There was no word on whether she was planning to stay at the station and further test the restrictions on her movement or return home. </p> <p>Security at the station was extremely heavy with truckloads of riot police and scores of plainclothes officers swarming all over the area. </p> <p>A few dozen NLD supporters who turned up in advance to demonstrate were whisked away while journalists and British diplomats were refused entry. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said yesterday that it was clear that Burma's generals were not sincere in their desire to further democracy because \"they continually harass those who exercise their democratic rights\". </p> <p>Earlier in the day police vans and cars sealed off the road outside Ms Suu Kyi's house. It is not clear whether the authorities let her through or whether she managed to evade the blockade. </p> <p>The last time Ms Suu Kyi, 55, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, tried to go to Mandalay by train was in 1996. Then the authorities uncoupled her carriage just before the train was due to leave, citing technical problems. </p> <p>Yesterday's bid to travel signalled Ms Suu Kyi's latest clash of wills with the ruling generals who refuse to recognise the NLD's landslide victory in the 1990 general election. </p> <p>The military regularly restricts her movement and imprisons party colleagues. She was kept under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 </p> <p>Last month's crackdown on Ms Suu Kyi and the NLD provoked international condemnation, particularly from Britain and the United States. </p> <p>Earlier this week Burma's foreign minister, Win Aung, said at the UN general assembly in New York that the impoverished country was not yet ready for full democracy and such criticism hindered the transition process.</p>",
  "An advert was run recently in the print Guardian for Solar Century, the UK solar power company devised and presided over by former Greenpeace representative and Oxford fellow Jeremy Leggett. The advert incites us to consider what may happen when supplies of carbon fuel begin to run out, what sort of blockades and panics we will suffer, what sort of squabbles at the pump. Now, the advert suggests, before it is too late, for oil supplies, and for the future of the planet, we should turn to solar alternatives. <p>Solar Century is an unabashedly commercial enterprise. Its website offers a range of solar products, from roof installations of various sizes to portable powermats. The aim of the company is to hurry the conversion to solar power in Britain, for fiscal profit. However, Solar Century also runs a charitable trust, aiming to extend solar power to those less likely to be able to afford the conversion rates, the Solar Century Global Community Trust. </p> <p>What companies such as Solar Century are aiming to demonstrate is the economic viability of solar photovoltaic (PV) power. As usual, Britain is lagging behind countries such as Japan and Germany, where government schemes have propelled rates of conversion. We remain at the level of unconverted barbarism: the Solar Century site aims to correct a few of our more primitive preconceptions. Will it work in the dark? Will it work in the clouds? The answer to both questions is, of course, yes. </p> <p>At the present time, most solar roofs are connected to the national grid. So, in the day when a surplus of electricity is generated, the excess is effectively sold to the local electricity company. At night, the local electricity network supplies the power back. Clouds interfere only slightly with the workings of solar panels. Electricity is created by daylight - cloud cover may diminish the output, but there will still be power. </p> <p>Solar Century orchestrate discussions with the local electricity companies, who are compelled by law to let customers install solar power anyway and to buy surplus electricity created by the panels. Planning permission is rarely required, unless the solar roof has been designed to project wildly beyond the frame of the house. </p> <p>Faced with these sorts of enterprises, it seems absurd that we do not, as a nation, convert instantly. Global warming, caused by carbon emissions throughout the world, but particularly in developed, industrialized countries, is no longer even a debatable probability. Its effects have already been witnessed - freak weather conditions, floods in China, El Nino storms buffeting the Atlantic coast. </p> <p>This summer the northern polar ice cap melted. Scientists respected for their rigour and precision are predicting monstrous, apocalyptic future effects, including a sea level rise of one metre, which will destroy the homes and livelihoods of, for example, 30m people living in Bangladesh, Egypt and Vietnam. </p> <p>The first recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990 were for a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, as the basic level required to return the planet's climate to a healthy level. Governments globally have failed to commit to anything even approaching this. </p> <p>Various dubious enterprises have been created to allow further evasion of carbon cuts for richer countries, including the carbon credits scheme, which creates a trade in carbon emission entitlements - a company which emits below its allowed level will be able to sell its surplus allowance to another. </p> <p>This once more means that money will save individuals, companies and nations from significantly altering their lifestyles. It was George Bush senior, as US president in the early days of international climate panels and conferences in the 1980s, who suavely assured the world that the American lifestyle was not negotiable. </p> <p>Now America has seen some of the worst, most destructive storms in its history: Florida devastated, Texas drought-riddled, heatwaves sweeping the midwest and the south, killing the young and the elderly. And now this year and last, an encephalitis epidemic in New York City. </p> <p>In the UK, we are more fortunate. So far, we have evaded some of the more sinister and appalling demonstrations of climate change. But we are inactive, clinging to our petrol and our cars, clinging to the core comforts of life, \"core comforts\" we have known for less than a century. There is one area in which we might act. We might, given that it is so extraordinarily easy, convert our homes to solar power. </p> <p>The use of renewable energies no longer requires individuals to adopt eccentric living patterns, to retire to the Lake District and hammer up a windmill on the top of the fell. Solar power is there for the installing, by competent, mainstream, commercially minded Oxford fellows and their team (which includes figures no less mainstream and commercial than former employees of BP). </p> <p>We scarcely have to do anything. We are not required to leave our homes, we are not required to picket or protest, to storm and rave. We are merely required to adjust our thinking slightly. To adapt.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.solarcentury.com\" target=\"_new\">Solar Century</a></p>",
  "<p>When I am called upon to write about the mostly fictional entity called Spinal Tap, I usually do so in the mostly fictional character of David St Hubbins, long-time guitarist/clothes-horse for said group. David can knock the piece off at one sitting, email it to his manager, and be back in bed by 10am. But the one thing David St Hubbins can't do for us is talk about a movie called This Is Spinal Tap. None of the band can give you a rundown on the odd genesis of this film, because it doesn't exist in their world. So I'm filling in. </p> <p>In 1978, Rob Reiner, fresh from a long distinguished stretch in series television, put together a special called The TV Show. It spooved (yes, that is the correct word) network and local television, satirising a full viewing day's worth of crap in one hour. It was very funny. </p> <p>I knew Rob, and several of the writers were old friends of mine. One of the proposed pieces was a parody of a show called Midnight Special, a rock'n'roll concert/variety show, hosted by the late Wolfman Jack. Christopher Guest, who would go on to play the Tap's Nigel Tufnel, suggested that a pea-brained English rock band be featured in the sketch. Chris and I had played a couple of road-weary Britrockers in a short piece he had directed so I became involved in the project. Chris, Rob, the show's producer Harry Shearer (who would play Tap bassist Derek Smalls) and I wrote the song Rock'n'Roll Nightmare and its accompanying visual foolishness. After some groping about for a suitably duff name, we settled on Spinal Tap. </p> <p>About a year and a half later, Rob was looking to direct feature films, and the notion of doing a fake documentary about this awful band snowballed. Rob pitched the idea and got a hearty \"maybe\" from Sir Lew Grade's US wing, Marble Arch. In early 1980, the four of us began meeting daily to furnish Spinal Tap with a believable past. We watched a lot of rock'n'roll concert and documentary film, and noted the recurrence of an interesting theme: the survivor - the yeoman road warrior who never says die, no matter how clearly the market suggests he do so. </p> <p>We had no intention of writing a screenplay. The idea was to construct the history of the band and the characters, set the general story elements and improvise the dialogue, having hired actors we knew could play the game. We shot a demo in four days and Rob assembled the piece over the next few months. In the interim, Marble Arch had released Legend of the Lone Ranger and Raise the Titanic (right boat, wrong direction!) in rapid succession and slipped quietly out of the Big Tent. </p> <p>We assumed it was not going to happen. We all went back to our day gigs and night sweats until Lindsay Doran, a fan of Rob's and a bright light at Embassy Pictures, suggested they just make the damn thing anyway. Jerry Parenchio and Norman Lear, dean of Reiner's alma mater, All in the Family, were running Embassy, and things fell gradually into place. We began writing, casting and crewing in the spring of 1982. </p> <p>Peter Smokler's camera rolled late in that year. We had cast old buds like Paul Benedict, Billy Crystal, Ed Begley and Paul Shaffer, along with new friends Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey, Patrick Macnee, Anjelica Huston, et al. Ric Parnell and David Kaff came aboard as drummer Mick Shrimpton and keyboardist Viv Savage. June Chadwick was cast as Jeanine, St Hubbins's ladylove. Tony Hendra became our manager, the faithless Ian Faith. We asked everyone to come and improvise with us. We'd made very few miscalculations: the actors got the joke and flew with it, and every day's shooting was at least as much fun as the day before. Rob edited the film over the next year, and the film was released in March of 1984. </p> <p>The critics liked us very much. The public that found us, either by fluke or in response to the \"trickledown\" theory of promotion, found us funny. But we were a modestly budgeted satirical film with a very specific voice; we gave the bigger spring releases no serious nightmares. It did play in one theatre in Boston for something like a year, and the fans we encountered were smart and funny and flattering. This Is Spinal Tap made a lot of Best of the Year lists; it just didn't crack 1984's top 10 box office. But it was the movie we had wanted to make, and we were very happy with it. </p> <p>Video release widened our circle of friends; bits of Tapspeak found their way into the language. We had achieved an important goal: shelf-life, the ability to stay fresh and crisp while other comedy gets stale and mouldy. When someone reports watching the movie regularly and finding new stuff to laugh at each time, it makes us very glad. Lots of other stuff has happened since. Rob, Harry, Chris and I have been thankfully busy most of the time - but for each of us the making of this strange movie was a high point. </p> <p> <strong> Michael McKean </strong> </p> <p><strong> Authenticity </strong></p> <p> The band wrote and performed all the music from the film, with collaboration from Rob Reiner. Harry Shearer has spoken of the irony that many real bands rely on miming to pre-recorded tracks for their live performances, while \"the joke band really plays\". Christopher Guest concludes: \"What we've seen over the years, when we've played live, is that people want to feel as if they're part of the movie. Because they were the audience watching this movie, the audience that comes to the show feel as if they are now in the movie in a funny way, and they become the audience in the movie and it's very difficult to separate. It's a very bizarre phenomenon. They know all the songs and we can never tell... are they joking? Or do they know?... At what point does this become real or imagined?\" </p> <p><strong> Backstage requirements</strong><br> </p> <p> In This Is Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel is seen being appeased by the band's manager, Ian Faith, as he runs through what is wrong with the backstage catering. The particular inspirations were the peculiar demands made by Jerry Lewis, Yul Brynner and especially Van Halen - who, according to legend, insist on being served bowls of M&amp;Ms with the brown ones taken out. Michael McKean recalls Brynner's contract for backstage provisions demanding: \"Under no circumstances must white eggs be substituted for brown.\" </p> <p>Guest recalls of Spinal Tap's real tours: \"We also suffered many of the ignominies that the band did in the film. Art imitating life that had already imitated art. At one gig there was half a sandwich and a pitcher of water in the dressing room. That was it. At least the sandwich was wrapped in plastic\" </p> <p><strong> Bizarre gardening accident</strong><br> </p> <p> The manner of original Tap drummer John \"Stumpy\" Pepys's death in 1969. The idea of the \"bizarre gardening accident\" has entered the language and the popular imagination. Angry Salad, a Boston-based rock band, have released an album by that name and it is rumoured that Jeff Porcaro, the drummer of Toto, may in fact have died in this way in 1992, eight years after the release of This Is Spinal Tap. One theory has it that Porcaro was spraying insecticide in his garden and inhaled too much, triggering a fatal heart attack. Ironically, Toto's lead guitarist, Steve Lukather, served as producer and guitarist on Spinal Tap's Break Like the Wind in the same year. </p> <p><strong> Cher</strong><br> </p> <p> Cher was one of the celebrity collaborators on the Tap's comeback project, Break Like the Wind. She sang with St Hubbins on Just Begin Again. The collaboration was hampered by Cher's apparent animosity towards her co-singer - as St Hubbins recalled in a 1992 interview in The Nose: \"It was great in one sense that she insisted on me not being anywhere near her when she sings. In fact, the papers said I had to be 100 yards away from Cher when she's actually doing vocals, which would be a house-and-a-half down the road from the studio where we were doing it.\" When asked why Cher didn't join the band in person for their comeback tour, St Hubbins explained: \"We begged, we pleaded, and finally she agreed not to.\" </p> <p><strong> Don't Look Back</strong><br> </p> <p> DA Pennebaker's seminal rockumentary of Bob Dylan's UK tour of 1965. One of the declared inspirations for This Is Spinal Tap, the film offers a searingly candid view of the young, supremely confident Dylan on tour. We see him granting an audience to his nervous acolyte Donovan who sings To Sing For You in a nearly embarrassing homage to his idol. Dylan is shown suffering from the everyday niggles of touring, such as singing The Times They Are A-Changin' with an initially dysfunctional mike - it isn't plugged in. The most obvious reference in This Is Spinal Tap is the getting-lost-backstage scene. After the Manchester gig, Dylan and his entourage are seen scurrying around backstage desperately trying to find their way out, and Dylan enquires urgently: \"Where's the door?\" </p> <p> See also: Xanadu Star Theatre </p> <p><strong> Eleven</strong><br> </p> <p> In one of the great sequences of modern film comedy, Nigel, having shown Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) his beloved guitar collection, introduces him to his Marshall amp: \"This is a top to what we use on stage, but it's very, very special because, if you can see, the numbers all go to 11. Look, right across the board: 11, 11, 11.\" </p> <p>Marty: \"And most amps go up to 10.\" </p> <p>Nigel: \"Exactly.\" </p> <p>Marty: \"Does that mean it's louder? Is it any louder?\" </p> <p>Nigel: \"Well, it's one louder, isn't it?\" </p> <p>This exchange has become so embedded in the mythology of rock that the number 11 now has a separate and instantly accessible meaning. Eddie Van Halen is reputed to be the first rock guitarist to have been inspired by Spinal Tap and request a customised amp with dials going up to 11. </p> <p>Christopher Guest speaks in his commentary for the special laser disc edition of the film of how he has worked with the hi-fi company since the time of the film's production: \"Marshall made a special plate for me that went up to 11. Subsequently they have done some ads with me, and now the new amp that they made for me actually goes up to infinity on the dial. They made a real amp that goes up to 20. That's the one that people can buy in the stores now for real. But mine goes up to infinity. This has been ripped off big time. Almost every amp company now sells knobs that go up to 11.\" </p> <p> <strong> Foghat</strong> </p> <p> British boogie-blues band formed in 1970 who became successful in the US in the mid-70s. McKean, Shearer and Guest insist that the events in the film are not based on specific bands or personalities, but acts continue to claim or protest that they are the models. As Michael McKean explained in an interview with the Guardian: \"We were accused by someone from Foghat of planting a bug in their bus because they swore that we had ripped off the idea of the girlfriend taking over and using astrology to plan the tour.\" </p> <p><strong> Fufkin, Artie</strong><br> </p> <p> Promoter at Polymer Records, Tap's label. In the NME on September 8 1984, Harry Shearer spoke of how people in the record industry would identify with the spoof: \"A lot of people from record companies bug us now. They take you aside and say, 'Well, Harry, if I say it myself, I'm the Artie Fufkin of this burgh,' not realising it's sort of a damning indictment.\" </p> <p><strong> Guest, Christopher</strong><br> </p> <p> Plays Nigel Tufnel. Son of Lord Peter Haden-Guest and Jean Hindes, aka Lady Jean Haden-Guest, former vice-president of CBS. In 1984, the year This Is Spinal Tap was released, Guest married the actress Jamie Lee Curtis at Rob Reiner's home. Reputedly, Lee Curtis was first attracted to Guest when she saw his picture in Rolling Stone magazine, and arranged a date with him through his agent. In 1996, after the death of his father, Guest was ennobled as the fifth Baron Haden-Guest of Saling. In the Register of Lords' Interests, Guest is declared offly as: \"Film director.\" He is the half-brother of journalist and bon vivant Anthony Haden-Guest, who is widely believed to be the model for Peter Fallow, the louche, hard-drinking English journalist in Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. </p> <p><strong> Huston, Angelica</strong><br> </p> <p> Plays the designer of the Stonehenge set, Polly Deutsch. Huston emerged from the shadows after Spinal Tap, starring in Prizzi's Honor (1985), The Dead (1987), Crimes and Misdemeanours (1989), The Grifters (1990) and The Addams Family (1991). </p> <p><strong> Iron Butterfly</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the first heavy rock bands, Iron Butterfly were formed in San Diego in 1966. It is fitting that there should be strong links between the Tap and Iron Butterfly, for whom the description \"heavy metal\" is believed to have been coined. The band plotted a similar course to the Tap, moving from psychedelia to heavy rock and pushing the envelope of the four-minute pop song to the epic form with their classic In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (the album of the same name is said to have sold 25m copies). Spinal Tap played their first live gig at Gazzari's on Sunset Strip, in a double bill with Iron Butterfly. </p> <p><strong> Judas Priest</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the bands to which the Tap have consistently been likened. As part of his research for This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner went to see Judas Priest: \"It physically hurt my chest. The reverberation in the hall was so strong that I couldn't stay there any longer.\" </p> <p><strong> Kunkel, Russ</strong><br> </p> <p> The famed session drummer who appeared as the drummer in the band's first appearance on The TV Show and played Eric \"Stumpy\" Joe in the band's jamboreebop appearance. Kunkel has served as producer for Clannad and played with Emmylou Harris, BB King and Bob Seger. </p> <p><strong> Last Waltz, The</strong><br> </p> <p> Directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the inspirations for Martin DiBergi, this proto-rockumentary records the last performance by The Band, which Robbie Robertson describes as \"the beginning of the end of the beginning\". </p> <p>The interview technique of This Is Spinal Tap is lifted straight from The Last Waltz, where Scorsese placed himself in front of the camera for some of his chats with the band, of which he was a declared fan. In the interviews, the band explain that they got together having been assured that they would get \"more pussy than Frank Sinatra\". </p> <p>Among the film's Tap-like moments: the band members discuss the pleasures and pains of 16 years on the road, and the tensions and joys created by mixing music and women; a very obviously and chronically goofed keyboardist, Richard Manuel, recalls the band's problems with settling on a name: \"It was right in the middle of the whole psychedelia, Chocolate Strawberries and Marshmallow Overcoat - those kind of names. They were the Hawks and toyed with becoming the Crackers or the Honkies before eventually settling on the Band.\" In a very Tap-like observation, Robbie Robertson acknowledges what rock'n'roll had done for them: \"It took us everywhere. It took us to some strange places... physically, spiritually and psychotically.\" </p> <p><strong> McKean, Michael</strong><br> </p> <p> Actor playing David St Hubbins. Besides his moment of glory as St Hubbins, McKean has made a name for himself, like Shearer, as a voice artist, and in supporting corporate/nerdy roles, often faintly sinister. </p> <p><strong> Nash, Graham (1942-)</strong><br> </p> <p> Rock star, born in Manchester, who was a founder member of the Hollies before forming Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in 1967. He appears in The Return of Spinal Tap as the man who goes into Jeanine's shop, The Drippery, complaining of trouble with his chakra ball. </p> <p><strong> The Otto Show</strong><br> </p> <p> The episode of The Simpsons, for which Shearer is a regular voice artist, in which Bart goes to his first heavy metal concert when Spinal Tap play Springfield. Marge is heard saying optimistically: \"I hope the Spinal Tap don't play too loud.\" We see that Bart is wearing a T-shirt bearing the words: \"Spinal Tap World Tour: London Paris Munich Springfield.\" </p> <p><strong> Pettibone, Jeanine</strong><br> </p> <p> The presence of David St Hubbins's girl friend Jeanine in This Is Spinal Tap supplies what McKean, Guest and Shearer call \"The Yoko plot\". She represents the threat posed to the central duo by the appearance of a woman. Nigel and David are the core of the band, with obvious reference to Jagger/Richard, Lennon/McCartney and Page/Plant. Women are meant to be entertainment on tour and steady girlfriends or wives are anathema to the whole experience. </p> <p>In Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Do, John Lydon writes of his experiences in the Sex Pistols with his mate Sid Vicious and Sid's girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. After the break-up of the band, Rotten wanted to work again with Sid, who assured him he had given up drugs: \"I told him to meet me at Gunter Grove so we could talk - provided he didn't bring Nancy, which he did. Nancy was getting at Sid and wanted to be his manager. The ego games were so appalling, it resembled something out of that rock'n'roll satire movie, Spinal Tap.\" </p> <p><strong> Pischedda, Tommy</strong><br> </p> <p> Chauffeur played by Bruno Kirby. The special resentment between chauffeurs and rock stars reached its crisis point in 1976 when The Who's Keith Moon accidentally ran over and killed his own chauffeur, Cornelius Boland. </p> <p><strong> Plastercaster</strong><br> </p> <p> Legendary rock chick Nancy Godfrey was famed for her collection of plastercasts of rock stars' dicks. Apparently Jimi Hendrix is the star exhibit. In a sequence featured in the original script for This Is Spinal Tap, Derek and Viv are seen in their Memphis hotel room with their bums immersed in plaster as a favour to two groupies who collect casts of rock stars' bottoms. The groupies strip the plaster off Derek and Viv - but too soon. The casts are shapeless messes. </p> <p><strong> Q </strong><br> </p> <p> There is no Q. </p> <p><strong> Rock and Roll Creation</strong><br> </p> <p> This Tap track entered musical legend because of the trouble Derek Smalls had emerging from his pod during the performance of the song, as captured on This Is Spinal Tap. The original idea for the band to be born on stage out of pods was borrowed from 70s heavy-rock band Angel. </p> <p>For U2's Popmart tour, the show's designer Willie Williams and the band decided the group should emerge from a giant lemon. Asked what inspired the idea, Williams replied: \"Spinal Tap, actually. We needed a pod-like object for the band to come out of like they did in the movie. We felt that the more smoke there was the better, because it was the pure Spinal Tap moment. Just then Las Vegas decided to have the stillest wind ever. So The Edge comes down from the stairs, and to start his guitar he has to kick a switch on his foot-pedal. Well, he ended up on his hands and knees, feeling around for the pedal. Later he said to me, 'There I was at the debut, the premiere opening night, and this voice came into my head: I'm Derek Smalls.'\" </p> <p><strong> Stonehenge</strong><br> </p> <p> It has been widely claimed that Spinal Tap's Stonehenge set was taken from a notorious Black Sabbath live extravaganza, the 1984 Born Again tour. In BBC TV's Rock Family Trees, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Ian Gillan (the then vocalist) recalls the meeting with LSD, the designers: \"We were all going, 'Something earthy, maybe.' And Geezer said, 'Stonehenge.' The bloke says, 'That's a brilliant idea. How do you visualise it?' He said, 'Life-size of course.'\" </p> <p>The result was actually three times bigger than Stonehenge. Sabbath had to hire the Birmingham NEC for rehearsals as that was the only place it would fit - and that was without the stage. They assumed it would be all right in America, as \"all the places are bigger over there\". Then at the first gig they couldn't get it in the doors. </p> <p>In the December 1994 issue of Mojo magazine, Gillan adds: \"On the last day of rehearsal we're wondering what this dwarf is doing hanging around backstage. When we do the dress rehearsal, the dwarf emerges in a red leotard, long yellow fingernails and little yellow horns. He's going to be the baby [a diabolical baby is featured on the cover of the Born Again album]. Then we hear this horrendous [recorded] scream and suddenly we see this dwarf crawling across the top of Stonehenge. He stands up as the scream fades away and falls backwards off this 30ft fibreglass Stonehenge on to a pile of mattresses. Then - dong, dong - bells start tolling and all the roadies come across the front of the stage in monks' cowls, at which point War Pigs starts up.\" </p> <p>At first this may seem like a case of the film being inspired by real incidents, but this is improbable - the tour happened the same year This Is Spinal Tap was released. </p> <p><strong> Troggs tapes</strong><br> </p> <p> The British pop band, led by millionaire crop-circle enthusiast Reg Presley and famous for Wild Thing and Love Is All Around, became the subject of cult fame with the Troggs Tapes. These recordings, available on bootleg, were made during a session and display, according to The Penguin Encyclopaedia of Popular Music, \"instrumental incompetence, mutual recrimination and much foul language\". They inspired the sequence in which Tufnel and St Hubbins have their row in the Rainbow Trout Recording Studio. </p> <p><strong> Uriah Heep</strong><br> </p> <p> One of key bands who inspired the Tap, the long-lived and resolutely unfashionable Heep enjoyed commercial success, especially in America, for three decades, and plodded on despite critical indifference or scorn, enduring more than 30 changes in personnel (particularly with drummers) and two deaths. </p> <p>John Sinclair, the original keyboardist with Spinal Tap, had to leave the band when negotiations for the film were taking too long. He toured with Uriah Heep. When he returned to the project to contribute to the album, he told the band how Uriah Heep were once booked to play an air force base. Tap in turn play an air force base, where their sound system picks up military radio messages. </p> <p><strong> Vomit </strong><br> </p> <p> Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs, the Tap's second drummer, died in 1974 by choking on vomit, although it has never emerged whose vomit it was. AC/DC's lead singer Bon Scott died this way, as did Jimi Hendrix and Mama Cass Elliot, of The Mamas and the Papas. But the immediate inspiration for Stumpy Joe's death is John Bonham, drummer of Led Zeppelin. On the afternoon of September 24 1980, Bonham started a drinking binge that continued until midnight. The following afternoon an assistant went to rouse him and found him dead. He had consumed around 40 shots of vodka, suffered alcohol poisoning and choked on his vomit in his sleep. </p> <p><strong> Wainwright III, Loudon</strong><br> </p> <p> In early incarnations of the Tap, singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III appeared as keyboard player. </p> <p><strong> Xanadu Star Theatre</strong><br> </p> <p> The venue in Cleveland, Ohio where the band get lost backstage. In his commentary for the Criterion laser disc edition, Christopher Guest recalls the inspiration for the scene: \"We saw a tape of Tom Petty playing somewhere in Germany, where he's walking backstage and a door's opened and he ends up on an indoor tennis court and there's just this moment of stunned, you know, 'Where am I?'\" </p> <p><strong> Yes</strong><br> </p> <p> Steven Soderbergh made a documentary of British prog-rock band Yes in the mid-80s called 9012 Live. In an interview with Soderbergh, Observer journalist Andrew Anthony asked incredulously if the film was made after This Is Spinal Tap. Soderbergh replied: \"Yeah. I took Jon Anderson to see it and he came back and told the rest of the guys about it. They started watching it, like, every day because it was so their world.\" </p> <p><strong> Zappa, Dweezil</strong><br> </p> <p> Son of rock guitarist Frank, who contributed a solo to Diva Fever on Break Like the Wind. </p> <p> \u0095 Extracted from This Is Spinal Tap, the Official Companion, edited by Karl French, published by Bloomsbury on 16 October at \u00a316.99.
