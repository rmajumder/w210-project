  "<p>Only a scant knowledge of economics is necessary to realise that in the nature of things a boom must eventually go bust. Football, however, appears set on defying economic law for some time yet. </p> <p>As the new season begins there is no obvious sign that the game in England, with all its shortcomings, is about to loosen its bulldog grip on either the public's affection or the public's purse. When people queue up outside the Manchester United megastore at midnight in order to be the first to buy the latest design in shirts at \u00a348 for adults and \u00a338 for children, it is hard to argue that the game is heading for the rocks. </p> <p>Certainly the television companies do not share this view, scrambling over one another to pour more millions into club coffers under the latest agreement while said millions are being mortgaged by boardrooms to pay the fees and salaries of costly new signings. </p> <p>Much of the football may be mundane but financially the game, in general terms, has never had it so good. As well as the latest strike at the TV goldmine, clubs stand to earn extra windfalls through sponsorship and kit deals. And while their supporters may complain about increased admission prices, they have yet to stay away in significant numbers. Miss a match and withdrawal symptoms soon set in. </p> <p>With a captive and captivated audience, football, it seems, cannot lose. The unknown potential of pay-per-view has yet to be exploited to a serious degree but there is a proliferation of dot-commery to give fans a quick fix. A fully fledged European league is imminent and more new stadiums are planned, with Arsenal set to rebuild barely a mile down the road from Highbury. </p> <p>Given such an optimistic background, dissenters are apt to be given the sort of bemused glance accorded to those mournful figures who used to parade outside football grounds advising customers to prepare to meet their doom. </p> <p>At regular intervals financial experts warn that football is dancing on thin ice with heated skates. Yet the waltz continues, with an ever-higher proportion of club turnovers being spent on players' salaries as managers strive to keep their jobs while directors juggle to keep supporters and the banks happy. </p> <p>Inflation is rife. Students of O-level economics are taught that inflation is the result of too much money chasing too few goods, and when Tottenham feel compelled to spend \u00a35m on a defender, Ben Thatcher, from a relegated team, Wimbledon, the point is surely proved. Everybody, however, seems happy with the way things are. </p> <p>Only two things, in the main, could upset this sanguine state of affairs. One is a recession of sufficient severity to curtail the public's spending power and leave football with a lot of replica shirts on its hands, but there is no sign of this yet. </p> <p>The other is a stage at which BSkyB felt its coverage had reached such a point of saturation that no useful purpose would be served by forever upping the ante. If that happened a shudder would run through the game's balance sheets, but the process of soaking the viewers has barely begun. </p> <p>Fans will always moan about a losing team and few have ever had a good word to say about referees, but in general it seems that football can do no wrong. The England team may have failed in a major tournament under a coach whose only credentials appear to have been his popularity and ability to get on with the media, but England teams have flopped before without diminishing people's enthusiasm for a flawed but invigorating domestic game. </p> <p>The proliferation of foreign players, some outstanding, most merely competent, makes it easier for supporters to dissociate themselves from the mediocrity of the national team. Why worry about who will follow Alan Shearer in the England attack when your club has signed a talented Ukrainian, Sergei Rebrov, or a goalscoring Dutchman, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink? </p> <p>Fans are not daft. They know that technically the Premiership is not on a par with the leagues of Italy and Spain, but will insist that for action, incident and excitement it has no equals, an argument supported by the number of foreign countries who take the live TV coverage from English grounds. </p> <p>\"English football is at its best when our teams are playing each other,\" Ron Greenwood declared many years ago, and the domestic product continues to support this view. Terry Venables was also right when he said that the English game thrived on errors which became an embarrassment when repeated in international tournaments, a point well made by Kevin Keegan's team this summer. </p> <p>This is why, while Manchester United and Arsenal may be among the European clubs forever threatening to break away and form their own TV-orientated league, fans will take a great deal of persuading that such a competition could ever take precedence over the present scheme of things. In the longer term, domestic rivalries will always have more appeal than international rivalries. </p> <p>The Premiership remains a lead pencil with a gold top but few fans are complaining. And United will not stay top forever, even though it may take Sir Alex Ferguson's impending retirement to end their present domination. If he actually goes, that is.</p>",
  "<p>Even the silver-tongued Alistair Darling could not have sounded less persuasive. The social security secretary was on the BBC Today programme defending the indefensible. There would be compensation for people who could show that his department had misinformed them about changes to the state earnings related pensions scheme (serps) made in 1986, and due to come into force this year. But there was no guarantee of redress for anybody else who had suffered.</p> <p>The numbers involved are huge: there are 20m contributors to the scheme, which provides a second state pension to people who do not have an occupational or personal pension. But that does not affect the principle. For a decade after the change in the law, the department failed to alter its leaflets to warn contributors that the pensions of their partners would be halved on their death. Worse still, people who wrote for information were not told of the change. </p> <p>Mr Darling suggested there was no precedent for a government compensation on such a large scale. But there have been very few precedents for such a massive Whitehall administrative error. No wonder the bureaucrats have been at their worst in trying to defend it, even suggesting they had not misled people, because advice given between 1986 and 1996 had been \"correct at the time\". </p> <p>As private pension specialists noted yesterday, the sin of omission is as serious as that of commission. The department is as guilty of \"mis-selling\" pensions as the private companies and personal financial advisers who ripped off 2.7m people in the personal pension scandal a decade ago. The department has deferred the change until October 2002, but in a report this week the Commons public accounts committee suggested this should be extended to 2016. </p> <p>The MPs were unequivocal about the Government's obligation to recompense contributors. Ministers should seize this solution: there is no way they can devise a scheme which can identify people who were misled by a telephone call or leaflet up to a decade ago. Mr Darling complains about the costs: about \u00a313bn - but the private sector has been forced to spend \u00a311bn compensating its victims. </p> <p>But let us be clear where the real responsibility lies. It should not have been Mr Darling in the dock yesterday, but the succession of Tory ministers running the department between 1986-96 when these shameful errors occurred.</p>",
  "<p>Coventry were proclaiming a coup last night with the immiment \u00a36.5m signing of Craig Bellamy, a forward the midlands club \"fully expect to do as well as Robbie Keane, if not better\". </p> <p>The prediction came from an elated Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson, whose club are capturing a 21-year-old player in Keane's quick, clever mould for half the Italian money received on the young Irishman's startling recent move to Internazionale. </p> <p>Richardson said: \"It is fantastic news for the club - especially considering the calibre of opposition we were up against,\" claiming three Premiership clubs and one from the First Division had also pursued Bellamy. Tottenham are known to have monitored the Welsh international since he made an impact as a fast, free-scoring forward at Norwich. </p> <p>Coventry were particularly keen to check Bellamy has fully recovered from the knee injury that kept him out of the Norwich side for most of last season and undoubtedly delayed his move to the Premiership. </p> <p>The financial side of the deal was completed at 2am yesterday, with Bellamy agreeing a five-year contract, before he drove to the midlands in the afternoon for his medical. </p> <p>Richardson said his manager Gordon Strachan had spoken to several other people to make sure and they all said, \"Go and get him, he's tops.\" </p> <p>Coventry will find they have signed a \"disciple of the game,\" according to Bobby Gould, who worked closely with Bellamy while Wales manager. \"Craig flies to Belgium and Holland to watch matches and to learn about the game - and that shows in the way he plays. </p> <p>\"On the pitch he is very effervescent, a sharp performer and an excellent finisher. I would certainly put him in the same bracket as Michael Owen and Robbie Keane.\" </p> <p>Bradford City's manager Chris Hutchings yesterday contemplated an audacious move for the talented but troublesome Russian striker Vladimir Beschastnykh. </p> <p>A delegation led by Hutchings flew into Moscow yesterday, where Beschastnykh played for his country before coming off in the 46th minute in the 1-0 win over Israel. </p> <p>The controversial 26-year-old is eligible to leave Racing Santander on a free transfer next summer and the Spanish club would prefer to sell him now, albeit for a fraction of the \u00a36m that he would usually command. Beschastnykh has fallen out with Santander team-mates and been criticised by the club's president Miguel Angel Diaz. </p> <p>Leeds are to make David O'Leary the highest-paid manager in the history of English football in the next 48 hours. The club confidently expect him to commit himself until 2006 after accepting a deal worth \u00a32m a year, plus bonuses. </p> <p>Dominic Matteo's move to Leeds hit a snag yesterday when a medical revealed a knee injury which will keep him out for two months. But Leeds insist that the \u00a34.75m deal with Liverpool will eventually be resurrected.</p>",

  "<p>Gloucestershire, the inexplicable two-timers of county cricket - on their way to their fourth Lord's limited-overs final on the trot while languishing at the bottom of the championship - never quite sustained their attempts at pleasant Castle Park yesterday to disprove the theories about lack of versatility in their technique. </p> <p>They finished on 278 for nine and had hinted they would do better than that. But it was an encouraging start to the Colchester festival for Essex, who are well placed for promotion from their runners-up position in the Second Division. </p> <p>Success is likely to rest with the spinners, and Essex are playing three of them. Peter Such has already taken four wickets, having been on a hat-trick and ambling through overs with that craft that not long ago appeared to be going into obscurity. </p> <p>Gloucestershire perhaps are banking on Martyn Ball and Jeremy Snape, who is currently batting well and has to be dislodged this morning. </p> <p>Gloucestershire like to bat first and crack along. Their acquired one-day confidence seemed in evidence during the morning session, though Dominic Hewson disappeared, caught at second slip, and Tim Hancock, approaching his half-century, was out cutting to Graham Napier at cover. Ronnie Irani was the bowler each time. </p> <p>Essex persevered and were periodically rewarded. Matt Windows and Kim Barnett, effective against Lancashire on Sunday, in turn moved the score on. But eventually Windows jabbed to short leg and Barnett was caught at gully. </p> <p>At that point there appeared to be plenty to come. Chris Taylor, in his first season of county cricket and impatient to reinforce the acclaim that accompanied his maiden hundred at Lord's, paraded several glorious shots, through mid wicket off Danny Law and guiding Such through the covers, before top-edging spinner Tim Mason to short fine leg. </p> <p>Mark Alleyne, shrugging off his back problem benefited from edges wide of slips against Irani. After a settled period and eight boundaries Alleyne played on to Ashley Cowan. </p> <p>Essex retained the initiative during the evening as Jack Russell was caught at silly point after an obdurate stand. Further, Ball was bowled by Such and Jon Lewis perished first ball to short leg.</p>",
  "<p>Has the e-book arrived? This is the question nervous publishers have been asking themselves this week, after Microsoft unveiled the latest version of Microsoft Reader, the software for laptops, PCs and hand-held devices which aims to transfer the experience of reading from the written page to the computer screen.</p> <p>The move, described by Microsoft as equivalent to the creation of the first mass-produced motorcar, was timed to coincide with the launch of its eBookStore by the US internet bookseller <a href=\"http://www.bn.com\">Barnes &amp; Noble.com</a>. \"This is a major milestone for the publishing industry and book lovers alike,\" said Dick Brass, vice president for technology development at Microsoft. \"Anyone wondering about electronic reading needs only to spend some time with a good eBook on Microsoft Reader to see what the excitement is all about.\"</p> <p>Suggestions that the software could do to publishers what Napster and the MP3 have done to the music industry were rebutted by Microsoft, which said that it had joined up with the Association of American Publishers to fight digital piracy. The computer giant promised to put a \"significant financial endowment\" into creating new technology to identify illegal content on the net.</p> <p>In the US a number of publishers have jumped on the e-book bandwagon in recent months, including the giants Random House and Time Warner, both of which have established their own digital imprints. \"I believe that the eBook will change the whole notion of how we receive and enjoy information and entertainment,\" said a bullish Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman and CEO of Time Warner Trade Publishing.</p> <p>This latest \"major milestone\" was greeted with typical stiff upper lips in the UK, where publishers have yet to be convinced that the e-book will not go the same way as the ill-fated CD-rom.</p> <p>However, Microsoft's hyperbole aside, the fact that consumers the world over can now download books such as Michael Crichton's Disclosure or Kathy Reichs's Deadly Decisions for as little as $10 and read them using their preferred e-book software should not go unnoticed for too much longer in the UK. One of the books being heavily promoted by Barnes &amp; Noble.com, Jackie Collins's Lethal Seduction, will not be available in the UK in traditional book form until October. Replace Jackie Collins with JK Rowling and Lethal Seduction with Harry Potter Five and the potential threat is obvious.</p> <p>One British publisher which has decided to take a chance on e-books is the academic group Taylor &amp; Francis. They recently signed up with a US e-publishing company, Versaware, to publish new digital e-book formats alongside their conventional printed books. </p> <p>The company, whose imprints include Routledge and Garland, also intends to have an e-book version of its entire back catalogue by 2001. When asked why the group was taking this step now, managing director Roger Horton said \"the eBook is here, and the widespread use of the internet makes it much more accessible. We cannot continue to dip our toes into the digital stream... We had to take control of our content, its availability and distribution to position ourselves for the future.\" </p> <p> As if this was not enough for publishers, the Bookseller has reported that literary agents are also getting in on the act. According to the trade paper, Richard Gollner of Radala &amp; Associates is to publish The Wisdom of Crocodiles by Paul Hoffman on 29 August under his agency's own imprint, Big Time Press. According to Mr Gollner, the decision to publish was an experiment - but he warned that, with cheaper and easier printing methods now available, it was an experiment that could easily be repeated. In a show of net nous, the book - a section of which has already been made into an eponymous film starring Jude Law - is being promoted by a fiendishly difficult online competition at <a href=\"http://www.1234.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.1234.com</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, mind, body and spirit publisher Element, which has been suffering a long period of bad karma, could be about to join Fourth Estate at HarperCollins, Rupert Murdoch's rarely harmonic global publishing empire. The Bookseller reported that newly installed chief executive Victoria Barnsley has been courting the struggling purveyor of all things yin and yang. Ms Barnsley, it seems, would like to put it alongside HarperCollins' very own mind, body, spirit imprint, Thorsons.</p> <p>The rumour, if it proves to be true, should be of interest to Eileen Campbell, the publisher credited with being the inspiration behind Thorsons. Ms Campbell left HarperCollins earlier this year for Penguin, where her brief was to nurture a mind, body, spirit list. Penguin, which distributes Element's books in the UK, is thought to have backed away from an attempt to acquire Element itself.</p> <p>But then Penguin has been busy of late, not least in the company of lawyers. Fresh from the David Irving trial, the nation's favourite publisher has received a legal challenge from the owner of the domain name katie.com, after releasing a book in the US with the same title. The original Katie has been forced to take down her site and replace it with an <a href=\"http://www.katie.com\" target=\"_NEW\">open letter to Penguin</a>, in which she says that the book was originally to have been called girl.com - presumably until someone twigged that it was an address for adult content.</p> <p> It seems Penguin could face further legal problems arising from the closure of Dorling Kindersley Family Learning (DKFL), the direct-selling arm of the company acquired by Penguin earlier this year. According to a report in Publishing News, a number of DKFL distributors, who feel they have been left high and dry by Penguin's decision to close the unit, are exploring their legal options. The numbers involved were not disclosed, but there were more than 30,000 such distributors when the division was culled.</p> <p>But it has not been a wholly bad week for Penguin. The publisher has announced that it is bringing forward the publication of Sir Alec Guinness's last volume of diaries, the prophetically titled A Positively Final Appearance. The book was originally scheduled for late September publication, but has been brought forward a month in the wake of the actor's death. Copies could be in bookshops as early as this week.</p>",
  "<p>Football, more than any other business, can pretty much count on its clients' continued support. Today's Premier League charter represents a long-overdue recognition by clubs that their fans' loyalty has been scantly repaid.</p> <p>Like the cleaning rota pinned inside the doors of toilets in certain pub chains, the important thing is not so much that customers' needs are met but that they are seen to be met. And so while fans may be still be paying inflated prices to watch English football - cruelly exposed during Euro 2000 as not quite what it was cracked up to be - the charter should give us all the warm reassurance of a spotless urinal.</p> <p>While Premier League clubs have been anxious to portray their new agreement as legislation with teeth - a legally binding document that could incur fines for offenders - the small print is telling by its absence.</p> <p>The draft charter says that there should be \"a broad range of ticket prices\"; that \"at least 5% of tickets to each game [go] to non-season-ticket holders\"; that there should be \"support for disabled supporters and their carers\". All very honourable, but hardly holding clubs to task.</p> <p>Other specifications amount to little more than a promise not to rob supporters blind. Few of football's new middle-class fan base might have realised a charter was needed to guarantee reduced admission to replays of abandoned games, including those abandoned before kick off; or to ensure that a club should \"offer refunds on merchandise in accordance with its legal obligations\". </p> <p>And under the sections relating to away support, loyalty, customer service and community activity, large chunks carry the proviso \"to be decided by the individual club\".</p> <p>It would be churlish to be entirely dismissive. Even the fact that football authorities are registering supporters' grievances at such ongoing abuses as overcharging away fans is progress.</p> <p>But charters are invariably associated in the public mind with shoddy service - where are they more vaunted than the railways, the only other British institution that could compete in terms of overcharging and customer discomfort? </p> <p>The very term charter is redolent of the early Major years. Back then, it was already clear to the paying public that clubs were taking liberties with their loyal followers. Until actions follow the fine words, the Premier League's belated move is only likely to be perceived as so much spin.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gwyn.topham@theguardian.com\">gwyn.topham@theguardian.com </a></p>",
  "More students are staying in education after GCSEs but they do not necessarily study what ministers would like them to, information released last night by the exam boards shows. <p>A new post-16 curriculum is being introduced from September, with more emphasis on vocational qualifications and encouragement for students to take a greater mix of subjects. </p> <p>But this year there were significant falls in those completing vocational advanced GNVQ courses - a fall of 10,749 to 80,290, and a change which worries the Confederation of British Industry. Entries at A-level in sciences and modern languages also fell - both key subjects which also fell in 1999. </p> <p>In their penultimate year, traditional A-levels showed their enduring popularity. </p> <p>The number of A-level entries was up slightly by 1,298 to 784,990, even though the number of 18-year-olds in Britain has fallen by 7,500 to 606,000. </p> <p>AS-level entries, which will play a much greater part in the revamped system, increased by 6,600 to 74,950 this year. </p> <p>A-level French entries fell by nearly 3,000, or 13.5%, to 18,221. German declined by al most 1,000 (8.9%) to 8,692. </p> <p>In May the Nuffield Languages Inquiry, headed by Sir Trevor McDonald, published a lengthy report warning of the dire implications of Britain's \"deplorable monolingualism\". </p> <p>The inquiry's assistant secretary, Alwena Lamping, said last night: \"This is very worrying and is a continuation of the trend we foresaw in our inquiry. </p> <p>\"More than 90% of pupils already drop languages at the age of 16 and in a few years there will be a serious lack of specialist linguists in the UK.\" </p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"Students are voting with their feet and dropping French, German, and other traditional subjects. The significant drop in modern language entries is evidence of a European isolationist attitude.\" </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"At a time when the country needs the maximum number of well-qualified modern linguists, it is perverse that A-level entry is decreasing.\" </p> <p>Paul Sokoloff, convenor of the Joint Council for General Qualifications, representing the exam boards of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said he hoped more students would take a modern language as a one of the four or five subjects they take at AS- level in the first year of sixth form. </p> <p>But Mr Dunford has already reported that pupils going into the sixth form next year seem far more likely to choose subjects like media studies and psychology. </p> <p>They were among those showing an increase in A-level entries this year, psychology by 5%, and media, film and TV studies by 7.4%. Psychology entries at AS-level rose by 29%. </p> <p>Mark Reid, of the British Film Institute's education department, said: \"The increase in the number of youngsters taking media studies reflects the strong interest in our cultural life. </p> <p>\"It is completely wrong to suggest that this is a subject which is not as challenging as others\". </p> <p>But computing and IT A-level entries rose by nearly 2,000 or 11.4% to 19,099. At AS-level entries rose by 25%. </p> <p>The most popular subjects were general studies, English, maths, biology and chemistry, with the top three remaining unchanged on last year. But of those, only general studies showed an increase in entries year on year. </p> <p>Geography was another big loser at A-level, with entries falling by 11.9%. </p> <p>There were increases in those taking A-levels in art and design, business studies, his tory, religious studies, physical education, technology and Welsh. </p> <p>But entries fell in classics, communications, economics, expressive arts, home economics, law, physics, politics and sociology. </p> <p>Nick Seaton, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: \"Youngsters need modern languages and geography to make their way in the world. The vast majority of people think media studies a waste of time.\" </p> <p>One of the arguments used by independent schools to justify their disproportionate intake to top universities is that more of their candidates take the harder A-level subjects. </p> <p>But Mr Solokoff said great efforts were made to ensure that A-level subjects were equally demanding. </p> <p>In a further twist to the gender divide, girls do better than boys in maths and physics but worse in French and Spanish. But more boys take maths and physics and more girls take the two languages, which may to some extent explain the discrepancy. </p> <p>At advanced GNVQ, 15.4% of candidates won distinctions, compared with 13.5% last year. Entries increased for computing and performing arts and dropped for business and leisure and tourism.</p>",
  "Underwater rescue capsules again failed to reach the 118 seamen trapped on a Russian nuclear submarine today. <p>But there was renewed hope for the crew of the Kursk when new Russian estimates suggested that there may be up to three weeks of oxygen in the vessel. </p> <p>Evidence analysed today suggested that the submarine may have been sunk by a massive torpedo explosion which shattered large areas of the vessel, leaving few sailors time to escape. Navy officials said that there were now no signs of life on the vessel, but insisted that some of the crew could still be alive. </p> <p>Rescue capsules trying to link up with the submarine for the past three days were again driven back today by racing currents and sand on the dark seabed.</p> <p>The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, said today that the situation was \"close to catastrophic\". </p> <p>A British rescue team was tonight heading towards the scene by ship, but it is not expected to arrive until Sunday.</p> <p>The Russian navy has given contradictory estimates of how long the Kursk's oxygen could last. It currently suggests that there could be up to three weeks of air trapped inside the hull.</p> <p>Film of the submarine studied today revealed massive damage from the front of the vessel to the conning tower. The damage would have sent the vessel crashing to the bottom in seconds.</p> <p>The control room where most of the crew work is below the tower, suggesting many sailors had no time to escape when the submarine went down. </p> <p>\"The accident happened so quickly we can say it was like a flash,\" said navy spokesman Captain Igor Dygalo. </p> <p>US submarines monitoring Russian navy exercises at the time when the Kursk was lost detected two explosions, according to Russian press reports. The second explosion was much larger than the first, the reports said. </p> <p>The Russian navy refused to confirm the reports, but officers have said an explosion in the torpedo compartment at the front of the submarine apparently caused the Kursk to sink. A likely scenario was that one torpedo exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion in the loaded torpedo compartment. </p> <p>The damage apparently included the submarine's internal escape capsule located in the conning tower, making it impossible to use, Captain Dygalo said. </p> <p>Defence minister Igor Sergeyev said authorities were still investigating the possibility of a collision. </p> <p>After insisting for days that western aid was not needed, the Russian government asked Britain and Norway to for help. Two Norwegian ships were today taking divers and the British mini-submarine to the rescue area. </p> <p>The reversal apparently came after President Vladimir Putin spoke with US President Bill Clinton yesterday before ordering his navy to seek help. </p> <p>Russian officials refused to say why the Russian plane which flew the British mini-sub to Norway was not flown to a Russian airfield closer to the rescue site.</p> <p>The rescue capsules currently at the scene are trying to latch onto one of the Kursk's hatches. The effort was being frustrated by the strong currents and almost zero visibility. </p> <p>Four Russian rescue capsules are taking turns to try to reach the Kursk, each spending up to five hours submerged. Success of the rescue operation is dependent not only on latching on to a hatch, which can only open from the inside, but also on whether any survivors are able to open it.</p>",

  "On the desert sands of Jericho, not far from Sodom and Gomorrah, thousands of Israeli Jews are succumbing every night to a powerful temptation: legalised gambling. <p>The Oasis casino is a light pink lump that has pretensions of Atlantic City glitz, although it is across the road from a Palestinian refugee camp. Less than a year after it opened, the roulette wheels are spinning dizzily, and the twisting desert highway from Jerusalem is bumper-to-bumper on weekend nights.</p> <p>The Oasis is the first legal casino within easy drive of Israeli homes since the Jewish state was founded in 1948, and its attractions are proving irresistible. </p> <p>But the casino's popularity is surprising. Jericho is a taboo territory - controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority - where many Israelis would not otherwise venture.</p> <p>A trip to the tables requires submitting to Palestinian refugees in khaki uniforms who demand the surrender of weapons, and take your pictures with a hidden camera. It also means handing over your money to a former enemy when you lose. </p> <p>But Israelis, who make up 95% of the casino's customers, evidently have no qualms about that, helping the casino to rack up estimated earnings of \u00a3700m a year. Much of that windfall is going to the Austrian firm that runs it, but the rest finds its way to the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>Inside its pink confines, the casino - open 24-7 barring the Jewish Day of Atonement - is a place of fierce concentration. Blackjack players clutch two hands at a time, and people strain to get close to the tables. Piles of empty coffee cups are racked up by the roulette wheels, their owners lost to the game.</p> <p>Most of the players are middle-aged or elderly people, gambling with their pension money, and riding the free buses that run between the casino and 13 Israeli cities. The regulars also include Orthodox Jews, who use the hours between 3am and 5am, returning to Jerusalem in time for morning prayers.</p> <p>Seema Levy, a Jerusalem housewife, says she takes the 8pm bus here nearly every evening. Beginning by playing chaperone to a husband who is a compulsive gambler, she now takes an occasional spin on the $10 (\u00a37) roulette. \"I still control the money, and when we lose $200 then we get back on the bus.\"</p> <p>But many of the regulars here have no such minder, and Ms Levy has seen players lose small fortunes. A retired telephone linesman confesses that his losses for April came to more than $3,000, and a building contractor toted up his losses since the casino opened in September 1998 as more than $50,000.</p> <p>Such dismal accounts are confirmed by addiction counsellors in Israel. \"Since the casino opened, I have had one thousand calls from families who have lost everything - houses, money, furniture, cars,\" said Pnina Eldar, who runs gambling treatment centres in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. \"People who have never gambled before are now addicted. It's a terrible situation.\"</p> <p>For the Palestinians, whose economy is largely held hostage by Israeli controls, the takings at Jericho are sweet revenge. The Jericho gambling den has proved so lucrative that the casino is planning to expand to the West Bank city of Ramallah, less than half an hour from Tel Aviv once a new Israeli security road is completed.</p> <p>Officials in the authority have few qualms about relieving Israelis of their funds, and they can rest secure in the knowledge that none of it is coming from Palestinians. By order of the Palestinian Authority, none may enter the casino, partly to appease Islamist clerics who had balked at the presence of a legal gambling den.</p> <p>For many Palestinians, the ban is simply good sense. \"Casinos are in the business of taking people's money away,\" said one employee.</p> <p>Neither apparently do Israelis have much compunction about handing their money over to a people still seen as the enemy by a significant minority of the population. \"In the beginning I used to be sensitive,\" Ms Levy said. \"I did not want to play and give money to Palestinians, but after a while, you just play, you don't worry where the money is going.\"</p> <p>That apparently has been a lifelong problem for Israelis. Ms Eldar estimates that 80% of Israelis over the age of 18 gamble; about 4% of the population are compulsive gamblers, a higher rate than in many western countries. She has also set up clinics for teenage gamblers, who play away their money at high school betting dens.</p> <p>Until the casino at Jericho opened, many Israelis such as Ms Levy were regular travellers to casinos in Turkey - all of which closed two years ago - and in Taba, on the Egyptian side of Israel's southern border. There are also thriving gambling operations on ships that call in at the port of Eilat.</p> <p>Ms Eldar fears the arrival of legal gambling so close to home will prove irresistible to Israelis, and complains that the government's social services department has failed to recognise the danger in the vice.</p> <p>But many at the Oasis would dismiss her as an alarmist. \"Anyone who has a brain knows how to play,\" said a housewife from Ramle, who was settling in for a long night to recover the $300 she lost at the roulette tables. \"You have to know there is a limit.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,45382,00.html\">John Gielgud</a>'s last film appearance is to be showcased at the inaugural Belfast Film Festival, which runs from September 22-29. \"Cork has had a film festival for 44 years; Dublin for 37 years,\" festival director Aidan McCloone told the BBC. \"I think it's long overdue.\" Gielgud died in May, aged 96, shortly after acting opposite the playwright Harold Pinter in the short film <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0243166\">Catastrophe</a>, one of seven sections in a feature based on the work of Samuel Beckett. Pinter later remarked that Gielgud had seemed frail during the shoot and that there had been a general sense that this was the great actor's final role.</p> <p>\u0095 On the other side of the Atlantic, next month's <a href=\"http://www.e.bell.ca/filmfest/\">Toronto Film Festival</a> has selected Robert Altman's eagerly awaited Dr T and the Women (starring Richard Gere, Liv Tyler and Helen Hunt) to officially open the proceedings. Other films in the line-up include Beautiful, directed by Sally Field and starring Minnie Driver, and Pollock, a portrait of the legendary drip-painter Jackson Pollock, directed by and starring Ed Harris. </p> <p>\u0095 No-one could accuse <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?von+Trier,+Lars\">Lars Von Trier</a> of mellowing with age. Having pioneered the oddball Dogme movement with The Idiots and squabbled with Bjork on the set of Dancer in the Dark, the Danish director now has his heart set on making a James Bond movie - in which 007 is gay. Mulling over his options after scooping the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Von Trier has told reporters that: \"I want to do a James Bond film. James Bond is a genre in itself now. In read all of the books, and loved them very much. The books have a really good mood, they have more perversity.\" In Ian Fleming's source novels, Von Trier adds, \"Bond enjoys torture\u00c4 and he has very badly hidden homosexual tendencies.\" Wonder if Pierce Brosnan is aware of this.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Matarazzo,+Heather\">Heather Matarazzo</a> has signed on to co-star in Disney's The Princess Diaries, for director Garry Marshall. The star of Welcome to the Dollhouse will play the best mate of an everyday Manhattan girl (Anne Hathaway) who discovers she's really the heir to a fairytale European duchy. The picture starts shooting next month. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Freeman,+Morgan\">Morgan Freeman</a> (pictured) is in final negotiations to reunite with his Kiss the Girls co-star Ashley Judd in Fox's thriller High Crimes, reports <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/\">Variety</a>. Based on Joseph Finder's novel, the film is a legal-eagles outing about a Harvard professor (Judd) who defends her army-deserter husband with the aid of an ex-judge (Freeman). Carl Franklin, director of the woefully underrated Devil in a Blue Dress, will be behind the camera.</p> <p>\u0095 With Pearl Harbor already well into its shooting schedule, last-minute roles are still being filled. The most recent of these has gone to <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Aykroyd,+Dan\">Dan Ackroyd</a> - drafted in to play an army officer who blows the whistle on the Japanese attack on the US naval base. Considering that the whole movie revolves around this one event, it sounds such a crucial role you wonder why they took so long to cast it.</p>",
  "<p>When Wired magazine was launched in the UK in 1995, the front cover pictured Thomas Paine, and a wonderful article argued that he should be adopted as the patron saint of the information age. I was delighted to see this recognition that he still has something new to offer us, despite the fact that he died in 1809. </p> <p>Paine was one of the few people to do something to which countless have aspired: he wrote a book that changed the world. His extended pamphlet Common Sense, published in January 1776, galvanised colonial opposition to the British government and in many ways sparked off the American Revolution. </p> <p>That revolution seems to have interesting connections with the internet revolution. Discussions in internet newsgroups covering politics, economics and social issues make frequent appeal to the US constitution and the thoughts of the founders. This must be partly because of the US origins of the internet, but I don't believe it is the whole story. There is too much resonance between the founders of the American Republic and the English-speaking denizens of cyberspace. </p> <p>Start with the analogies bandied around. How many presentations about the internet refer to it as the Wild West? This was geographically distant from the seat of government and had to evolve its own codes and rules. When government finally reached the frontier it legitimised these codes but didn't really have any choice about their foundations and structures. </p> <p>Today the frontier is the internet. It is equally distant from the seat of government but in this case the distance is in \"information space\" rather than physical space. The government will eventually catch up, but its only course of action will be to legitimise rules that are being formed right now. </p> <p>Even though the metaphor is useful, the internet isn't the Wild West. For one thing, the West existed before it was exploited: cyberspace is being created and extended every day. </p> <p>How about a different metaphor? A superpower is bogged down in a distant guerrilla war. It must resupply its army (victorious for a generation) thousands of miles from home and it is very expensive. Support for the war is tentative, dividing both the people and the political leadership. The guerrillas are supported by the superpower's greatest enemy. The war drags on and the rebels continue to gain momentum, even though they are occasionally beaten. Vietnam? No: British North America in 1782. </p> <p>It's easy to see the roots of the dispute: </p> <p>\u0095 A distant colony where conditions are different.</p> <p> \u0095 Politicians taking actions they feel constrained to implement even while they are being advised that they are acting against the nation's best interests. In 1774 Viscount Rockingham (Britain's 'Minister of War') said that a land war in America would be useless, costly and impossible to win.</p> <p>\u0095 Legislators trying to fit something they don't understand into existing models. British politicians operated in almost complete ignorance of America. None of them had ever been there, and they made no effort to learn anything about it. </p> <p>There is a another parallel: the row going on about encryption on the net and the row that went on in the colonies about taxation. In 1760s, the British government introduced the Writs of Assistance to clamp down on the evasion of customs duties. These didn't work, of course, because the cost of enforcement vastly outweighed the revenues collected. </p> <p>However, similar legislation introduced in England - the hated Cider Tax - prompted William Pitt's famous tirade in opposition: \"The poorest man in his cottage may bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may leak; the wind may blow through it; the storms may enter; the rain may enter - but the King of England cannot enter; all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!\" </p> <p>This is as good a call for strong cryptography as anything since. </p> <p>Britain tried to get the colonies to pay for their defence, and they wouldn't, much as business does not want to bear the cost of the RIP Bill. </p> <p>As American historian Barbara Tuchman has written, a consistent feature of the dealings between the British and the Americans in this period was that each side over-estimated the goals of the other. British intransigence, when compromise was both sensible and feasible, created rebels where there were none before. Is that so different from the current situation, where netizens suspect Jack Straw of wanting to read their email while the Home Office sees subjects suspicious of the RIP Bill as agents of anarchy? </p> <p>As we all know, the colonists decided against the many benefits of British rule. But as Edmund Burke was later to observe, the retention of America was worth far more to the mother country economically, politically and even morally than any sum which might have been raised by taxation, or even any principle of so-called constitution. </p> <p>A Britain that would have gained immeasurably by retaining a smaller proportion of the colonies' rapidly expanding economy acted directly against its own self-interest and lost everything. </p> <p>Will we be thinking the same about cyberspace a decade from now? </p> <p>I recently heard that around half of all income taxes are paid by around one twentieth of the population; and around half of them could work anywhere in the world provided they had a telephone line. Secession isn't that difficult for them. </p> <p>A rational government ought to proceed on the basis that trading with cyberspace is more important than control ling it. It isn't just about economics, though, as in the case of the Colonies. Economics may be at the core of the discontent but it is when the more emotional and emotive issues of liberty and freedom come into play that the flames are fanned to fire. This is why arguing about the RIP Bill may turn out to have more significance than people may think. </p> <p>\u0095 David Birch's company, Consult Hyperion, is one of the sponsors of the Tom Paine Project in Lewes, Sussex, where Paine spent some of his early life as a customs officer.

  "<p>In 1967, an extraordinary television series captured the imagination as few programmes had done before. Audiences were confronted with The Prisoner, a unique mix of science fiction, action adventure, social satire and allegory. Devised by Patrick McGoohan, who also played the lead role of Number 6, The Prisoner developed into a weird, apocalyptic nightmare, a radical piece of TV which dared to probe the boundaries of what the medium's potential could be. Now, a new release of the series on video and DVD is set to captivate a whole new generation. </p> <p>Set in a bizarre prison colony called The Village, Number 6, a former secret agent, is interrogated by a succession of officials known only as Number 2, in an attempt to find out why he's resigned from his top government position. Scientists use psychological conditioning, thought control and hallucinogenic drugs to try to break him, but Number 6 refuses to be \"pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered\" and instead puts all his time and energy into planning his escape. </p> <p>However, the series concludes as it began, with no happy ending. \"Freedom is a myth\", said McGoohan. </p> <p>The last episode, written and directed by McGoohan, completely overdosed on weirdness pills. \"Fall Out\" had Number 6 gunning down guards to \"All You Need is Love\", with no obvious answers to all the questions posed throughout the 17 episodes. On the night of transmission, thousands jammed the ITV switchboard, complaining about the incomprehensible finale. </p> <p>Confused viewers had been used to seeing McGoohan as the suave secret agent John Drake in Danger Man, a more straightforward show which he had tired of by the mid-60s. He quit and relied on his popularity to persuade Lew Grade to finance The Prisoner. McGoohan had already become the highest paid actor on British television, and was even offered the role of James Bond before Sean Connery. Uninterested in good guys with guns, he turned it down - twice. As McGoohan's Prisoner co-star Alexis Kanner recalls, \"Patrick was even offered a lot of money by the producers just to talk to them about playing Bond.\" </p> <p>Whatever his intentions, the generally hostile reaction to the final episode forced McGoohan to leave the country - the ironic situation of a real fall-out between him and the television audience. He escaped to Switzerland before settling permanently in California. </p> <p>Fellow Prisoner actor Kenneth Griffith thinks the enigmatic series was symbolic of McGoohan's own \"resignation\": \"I told Patrick that he was tall and handsome and could have made millions. But he rejected the star system. I think he really didn't like being in a business which is so shallow and has such shallow values.\" </p> <p>Over the years, McGoohan has become increasingly reclusive. At the same time, his series has attracted a new audience and become one of the most fanatically followed TV programmes of all time. </p> <p>So what's happened? Well, The Prisoner has become an international cult. There's an appreciation society, a shop dedicated to the programme in Portmeirion, and annual conventions organised by dedicated fans. American students have even studied McGoohan's series as part of sociology degree courses. </p> <p>The cult of The Prisoner also seems to extend to a cult of McGoohan. His refusal to give interviews only feeds the mystery and adds to his attraction. Many fans say that they've found the themes of The Prisoner in his other (rare) film appearances. For example, in 1979, Number 6 became Number 2 when he played the Chief Prison Warden in Don Siegel's Escape From Alcatraz. Again, in Mike Newell's The Man In The Iron Mask, McGoohan is the jailer, with lines like \"No one must see the prisoner.\" </p> <p>Now, more than 30 years after its initial broadcast, McGoohan could be about to come out of self-imposed isolation. The Prisoner is about to break out on to the big screen thanks to Con Air director Simon West and Universal Studios. Filming on the remake is due to get under way at Pinewood later this year. </p> <p>The roots of a full-length Prisoner feature film possibly lie in the success of Peter Weir's 1998 film The Truman Show, which starred Jim Carrey, and which, for a Hollywood movie, dealt with some pretty dark Prisoneresque themes - loss of personal freedom and identity. This deceptively light-hearted film even had an authoritative Number 2-type character called Christof (Ed Harris), the creator of Seahaven, Truman's \"prison\", a place very similar to the Village world of cheery greetings and blue skies. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see what a Hollywood director can add to the concept of The Prisoner, although it'll be no surprise if he's forced to use the same formula applied to other remakes like The Fugitive and Mission Impossible - big-budget bangs, car chases and happy endings. Nevertheless, whatever the outcome, good or bad, any remake of The Prisoner will hopefully draw attention to the original, a true work of art which deserves recognition.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Still simmering</strong><br> </p> <p> It's now eight weeks since Mary Williams turned to Consumer with the saga of her new kitchen. She had ordered it last December through a firm called Simply Kitchens in Chingford. Six months later she was still waiting for a satisfactory installation. Two sets of fitters appear to have been dismissed and not replaced; promised deliveries never turned up; other, unrequested, deliveries did arrive, including a grand total of four sinks; several items were damaged and three letters of complaint went unanswered. \"The company takes no responsibility and does not seem remotely interested in solving this situation for us,\" she says. \"There is a claims department but the customer support service won't put us through.\" </p> <p>\u0095The one time that Consumer gets through to a senior manager at Simply Kitchens he seems to be more interested in describing why we should all dump our kitchens and turn to him for renewal. In fact, any difficulties, he gushes, are entirely to do with the firm's astonishing success. \"We sell about 800 kitchens a week, in 80 in-store boutiques, but we're new and we are having growing pains,\" he admits. \"Sometimes miscommunications can cause problems but, hand on heart, we never ignore them.\" </p> <p>He promises to look in to the Williams case and that is the last we hear of him. Messages aren't returned, calls aren't transferred, or are put through to an automated system that culminates in a dead end. While we're waiting, an idle surf of the internet turns up an article on the company on the BBC Watchdog website. </p> <p>As many as 120 unhappy customers had registered a grievance, many with similar problems to Williams. However, Trading Standards insists the firm is merely ill-equipped to handle the demand. \"They've installed a new computer system to keep on top of problems,\" says a spokesman. \"If customers are still having problems they should contact their local Trading Standards authority.\" </p> <p>In the last fortnight, Williams has at last had her kitchen completed, but received neither an apology nor compensation. </p> <p><strong> Baggage claims</strong></p> <p> What happens when you arrive at your destination and your luggage doesn't? S Amodia, of Leeds, believes there is an international air-travel regulation which entitles passengers to $50 for each day their luggage is delayed. </p> <p>\"My sister-in-law was compensated when her case was delayed for a day, but when my son's luggage arrived two days late Sabena airlines denied all knowledge of the rule,\" she says. </p> <p>\u0095That is because this kind of compensation doesn't exist. \"There are so many urban myths of this type,\" laments Simon Evans of the Air Transport Users' Council (AUC). \"Airlines are liable for 'damages occasioned by delay' - for instance, if you have to buy toiletries to tide you over. But there is no rising scale for how much you get under specific circumstances. </p> <p>\"If you're outward bound you might get around $20-$30 a day, or an emergency kit, but if you're coming home you will be lucky to get anything.\" </p> <p>And if your belongings never turn up, the maximum you can get is \u00a314 per kilo, be it a bag of old T-shirts or the crown jewels. Interestingly, the AUC reports that complaints about mishandled baggage have risen by a third in its annual report which was published last week. </p> <p>\"Airlines' liability for lost bags is limited by international law to a a miserable sum,\" says the AUC's chairman, Ian Hamer. </p> <p>As he points out: \"A good quality suitcase costs more than that, let alone the contents. We are pressing European airlines to pay in excess of the statutory requirement on a voluntary basis.\" </p> <p><strong> They've been inking</strong></p> <p> The final word on printer ink cartridges, the cost of which has been exercising many of you. Peter Moore says he uses JR inkjet refills from Dixons, which last at least four refills and cost \u00a310 for black ink. Brian McDermott has been refilling the same cartridges for two years. Each refill costs about 75p in black ink, he estimates. </p> <p>Mike Walters of Stockport is less impressed with recycled cartridges from PC World. \"The black variety produced inferior quality print work and the colour didn't work at all,\" he says. \"An assistant told me that she wouldn't recommend them and that they might invalidate the printer manufacturer's warranty.\" John Dunning suggests readers visit the website of the Office Suppliers Trading Association to find their nearest independent stationer. \"Prices tend to be much cheaper.

  "A British rescue team today set sail on a desperate mission to aid 118 officers and men trapped on the seabed in a stricken Russian nuclear submarine. <p>Experts had toiled through the night to load the specialist British mini-submarine rescue vessel LR5 on to a supply ship in the Norwegian port of Trondheim so that it could set sail. </p> <p>The supply vessel, the Normand Pioneer, which has also been loaded with other specialist equipment, including decompression chambers, was heading for the Barents Sea, where the submarine Kursk is stranded on the bottom in about 350ft of Arctic water. </p> <p>But even as the rescue experts worked frantically to get to the aid of the stricken submarine, it emerged that the 14,000-ton vessel may have suffered much greater damage than first thought. </p> <p>Russian navy officials said film of the submarine showed that the vessel had suffered massive damage which reached from the front to the conning tower - and would have sent her crashing to the bottom in seconds. The control room, where most of the crew work, is below the tower, suggesting that many sailors would have had no time to escape as the submarine went down. </p> <p>\"The accident happened \u0085 like a flash,\" said Captain Igor Dygalo, a Russian navy spokesman. </p> <p>It was feared that any survivors among the 118 sailors aboard would be suffering an increasing shortage of oxygen and growing cold. But there were hopes that some of them could still be alive. The Russian navy has given contradictory estimates of how long the Kursk's oxygen could last, but some officers said air generators may have been destroyed when the submarine hit the seabed on Saturday. </p> <p>The British rescue team was not expected to reach the scene of the disaster until Saturday - a week after the Kursk sank during a military exercise. </p> <p>Russia's call for help came after strong currents and bad weather scuppered a series of rescue attempts by its own navy. </p> <p>Commander Mike Finney of the Royal Navy, a former nuclear submarine commander, said: \"We made the offer of help on Monday, and since Monday we have been preparing ourselves so that when and if the call came we could be as ready as possible to deploy. </p> <p>\"So we were really working hard to make sure there was absolutely no delay from our end. The LR5 is a submersible, so once it is in the water, it is no longer attached to the mother ship, so in effect it is an underwater helicopter. That gives it dynamic positioning capability, so it can cope with angles. So if the submarine is keeled over at an angle it can cope with that. </p> <p>\"But I think most importantly it is not reliant on a surface ship. A diving bell will actually move up and down with the surface ship it is attached to in a high swell. </p> <p>\"It [the mini-submarine] can position itself dynamically, so it can hold itself against the submarine even though there are currents sweeping over the top of the submarine.\" </p> <p>Efforts were under way to establish whether the Kursk's escape hatches could be opened from the outside, or whether they could only be operated by the trapped crew. </p> <p>\"Our technical people are in discussion with Russian technical experts on the design of the escape hatches and so on, and it could be that the hatches can be opened from outside,\" said Cdr Finney. </p> <p>The LR5 arrived in Trondheim yesterday, as the Russian government finally asked for international assistance. It was flown to Norway from Prestwick airport in Ayrshire, along with pilots and support staff. </p> <p>The submersible was loaded on to the Normand Pioneer, a chartered ship equipped with an A-frame from which the craft is lowered into the sea. </p> <p>The Russian navy continued its own rescue efforts overnight, using three of its escapes capsules diving in turn to the crippled submarine. But the efforts were frustrated by strong currents and muddy waters which reduced visibility to mere inches. </p> <p>The rescue of all 118 men on board the Kursk could take up to 24 hours, and naval experts said weather conditions would be crucial.</p> <p>Lieutenant Commander Jerry Bernau, who is on the operations staff responsible for submarine rescues at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde, said: \"The Russians will have their own systems in place and their personnel will be trained similarly to ours, but the weather will affect everyone.\" </p> <p>The rescue team on the Normand Pioneer is made up of 27 Royal Navy and civilian personnel - two pilots and a rescue chamber operator for the LR5, 12 support personnel and crew, two naval co-ordinators, four divers, two doctors and four medics. </p> <p>Defence minister John Spellar said: \"We are delighted to be able to assist in trying to save sailors from an awful fate and one that is of concern to all right-thinking people all around the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>At midnight last Friday, a curious email arrived at Consumer. \"We are pleased to announce that from Monday August 13 Safeway will be increasing prices on all our goods by 25%,\" it read. \"If this doesn't sound good to you then you can piss off to another supermarket chain such as Tesco or Sainsbury's.\" Safeway says that the message, which was sent to hundreds of customers who had logged on to the store's website, is being investigated. A spokeswoman assures: \"It was not issued by the company and the information it contained is entirely false.\" As if anyone could have doubted it. </p> <p>A disgruntled insider is the likeliest culprit, but it would come as no surprise to the industry if it was found to be the work of a rival store. </p> <p>Supermarket customers are used to having their favours fought over in increasingly bloody price wars, but the battle is starting to get dirty. The provocation is the US group Wal-mart, which last year took over the Asda chain and announced that it would reduce 10,000 lines by up to 10%. Its rivals, with brave dignity, professed to welcome the challenge and set about shearing the pennies off prices. Then, as the cost began to tell, the facade slipped and the squabbling started. Tesco declared it could match any ropey old deal offered by Safeway; Asda, not to be outdone, said the same. Then Tesco blew raspberries at Iceland who responded with rude stickers in Tesco stores. </p> <p>Safeway, meanwhile, was plotting revenge. \"We've got a new chief executive and his strategy is based on stealing other people's customers,\" its spokeswoman, Emma Mason told Consumer in May. An internal memo, leaked last week to a tabloid newspaper, revealed that the management was instructing its staff to wreak havoc in rival stores in the hope that, if customers don't defect to Safeway, at least they'll emerge with less than pleasant memories of their usual port of call. \"Be one jump ahead,\" operations director John Douglas urges his staff in the document. \"Make sure you know what they're up to and cause as much confusion as you possibly can.\" </p> <p>By way of inspiration, Douglas cites a recent triumph at Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands when a Safeway store manager sent 10 staff undercover to Asda. They all arrived at the check-outs simultaneously and demanded that the store match Safeway prices. \"The queues on the other tills were about 45ft long and people were dumping their baskets and leaving,\" boasted Safeway's Castle Bromwich manager. \"One customer was given his frozen food all for nothing because he waited so long.\" </p> <p>Safeway admits that it has set its sights on its rival - \"Ooh, it's exciting stuff!\" breathes communications director Kevin Hawkins - but claims Asda was horrid first. \"Some weeks ago they targeted our stores and said they would match our special offers if customers produced one of our advertisements,\" says Hawkins. \"We knew this was implausible becase it's impossible for them to predict which items we'll discount each week and so they can't make sure they've got enough stock to meet demand.\" </p> <p>To help dry up the supplies, Safeway staff are dropping thousands of leaflets a week in Asda car parks, inviting customers to take advantage of the offer. \"We've caught them out many a time this way,\" says Hawkins. \"We've told our managers that if they want to send staff round to challenge Asda in person, they can.\" </p> <p>At Asda, spokesman Nick Agarwal can barely suppress his mirth. \"We're bemused and amused,\" he chortles. \"Our customers would be the first to say that Safeway's tactics are a tad childish.\" </p> <p>Gaggles of self-conscious Safeway infiltrators are apparently such a familiar sight at Asda stores that managers have started welcoming them over the public address system and offering them their own designated check-out. \"They're not very good at undercover operations and often forget to change out of their uniforms,\" says Agarwal. </p> <p>\"At Rawtenstall in Lancashire they could only muster four staff who were still in uniform. Our manager saw them huddled in the carpark in the rain and took pity on them and gave them an Asda umbrella under which to shelter. He has now set up a hotline to Safeway in his store so that customers can call up and tell them what they think of them.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Safeway's hit squads have been goading Tesco after the latter promised to match Safeway's special offers in its Wells and Walsall stores. Customers will have found leaflets promoting the Tesco deal under their windscreens, put there by Safeway staff who hoped a run on the discounted goods would empty Tesco's shelves. \"We're delighted that they are going to all that trouble to do our marketing for us,\" says Karen Marshall of Tesco. It's intensely competitive out there, but we would never resort to such tactics.\" </p> <p>Oh no? In May Iceland went weeping to the Office of Fair Trading after Tesco launched a \u00a320m poster campaign claiming that its prices were cheaper. \"Clearly they feel threatened by us to target us in such an underhand manner,\" says Iceland's managing director, Russell Ford. \"They recently experienced their first year-on-year fall in sales for three years and are clearly feeling the pressure.\" Iceland retaliated by pasting stickers on Tesco's frozen food counters, which read: \"Pssst, it's cheaper at Iceland.\" </p> <p>Sainsbury's says it prefers the grown-up approach and leaves such juvenile cavortings to its rivals. \"We fight with competitive prices and good quality,\" says a spokesman. This did not prevent the group from trying to pull a fast one on Safeway. When the latter announced that it was scrapping its ABC loyalty card in May, Sainsbury's promised 500 free points to customers who traded in their card for its equivalent. </p> <p>Each supermarket group claims that the others are motivated by jealousy. \"We've acquired a million new customers in a year and are obviously hurting Asda,\" crows Hawkins. And according to Asda: \"Safeway's tactics are a compliment. They obviously see us as a threat.\" </p> <p>Tesco says its rivals are intimidated by its \u00a3380m investment in price cuts last year, while little Iceland believes its 16% share of the frozen food market has discomfited Tesco. However, beneath the bravado the supermarkets are running scared. \"We are a 300lb gorilla,\" warned Wal-Mart when it arrived in Britain last June, and the predictions are that it will consume whatever chains it can lay its hands on. At present, three quarters of the population buys its groceries from the Big Four - Safeway, Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury; the fear is that Wal-Mart, with its global purchasing power and sheer magnitude, will swallow their profits. </p> <p>For as long as the battle wages, it can only be good news for consumers. Prices will continue to drop as stores bribe shoppers for their custom. Now the gloves are off, the inter-store warfare is likely to become ever more diverting. </p> <p>\"Asda says our tactics don't hurt them, but they would, wouldn't they,\" says Hawkins. \"We will continue to target them for as long as it takes. It's tit for tat.\"</p>",
  "Joe Lieberman of Connecticut could be the key that unlocks the 2000 US presidential election for the Democrats. <p>If that turns out to be true, then it will be one of the more improbable transformations in modern American politics. Less than two weeks ago, Mr Lieberman was a relatively obscure, generally conservative Democrat senator, known to the public mainly because if his prominent criticism of president Bill Clinton during the impeachment crisis, and known to the Washington press corps mainly as an honest and interesting, but marginal, figure within his own party. </p> <p> Last night, though, thousands of delegates in the Staples Centre greeted the little man from Connecticut as a conquering hero when he delivered a smart, upbeat and generally well-judged acceptance speech to the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. </p> <p>It must have been by far the largest audience that Mr Lieberman has ever addressed, and although he still seems stunned by the transformation of the past fortnight, it was an obvious success. He entered to the music from Chariots of Fire, greeted the audience with an improbable clenched fist salute and started his speech with a Jewish mother-in-law joke. </p> <p>But in contrast to his campaign appearances last week, this time Mr Lieberman dwelled only lightly on religious themes or the significance of his selection to American Jews and immigrants. It was a speech which set out to do four things. First, it had to introduce the still largely unknown Mr Lieberman to the wider national audience in a rare prime-time television opportunity. Second, it had to help promote Al Gore's generally lack-lustre public image - a major theme of this third day of the Democratic convention. </p> <p>Beyond these core tasks, the speech had to fulfil two potentially contradictory aims. It had to win the support of the black American electorate, a crucial Democratic base, but one which cannot be counted on to support a Jewish candidate. Simultaneously, the speech had to reach out beyond the party, to independent and undecided voters who needed to be given some reasons for preferring Gore-Lieberman to the Republicans' Bush-Cheney ticket. </p> <p>The first two objectives were easily fulfilled, Americans have no excuse for not knowing the key elements in the Lieberman narrative these days - the modest background in Connecticut, the days in the civil rights movement campaigning to register black voters, the abiding importance of his mother Marcia, the marriage to Hadassah Freilich, a daughter of Holocaust survivors, the assaults on Hollywood's debauched standards, then the attack on Mr Clinton over the Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>Last night the television audience heard nice stories from and about Joe Lieberman. And no one tuning in to the Democratic convention could doubt that he supports and promotes Mr Gore. After meeting the vice-president on one occasion, Mr Lieberman's young daughter said \"He must be a daddy\". </p> <p>Al Gore's virtues as a father were a constant theme of yesterday's sessions. Politically, though, there were other jobs to do. \"Let me just speak to those of you at home who haven't made up your mind if you want to build on our prosperity,\" Mr Lieberman said, before highlighting bi-partisanship and political reform as two key areas tailored to appeal to independents. </p> <p>\"I respectfully say to you that Al Gore and I are the guys who are ready to do the job,\" he said, At various points in his speech, Mr Lieberman praised Republican leaders like Ronald Reagan. He stressed his senate reputation as an \"across the aisle\" legislator, who had worked with Republicans in the past and who was happy to do so again. </p> <p>\"Our opponents are decent and likeable men,\" he said. \"I am pleased to call many in their party my friends.\" He praised \"my dear friend John McCain\" - the Arizona senator was diagnosed with skin cancer yesterday - and labelled him a great man. </p> <p>In the coming election, this appeal to the centre and to independents will surely be one of Mr Lieberman's responsibilities. The senator's quirky and unconventional voting record has raised some questions - especially among black leaders - about whether he will win over their support. </p> <p>In two warm-up speeches congressmen Robert Menendez, a Latino from New Jersey, and the formidable John Lewis of Georgia, who is black, fought to promote Mr Lieberman's anti-racist record. Meanwhile the man himself went out of his way to restate his support for affirmative action, as he had also done earlier at a meeting with the congressional black caucus. </p> <p>At the end, the Liebermans were bustled off the stage to prepare the way for Karenna Gore and Tommy Lee Jones to nominate Mr Gore for the election, and later for Mr Gore to make a surprise appearance himself, prior to being formally adopted. </p> <p>But the impact that the senator has made on the polls in just a few days has been good for the Democrats, and yesterday's speech is surely destined to push the party forward still further, as Mr Lieberman road tests his own considerable assets under campaign conditions.</p>",
  "Chopper, a gruesomely funny entrant for the Edinburgh film festival, was last night condemned for glamorising a self-confessed \"murdering bastard\" who claims to have \"wiped out\" 19 other criminals \"for the good of society\". <p>The low-budget black comedy, based on the nine books the hitman Mark Brandon \"the Chopper\" Read wrote while in prison in Australia, has taken the film world by surprise, knocking the Mel Gibson blockbuster The Patriot off the top of the box office down under this week despite being dropped by its distributors at the last minute. It is the first adults-only film to have performed so well there. </p> <p>Chopper Read earned his grisly nickname through the \"free pedicures\" he administered as a gangland enforcer, slicing off his rivals' toes with a bolt cutter. His notoriety grew while he was in Pentridge prison near Melbourne for attempting to kidnap a judge, where he cut off both his ears with a razor blade as a fashion statement, a trend copied by other hardcore convicts. </p> <p>But it was his infamous drunken appearance on the McFeast Live TV show when he groped host Lisbeth Gorr and joked about stuffing a victim in a cement mixer (\"It took us hours to get him into it, the bastard. He kept climbing out\"), that caused widespread revulsion. The series was later pulled and ABC had to issue a public apology. </p> <p>The film, which Rupert Murdoch's Fox corporation dropped last week, has caused most anger in Tasmania where Read, 45, served his last sentence for shooting a friend, and to where he has now \"retired\". </p> <p>The state's cabinet secretary and minister for women, Fran Bladel, yesterday repeated her claim that there was no value in making a film to further glorify a \"very sad and dysfunctional person\", who had profited from gross violent acts and achieved celebrity by joking about victims on TV. \"This film will certainly convey the message that to be cruel and vindictive and to beat women pushes you to hero status with a certain class of people,\" she said. </p> <p>Read himself, though happy with his portrayal by stand-up comedian Eric Bana, said he was angry that \"while every other bastard is making money out of me I've got nothing\". He insists he will donate the \u00a39,000 he got for the film rights to a police benevolent fund. </p> <p>The film has been a big hit with critics both in Australia and at Edinburgh, where it had a sneak preview yesterday. </p> <p>Chopper Read comes over in the film as a deluded but personable psychopath who thinks of himself as \"a normal bloke who likes a bit of torture,\" another Australian convict anti-hero in the Ned Kelly mode. But what makes the film both frightening and funny, and which had the audience in Edinburgh yesterday shouting its praises, was how it inhabits the mind of a clearly psychotic criminal like no other movie made before. </p> <p>The festival's director, Lizzie Francke, said she had no compunction about showing it and said getting its European premiere had been a coup. \"We had long and complicated negotiations to get it.\" </p> <p>Critic Dougal MacDonald, of the Canberra Times, praised the writer/director Andrew Dominik, who he said had walked a thin line making it clear that Read was \"a man devoid of moral worth\". </p> <p>Its British distributors, Metrodome, make no bones about selling it on its mixture of violence and black comedy, a kind of real life antipodean Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.</p>",

  "<p>While working during those long holidays has always been a part of student life, increasing numbers find they are forced into employment during term by the rising costs of studying. Forty-two per cent of those in higher education work while resident at university, and for many it is not solely to fund an over-active social life. Indeed, 36% report that they are forced to find work in order to meet their basic living costs.</p> <p>With tuition fees rising to \u00a31,050 from the start of the academic year, and Barclays Bank reporting that the average student graduates \u00a34,497 in debt, the financial pressures on students have never been greater.</p> <p>But students seeking work shouldn't expect a bulging wage packet. Research by the National Union of Students and the TUC shows that the average student earns \u00a34.37 an hour, but 3% of students earn less than the national minimum wage - just \u00a33.20 an hour for those aged between 18 and 21. This compares unfavourably with the average adult hourly pay of \u00a310.03.</p> <p>Kath Rothman, vice-president for welfare at Bristol University Students' Union, says that most students work part-time in pubs or clubs, either during the evening or at weekends. \"The majority probably work for two or three evenings a week, or all day Saturday or Sunday. But there are a small minority who are really working full-time, for 30 hours or so a week, in offices or shops.</p> <p>\"There is a worrying trend for students to work for longer hours, and some struggle with their academic work. Students are now forced to manage their time and priorities, because of new financial pressures, in a way that was never the case in the past,\" she comments. She hears of medical and dentistry students who work night shifts as ancillary nurses and do their academic work during the day. </p> <p>Bristol, like many other universities, has a job centre for students. Rothman suggests there is sometimes a conflict between helping students to find work and advising them on the sensible number of hours to work. </p> <p>Angela Phillips, a tutor in media and communications at Goldsmith's College in London, says that students working during term are a growing problem. \"We find that if we alter the time of a lecture, students may miss them for a whole term because they clash with their shift. Particularly at the end of term, students are under immense financial pressure and the problem is at its worst in the third year, when students find that they have missed a lot of work, especially with practical courses.</p> <p>\"In the past there was the assumption that students were on a full-time course, and you didn't go out and work at the same time. The changes in student finance happened so fast, the university system has not caught up,\" she says. Phillips says that tutors have always tried to give flexibility to students who have children, but has difficulty seeing how tutors can fit in with the working times of all their students. \"In America there has always been work available on campus for students, but we have the problem that this sort of work [in the UK] is done by staff who would obviously resent their jobs being taken away,\" she comments.</p> <p>According to the NUS, the average student works for just over 13 hours and puts in six and a half hours overtime. Yet 59% of students claim that their job has slightly affected their studies and 15% claim it has either badly or very badly influenced the quality of their work. Indeed just under half go so far as to say that they would have got higher grades had they not been employed.</p> <p>But what is the maximum number of hours a student should work, before it starts to impinge on their studies? </p> <p>John Sander, student employment officer at Sussex University and vice-chair of the National Association of Student Employment Staff, advises students not to work for more than 15 hours a week. Research from the United States suggests that working between 10 and 20 hours has an almost insignificant effect on student's academic progress. Working more that 20 has a negative impact, but interestingly students who do not work at all get worse grades.</p> <p>Sander explains this by the fact that \"a job forces time management and so can improve grades\". He highlights studies by Dr Phillip Gardner at the University of Michigan which show that those students who didn't get a job spent more time socialising rather than studying. Sander advises new students at university who want to earn money to do so in their first two years when their academic load is lighter.</p> <p>He also suggests that they don't limit themselves to what they might perceive as traditional student jobs, such as serving in a bar or working in an office. \"Try and develop skills, such as word processing or using the internet, which will help you to increase employment opportunities, and will be of use after you graduate as well,\" he says. At Sussex, most students work in part-time clerical jobs, but those who have skills valuable to employers have a serious advantage. Sander explains that students who have computer skills and can design web pages can earn \u00a3200-300 a week without working many hours, and having a second language allows you to earn good money translating. Students should head straight to their university employment office for advice. \"Student employment services are there to provide enough opportunities for students to work reasonable hours at decent pay, although people who really want to work 20 or 30 hours a week can always find work elsewhere,\" he says.</p> <p>The NUS study finds that a considerable number of students don't manage to find jobs with responsible employers. One-third report health and safety problems in the work place, and 27% claim work has affected their health. They also don't always get a fair deal when it comes down to their pay. Two-thirds do the same job as permanently paid staff, but of these 29% are paid less than full-time employees.</p> <p>\"Check out the pay of other employees. If students are part-time workers then they should not receive less pay than full-time members of staff,\" says Bharti Patel, director of the Low Pay Unit. If a job lasts for more than 13 weeks then the employee is entitled to holidays, and after four weeks they can demand a written contract. </p> <p>Students can get advice on their rights at work from their student union welfare advisers, their university employment office or the TUC's advice line on 0870 600 4882 or its website, www.tuc.org.uk/rights/know_ your_rights</p>",
  "<p>Chris Woodhead's pronouncement that too many university courses are \"vacuous\" and fail to prepare students for work may be a new step in the quarrel between the Chief Inspector of Schools and the universities, but for many teenagers up and down the country it is nothing new. The argument now raging between Woodhead and the universities echoes an all-too-familiar quarrel between anxious parents and their headstrong children. </p> <p>\"We need to be certain,\" Woodhead wrote in the Sunday Times this week, \"that undergraduate study is in the interests of the individuals applying to universities\". Like Woodhead, many parents believe they are arguing on behalf of a child's best interest when they insist that a good course is one which leads to a good job. At home and outside, there is a clash of ideas as to why higher education is valuable: is it because of what young people gain after they've graduated, or because of what they experience while they're studying? </p> <p>A-level students who discover this week that they have not done well enough to gain a place on their preferred course will again confront this question. Many will have to re-think their university and their course. Some will find that the more traditional courses are, this year, closed to them. They will have to decide whether to opt for a less mainstream course, or postpone education for a year. While at least one of the degree courses now available is likely to be of some intrinsic interest, they will also be asked whether such a course is \"worthwhile\". </p> <p>Feeling vulnerable, disappointed and uncertain of their future, they may seek a parent's help. All too often, a parent may cling to the mindset that education is only useful in so far as it produces specific, employable skills (and now they have the Chief Inspector to back them up). The young person balks at such intellectual prudery, and before you know it parent and child are locked in a frustrating, debilitating argument. The terms of the argument seem clear: employment prospects versus educational excitement; sense versus sensibility; substance versus vacuousness. </p> <p>But the apparent clarity is deceptive, and clouds our ability to make (or to guide) decisions, whether the debate is conducted on a personal level, or on the more public one which challenges the purpose of wide-ranging university courses. The confusions in the debate confound young people's confidence in making decisions, and the conflict with a parent deprives them of much-needed support. </p> <p>One problem is that parents and even teachers often look to young people's future with an outmoded model of education leading to a career. Now a degree is just one of many qualifications an employer will consider. Even graduates from the best universities, taking the most traditional courses, have to stand up to stiff competition and adapt their plans to what's available. Instead of complaining that some courses do not prepare young people for specific careers, we should be demanding that no course be too rigidly linked to any single career. </p> <p>In all probability, today's teenagers will, at 30, be in a very different career from the one they start in their early twenties. They may be in jobs we cannot yet name. We do know, however, that tomorrow's adults will need to be flexible. Even if we insist on debating the value of education in terms of employment prospects, we still need a broad scope. Employers value people who are imaginative and creative and who are undaunted by problems. They are after a lively mind, rather than a body of knowledge. If a young person is considering one of those derided courses - in golf course management, knitwear, beauty therapy or media studies - we cannot predict where it will or won't lead. A BSc in Business Perfumery may get a laugh, but several professors at Stanford University in California are now in the business of identifying and modifying smells for commercial use. </p> <p>The relevant question is not what specialist skills a course provides, but what understanding it fosters. A course is \"vacuous\" not if it does not lead to a job in a particular field, but if it does not provide intellectual stimulation. </p> <p>Encouraging young people to study courses that are intrinsically interesting to them will not make the task of choosing intrinsically easy, but it will help. Young people should ask themselves what they like and dislike about what they are studying now. They could consider what they admire about the lives of people they know and visualise their futures. These reflections will highlight interests and preferences that can then be linked to present choices and subsequent possibilities. Envisaging a variety of outcomes will ease the anxiety many young people experience when making what seems like a momentous and final choice. </p> <p>Parents, meanwhile, should also ask themselves how genuinely open they are to what a daughter or son wants to do. A familiar gripe from young people is that what their parent calls a \"discussion\" feels like a \"lecture\". </p> <p>Young people can be encouraged to identify what they can't control (disappointing exam results, for example), and what they can (the immediate next step). They can remind themselves that they have the power to change some things in their lives, and that they will keep this power even after they have made important choices. One of Woodhead's imperatives for developing the higher education system we need is to engage different generations in a conversation in which young people learn to find meaning in the things that have greatly moved humankind. I would agree with this if the term \"conversation\" held onto its meaning as a two-way exchange, whereby each generation had a voice. In that case, courses would continue to proliferate in response to a new generation's experiences and interests. The workforce Britain needs would be recognised as having a human dimension, which education would serve by fostering the curiosity and quirkiness that intellectually healthy people have. As young people make dizzying decisions about courses and careers, they, too, have to be certain that their study is in the interests of the individual. </p> <p>Terri Apter is a senior tutor at Clare Hall, Cambridge.</p>",
  "<p>College beckons. As the reality of university life draws nearer, the practicalities come into focus. What will it be like? Will I make any friends? Will I cope with the work? Where will I live?</p> <p>For first-year students the last question shouldn't arise. Most universities have dedicated accommodation reserved for their first-year intake - either in halls of residence or university-owned housing. But some students could find themselves looking for rented accommodation in their first year, and most will spend at least one year in a bedsit or flat. Amy Blackmore studied politics and international studies at Birmingham University.</p> <p>\"In my first year I was in Chamberlain Tower, a 17-storey tower block on the university campus. The food was diabolical and the room was very basic.\" But Amy found the social advantages outweighed the limitations of the accommodation. \"It's very hectic in hall, a 24-hour party, it's a great way to settle into university life.\" </p> <p>The big advantage of campus accommodation is that it places the student at the centre of things. There's a ready-made social life just across the quad and bookshops, cafeterias, bars and clubs all geared to the peculiar needs of the student. For some that's the problem. They want to get away from what they see as the claustrophobic atmosphere of the campus. And some students, particularly in the bigger cities, don't get the choice. There isn't enough university-owned accommodation for everybody and the search for a flat begins.</p> <p>In terms of desirable tenants, students rate above cockroaches but below most paying customers. The reasons are obvious. It's a short-term let, students are young, noisy and usually untidy. There's little sense of ownership about the property, which can lead to damage and mess. And students are broke, which can lead to problems collecting the rent. Add to this the fact that the average 18-year-old has a knowledge of housing law that could be written on the head of a pin, and there is the potential for trouble. </p> <p>Student's union officers know only too well the problems that can arise with landlords, from substandard accommodation through to harassment and intimidation. \"It's an area where even the limited current legislation is unenforced,\" says Ben Wilson, SU vice-president at Bristol University. \"Students are desperate for accommodation within easy reach of the university, but it can be a struggle for them to find somewhere decent.\" </p> <p>Ben encounters problems with tenancy agreements, with landlords who withhold deposits unreasonably, and with substandard or even dangerous premises. \"I found these funny wires in the shower,\" one student told him. Another casually mentioned that she was sharing a bathroom where a hole in the wall allowed a Big Brother-style viewing of one of the bedrooms.</p> <p>Students may move out of a property after a bad experience, but they rarely complain to the authorities and they will sometimes put up with appalling conditions because it is so difficult to find anywhere else to live. Environmental health officers in local councils have the legal responsibility to supervise rented housing. \"Students are in a particularly vulnerable position,\" one told the Guardian. Dangers include faulty or poorly serviced gas appliances, which release toxic fumes and have been responsible for the deaths of at least 10 students since 1990. In one case, London landlord Terrence Connally was fined \u00a360,000 after gas appliances in almost every one of his 70 properties in Ealing and Brent were found to be in \"extremely poor condition\".</p> <p>Other problems include:<br> \u0095 inadequate fire escapes</p> <p>\u0095 inflammable furnishings</p> <p>\u0095 dangerous electrical fixtures and fittings</p> <p>\u0095 dampness</p> <p>\u0095 poor insulation </p> <p>\u0095 poor security.</p> <p> In most cases, shared accommodation has to meet strict safety standards as a \"house in multiple occupation\". This would involve fire safety measures and regular inspection. But, in 1995, a legal judgment in Sheffield argued that student lets could be classed as a \"household\" because flatmates shared meals and facilities. The ruling left much student housing unregulated.</p> <p>Universities are well aware of the dangers and nearly all have accommodation offices to help students find reasonable housing. One of the biggest is in London, where Bob Miller's team at the Senate house deal with thousands of inquiries every year. \"There are just over 22,000 places in university accommodation for upwards of 90,000 students,\" he says. \"About 20% live at home or have their own property - which leaves more than half looking for a place to rent.\"</p> <p>Five years ago the bureau launched a landlord registration scheme. \"We lost a few landlords initially, cavalier ones mainly,\" recalled Miller. \"But landlords who are registered are offered free training on legal and safety issues, making it a good deal for them.\" Landlords on the scheme offer students a minimum standard of accommodation. \"There's a code of practice,\" says Miller. \"The law doesn't require a written tenancy agreement - we do. It doesn't require an inventory - we do.\" </p> <p>The accommodation office also runs a summer information service for students looking for work in London and a contact listing for people looking for a flatmate. Bob Miller is aware of the difficulties that students renting accommodation can run into: \"But only a very small percentage of students get into serious problems,\" he says. The government promised to reform housing law in its manifesto, with changes that would regulate the kind of shared housing most students rely on. With only one full session remaining, housing organisations are looking to this autumn's Queen's Speech for some action on the issue.</p> <p>\"Students in Bristol alone spend \u00a322m on accommodation each year,\" says Ben Wilson. \"It's time we got our money's worth.\"</p> <p> What should be provided:</p> <p>\u0095 A written tenancy agreement, which covers: when the tenancy actually starts and finishes, the level of rent and when it is due, deposit arrangements, rights and times of landlord access and contact details.</p> <p>\u0095 Evidence of safety checks to gas and electrical appliances; ask for a copy of the inspection certificate.</p> <p>\u0095 Smoke detectors should be fitted - check whether they actually contain batteries. </p> <p>\u0095 All rooms should have adequate means of escape. This is particularly relevant in three-storey Victorian housing.</p> <p>\u0095 Furniture should be made from fire-retardant materials. </p> <p>\u0095 Any damage seen on inspection should be logged and the landlord should provide a date for completion of repairs.</p> <p>\u0095 Rooms should have multiple electrical sockets. A single 13-amp socket is inadequate when faced with a hi-fi, clock-radio, computer, lamp, hairdryer and TV.</p> <p>\u0095 The landlord should supply cleaning equipment; students should not have to buy a vacuum cleaner.</p> <p>Problems with central heating systems and dampness are unlikely to be evident in summer. That's why it is important to seek advice about properties from university accommodation officers or student union welfare staff.</p>",
  "<p>The digital age has arrived. Almost every university now has its own website with an admissions' application only a click away, and the government's higher education online dream is well on the way to fruition. It should be the cause for loud celebrations, and yet the applause so far has been distinctly muted. </p> <p>To find out why, you need look no further than Digital Decisions, a new report from Dr Anthony Hesketh of Lancaster University Management School into the role of the internet in shaping the higher-education choices of applicants. The research was commissioned by Teletext, which was investigating an idea for its own student dot.com, and its findings make sober reading for both policy makers and the universities.</p> <p>Stephen Byers, the secretary of state for trade and industry, said recently that familiarity with the new digital world is a \"key enabler of a modern, knowledge-driven economy\", and the government has pledged itself to widening participation for disadvantaged communities through greater access to modern information and communication technologies. To help achieve this, it has established the National Grid for Learning, which aims to get all schools and colleges online by 2002, and Tony Blair has said everyone should have their own email address by 2005. </p> <p>It all sounds great. But some things are easier said than done. There was anecdotal evidence last year that some better-off students were able to secure a significant advantage for themselves by emailing in their clearing applications, while the rest of the student population was left to struggle with constantly engaged telephones, and Hesketh's research suggests that this socio-economic digital divide is very much a reality when it comes to students' higher- education choices.</p> <p>Ninety-five per cent of the research sample of 1,300 sixth-form students and 200 mature entrants from FE colleges said they had access to the internet, but the quality of the connectivity varied greatly, and Hesketh divided the group into those with real access, quasi access and the disconnected.</p> <p>Real access meant that students either had their own PC at home or access to their parents' PC, while quasi-access implied that students could get online through schools, cyber-cafes or libraries with all the attendant restrictions of time, travel and queueing. </p> <p>Predictably, those from the high socio-economic groups were more than twice as likely to be found in the real-access group, while the converse was true for quasi-access. Professor Paul Foley of De Montfort University has conducted research that paints a bleaker picture still. His finding that \"the relative wealth of internet users has been decreasing in recent years\" initially suggests a widening participation in IT, but his observations on the different ways the internet is used are cause for deep concern. </p> <p>Although relatively less wealthy households have an increasing presence on the net, the same households are also more likely to disconnect from it. Moreover, the lower the relative wealth of a household, the less time it spends connected to the internet. Foley concludes that households that have been connected to the net for over two years are, on average, households with twice the wealth of those who disconnect from the net within 10 days.</p> <p>\"It suggests that lower- income households are attracted to the idea of the internet and get connected,\" says Hesketh, \"but feel that the hype does not live up to their expectations. So they switch off.\" The effects are likely to be catastrophic. Hard as it may be to get someone to try out the internet for the first time, it is nothing in comparison to the difficulty of persuading them to reconnect to something they have already experienced and rejected.</p> <p>A large part of the problem, though, is the quality of the information that is accessible online; and it is here that higher-education institutions must shoulder their share of responsibility. \"Many universities think that all they have to do to create a website is to upload their prospectus,\" says Hesketh. \"That is just not good enough.\"</p> <p>The information students want from universities is not some polished sales pitch sandwiched between a couple of bland photos, but a warts-and-all picture of university life - from the academic to the social. The comments Hesketh collected from his focus groups about university websites were almost unanimously condemnatory. \"They are all very boring. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all\" was a typical example, and suggested improvements varying from a webcam in a lecture to show what actually goes on, to emailing students already at the university to get the inside information.</p> <p>One student reckoned that it was \"almost as if universities don't want to let the cat out of the bag in the fear that we won't turn up and pay their extortionate tuition fees\". This last point gets to the heart of the matter. Not so long ago students received higher-education grants that covered tuition and sometimes went a long way to covering their living expenses; moreover the hierarchical divisions between institutions were made more explicit through the university and polytechnic sectors. So students not only had a fair idea of what they were getting by way of an education, they also had no - or little - personal financial investment in their decision.</p> <p>How things change. Most university students now finish their education with a debt of roughly \u00a31,000, and with the former polys rebranded as universities there has been a deliberate blurring of the distinctions between higher-education institutions. \"The universities probably divide into four distinct divisions,\" says Hesketh, \"and each university will have a fairly good idea of where it stands in the pecking order. However, everyone will try to make out to prospective students that they are either as good as or better than the others.\"</p> <p>This may not be such a problem for those from higher socio-economic groups whose parents might have been to university and can point them in the right direction of, say, a university league table. But widening participation also means people from families with no experience of higher education are now going to university and the same informal channels of information are not open to them.</p> <p>As well as all the usual stuff of \"what's the campus like?\", \"How much work will I have to do?\" and \"How much does accommodation cost?\" students are increasingly also asking what their job prospects are likely to be. \"Employers will say that they treat all applications equally,\" says Hesketh, \"but this is often just to cover themselves for equal-opportunities legislation. Many employers are highly sensitive to where they recruit from.\" In short, a first-class degree from a Russell group university carries much more clout than the same degree from one of the newer universities.</p> <p>What prospective students want is to have these employability differentials spelled out and quantified, but most universities are notoriously reluctant to do so for fear of appearing to run themselves down.</p> <p>So for the time being, as Digital Decisions makes clear, there is an unhealthy stand-off: universities continue to market themselves in glossy PR speak and the wealthier students get the best out of the internet. How long it can stay that way is another matter. One new website and the information floodgates could open. All that then remains is the small problem of persuading people to log on to it.</p>",
  "<p>Today's the day thousands of young people, and their friends and families, have been dreading for some time - it's A-level results day. </p> <p>The trip to your school or college to collect the slips of paper with the good news, the bad news or the somewhere-in-between news is likely to be a tense one, and the wait once you get there is almost unbearable. But what do you do when the grades are staring you in the face? How best to react? First, the lucky ones - you've got the results you need, so it's time to celebrate. No need to do anything immediately - your chosen university will soon be in touch to add to your feeling of personal wellbeing.</p> <p>What happens if your results are not exactly as desired? Even if you have not scored the points or got the grades your university wanted, they may well still accept you - telephone to find out. Universities would often rather accept those whose applications they received and considered in the first round of application than those applying at the last minute in clearing. </p> <p>Pupils in Scotland who have not yet received their Highers results would not be disadvantaged in the clearing scramble, ministers have assured the public, while universities are telling people not to panic. Results are promised by tomorrow, but in the meantime try to speak to directly to the admissions tutor on your course to clarify the situation. </p> <p>But if you are at all doubtful about your results there is no harm in ringing other universities about potential alternatives - students in England and Wales will be hitting the phones today - always bearing in mind that if you do get the grades you will have to stick to your existing offer. </p> <p>This year applicants who have access to the internet can register with Ucas, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, this morning to see online whether or not their first-choice institution has confirmed their place. </p> <p>If your results are not what you'd hoped for, this is where clearing comes into play. It is worth getting to grips with how it works and how you can get the best from it. Put simply, clearing involves all those universities who still have places on some of their courses and all those students who are without places and who are still searching for one. </p> <p>You are eligible for clearing if you did not receive offers when you first applied through the Ucas system or if you did not get the grades for the two offers you were holding over the summer. Any last-minute applicant will also be trying for a place through the clearing process, which starts now and continues until late September. Not all universities and colleges, and not all courses, will be in clearing; so some research is necessary. These pages include details, including information on teletext and the internet. However, information is often nothing without advice, so talk to your teacher or adviser on your best line of attack before committing yourself.</p> <p>The best piece of advice at this stage is to act swiftly but not in haste; and don't panic. Much of the action in clearing does take place in the first few days, so be prepared to move. There are likely to be plenty of good opportunities for you as long as you passed at least one A-level or successfully completed your GNVQ, so: </p> <p>\u0095 act quickly</p> <p>\u0095 get information about what's on offer</p> <p>\u0095 phone to check that places are still available and what grades are required</p> <p>\u0095 if offered a place, express positive interest </p> <p>\u0095 do not commit yourself if you need to take stock - ask for some time </p> <p>\u0095 even if you are thinking of resits, do look at vacancies in clearing </p> <p>\u0095 don't give up if nothing comes up at first - keep trying</p> <p>Everyone in clearing is issued a clearing form and number by Ucas. It is only when you have given the number and your form to a university that your place is guaranteed. You cannot negotiate with other institutions after this point, so arrive at your decision carefully and take expert advice if in any doubt. Visit the university if you can - check out the course, accommodation and general feel of the location: after all, you'll be spending the next three or four years of your life there.</p> <p>It is a good idea to try to think imaginatively during clearing. It can be up to 11 months since you first applied, and ideas understandably change in that time - you can look at subject areas that are different from your original choice, or consider joint or modular degrees where you will be studying two or more subjects. Whatever you consider, always research these new options fully, so you know what's involved. Beware universities who offer you something completely different from your chosen course. Town planning is a far cry from English, for example.</p> <p>If you didn't plan to go to university before, but are suddenly getting interested, now is the time to take action. There is no reason why you should not enter the fray along with everyone else, so start phoning! You will need to contact Ucas to get a form and a clearing number.</p> <p>Last year more than 60,000 people found places through clearing, so get active, be flexible, be persistent and take advice whenever in doubt. In less than two months you could be happily embarking on a higher education course.</p> <p>John Beckett is a higher education adviser. </p> <p>Ucas: www.ucas.ac.uk </p> <p>Telephone: 01242 227788.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Back up </strong><br> What is the cheapest backup medium - Zip drives, rewriteable CD's, tape streamers? - and from whom?  <strong>Nigel Bruce</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:nigel@grove22.freeserve.co.uk\">nigel@grove22.freeserve.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield:</strong> Ask me next year, because I'm optimistic about the progress of rewriteable DVD, or DVD-ram drives like the Panasonic LF-D103. </p> <p>Today, tape streamers are great for professionals, and I like the look of the Tecmar Travan NS20, but tapes don't appeal to home users. One possibility is a \"superdisk\" such as the Iomega Jaz drive or the similar Orb system. </p> <p>These can store 2GB per disk, but the disks are expensive. (Iomega's popular Zip disks, which hold 100MB or 250MB, are now too small for back-ups, and the disks are also too expensive.) CD writers are more attractive because they double up as CD players and let you create your own audio CDs. </p> <p>They are cheap to run: blank CD-R discs cost less than \u00a31, and rewriteable CDRW discs cost less than \u00a32 each. The problem is that one disc does not hold enough: typically 74 minutes of audio or 650MB of data. You would need 16 discs, and a lot of spare time, to back up a 10GB hard drive. </p> <p>DVD-ram drives can store 2.6GB on a single-sided disc costing about \u00a315. When the cost of drives comes down to \u00a3200 or less, and blank disc prices are also halved, they could be almost irresistible. </p> <p><strong> Why not MD? </strong><br> Is there any reason why it shouldn't be possible to back up PC files onto a recordable MiniDisc player and, if not, why doesn't this facility seem to be available?  <strong>John Arran</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:john.arran@eds.com\">john.arran@eds.com</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> MiniDiscs were designed to store audio data using a \"lossy\" compression system that Sony calls ATRAC (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding). </p> <p>Unfortunately, \"lossy\" compression systems, which throw away data they think you can't see or hear, are no use for computer data where every bit counts. </p> <p>In 1993, however, Sony announced a suitable format called MD Data, and Sony and Sharp said they would have 650MB drives ready by 1997. This is only 4.6 times the capacity of a standard MiniDisc, so I expect Sony could have done it. </p> <p>But presumably they could not do it at a price competitive with CD-based systems. </p> <p><strong> Why not CD? </strong><br> I back up data files to floppy disk. I understand I can use a CD-R or CD-RW (rewriteable) drive, but CD files are \"Read-only\", and when copied back to the hard drive cannot be edited.

However, if you copy a file from a CD to a hard drive, you can easily change the \"Read-only\" setting in Windows. </p> <p>Right-click on the file and select Properties.

The solution is a commercial program called Partition Magic 5.0 ( See <a href=\"http://www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/\">www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/</a>). I bought a copy and it is brilliant. There are also some free programs that do the same thing, such as <a href=\"http://www.users.intercom.com/~ranish/part/\">Mikhail Ranish's Partition Manager</a>. This is a very powerful program, but too hard for most of us to use. </p> <p><strong> Fixing flickers </strong><br> I want to change the display refresh rate on my PC (jitter on the new monitor), but in true Windows form, nowhere does it tell you how to do this.  <strong> K. Lillington</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:karlin@indigo.ie\">karlin@indigo.ie</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Windows may be cagey because setting too high a refresh rate can damage the monitor. It will therefore set a conservative (too low) refresh rate if it does not know what the monitor is, and will not let you increase it. </p> <p>To check, right-click on the desktop and select Properties, then go to the Settings tab and click the Advanced button in the lower right hand corner. Look at the Monitor sheet and see if Windows recognises your monitor. If not, try to find the appropriate .inf (information) file, which may be on a floppy disk supplied with your system, or may be downloaded from the supplier's website. </p> <p>Now go to the Adapter sheet and see if Windows knows which graphics card you have. If everything is OK, you should see a drop-down list of available refresh rates including \"Adapter default\" and \"Optimal\". </p> <p>Bear in mind that every graphics card has a finite amount of power and memory. You can only get the highest refresh rates by compromising on the screen resolution and the number of colours. So go back to the Settings page and either reduce the colour depth or screen area or both. Changing from, say, 32-bit True Colour at 1280 by 1024 pixels to 16-bit High Colour at 1024 by 768 pixels should automatically produce a higher refresh rate. </p> <p><strong> France calling </strong><br> I have two ageing PCs, one in the UK and one in France.

  "Aviation experts were last night writing Concorde's obituary as safety officials warned that modifications to the supersonic jet could take \"months not weeks\" to implement. <p>Airline industry observers said the extensive costs of ensuring that the ageing model could fly once more might render it commercially unviable. </p> <p>The civil aviation authority confirmed that it was withdrawing the plane's certificate of airworthiness because of a \"freak\" tyre burst that caused last month's crash of an Air France Concorde in Paris, which cost 113 lives. </p> <p>British Airways responded by insisting that it would resume operations as soon as possible, had only cancelled services until early September, and could restart them with just 24 hours' notice. </p> <p>But such optimism was dampened by analysts who said it would rapidly become cheaper to allow the 30-year-old plane, which brings in just \u00a320m profit a year for BA but costs \u00a350m to maintain, to die. And even if Concorde does fly again, there is no guarantee that it would be supersonic. </p> <p>The sombre prediction of the end of Concorde's commercial flying history came as questions were asked as to why the CAA and BA had taken almost three weeks to ground the seven British planes after the Paris crash, despite knowing almost from the start that a tyre burst had occurred. Air France indefinitely grounded its five-strong fleet on July 25, the day of the disaster. </p> <p>Yesterday, both BA and the CAA said they had stuck by the letter of the law, with the regulatory body emphasising that it could not suspend certificates of airworthiness with no firm information. \"We have acted in a responsible, prudent way,\" the CAA chairman, Sir Malcolm Field, said. </p> <p>But the authority admitted that 70 tyre bursts had taken place since Concorde started flying in 1976, with seven causing fuel tanks to rupture. </p> <p>This awareness of the problem, but failure to act on it, was criticised by experts. \"The vulnerability has been known since 1979,\" said Frank Taylor, director of the aviation safety centre at Cranfield University. </p> <p>The CAA has only banned an aircraft from flying once before, in 1979, when public confidence in the DC-10 plunged after two serious accidents.</p>",
  "<p>Government experts yesterday made the historic decision to allow cells to be taken from human embryos less than 14 days old; this could have \"enormous potential\" to create new kinds of treatment for now incurable diseases. </p> <p>The announcement was greeted with delight by biomedical scientists, who see stem cells as a new weapon against cancer, spinal injury, diabetes and Parkinson's Disease, and biotechnology companies who are anxious to begin the long process of turning theoretical possibilities into practical treatments. </p> <p>But that was countered by horror from religious and ethical groups who see the possibilities of human embryos being turned into tools to keep alive people who have already enjoyed a lifespan. </p> <p>A Catholic archbishop called it \"the production line approach to human lives\". Liam Fox, the Conservative shadow health secretary, said there was \"a genuine deep-rooted political unease about the medical techniques we can now employ\". Others raised fears that the decision could open the door to reproductive cloning. </p> <p>Embryo stem cell research is a new field: it is only two years since these unusual cells were first isolated in the US. Their discovery offers a future in which failed organs could be made to rebuild themselves and fractured spinal cords persuaded to grow again. But the research also raises huge ethical questions. </p> <p>Embryos are already used - under strictly controlled conditions - for fertility research. After more than a year of deliberation, a committee led by Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, yesterday recommended that surplus embryos could also be used for research into new medical treatments. </p> <p>The committee also gave the all-clear for limited experiments in so-called \"therapeutic cloning\". This would make possible the transfer of genes from one person into the nucleus of a cell taken from another. </p> <p>Humans start life as one fertilised egg and end it as a collection of trillions of specialised cells of more than 200 kinds. Embryos which are a few days old, are a collection of 100 or 200 cells, any one of which could turn into any part of a human. These are embryo stem cells. </p> <p>Researchers have already used adult stem cells to renew bone marrow tissue . But, the Donaldson report says, embryo stem cells could be used to repair nerve damage in stroke victims, make insulin for diabetics or treat inherited disorders. </p> <p>Ideally, scientists want to learn how to \"reprogramme\" adult cells and use them to make new organ tissues. But research on embryo stem cells could be the only way to learn how to do this. </p> <p>Dr Donaldson's expert panel of scientists, lawyers, surgeons and ethicists recommended that research on embryos either created by cell nuclear replacement - the technique that made Dolly the cloned sheep - or by in vitro fertilisation, should be permitted. But this research would be subject to control by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Before the HFEA licensed the use of any cloned embryos, it would have to be satisfied there was no other way to proceed. </p> <p>Between 1991 and 1998, fertility researchers handled more than 48,000 embryos not needed for in vitro fertilisation, all of them less than 14 days old. </p> <p>The committee said that the individuals whose eggs or sperm were used to create the embryos should give specific consent. The mixing of animal eggs and human cells would be forbidden and it would remain a criminal offence to implant an embryo created by cell nuclear replacement into the uterus of a woman. </p> <p>The committee also recommended possible legislation to govern the use of embryo cells in any future treatments for disease - and suggested creating a \"library\" of stem cells for researchers to use. </p> <p>But the committee said that any real healthcare benefits were years away. The embryo research might only be a stage on the way to a medical \"holy grail\" - in which scientists learned to switch on early stem cells from patients, grow them in the laboratory, and then implant them. </p> <p>\"It would also result in tissue that was genetically compatible. You wouldn't have the problems of rejection,\" Prof Donaldson said. \"The technique isn't currently feasible, it is a theoretical idea that scientists believe one day may be possible. They believe that the phase of a better understanding of research into embryonic stem cells is vital to getting the breakthrough.\" </p> <p>The report conceded that some people would argue that the research was unethical, others that the embryo required no moral attention whatsoever, and a third group that there was an ethical issue which had to be weighed against the benefits of any such research. </p> <p>The decision drew fire yesterday. A spokesman for the anti-abortion group Life said: \"Therapeutic cloning _ is a further trivialisation of human life. It exploits human beings at the most vulnerable stage of their lives - it is neo-cannibalism.\" </p> <p><strong> Destruction</strong><br> </p> <p> Cardinal Winning, the Catholic archbishop of Glasgow, said \"Obtaining stem cells from a human embryo is morally wrong, because it involves the destruction of a human life. Human life is inviolably sacred, both before and after any arbitrary 14-day deadline.\" </p> <p>The Campaign Against Human Genetic Engineering called for the government to lobby for an enforceable international treaty against reproductive cloning. \"The government must not allow us to be railroaded into crossing fundamental ethical barriers by over-enthusiastic scientists and companies,\" said David King, the group's co-ordinator. </p> <p>But the Genetics Interest Group - an alliance of 100 groups of families affected by inherited disorders - said the research offered new hope. \"The possibility of undertaking research in this area and choosing not to do it, is not ethically neutral,\" said Alastair Kent, the groups' director. </p> <p>\"Such a decision would leave families to be affected by disease or disability that might otherwise have been treated.\"</p> <p><strong>The case against: 'Cherish life, don't consume it'</strong></p> <p>\"Spare part\" cloning creates human embryos so as to harvest their cells. As the cells are extracted, the clone is killed, having served the purpose for which it was made. A human life has been created for destruction. This is morally unconscionable. </p> <p>Everyone wants to see treatments developed for Parkinson's disease, and similar distressing conditions. Stem cell therapy may prove useful, although it is too early to say. </p> <p>The point is that stem cell therapy need not involve cells from embryos. Using adult stem cells would not pose any ethical problem in principle, for the simple reason that the adult would survive the extraction. </p> <p>There is, of course, nothing new in using embryos as laboratory material. IVF embryos are used in this way by the thousand. Clones, however, have no genetic parents in the normal sense of the term. The person providing the cell from which the nucleus is taken is neither the mother nor the father, but a twin sibling. The woman providing the ovum is the \"mother\" only in a very partial sense, since the ovum has been gutted of most of her genes. Parental feelings towards clone embryos do not seem to be envisaged. </p> <p>There is of course a problem in getting eggs: women are understandably reluctant to donate their ova. The Donaldson report discreetly raised the possibility of using ova from female aborted foetuses. This would be a lavish source of ova from females who will not be disputing their use. </p> <p>But we should not use an embryo as a mere source of cells. An embryo is an individual at the start of its life. It has interests in its welfare and survival: in the marvellous unfolding of its human powers. Human offspring are something to be cherished and protected. They are not to be consumed in research.</p> <p>\u0095 Helen Watt, research fellow at the Catholic-funded Linacre Centre for Healthcare Ethics</p> <p><strong>The case for: 'This could stop Parkinson's in its tracks'</strong></p> <p>Therapeutic cloning could provide the biggest breakthrough in Parkinson's disease research for 30 years. The Parkinson's Disease Society wholly supports Liam Donaldson's finding that cloning research should go ahead, with safeguards. </p> <p>If stem cell research is allowed, in 10 to15 years we may be able to provide effective treatment which could lead to a cure for Parkinson's. </p> <p>There are 120,000 people with Parkinson's in the UK, and 1m are affected by the disease as carers or partners. The three key symptoms of the progressive neurological disorder are debilitating tremors in the hands, arms and legs, rigidity, and slowness of movement. These are caused by the loss of brain cells that produce the chemical dopamine. </p> <p>If cloned stem cell research is allowed, scientists may be able to find a way to reprogramme stem cells to become dopamine-producing cells. These could be implanted into the brains of people with Parkinson's and halt the progress of the condition. Scientists do not understand how this process works, which is why cloned embryo research is so crucial. </p> <p>Therapeutic cloning clearly raises ethical, moral and religious concerns, and we welcome a full debate before parliament determines the issue. But its potential to improve the lives of people with Parkinson's justifies embryo research, within Prof Donaldson's guidelines. At the moment 40,000 embryos are being stored for IVF treatment. Rather than throw them away, we hope that embryos up to 14 days old can be used for research. </p> <p>The argument that adult stem cells can now be used fails to recognise that they offer limited potential. Work with embryonic stem cells can be seen as the first step to understanding how we reprogramme cells which, in time, may lead us to work with adult stem cells.</p> <p>\u0095 Robert Meadowcroft, director of policy and research, the Parkinson's Disease Society</p>",
  "Israel's new foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, held his first talks with Palestinian officials yesterday amid signals that both sides are reaching towards a peace deal. <p>The talks were at the highest level held since the Camp David summit broke down without an agreement three weeks ago, and will intensify speculation that a second encounter could be held next month to clinch a final settlement. </p> <p>Despite the summit's failure, Israel and the Palestinians insist that progress was made at Camp David. </p> <p>In the weeks since then, Yasser Arafat and Israeli envoys have circumnavigated the globe, seeking international support for their respective positions, but they have also telegraphed to say that they are ready for a resumption of talks. </p> <p>The US envoy, Dennis Ross, arrives in the region today to ensure both sides agree on where progress at Camp David was made - none of the offers were put in writing - and to coax Israel and the Palestinians on. </p> <p>But convening a second summit would first require reconciliation over Haram al-Sharif - or as the Israelis call it, Temple Mount - which both sides are resolved to control.

  "Three suspected further outbreaks of swine fever have raised the possibility of a devastating spread of the disease outside East Anglia. <p>Three farmers, in Cheshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, two of whom had taken piglets from British Quality Pigs, the Norfolk farm that was the source of the swine fever outbreak, contacted the Ministry of Agriculture after animals on their farms became ill. </p> <p>Tests were ordered immediately but last night there were still no results. </p> <p>Both the United States and Canada yesterday banned the import of pigs and meat yesterday in response to the confirmed outbreak on five farms, though the trade across the Atlantic is small compared with Europe. Exports of pigs and products total \u00a3126m, of which \u00a322m comes from outside the European Union. </p> <p>Officials of the ministry and the Department of Trade and Industry were in Brussels yesterday, meeting representatives of the European commission and agriculturalists from Germany and the Netherlands who have recent experience of tackling classic swine fever. </p> <p>In 1997, an outbreak hit the relatively large Dutch pig population. More than 400 farms were affected and millions of pigs slaughtered in an epidemic that took more than a year to bring under control. </p> <p>Germany suffered several cases in 1997 and 1998. Hundreds of thousands of pigs were slaughtered and export restrictions were applied to some lande (states). The virus in East Anglia looks likely to be the same as that which devastated the German industry. The source was never established but was believed to be a wild boar or an import from eastern Europe. </p> <p>Commission sources indicated yesterday that it had been likely that the Europe-wide ban on English pig exports would be reduced to only East Anglia next week, provided no new cases had been confirmed. But one source said: \"If it is confirmed that swine fever has spread to other parts of the country, they will probably vote to prolong the ban beyond August 31 or extend it to the rest of the UK.\" </p> <p>An EC spokeswoman admitted that there was a chance that the herd of pigs where the disease was first discovered might have passed swine fever on to some 48 herds all over England owned by the same company. </p> <p>Blood tests on the 48 herds are expected to resolve the matter within a few days. \"Tests are still going on and so far we stay with five confirmed cases,\" said spokeswoman Andrea Dahman. </p> <p>Andrew Garvey, of the meat and livestock commission, said that the US export ban would be a further blow to pig farmers. \"We can well understand why the Americans have taken this decision. We also fully understand why our colleagues in the EU have put up the ban on live exports. </p> <p>\"But we are very concerned to resolve this issue quickly. The pig industry has been in crisis for the last two years and it is now in recovery. Exports are a very important part of our industry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Peter Duffett-Smith, Cambridge academic turned hi-tech entrepreneur, has a vision. \"One day soon your mobile phone, laptop and palm-held computer will all merge into a single personal communicator. It'll tell you everything, from how to get a map to the closest restaurant to finding where your friends are; it could even track your kids and your car,\" he says. \"The key to information when you're mobile is knowing your location - and we know how to find it.\" </p> <p>It might sound like an outtake from Star Trek, but Duffett-Smith is staking his future on it. The 50-year-old husband and father of two has abandoned a lectureship at Downing College, and more than 20 years of research in radio astronomy, to pursue the vision of making every mobile phone locatable. </p> <p>This is no flight of fancy; he's convinced some of the biggest players in the mobile communications business to join him for the ride. Cambridge Positioning Systems has struck deals with both Ericsson and Siemens (which holds a 3% stake in the company) to incorporate its positioning software in future handsets. Deals with Nortel and Lucent are also under negotiation. </p> <p>The concrete offices of CPS are a stone's throw from the ivory towers of Downing College. In one room a map of the town centre is projected on a wall to demonstrate the CPS positioning technology, called Cursor. </p> <p><strong> Rogue dot</strong><br> A yellow dot flashes where CPS HQ should be. Inches away another dot is flashing. The flappable Duffett-Smith points at it and cries: \"What's this?\" </p> <p>The rogue dot - supposedly showing the position of the phone I'm holding - indicates we are across the road in a residential building, a hundred metres away. </p> <p>\"Impossible. That shouldn't happen,\" he says. An aide looks worried and rushes to explain the anomaly. \"The Cursor System is accurate to within 50m 67% of the time,\" she says, \"and within 100m the remaining 33%.\" </p> <p>Embarrassing, you might think, but the glitch is a mark of a company that is stretched to the limit to keep up with its meteoric growth over the past 20 months. </p> <p>At the end of 1998 CPS had eight employees. Less than two years, \u00a39m in venture capital invested by 3i and Prelude, and scores of field tests later, the staff has grown to nearly 60. If the chief executive officer, Chris Wade, has his way that number will almost double to 100 employees by the end of the year and is forecast to reach 200 by the end of 2001. </p> <p>\"If the market conditions are right, we'll go for an initial public offering this time next year,\" he says. </p> <p>A Washington-based telecoms analysts, Strategis, estimates $81bn in revenues will be generated by location services in Europe by 2005. </p> <p>CPS wants a chunk of the p-commerce (position-based commerce) action and is fast developing WAP-based services. </p> <p>\"In September we will formally launch the services division of our company,\" says Wade. \"It will be responsible for developing applications and providing infra structure for location-dependent content.\" </p> <p>CPS has entered partnerships with online map providers Webraska and directory service Scoot. Soon you'll be able to find your nearest hotel or restaurant, and then get a map showing you how to get there; send out your location in case of a breakdown or emergency; manage your employees remotely; or give your children wrist-watch style transmitters so that they too can be tracked. </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest market, according to Duffett-Smith, will be the teenage affection for \"the trivial and frivolous\". </p> <p>\"The 15-to-25-year-old lifestyle market will be huge,\" he predicts. </p> <p>\"I believe a major market will be these buddy-buddy systems where friends choose to let each other know where they are. Imagine a system where you could let a select group of friends find out where you are at any time, it'd be an instant hit.\" </p> <p>As if to back up this prediction, his 17-year-old daughter calls him twice within 30 minutes while we talk. \"You have to have teenagers to understand this,\" he says. </p> <p>Stretch the idea further and one day we might use our mobiles to find a date. Imagine, you could store a profile of yourself and your heart's desire, and then should that special someone walk by you'd be alerted with a ring. </p> <p>In the US, CPS is already angling for market domination. Wade and Duffett-Smith have just returned from Houston, Texas, where they demonstrated Cursor to a panel of American mobile phone companies desperate to buy positioning technology. </p> <p><strong> Scribbled idea</strong><br> The E911 rules (E stands for Enhanced), adopted by the federal communications commission in 1996, require by 2002 that all US mobile phone operators make their handsets capable of automatically supplying location information accurate to 125m with every emergency call. In October operators must declare which technology they will use. </p> <p>\"VoiceStream, America's biggest mobile phone operator, has unofficially declared it will use Enhanced Observed Time Difference technology to comply with the rules,\" says Duffett-Smith. \"Cursor is the only commercial system in existence based on EOTD.\" </p> <p>CPS has no competitors in EOTD because for a time it was thought that the technique didn't work. \"We proved them all wrong,\" says Duffet-Smith. </p> <p>He has more than a mere clutch of mobile phone experiments to prove Cursor's worth, he stands on 50 years of scientific research. </p> <p>Cursor began in 1987, inspired by an episode of BBC TV's Tomorrow's World. Duffett-Smith scribbled down an idea and showed it to the university technology transfer office. They were impressed and agreed to pay the \u00a3500 fee to register a patent. </p> <p>In his spare time he began experimenting, first in the lab, where he managed to track a student walking in the garden with an accuracy of 10cm, then using signals from local radio transmitters - accurate to 5m. The latter he affectionately calls \"navigation by pop music\". </p> <p>Cursor is based on the same principles Duffett-Smith used to locate radio signals from outer space in his days as a radio astronomer. </p> <p>\"The important difference between our system and other systems is that the mobile phone is in control of sending the location information, so you can't be tracked unawares. There's no Big Brother. If you don't agree to be tracked you won't be.\" </p> <p>Cutting-edge technology is crucial to the company. So much so that when Duffett-Smith decided to buy a patent from the Sydney University of Technology spin-off, Insearch, he grabbed two of the patent's inventors into the bargain and added them to his research team. </p> <p>It's still early days for CPS. When 3G phones begin to appear on the market then the fun really begins. </p> <p>\"With 3G technology Cursor's accuracy will improve ten-fold to a resolution of 5m,\" says Duffett-Smith. Then the glitch that's blinking behind him on the map might just be a fond memory of his pioneering, start-up days.</p>",
  "Everyone on earth should be allowed to vote in American elections. All the major decisions about the future of world are now brokered by the United States. Only the US has the power to provoke a world war. Only the US can re-engineer the global economy. <p>As the Transatlantic Economic Partnership - which is quietly \"harmonising\" our laws with those of North America - demonstrates, Washington now exercises more control over the lives of British people than Westminster. </p> <p>We will never, of course, be allowed to influence the world's most important political decisions. But this autumn we can do the next best thing, which is to plead with our friends and colleagues in the United States to cast their votes against Al Gore. The only hope for both America and us is that George Bush wins. </p> <p>A Bush presidency would, of course, be an unmitigated disaster. This poisonous political pygmy owes everything to the dollar and nothing to democracy. Under his governorship Texas has killed more convicts, left more children without health provision and poisoned more of its own air and water than any other state. Its spending on education, public hospitals and social services has all but collapsed. </p> <p>As president, Bush would cut the scant taxes rich Americans pay, disabling America's residual public provision. He would dump the minimum wage, abandon affirmative action, sell off national parks and destroy trades unions. </p> <p>He has suggested that he would like to see more adventures of the kind the US pursued in Nicaragua and Grenada, and fewer humanitarian missions. His incomprehension of world affairs will reinforce American isolationism, while his plans for a national missile defence system will launch a new nuclear arms race. </p> <p>Anyone with a grain of political sense, in other words, would be mad to support George Bush. But the biggest threat to Al Gore is a defection of Democratic voters not to the Republicans, but to the Greens, and their presidential candidate, Ralph Nader. Nader will capture, depending on which opinion poll you believe, anywhere between 3 and 10% of the vote. </p> <p>Crucially, his prospects are best in some of the states Gore must win to secure the presidency: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Oregon and California. There is, in other words, a seductive if superficial truth in the assertion, aired repeatedly by Democratic party hustlers, that \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\". </p> <p>But Ralph Nader's campaign is about far more than the coming election. He has launched what amounts to nothing less than a rescue plan for American democracy, and with it, a rescue plan for the rest of the world. Nader, alone among the remaining candidates, has promised to tackle the world's principal problem, namely the corporate stranglehold on American politics. </p> <p>When George Bush raises $100m for his campaign, Al Gore has to do the same. In his eight years in office, Bill Clinton has distinguished himself by amassing some one billion political dollars, almost all of them, directly or indirectly, from corporations. </p> <p>This money is merely a measure of the politicians' indebtedness to special interests. The result is that the priority of both presidential candidates is to deliver not what the people want but what the corporations want. For the past 50 years, the world has been held to ransom by America's corporate oligarchs. </p> <p>Ralph Nader would kick corporate money out of politics, ensuring that public campaigns are publicly funded. He is, of course, no more likely to become American president in November than you are. </p> <p>The best he is likely to achieve is to hand victory to Bush, plunging the world into four terrifying years of government by morons. But the alternative is far worse. If Gore wins, backed by one hundred million corporate dollars, then the last faint hopes that a mainstream political party might fight for a change in the way American campaigns are financed will evaporate. </p> <p>His victory would hasten the arrival of a new and potentially endless dark age, in which only the demands of the mighty are acknowledged. </p> <p>If, by contrast, Gore loses because Nader steals his key votes, then this will force the Democratic party into the most profound self-examination in its recent history. As the Democrats come to see that they cannot recapture public trust until they have done something to earn it, they will ensure that campaign finance reform becomes the key issue in the 2004 presidential elections. </p> <p>If you don't stand up for what you believe to be right, regardless of the consequences, you will quickly discover that there is nothing left to believe in. The Americans, like all of us, should vote not in fear, but in hope. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "A coroner ruled yesterday that a widow who \"went out like a light\" while being treated by the serial murderer Harold Shipman had been unlawfully killed. <p>Sarah Ashworth, 74, died at home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in April 1993 and her body was exhumed five years later during police inquiries into the deaths of Shipman's patients. </p> <p>Shipman was jailed for life in January after being convicted of killing 15 mainly elderly women but was not charged with murdering Mrs Ashworth. </p> <p>The verdict by the south Manchester coroner, John Pollard, cannot by law distinguish between murder and manslaughter nor name a killer. But it will encourage the families of other patients who died while in Shipman's care to hope for similar verdicts. Inquests on another 25 patients are to be held this year and next. </p> <p>Jane Ashton-Hibbert, leader of the families' support group and granddaughter of Hilda Hibbert, one of Shipman's patients, said: \"I'm glad that it has gone on record that this was an unlawful killing, which is quite an unusual verdict.\" </p> <p>Mr Pollard announced his verdict after saying he would set aside the death certificate issued by Shipman and recording that Mrs Ashworth died of heart failure. He listed nine similarities between Mrs Ashworth's death and those of Shipman's 15 known victims. </p> <p>\"I find it impossible that it is more likely than not that Sarah Ashworth died of natural causes,\" he told the inquest at Tameside magistrates court. \"The only plausible explanation for her death is that she was unlawfully killed and that is the verdict I shall record.\" </p> <p>In a statement, a spokesman for the family said: \"The search for the truth about their mother's death has been a painful experience and they would like to thank everyone concerned and especially the families of other victims for the support they have received. </p> <p>\"No verdict will bring Mrs Ashworth back but the family are now pleased that the record has been set straight.\" </p> <p>In his summary, Mr Pollard asked why, on the day Mrs Ashworth died, Shipman had collected from a pharmacy a prescription for 30mg of morphine. Mr Pollard described it as a lethal dose for someone apparently dying of heart failure. </p> <p>He said Shipman told relatives that Mrs Ashworth had fallen back on her bed and gone out like a light. But expert witnesses said people with heart failure did not die so suddenly. </p> <p>Earlier, Julie Evans, a forensic scientist, said that tests had shown that \"on the balance of probabilities\" there was morphine in Mrs Ashworth's body. </p> <p>A Home Office pathologist, John Rutherford, who carried out the postmortem examination, said giving morphine to someone with a respiratory condition was a \"contentious\" treatment because the drug depressed respiration. </p> <p>\"I would perhaps describe it as going against conventional recommended medical practice,\" he said. He agreed later that it was dangerous. </p> <p>Because of the risks, opiates would usually be given in hospital where life saving equipment was available. Given Shipman's account of Mrs Ashworth's symptoms, he could see no reason for taking the drug to her home. </p> <p>Shipman's account of her dying was at odds with his diagnosis of heart failure. \"I find it very surprising,\" said Dr Rutherford. </p> <p>Shipman chose to make no use of the video link which had been established to allow him to watch the inquest and cross-examine witnesses from Frankland prison in Co Durham during the two-day hearing.</p>",
  "<p>Japanese investment bank Nomura yesterday refused to concede defeat in its four-month battle for control of Hyder, the Welsh utility group, despite a takeover panel ruling in favour of rival bidders Western Power Distribution. </p> <p>The panel yesterday rejected Nomura's appeal against the panel executive's decision to allow a 365p a share offer made by WPD in a sealed bid last Friday. The WPD offer topped Nomura's existing offer by 5p a share. </p> <p>A Nomura spokesman said the bank was still considering its options. Executives from its London-based principal finance group, which has led its bid for Hyder, spent the day closeted with their financial and legal advisers. </p> <p>The panel, which held a day-long meeting at its office in the London stock exchange building on Wednesday, said it would publish the reasons for its decision tomorrow. </p> <p>Hyder, which has been the subject of competing bids from Nomura and US-owned WPD, said it would respond to the panel's announcement \"in due course\". A spokesman said it was waiting for clarification from the panel. </p> <p>WPD said it was not prepared to comment, while Nomura's future intentions were still unclear. </p> <p>City sources said Nomura's first option would be to seek leave to appeal to the takeover panel's appeals committee, which is chaired by Sir Michael Kerr, a former lord justice of appeal. </p> <p>The committee is usually made up of its chairman or deputy chairman, and two other members of the panel who have not been previously involved in the issue at stake. </p> <p>Nomura is thought unlikely to consider seeking a judicial review of the panel's handling of the Hyder bids until it has explored all the panel's appeal procedures. </p> <p>There is an outside possibility that Nomura could still put its lower 360p offer to shareholders in the hope that it can persuade sufficient local shareholders that its plans will best solve Hyder's problems. Nomura already owns 16.2% of the group. Nomura has said it intends to retain Hyder's water and electricity operations and bring in new top management to run them. </p> <p>WPD abandoned an earlier plan to sell the assets of Hyder's regulated water business to a non-profit making trust after opposition from the water industry regulator. </p> <p>But it still intends to contract out the running of the business to United Utilities, the multi-utility group based in the north west of England. </p> <p>Both bidders have said that they do not intend to implement job cuts beyond the 1,000 already announced by Hyder's existing management. </p> <p>Hyder is heavily indebted and faces the loss of up to \u00a370m in profits this year as a result of regulatory price cuts. </p> <p>City bankers and investment managers, concerned about the takeover panel's handling of the Hyder bid, want to see the detailed reasoning behind yesterday's decision. </p> <p>The main points at issue will be the justification of the panel executive's decision to impose a sealed bid procedure in the first place and the reasons why it felt it could allow WPD's sealed bid, even though it was not announced by the executive's deadline of 4.30pm on Friday. </p> <p>WPD's delay in announcing its winning bid by Friday's deadline has been put down to a technicality which required its bid to be resubmitted. None of those involved has revealed what the technicality was. </p> <p>Welsh Assembly environment secretary Sue Essex said: \"I regret that if the takeover panel's decision stands this effectively means the break-up of the Hyder group and an end to one of Wales's most prestigious and well known companies.\"</p> <p> <strong> December 9 1999</strong> Hyder cuts interim dividend and announces strategic review </p> <p><strong> March 28 2000</strong> Sharp share price rise forces Hyder to admit bid is possible </p> <p><strong> April 14</strong> Hyder says it is discussing a bid </p> <p><strong> April 18</strong> Nomura makes agreed 260p a share bid </p> <p><strong> May 2</strong> Pennsylvania Power and Light and Southern Group plan counterbid through Western Power Distribution joint venture </p> <p><strong> May 2</strong> Barclays Capital backs out of WPD plan to create non-profit vehicle for Hyder's Welsh Water business </p> <p><strong> May 18</strong> WPD revises Welsh Water sell-off plan </p> <p><strong> May 31</strong> WPD makes 300p a share bid </p> <p><strong> August 1</strong> Hyder board backs Nomura's increased bid of 320p a share.

  "<p>We have reached a new medical frontier. That is a cause not for the dismay with which some religious organisations greeted it yesterday, but for rejoicing. There is a prospect now of ancient degenerative and chronic diseases causing untold pain and misery to millions being treated and cured. Human cloning for medical research, which an expert committee headed by the government's chief medical officer said yesterday should be given the go-ahead, could turn out, one scientist suggested, to be as important as the genome project, with possibly \"even more practical benefits\". As with the genome, the research will be fundamental, going to the heart of creation. </p> <p>And there, for some religious groups, is the rub. The new research will examine how life develops from one fertilised cell to a trillion, distributed across 200 different categories in every person. A vital part of it would involve making embryo clones, using the same technique as with Dolly the sheep, but now for medical not reproductive purposes. It would mean taking the nucleus from an adult cell and placing it in an egg whose own nucleus had been removed. The egg would then subdivide and grow into an embryo. While it was still the size of a pinhead, containing 100 cells, stem cells would be extracted. </p> <p>Life, the anti-abortion group, described the proposals as \"a further trivialisation of life\". \"It exploits human beings at the most vulnerable stage of their lives - it is neo-cannibalism,\" the organisation said. Cardinal Thomas Winning, Archbishop of Glasgow and chairman of the bioethics committee of the Catholic bishops of Great Britain and Ireland, said obtaining stem cells from a human embryo was morally wrong and would \"shock and disappoint many\" because it involved the destruction of a human life. But Lord Winston, director of research at London's Hammersmith hospital, made the right response: \"Most people, when the science and possibilities are explained, will regard this as a sensible and moral decision,\" he said. </p> <p>Embryonic stem cells, unlike adult stem cells, possess the unique ability to develop into different types of tissue in the body - nerves, muscles, organs and bones - depending on the chemical cues given. Grown in a laboratory, they could be used to make replacement tissue for degenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, bone cells for osteoporosis, eye cells for macular degeneration, blood cells for cancer, insulin producing cells for diabetes, nerve cells for spinal chord injury, skin cells for burns, liver cells for hepatitis, muscle cells for congestive heart disease, or skeletal muscle cells for muscular dystrophy. The list is endless. It is not the scientists who are trivialising the debate, but Life. </p> <p>The embryo at the heart of this argument is under 14 days old, has no brain, heart or any other human feature, and is only just visible to the naked eye. A public consultation exercise by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority two years ago was unequivocal in placing the rights of patients with degenerative and chronic diseases ahead of the embryo. Ironically, research on such embryos is already permitted, so long as it is confined to fertility, contraception, or miscarriages. What is now proposed is that the law should be relaxed to allow the use of early-stage human embryos for stem cell research. It will be carefully controlled and monitored. Reproductive cloning is already effectively banned, but ministers will introduce a specific legal ban. There will be a free vote in parliament. The case for assent when that comes will be overwhelming.</p>",
  "<p>Jodrell Bank is so big, it's unnerving. You may have seen the radio observatory's telescope in books, its upturned face cranking around to eavesdrop on some intergalactic cataclysm. But chance upon it as you steer between twisting hedgerows and you'll be hard pressed to keep an eye on the road. </p> <p>What is this vast latticed bowl slung between white-capped towers, cogged and pinioned and mounted on a circle of railway track the size of a stadium? Was it some alien mother ship that placed it on the Cheshire plain 50 years ago, laying it gently like an egg while cows and sheep munched and all the people slept? What is its purpose, and how much longer before that ship returns? </p> <p>\"When it moves at night,\" says Helen Knowles, \"it makes an incredible clanking weird sort of noise.\" </p> <p>Knowles has stood beneath the telescope at night, when all the visitors have gone, and only technicians and scientists remain to steer the gigantic dish and marvel over the radio signals that it hears in the depths of space. But Knowles is not a scientist. She is the observatory's artist in residence. Employed by the visitor centre, her job is to create works near the entrance to a 35-acre arboretum that was planted on land surrounding the observatory by its first director, the visionary Sir Bernard Lovell. </p> <p>Knowles plans to make an entire floor out of leather, and is currently tanning sheep hides in pits filled with water and oak bark. But she has temporarily set this aside in favour of an even more ambitious project - an exhibition entitled Radio Halo. </p> <p>\"Radio halo\" is the term astronomers apply to a phenomenon they have observed among the far-flung galaxies. And although Knowles is less than certain what it means, she knows it's a great name for her art show. \"We are making a halo of art around the observatory,\" she says. So 11 artists have busied themselves in the woods with string and spray-paint and magnetic stars. </p> <p>Magnetic stars? \"That's right,\" says Jay Townsend. \"I cut them all out by hand, and it really did my fingers in. The things we do for art.\" </p> <p>Jay has constructed what he calls a Big Bang Simulation Unit - a sort of celestial building site in the wet grass. \"People tend to forget it's really chaotic up there,\" he says, pointing at the rain clouds but seeing far beyond them. So his installation contains a\"roadworks\" sign and an old iron roller that attracts the multi-coloured magnetic stars. </p> <p>Close by, Leo Fitzmaurice has erected another road sign. With its white lettering on a coffee-brown background, it is a perfect simulation in wood and paint of the \"heritage\" signs that urge drivers to leave the dual carriageway and sample the delights of some nearby stately home. Except that Leo's sign bears the single word \"Heaven\". </p> <p>Similar \"Heaven\" signs crop up all over the woods, but each time in a different format. Beside the pond, black and yellow warns us of danger, while a large blue and white motorway sign shows us where to turn when the path forks. But Knowles has left the path and is tramping across the grass, to where Elizabeth Stuart Smith has been working in a clearing surrounded on three sides by water. </p> <p>\"It's a very, very nice place,\" says Liz. \"Sometimes there are cows and sometimes there are ducks. And there are five of these.\" She indicates a loose cylinder of transparent acetate, staked into the soil like a flimsy wastepaper basket and filled with empty acetate parcels. May one touch it? \"But of course.\" It's very strange. \"Well yes, it is.\" </p> <p>And she describes how she sought out an astronomer one day, and asked her what she did in her laboratory beneath the great radio dish. </p> <p>\"I thought it would be very straightforward - that they would pick up a radio signal and it would mean this or it would mean that. But instead she said, 'Well, we get it, and then we sort of decode it, then we have to iron it out, then we have to colour-code the images_' And I suddenly realised that astronomy, like art, is very uncertain. A lot of it's visible, but there's so much more that is hidden.\" </p> <p>Her work is called Invisible Light, which is a reference to the radio waves that the dish can hear but that the eye cannot see. \"It's about sunshine,\" says Liz. \"But it's about shadows, too.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Gillian Nicol has been catching shadows. Down on her knees, she has clipped a patch of grass into the image cast by a young ash tree in the morning. \"And that's the shadow at 5 pm,\" she says, pointing to another unexpected shape which, edged as it is with yellow string, suggests the chalk outlines that paperback detectives trace around murder victims. \"But this one was an hour later, and you can see it's already tall and slender.\" While Nicol uses trees as sun dials, Anna Hill uses them to describe an entire galaxy. With 30 saplings grown from a 2,000-year-old yew in Wiltshire, she is mapping out a great maze in the shape of the spiral nebula - a work that will take half a century to mature. </p> <p>As Helen Knowles skips through the embryonic maze to demonstrate its cunning double spiral, Ally Wallace explains why he chose to suspend a luminous green circle in some nearby foliage. \"I like putting alien things into an environment,\" he says. Why a circle? \"Because it seems to crop up a lot in astronomy.\" Why green? \"It's a jokey science fiction colour, and it ties in with the arboretum.\" </p> <p>Everywhere, artists are dreaming up such connections, and always with a method in their seeming madness. \"Art easily communicates an idea,\" says Knowles. \"Rachel Whiteread deals with negative space and Anish Kapoor with voids. These are very difficult scientific concepts, but through art they become tangible and visible and more easily understandable than looking at algebra.\" </p> <p>She points out four human figures, which on closer inspection prove to be empty life-size cloaks cast in plaster and resin. \"They represent the four moons of Jupiter,\" says Paula Chambers, and she explains how she modelled them so that their relative sizes match those of the heavenly bodies, as do their surface appearance (cratered Callisto, smooth icy Europa and so on). Even their characters reflect those of their mythological namesakes. </p> <p>Nearby, on washing lines strung from branch to branch, Julia Ingle has hung an extraordinary collection of garments - put there, she says, by child astronauts of the future who landed a few minutes ago and just had to rinse out their clothes. </p> <p>In a timber shelter among the trees, Andy Lawrence has cut two window holes and filled them with glass photographic transparencies that glow like cinema screens, while Benji de Burca has mounted stained glass panels in brightly painted traffic cones that mimic astronomical telescopes but work like giant kaleidoscopes. </p> <p>And all the while, as if slightly aloof from the proceedings, the great steel dish creaks and groans, seeing right through the clouds that occasionally dampen the artists' spirits and scanning the heavens for some glimpse of their meaning. </p> <p>\"For 15 years I've watched it from my studio window,\" says the artist and poet Noel Connor. Noel lives on a hill overlooking the observatory, and he sometimes imagines what that great ear would hear were it one day to turn away from the sky and listen instead to his ancient village. </p> <p>Among the trees of Bernard Lovell's arboretum, on plaques that are exact copies of the information boards dotted here, Noel has placed a series of short poems. \"Tonight, while we all sleep,\" reads one of his plaques, \"the fox will investigate art and the owl will hunt above both prey and poetry.\" </p> <p>Radio Halo is at the Jodrell Bank Arboretum, Lower Withington, Macclesfield, Cheshire (01477 571339), till September 7.</p>",
  "I am surprised by the attempts by spokesmen for the Roman Catholic church to defend the church's actions against priest paedophiles (Abuse: how the churches are responding, Letters, August 14). <p>As child protection officer for the Catholic diocese of Portsmouth for five years, I met victims of abuse and their families - and my experience is different. </p> <p>Most were in shock, stunned not only by what had happened and its effect on them, but also by the silence and denial by the church. Many victims of abuse had their lives destroyed. They found relationships with their families and friends distorted, their sexuality confused and their whole being affected. They couldn't understand why it had happened to them. </p> <p>As I listened to their stories, I experienced a sense of shock and a turning upside-down of my own view of the church. Like the victims, I couldn't understand why priest paedophiles were moved around and why victims' complaints were ignored or played down. </p> <p>It is not easy for victims to speak about the abuse perpetrated on them to their families and friends, let alone to priests and bishops who sometimes find it difficult to talk about sexual matters. As a church too, we are not comfortable with complaints, and it is not easy for vulnerable people to approach figures of power and authority. </p> <p>The climate in the church is changing, even if slowly. Of course, we did not always know what we know now. But we have known for years the effect of abuse on victims. My own experience is recent - and it shows that the church, although better than in the past, still does not always act properly. </p> <p>We are told that there are good procedures in every diocese. There are, but they are not always implemented and there is no one who monitors whether they are. </p> <p>I know of one archbishop who appointed a child protection team and forbade the three priests appointed to tell anyone about their appointment. Isn't that encouraging an atmosphere of cover-up and a hope that the issue will go away if we pretend it isn't there? </p> <p>Then there was the priest headteacher of a private school who told me that the boy victims of abuse \"soon get over it\". Isn't this a culpable level of ignorance? Was in-service training about sexual abuse compulsory? If not, isn't this a denial of the significance of sexual abuse? </p> <p>In similar vein, a bishop to whom I passed on a complaint concerning a priest's fascination with boy altar servers replied: \"This priest is not like that. He is heterosexual.\" Isn't this to misunderstand the complexity of paedophilia? Is such a misunderstanding acceptable today in a church leader? </p> <p>In another case, a self-confessed paedophile was retired but with no restrictions placed on his pastoral work. Within a a few weeks he was found to be working with young people. Is the thinking here that paedophiles can be trusted? I also know of one case in which the vicar-general was sent to warn a priest about his behaviour after a complaint had been made - and the complaint was not referred to the child protection team. Yet again, a cover-up. </p> <p>More generally, the church consistently refused to accept psychiatric evidence of paedophile tendencies on the grounds that \"we know better\". There is also widespread suspicion that the amount spent on those receiving treatment for paedophilia is greater that that spent on victims. No diocese has even gone public on this. </p> <p>Why aren't the procedures always applied? Most child protection officers are priests or deacons who at their ordination have made a promise of obedience to their bishop. It is psychologically and spiritually difficult for them to argue with a bishop or to try to convince a bishop to act. In the case of a priest, the bishop decides where he lives, what work he does and therefore what salary he has. Can't the church see that it is asking too much to expect a priest to take on his bishop? I couldn't do it, which is why I resigned from child protection work. </p> <p>The climate in the church is still one of denying abuse and minimising its effect, because to accept it is to open up issues about power. Parishes and dioceses can still be run on the whim of a priest or a bishop, and there is no appeal or grievance procedure in the law of the church. </p> <p>Victims and those who work with them and on their behalf are all too often seen as troublemakers and angry people. They can easily be marginalised. </p> <p>More generally, the church's teaching on many sexual issues - birth control, homosexuality and so on - is in turmoil, and paedophilia touches on some of the most troubling aspects of sexuality. It can be scary to open this up. It is certainly easier to pretend that there is nothing wrong. </p> <p>More generally still, the priesthood in the western world is in crisis, with a dwindling number of vocations and a consequent battening down of the hatches and an unwillingness to look at the reality of priesthood. The question of compulsory celibacy is not being addressed, with all that goes with it, such as the infantilising of sexuality, emotions and needs. This is a vast area and, although some of the church's spokesmen deny it vehemently, it is linked to sexual abuse. </p> <p>I think all this helps explain why the procedures are not always implemented. The way forward is to set up an independent body of experts, not subject to the bishops' authority, which would investigate all allegations about sexual abuse in the church and would have the power to suspend and remove priests. Victims would be able to approach this body confident of its expertise, knowing there would be no denial and covering-up and that appropriate action would be taken. </p> <p>The alternative is to trust the system, and surely there are few who do that? </p> <p>\u0095 Monsignor James Joyce was child protection officer for the Catholic diocese of Portsmouth from 1994-99.

  "Resisting rape, according to an article in this month's Cosmopolitan, is worthwhile and does not lead to further injury. The article cites a US study of 1.5m rape convictions over a decade which found that women who fought back tripled their chances of escape. How on earth this was calculated is not disclosed. One wonders whether resisting also trebled the chances of being killed. An analysis of the homicide statistics might be helpful here. <p>Crime prevention is all the rage at present and Scott Lindquist, author of The Date Rape Prevention Book (Sourcebooks, \u00a310.99), prescribes the perfect no-cost strategy: women should defend themselves. He tells women to \"outsmart\" their attacker, to \"take a risk and fight him off\", to \"trust your instincts - if one tactic isn't working, try another\". </p> <p>\"Make the most of the first precious minutes,\" he advises. \"At this time the rapist isn't in total control, so your chances are highest.\" The problem is that you won't be in control, either: studies of both men and women who are attacked show they are often \"frozen\" in the first few minutes and cannot then resist. </p> <p>Other advice is equally simplistic. Call the police and a trusted friend who can be with you immediately. However distressed you are, don't have a bath. Call Rape Crisis. Such advice is all very well, but not very helpful. Calling Rape Crisis is unlikely to get a response when few services are funded sufficiently to be on call more than a few hours a day and many women do not feel up to speaking about the assault to anyone, let alone the police. </p> <p>Generalising about resistance is also dangerous and distorting. It can be successful but it can also be life-threatening. In the 100 cases I studied for my book, Carnal Knowledge, I discovered that where women failed to escape, resistance often led to an escalation of violence, so could sometimes be a risky strategy. In such circumstances, surviving is more important than avoiding rape. </p> <p>Such prescriptions also reinforce a common myth: that most rapes are by strangers. All the case studies quoted in Cosmopolitan involved such attacks - including a victim of the serial rapist Clive Barwell, who is said to have fought so hard that he ran off. Yet according to the most recent Home Office report, published last year, only 12% of reported rapes are by strangers; the other 88% are by acquaintances or partners which can make avoiding rape even more problematic. Contrary to popular belief, women attacked by partners or ex-partners suffer no less serious injuries and are more likely to be killed than women attacked by strangers. One woman I interviewed described how she had to have hospital treatment for concussion, a fractured cheekbone, black eyes and bruising. Another had passed out while being strangled by her ex-husband. </p> <p>Some men who raped acquaintances did not need to use violence because the threat was sufficient. \"He got a kettle of boiling water and threatened to throw it over me if I didn't get undressed\"; \"He threatened to wake my children and rape me in front of them.\" </p> <p>Most women, when attacked by strangers, do resist when they can. In my survey, I found women did this in all sorts of ways: by screaming, fighting and biting, running away, refusing to cooperate, pretending they were pregnant or had Aids and by attempting to reason. </p> <p>At times resisting worked, at times it didn't. Much depended on where the assault took place. Most rapes are planned and rapists are careful to isolate their victim first. Resisting may be effective where there is an escape route but in an underground car park or deserted spot, or where faced with an assailant much stronger than oneself, it may not be practicable or sensible. </p> <p>Rita described the effect her resistance had after she was dragged by a stranger from a bus stop. \"I remember thinking what people say you should do if you are attacked. 'I'd punch and kick him in the balls.' So I punched him there and he grabbed my head and slammed it into the wall and called me a fucking bitch. I started to cry ... he said if I didn't climb over the gate before he counted to 10 he would kill me, then he started counting ... He put his penis in my mouth and said that if I bit it, I was dead.\" </p> <p>Advising women to resist also implies that women need to be told what to do. It holds them responsible. Women are often blamed and blame themselves for rape. If a woman physically resists and is severely hurt, she is told she should have acted more passively. If she does not resist, she is seen as accepting the violence. It is a no-win situation. </p> <p>It is surely time men stopped writing books about how women can resist rape and concentrated on how to stop rape. With a conviction rate in England and Wales at an all-time low (a mere 6% of reported rapes now result in conviction), and with women still subjected to demeaning and humiliating cross-examination in court, a first step would be to reform the court process. </p> <p>Sue Lees is the author of Carnal Knowledge: Rape on Trial (Penguin).</p>",

  "The Democrats have been trying hard recently to represent themselves as the party of family values, so what better way to illustrate the point than to have two members of the same family issue the rallying call for action? <p>Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the daughter of the man who was nominated in the same city 40 years ago, and Ted Kennedy, the late president's brother and now the patriarch of America's best-known political family, both won standing ovations. </p> <p>Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, making a rare political appearance, used the occasion to paint some of the ways in which the Democrats can distinguish themselves from what the Republicans are offering the country, most specifically on gun control. </p> <p>\"I thank all Americans for making me and John and all of our family a part of your families, for reaching out and sustaining us through the good times and the difficult ones and for helping us to dream our father's dreams,\" she told the delegates. </p> <p>She said that, as she and her brother were growing up, hardly a day had gone by without someone telling them how their father had drawn them into public service. Among their number, she said, was Joseph Lieberman, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate. \"Now it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a place in time but a timeless call,\" she said. </p> <p>She also became one of the few main speakers to raise the delicate issue of gun control, which is seen, along with abortion and health care, as one of the key grounds of difference between the two parties. </p> <p>\"If we believe that we have seen enough gun violence in our land and in our lifetimes, that guns should no longer take the lives of those we love\" - said the woman whose father was assassinated in 1963 and whose uncle Robert was shot dead in 1968 not far from the spot where she was speaking after he had won the party's primary - \"then it is up to us. It is up to us to elect Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.\" </p> <p>Introduced by his niece with an affectionate tribute and a hug, Ted Kennedy went through his paces like someone who has been best man at enough weddings to make the necessary speech without stretching himself too far. </p> <p>The days when he dreamed that he might have been the person saying Al Gore's lines may be long gone but the old political instincts clearly remain intact. </p> <p>He chose to highlight the \"life and death issue\" of health care, promoting Mr Gore as \"the only candidate committed to moving this country forward step by step, starting with covering every child by the year 2004\". </p> <p>Earlier the Rev Jesse Jackson became one of the few platform speakers to look immediately outward when he told delegates that they should embrace the protesters who have been camped, as it were, at the gate of the citadel since the convention started. </p> <p>The enormously heavy police presence, which sometimes makes the city look as though it is experiencing a coup d'etat rather than a democratic convention, has meant that many delegates bussed in from nearby hotels are unaware of the thousands of protesters raising issues which they claim are ignored inside the Staples Centre. </p> <p>Yesterday 45 animal rights protesters were arrested after a protest outside a fur shop. </p> <p>A further 30 protesters were arrested as the American Civil Liberties Union announced that it would be suing the Los Angeles police department for its action against demonstrators at the end of a rally and concert on Monday night. </p> <p>A legal observer who was video-taping an arrest was also arrested on a conspiracy charge. </p> <p>There was another voice from the past, too, albeit the more recent past.

  "Fuad Sirageddin, who has died aged 89, epitomised the landed aristocracy of the old order of Egypt that was swept away by the young army officers revolt of July 1952. The last surviving pasha - the highest title after the monarch - he was overweight, cigar and water-pipe smoking and had little or no patience with commoners. <p>He remained in politics all his life, but his world was shattered when those officers, of poor or fellahin background, dissolved political parties, deposed the king, abolished all titles - including pasha - confiscated the land, nationalised industries and, in turning Egyptian politics and society upside down, sent reverberations throughout the region. </p> <p>When the coup took place, Sirageddin was deputy leader of the then 30-year-old Wafd party, which had so dominated the scene that in the 1950 elections it fielded 296 candidates and won 226 seats. Some of its objectives were quite progressive. It insisted on national unity between Muslims and Copts, with the slogan \"Religion is for God, the homeland is for all.\" </p> <p>It advocated equal pay for equal work for men and women, full franchise for women and independence of the judiciary. The king was \"to reign; but not rule\", while his power was to derive from parliament not religious authority. Despite confrontation and friction with Britain as the occupying colonial power and over its policies in Palestine and Sudan, the Wafd party supported the allies during the second world war. </p> <p>Sirageddin was born into a land-owning family from Kafr Aggraidah, near Cairo. He graduated in law from Fuad University in 1930. His first job was in the attorney general's office, in 1932. </p> <p>Four years later he joined the Wafd party and in 1942 was appointed minister of agriculture and minister of social affairs, initiating a landmark law for anti-illiteracy in Egypt; in 1946 he was minister of communications. By 1950 he was holder of the finance and interior portfolios: and was clearly earmarked for the leadership of the party. </p> <p>In 1952 he won national acclaim when, as minister of the interior, he supported the Egyptian position in the clash between Egyptian police and a British battalion over a dispute about British access to police premises in Ismailia, the headquarters for the British Suez Canal forces. The occasion is still commemorated as National Police Day in Egypt. </p> <p>Fuad Sirageddin opposed Nasser's policies. He was arrested on charges of opposing the policies of the revolution, tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison (but spent only three years in jail). When Nasser died in 1970 and President Anwar Sadat restored a restricted degree of democratisation in 1978, Sirageddin re-emerged and founded the New Wafd party, which quickly became the main opposition party, somewhat more rightwing than the old grouping and gaining support mainly from the middle classes. He supported Sadat's economic liberalisation policy and rapprochement with the west. </p> <p>He remained a robust leader of the party until his death - but did not stand for parliament. The new party was moderately successful, but now has only five MPs in parliament, although it would probably gain more if free and fair elections were to be held. </p> <p>Fuad Sirageddin was a very determined and resourceful leader. After the confiscation of his property he turned his aristocratic hobbies into jobs, offering his services as a consultant in jewellery, interior design and antiques to many (including the nouveau rich of the one-party order). </p> <p>He is survived by his two daughters; one grandson is already competing for the leadership of the New Wafd party.</p> <p>\u0095 Fuad Sirageddin Pasha, politician, born November 2 1910; died August 9 2000</p>",
  "There are maybe a dozen around the city, and their number is growing: unable to afford the airy 19th-century lofts and studios that have become the preferred homes of upwardly mobile 30-somethings, the impoverished artists of Paris are squatting in some of its finest buildings. <p>\"What we're doing is essential,\" insisted Francesco, 30, a particularly exuberant painter. He, along with some 30 fellow artists of 15 different nationalities, has taken over a magnificent six-storey edifice on the Rue de Rivoli close to the ultra-chic Place des Vosges. </p> <p>\"We have no place to work, and the city has thousands of empty buildings. This place had been unoccupied for 13 years. Besides which, being in a community like this is inspirational, and gives the public a chance watch us.\" </p> <p>Suspended from the facade of the building, the property of an offshoot of the debt-ridden Credit Lyonnais bank, is a colourful cloth spider's web knitted from garment swatches. Up the stairs are digitally doctored photographs and paint-daubed posters. The walls are graffiti-covered, the bare rooms draped in cloth and dripping with installations. </p> <p>\"This is an alternative artistic community,\" proclaimed Kalex, one of the squat's founders. \"We are Parisian artists, and we demand the right to be able to live and work in our city. Historically, Paris has always been a home to artists, but to work you need a workshop, to get a workshop you need a state certificate, and to get that you need to know people.\" </p> <p>As more and more of the French capital falls prey to creeping gentrification, its traditional Bohemian haunts are being lost. The damage is worst in St Germain-des-Pr\u00e8s, where Emporio Armani has taken over the old Drugstore cafe, Dior inhabits the mythical Le Divan bookshop, and Cartier rings and bracelets are on display where once there was a classical-record shop. </p> <p>Rich young professionals in search of out-of-the-ordinary accommodation have also begun infiltrating Paris' cit\u00e9s des artistes: striking council-owned complexes of low-rent studios with high windows in places such as Montmartre and Montparnasse. </p> <p>\"Even if I could afford \u00a3600 or \u00a3800 a month for an atelier, no agent would accept me because my income is so precarious,\" said an artist known as Chauchat. </p> <p>Standing in front of one of his oeuvres - a bicycle attached by a complicated system of wires and pulleys to a doll that dances when the pedals turn - he said squatters \"have to break the law so the law will evolve\". </p> <p>Fernando, 30, a trompe-l'oeil specialist and one of 400 renegade artists who launched the squatters movement by temporarily taking over 15,000 square yards of an abandoned secondary school, agreed. \"This whole thing is taking off so successfully, we've started to believe in what was only a dream,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Once you squat, it's possible to live from and for your art. In places like this, surrounded by like-minded artists, you really develop. Squatting makes art possible for artists, and for people.\" </p> <p>At Paris town hall they are not quite so sure. \"It may be art, but that's not what most people would call it,\" sniffed a buildings inspector. \"They splash so much paint on the facades you have to sand down the stone to get rid of it, and no sooner have you finished than they've moved in somewhere else. These people need to learn respect for their artistic heritage.\" </p> <p>That, says Fernando, is what they said of Monet, Lautrec and van Gogh. \"The council?\" he said, cryptically. \"I hate straight lines.

  "<p>What makes jellyfish glow or give the ocean its sometimes luminous gleam is an eerie emission of light<br> by living things. This bioluminescence is seen in many species, from fireflies to fungi and sponges to<br> squid. </p> <p><br> Special proteins create these flashlight features which have intrigued humans for centuries. Pliny the<br> Elder discovered a clam which squirted a light-emitting liquid that made the mouth glow when eaten,<br> sparking off a trend for glow-in-the-dark banquets in first century Rome.</p> <p> Today, these proteins are<br> used by researchers as a molecular lantern, illuminating intricate processes, from nervous system<br> development to monitoring the movement of tumour cells in living animals. </p> <p><br> Bioluminescence is mainly a marine phenomenon, seen in the surface layers of the ocean as a<br> bluish-green fluorescent glow. Single-celled creatures called dinoflagellates are the main source,<br> shimmering when disturbed by passing ships, fish or breaking waves. A submarine's wake can stir up<br> the sea life, creating flashes of light that could potentially betray its position to passing ships,<br> aircraft or even satellites. </p> <p><br> More than 80% of fish and other animals living in the twilight zone of the deep oceans use light to lure<br> prey, to frighten off attackers or to attract a mate. Certain species of squid use bioluminescent<br> \"searchlights\" to find their prey, but they also have small spots of lights all over their body allowing<br> them to blend into the background sparkles of the water, cunningly camouflaging themselves by<br> counter-illumination.</p> <p> Others accommodate bioluminescent bacteria in special organs which they eject<br> as a luminous cloud when under attack, blinding the predator. <br> Jellyfish strike fear into many of us, conjuring up painful childhood memories of prodding a strange<br> blob of jelly on the beach. Deep in the ocean, however, jellyfish are breathtakingly beautiful, like<br> chandeliers illuminating the ocean. They gracefully move through their watery world by jet propulsion.</p> <p><br> These fragile and gelatinous invertebrates are some of the simplest animals, along with corals and sea<br> anemones, and are 95% water, about 3%salt, and 2% protein. <br> The jellyfish Aequorea victoria has discrete glowing points around the edge of its umbrella-like<br> structure. Bundles of about 6,000 to 7,000 special photogenic cells produce its ethereal light. </p> <p>These<br> cells are packed with a light-producing protein called aequorin and a colour-shifting secondary protein<br> that accepts the blue light emitted from aequorin, re-emitting it as green light, hence the name green<br> fluorescent protein (GFP). This is an exciting era for Aequora: the genes behind the glowing have been<br> borrowed by molecular biologists and GFP is now the most popular tool used by scientists to shed light<br> on cellular events. </p> <p><br> To understand how a cell works, we need to see the individual \"moving parts\" in action. This can be<br> done by labelling cellular components or proteins with tags. GFP has revolutionised cell biology,<br> providing a method for watching events going on inside cells in real time using time lapse microscopy.<br> The beauty of GFP is that, unlike other \"reporter\" genes, it doesn't need additional substrates for it<br> to work properly. </p> <p><br> Scientists have subtly altered the structure of GFP, optimising its properties for imaging purposes.<br> X-ray crystallography showed that structurally GFP resembles a lantern: the protein folds into a<br> barrel shape and a single alpha helix runs through the centre of the structure forming the<br> light-emitting structure called the fluorophore. </p> <p>The fluorophore absorbs low wavelength light and<br> emits bright green light by a fluorescence mechanism involving changes in the chemistry of specific<br> amino acid building blocks. Mutating the fluorophore's genetic sequence produced a brighter, more<br> stable GFP. Red, cyan and yellow fluorescent versions resulted from mutations that changed the<br> characteristics of the protein's emission spectra. Multiple proteins can now be watched simultaneously<br> by tagging each with a differently coloured GFP variant: each component can be seen around the cell<br> or interacting with each other in glorious technicolour with time lapse photography. </p> <p><br> Nature has produced an enormous variety of living things of assorted shapes, sizes and life styles,<br> but similar mechanisms underlie their development. Certain proteins are known to activate genes<br> controlling the way an animal's body plan is established. Linking the GFP gene to genes that encode<br> proteins governing fruit fly development enables researchers to track the movement of these<br> proteins: when introduced back into an animal, GFP acts like a glowing tag under ultraviolet light.<br> These fusions show where the protein is located during different developmental stages and allows the<br> behaviour of cells to be observed. </p> <p><br> As a fly's nervous system develops, many thousands of neurones are born, each migrating to a specfic<br> point and adopting a specific identity. Each neurone then extends an axon, the biological circuitry for<br> the nervous system, towards other cells. This has been watched by labelling components of axon<br> outgrowth with GFP. </p> <p>Specific substances get asymmetrically localised in neuronal cells before they<br> divide which ensures the generation of new cell types. Different coloured GFP variants have highlighted<br> the cellular localisation and interplay of three key molecules, called Staufen, Prospero and Miranda,<br> that are involved in this process. </p> <p><br> GFP can also be used as a \"reporter\" of gene expression. Sequences of DNA next to genes, called<br> promoters, contain the information about where and when the protein product of the gene should be<br> made. If the GFP gene is linked to a particular promoter, GFP will be made instead of the normal gene<br> product, revealing where and when the gene of interest is switched on. <br> Scientists at AntiCancer Inc, San Diego, are using GFP as a novel cancer imaging method. Tumour cells<br> labelled with GFP and injected into mice were easily seen, even in soft organs and bones, areas in which<br> tumours are particularly difficult for existing methods like ultra sound and magnetic imaging to pick<br> up. </p> <p><br> Almost 2000 years ago, Pliny the Elder described the luminous slime of the jellyfish Pulmo marinus, \"a<br> walking stick rubbed with the pulmo marinus will light the way like a torch\". Quite prophetic in light of<br> GFP's role in scientific discoveries.</p>",

Whilst research using human embryos falls outside the charity's remit, we appreciate how important cloning of specific human cells is to the future of medical research.<br> <b>Duncan Barkes</b><br> Action Research<br> DBarkes@actionresearch.co.uk </p> <p>\u0095 Philosophically speaking, the human embryo can be characterised as a human being, albeit at a very early stage of development, since it requires nothing but the right environment to develop to adulthood. Contrary to Ian Gibson's claim, no such continuum extends to the sperm and unfertilised egg. </p> <p>It is easy to characterise one's opponents as reactionary, but the idea that human beings have intrinsic value is one of the foundations of our civilisation. Many movements in history sought to undermine this and have also claimed to act in the name of reason and progress.<br> <b>Dr Andrew Pinsent</b><br> Sunningdale, Berks<br> Itautec@compuserve.com</p> <p>\u0095 Regarding the Roslin Institute's decision to end pig transplant research, Dr Grahame Bulfield, its director, swiftly undermined the implications of Professor Wilmut's statement that \"it's possible there could be viruses we don't know about that could be released into the human population\" (Gene fears end pig testing, August 14). He claims that the programme may be ended for \"purely commercial\" reasons. True. The lawsuits which might arise should an Aids-like virus be passed from pigs to humans as a result of their research, or any medical procedure derived from it, could quite easily ruin the bio-tech industry. </p> <p>Two issues give rise to disquiet: that \"commercial\" reasons are the consideration, rather than the concerns of Professor Wilmut about medical risks; and Dr Bulfield's belief that \"other centres might be better equipped to pursue xenotransplantation research\". There is considerable disquiet about this genetic research in Britain - Dr Bulfield's remark suggests the research can be quickly transferred to \"other centres\" - perhaps in countries where public concern has little impact on the decision-making process.<br> <b>Nick Gunning</b><br> London</p>",
  "There is one common element in all the depressing reports we have carried this week on the state of world fishing. What they record is the direct and predicted consequence of rampant short-termism, of the failure of political institutions, and above all, of political will. Everyone has known for at least three decades that we could not go on plundering the seas to satisfy hungry markets without doing irreparable damage to future fishing. Yet that is what has been done. Desperate to meet insatiable demand from dwindling resources, big operators with mighty and avaricious boats have invaded the fishing grounds of people like those in Senegal, whose fate we described on Monday, threatening not just their livelihoods but their lives. <p>Solemn conferences have been held, and sound resolutions carried - but not then implemented. Britain, though not the worst offender, has failed to meet the target reductions it set itself. The European Union has failed most conspicuously, soliciting good expert advice and then not taking it, and allowing rates of erosion known to be unsustainable. </p> <p>One nation emerges with credit: Iceland, where in the aftermath of the cod war of the 70s, rigorous restrictions were imposed in the face of real difficulties and, after initial failure, enforced. Some draw the moral that responsibility for control should be taken back from the EU and vested in national governments. Others, like John Gummer, who ran both fisheries and the environment under the Tories, warn that national governments will always look after their own. But maybe those who work in the industry here are ahead of government. They recognise that overfishing for present profit implies future ruin. Some are leaving the industry; others are adjusting their practice to the bleak new realities. Unless political leaders make that adjustment too, the state of the oceans next time we come to assess it will be even more dire than it is today.</p>",
  "\u0095 As we prepare to revisit Book of the Month, Under No Illusion by Paul Daniels, a letter about the author arrives from Margaret Forwood. When she was reviewing television for the Sun, Margaret recalls, \"I spent many happy hours winding up Paul Daniels, then at the 'height' of his TV success.\" Paul was worried enough to ask a PR how to stop her, recalls Margaret, and was advised to go on a charm offensive. \"I subsequently received the following letter (copy enclosed).\" Written from Room 7015 of the Kensington Hilton, it reads: \"Dear Margaret, Dinner? Best wishes, Paul Daniels.\" Margaret continues: \"Spoilt for choice for appropriate one word responses, I somehow neglected to reply, thus saving myself, I now realise, from the awful possibility of being 'driven home' by Paul.\" Indeed so. An early extract from the book, you will recall, revolved around Paul's athletic if unsatisfying endeavours on the back seat. A lovely man. Tomorrow we learn of a bizarre meal he once ate in Bombay. <p>\u0095 Once, by way of a local radio link, the land on which that Hilton stands belonged to my old friend Michael Winner. After making a property fortune, however, Michael became a much admired film director - and his latest effort, the 1999 comic classic Parting Shots, has reached the \"new video\" section at all good retailers (\u00a310.95). The film, which stars Chris Rea (who by a cute irony has just survived an attack of pancreatitis), cannot be recommended warmly enough. We will be talking to Michael about getting a batch of video tapes to give away to lucky readers. </p> <p>\u0095 Word arrives of a tourist attraction to rival the Yelverton Paperweight Centre and top-ranked theme park, the Big Sheep. Weirdly, this one is not in Devon. Dave Cohen writes to commend to us the Cumberland Pencil Museum in Keswick in the Lake District: \"While holidaying in the area some years ago I came across a leaflet for this magnificent example of our heritage, but foolishly chose not to visit and to walk round a lake instead.\" Crazy decision. \"Now barely a day passes without wondering what HB delights I must have passed up on by not patronising this lead-filled shrine.\" Any reports on the museum are welcome. </p> <p>\u0095 A coded phone call has been received at Scotland Yard from the Real GAF (Judy Garland Appreciation Front), the terrorist group that police now confirm is responsible for Gerald Kaufman's kidnapping. Gerald is in good health, we are told, and according to one officer was clearly audible in the background, raucously singing a medley of songs including My Favourite Things (Sound of Music), Tomorrow (Annie) and something lewd about munchkins (Wizard of Oz). He was also overheard by sharp-eared police negotiators going \"whisper, whisper, whisper\", but it is unclear what this meant. Negotiations will continue, and we hope to have good news tomorrow, tomorrow, we love you tomorrow, you're always a day away. Sorry, I don't know what came over me there. </p> <p>\u0095 Speaking of musical songs, I am saddened by an unpleasant resurgence. At publishing parties, people have taken once again to singing, sotto voce, the Fatty Cheetham Song whenever the delightful Orion boss Anthony Cheetham walks into a room. Sung to the tune of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, the lyric is as follows: \"Hi, Ho, Fatty Fatty Cheetham, Fatty Cheetham, we love you. And our Fatty Fatty Cheetham, Fatty Fatty Cheetham loves us too.\" And so on. It's not clever, it's not funny and I hope we hear no more about it. </p> <p>\u0095 Sad news from Berlin, where Heidi Berger has filed for divorce due to insufficient coupling. \"Hans is a good man - but worn out,\" says Heidi, 100. \"We've been married 69 years but the last five have been very frustrating.\" Her ex takes a phlegmatic approach. \"Thank God it's over,\" says Hans, 101. \"That woman is an animal.\"</p>",
  "The Taliban regime in Afghanistan is making an unlikely attempt to send a team to next month's Sydney Olympics, but women will not be allowed to compete and male athletes will be forbidden to shave off their obligatory beards. <p>Although there are few sports facilities left in the country, which has been devastated by 20 years of war, Afghans take pride in their tough boxers and wrestlers, who have won Olympic medals and competed in other international events in the past. </p> <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended Afghanistan last year, ruling that the Taliban have no control of sport in the country. </p> <p>Although the regime controls most of Afghanistan, it is not recognised by the UN. </p> <p>\"Our players have prepared for years for this, but now they are being denied participation in the Olympics,\" the sports minister, Shakoor Muttmain, said. </p> <p>He said it would be the first time since 1936 that an Afghan team had failed to compete at a summer Olympics. </p> <p>The Taliban, who swept to power shortly after the Atlanta games four years ago, have asked the IOC to let them send a team to Sydney. </p> <p>\"We know that it is at the behest of the United States that we are being kept out of the Olympics,\" Mr Shakoor said. </p> <p>Washington has warned that it is considering toughening its sanctions against the Taliban for refusing to hand over Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire it accuses of bombing two of its embassies in east Africa two years ago. More than 200 people were killed. </p> <p>The Taliban include sport in their tough interpretation of Islamic law: sportsmen are not allowed to wear short-sleeved shirts and shorts and may be beaten by the religious police if they trim their beards. </p> <p>Two years ago three Afghan boxers were banned from a competition in Karachi, Pakistan, because they would not cut their beards to meet international boxing rules. They said they feared severe retribution if they returned home clean-shaven. </p> <p>Spectators cannot clap or cheer at sports matches in Afghanistan and may only show their approval by shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is great). Kabul's football stadium is regularly used for public executions. </p> <p>The ousted Afghan government, which is still fighting a civil war against the Islamic regime, said the Taliban were trying to hijack the Olympic cause to court international diplomatic recognition. </p> <p>Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recognise the Taliban. </p> <p>\"The Taliban are facing political isolation worldwide and have seen the Olympic games as yet another opportunity . . . to seek world recognition,\" said Mahmoud Saikal, the former government's consul general in Canberra, Australia. </p> <p>His government, which still holds the UN seat for Afghanistan, hoped to enter a team of men and women in the games, he said.</p>",
  "<p>If you were hoping to take refuge from the Queen Mum's recent 100th birthday brouhaha in cyberspace, bad luck. She might not have been an early adopter, but the Queen has her own website now at <a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk\">www.royal.gov.uk</a> and, rather charmingly, has plastered the site with pictures of her mum's birthday. She's not the only one, there are plenty of websites already out there devoted to everyone's favourite unelected rulers. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the Queen's own website is the triumph of the bland that one might have feared. Designed in suitably tasteful colours, there are some attempts to get with the medium. There is an FAQ, for example, perfect for the Queen, who is presumably \"frequently asked questions\" on a daily basis. But these aren't questions that one would actually ask the queen, given the chance. (\"Why don't you splash out on a new set of dentures for the Queen mum?\" springs to mind.) Instead, one can thrill at the answer to \"Who was the last monarch to fight in battle?\" (George VI, Battle of Jutland, pub quiz fans.) </p> <p>If you have never made it to London and always wanted to gawp at Buckingham Palace - you are in luck. There are 3D tours of Buck House avail able with a Quicktime Player from the Queen's site, and sites such as <a href=\"http://www.vrlondon.com/vr/london/royl1.shtml\">VR London</a> let you view a 360-degree panoramic view from the outside of Buckingham Palace.

You can subscribe to its impressive free weekly newsletter email which creams off all the best stories from the papers. </p> <p>Given the fame and fortune of the royal family, it is amaz ing that there aren't more loony sites devoted to them, bearing in mind that, after pornography, loony sites is probably what the internet does best. Put 'royal family conspiracy theories' into any search engine and you'll be disappointed. </p> <p>It's the Spencers who attract most of the \"fan\" sites that are out there, and Prince William is the object of many a young girl's affections. If you do have a \"pash\" for young Willy, then don't waste your time typing in \"Prince William\" as a search, it brings up all manner of US sites. Try William Windsor instead. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/ Lights/9185/William.html\" target=\"_new\">\"Carly's Site\"</a> is a classic example of a fan site dedicated to \"that fine boy and wonderful person, Prince William\". You can leave a message on the site noticeboard too (it's obligatory to mention how \"gorge\" he is). </p> <p>Diana obsessives crop up in the most unusual places, too. Take this page that appears to be inaccessible from the otherwise completely normal home page for the stately home <a href=\"http://www.mistral.co.uk/hammerwood/ukroyal.htm\">Hammerwood House</a>. It has an article by Diane Tessman, with a \"message\" from the late princess, channelled through Diane (obviously). \"First, allow me to explain that I am the angelic essence of the lovely human being who was Princess Diana.

At present it supports PCs but not Macs or Psions. It will be on sale from Monday. </p> <p>It is based on the same high speed HSCSD technology which will also be used for Orange's pioneering video phone expected next year. A brief test this week of one of only 10 prototypes revealed a device that was clunky but full of potential. Its large (for a mobile) screen comfortably accommodated my face and that of the person at the other end though resolution was only half the planned level. It is too heavy to carry around in a pocket but its versatility - including facilities for everything from MP3 or web browsing to instantly emailing colour photographs - will have a strong novelty value. Though at a planned introductory price of \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500 it will take time to escape from a niche market.

It features 64Mb of storage - enough for around two hours of tunes - though it can be upgraded to archive as much as 340Mb worth of music. </p> <p>Due at the beginning of November is the 600's big brother, the \u00a3200 Rio 800. Among the goodies the extra money buys you are a remote control, a more prominent high-resolution display and voice recording facilities. </p> <p>Rio has also unveiled plans for internet music based home units and ghetto blasters. Due in December the Rio Rack teams up a CD player. The device, designed to be hooked up to a hi-fi system, also features a modem and internet browser to enable users to download music without having to resort to a PC. </p> <p>A portable MP3/CD player/hard drive storage system, dubbed the Rio Boombox, will go on sale next year.

  "<p><strong> Is the internet a triumph of hype over content?</strong> I get caught between the two camps of it being the new wave of corporate control and my initial dream of it being like the consciousness of the planet - the planet dreaming about itself. When it's that side of it, I get very passionate and I adore it, but occasionally I get depressed about all the dot.coms and the dot.communists! </p> <p><strong> Any favourite places on the net?</strong> One of my favourite sites is <a href=\"http://www.dotcomfailures.com\">Dot.com Failures</a>. Another one I enjoy is <a href=\"http://www.dotster.com\">Dotster</a>, where you can feed in three words and they'll transform them into a new dot.com name. It makes you realise that any name, any sound, any grunt has already been registered. I love the sense that you're more likely to find flights of imagination on the web than in the mainstream media, which has got as straight as it possibly can get. </p> <p><strong> Is the net bringing people together or is it breeding a generation of loners?</strong> It's a combination of the two. Loners are sad people in a community. That's the way the world always was in a way, with people using music, literature and entertainment to find ways of being together. I like the nets weird isolation, the sense that somehow we're all dreaming together. </p> <p><strong> Are you, or have you ever been, a geek?</strong> I kind of flirt with it. I guess I've got it in me, and if I was 20 years younger I'd probably go for it wholeheartedly. There's got to be a sort of middle-class, middle-aged geekiness about the fact that I do my shopping at <a href=\"http://www.tesco.com\">www.tesco.com</a> and book my holidays through <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com\">www.virgin.com</a>! </p> <p> <strong> How does the net affect the writer?</strong> My favourite type of writing tends to exist on the net. It's uncensored and unedited. A lot of writing that goes on in the mainstream media now is often compressed and fairly tedious. It is often untrained, but I find the most exuberant writing on the net now. </p> <p><strong> What do you see as being the next stage of the net?</strong> I guess it's an ongoing battle and I'm hoping that anarchy is going to win and that business is defeated. At the moment I'm optimistic and I've gone back to thinking the net is the consciousness of the planet in its wildest and most far-fetched sense. I think that some of the business dot.coms are starting to look a little stiff and absurd. </p> <p><strong> Is the net creating a two tier society? </strong> There's always been elitism but I do get the feeling that there's an underclass connected on the net that hasn't been connected before. Although the net will still isolate other people it does seem like a move forward because there are people who were previously denied freedom of expression who are now beginning to get it. </p> <p><strong> Whose e-mail addresses would you like to have?</strong> If they were still alive, I would love to have Samuel Beckett's and Lenny Bruce's. Two others I'd love would be Chris Morris's and Alan Alda's. </p> <p>Paul Morley's new book Nothing is now available from Faber and Faber.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Killing bugs has never been so dull</strong></p> <p><strong> Parasite Eve II</strong> <br>Square \u00a329.99 Sony PlayStation *<br> I'd never even heard of Parasite Eve I, much less played it. But however bad it was, Parasite Eve II cannot possibly be an improvement. </p> <p>You play Aya Brea, an agent for MIST, the Mitochondria Investigation and Suppression Team. The FBI has an entire department dedicated to exterminating bugs. </p> <p>That's right, the FBI has an entire department dedicated to exterminating bugs (although technically, a mitochondrion is not a creature at all but a constituent of a cell). Bizarre names, abstruse organisations, disregard for basic science - if you hadn't already guessed this was from the makers of Final Fantasy, now you know. </p> <p>It's just as well the FBI is so foresighted, because a swarm of overgrown creepy-crawlies has just infested a building in Los Angeles. And it's MIST's job to splat them. </p> <p>PEII is a \"cinematic adventure\", which translates into a scrolling third-person display reminiscent of Resident Evil and detailed but oddly dull graphics. </p> <p>Points are everything: HP (health points), MP (mitochondria points), and the experience points you earn after defeating each enemy. </p> <p>This is all accessed through a convoluted (and, in the heat of battle, deeply unrealistic) menu system. But whereas FF was largely about magic, the main concern here is firepower. </p> <p>Dozens of weapons are available in the game, many of which can be combined for even more lethal effect: Magnum, machine gun, flame-thrower, etc (disappointingly, giant cans of Raid and outsized magnifying glasses are not among them). </p> <p>By all rights, bug-busting ought to be fun. But with its drab visuals, infuriating controls (no run button?) and logic-defying plot, Parasite Eve II is as enjoyable as dipping your face in a barrel full of live cockroaches. Me, I'm sticking to beetle drives. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Dark, dark times in Europe </strong></p> <p><strong>Arcatera: The Dark Brotherhood</strong><br> Ubisoft \u00a329.99 PC CD Rom *<br> We enjoy their wine, climate and culture but one thing we Brits can't digest is the European love for point-'n'-click games. And that's not the fault of the genre. The seminal Monkey Island series, and titles like Grim Fandango, offered some of the best game experiences around. This was down to their humorous scripts and user-friendly interfaces - neither of which applies to Arcatera: The Dark Brotherhood. </p> <p>In fact it's almost as if the developers had deliberately decided to ignore everything that worked so well in Monkey Island and the rest. So we get laughable dialogue, complete with subtitles that often bear little relation to what is being said. We also get character accents that are unintentionally hilarious. The female lead sounds like a 19th Century West Country milkmaid. </p> <p>Even worse is the way you interact with your surroundings. Examining a chest takes two mouse clicks and if you want to cast a spell or get into a fight then prepare for excessive appendage motion. And don't even think about being able to navigate easily; the screen exit arrows regularly get hidden behind the stats menu. </p> <p>However, the ability to choose and develop a character, along with the medieval criminal investigations of the plot (complete with time limit), does offer some potential. </p> <p>The game is very easy on the eye, with some practically photo-realistic environments and quality cut-scenes. But beautiful backdrops and a sprinkle of RPG innovation are scant consolation for the game's numerous shortcomings. Arcatera makes aEurosceptic of us all. (GH) </p>"
