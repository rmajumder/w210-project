  "<p>Grimsby Town, offered a first-half reprieve by the profligate finishing of Lee Hughes, capitalised with a stylish recovery that earned Lennie Lawrence's side their fourth win in five games. </p> <p>Grimsby's win - the only home victory in the First Division this weekend - saw them leap five places while West Brom passed up the opportunity to move into the top four.</p> <p>But how different it could have been if Hughes, normally so reliable in front of goal, had not wasted half of the 12 chances Albion created before the interval. </p> <p>Grimsby's underrated keeper Danny Coyne reacted particularly well to frustrate Hughes on two occasions, but Albion's manager Gary Megson was justifiably upset at their failure to make their domination count.</p> <p>\"We had a dozen chances and didn't take any of them. That's very poor at this level,\" said Megson. \"I know their keeper made some good saves, but our finishing wasn't too clever.\" </p> <p>The second half provided a stark contrast, with Albion creating just one opening - for Hughes of course - while Grimsby took control. </p> <p>They took the lead in the 59th minute when Tony Gallimore, under pressure from Hughes, hooked a clearance beyond an advancing Albion defence and left Bradley Allen clear to lob over keeper Brian Jensen. </p> <p>Grimsby could have scored again through Paul Groves and John McDermott before on-loan David Nielsen sealed Albion's second defeat in 13 games with a crisp 84th-minute volley. </p> <p>Megson said: \"The manner in which we lost is disappointing. We've thrown it away, but we are still fifth from top - it's not an absolute calamity.\" </p> <p>Even Lawrence accepted that Grimsby rode their luck in the first half. He said: \"Albion are a difficult side to play against and we were fortunate to be level at half-time, but Danny Coyne showed that he's in impressive form. To use a familiar phrase, it was a game of two halves.\" </p> <p>Two entertaining halves it might be added, which makes it all the more regrettable that Grimsby attracted a crowd of only 5,429 yesterday. With the likes of Campbell, Nielsen and Coyne in action, they deserve better.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Cascarino's claims that he was ineligible to play for the Republic of Ireland could lead to him losing the record-breaking 88 caps that he won for his country, the Football Association of Ireland warned yesterday. </p> <p>The FAI is to investigate Cascarino's revelation that the Irish grandfather who allowed him to be eligible to play for his country was not a blood relative. The striker said that his mother told him in 1996 that she was adopted and that his \"grandfather\" was, therefore, not her natural father. </p> <p>Cascarino, who last played for Ireland against Turkey last November, won a further 24 caps for his country after his mother's bombshell. He also shared a lucrative testimonial with Steve Staunton in a match against Liverpool in Dublin in May. </p> <p>Cascarino makes the claims in a book Full Time: The Secret Life of Tony Cascarino, and the FAI's president Bernard O'Byrne criticised the timing. \"It is sad that Tony did not learn about all these things until much later in life,\" he said. \"But it is also sad if some of these facts are now being revealed to promote a book.\" </p> <p>Lazio's chairman Sergio Cragnotti said yesterday that Sven-Goran Eriksson, who the Football Association are expected to approach this week about the England manager's job, had not yet signed an extension to his contract. </p> <p>\"I will do everything I can to prevent Eriksson going to England,\" said Cragnotti. \"He has not yet signed an extension to his contract which runs out on June 30 2001. But I've already spoken with Sven-Goran Eriksson about the renewal of his contract and we have agreed on everything and made an appointment for before Christmas to put pen to paper.\" </p> <p>Sepp Blatter, the president of Fifa, has warned Brazil that they could be banned from international competitions, including the 2002 World Cup, because of political interference in the domestic game. </p> <p>Brazil's congress has launched two inquiries to investigate allegations of corruption, the financial difficulties afflicting many clubs and the exodus of top players abroad. \"If we consider that there has been outside control of football, the situation is clear: Brazil will be suspended from all international activities,\" Blatter said. </p> <p>Sheffield, the oldest club in the world, failed to reach the first round of the FA Cup on Saturday when they were beaten 5-1 by Northwich Victoria. In the draw for the first round, the Second Division strugglers Luton face a tricky tie against Rushden &amp; Diamonds, who are second in the Conference, the leaders of which, Yeovil, will play Colchester if they get past Horsham. </p> <p>Japan won the Asian Cup yesterday by beating the defending champions Saudi Arabia, who included the Wolves striker Sami al-Jaber, 1-0 with a goal from Shigeyoshi Mochizuki.</p>",
  "It's dubbed the ministry of fun, and if you believe the papers, Tory culture spokesman Peter Ainsworth is a fun kind of guy. He smoked dope at college, so he can't be all bad. And shadowing Chris Smith in parliament is hardly a tough task - the culture secretary has not exactly covered himself in glory recently. It would be hard to cock it up. \"It is one of the best portfolios,\" admits Ainsworth with a smile. <p> It is not, however, easy to take a Tory culture spokesman seriously. In government, the Conservatives' broadcasting legacy was the discredited auction system that turned ITV into a free-for-all for the highest bidder. Successive national heritage secretaries were lambasted for being ineffectual (think Stephen Dorrell and Virginia Bottomley). And the Broadcasting Standards Commission, set up as a sop to the right-wing clean-up campaigners, has turned out to be a toothless tiger. Arts groups remember the Tories for slashing arts spending - even though it was the Conservative government that set up the national lottery. The one consolation is that the Tories at least enjoy plenty of friends in the press.</p> <p> So when Ainsworth was appointed to the brief after the last election, he had a hard task ahead of him. He could have just made a name for himself by providing handy quotes to the Daily Mail when it gets outraged about Channel 5 (and he has done his fair share of that), and wait until something better comes along.</p> <p> But, instead, Ainsworth has quietly been doing the rounds of the media circles. He is known to all the major broadcasters and lunches newspaper editors. He has immersed himself in all the issues that concern his wide brief (today the \"historic environment\" is at the front of his mind, following a meeting with English Heritage), and by all accounts, he has taken on board what people have said. Yet until the Mail on Sunday outed a crop of Tory frontbenchers as having tried cannabis in their youth, there was nothing much more to say about him.</p> <p> But with a white paper imminent, it is important for the Tories to be seen to have a thought-out communications policy. It's not enough just to moan about the BBC, you've got to have a view about what to do about it.</p> <p> And at least he watches TV and reads the papers. (There's a photocopy of the Sun's mocking front page the day after Greg Dyke was appointed to the BBC on his wall.) He enthuses about My Family, the BBC sitcom that has debuted to mixed reviews (\"very high-quality comedy\"), Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? (\"great theatre\"), and, of course: \"I became addicted to Big Brother. And yes, I voted.\" So did he go for Scouse builder Craig, or lesbian former nun Anna? \"I was one of the 49%.\" An Anna man, then.</p> <p> So that takes care of BBC, ITV and Channel 4. What about Channel 5, which he condemned as \"gross\" in the Mail earlier this year after it exposed Keith Chegwin's bodily parts to an undeserving public? He makes the right noises about protecting children, but adds: \"Well, you can switch it off. You don't have to watch it.\"</p> <p> Suddenly, he swaps his smooth Oxford-educated received pronunciation for a mock-south London accent to imitate a constituent who complained about the channel. \"He said to me, 'It's absolute filth innit, it goes on all night.' I replied, 'You don't have to watch it, there is the off button. And he said, 'Funnily enough, that's what my wife says.'\" Clearly Ainsworth isn't that concerned about Channel Filth.</p> <p> He is far more exercised with the BBC. It's not surprising: for the Conservatives, the corporation has always been a handy whipping boy. Full of pinko liberal subversives, it was a corrosive source of counter-revolutionary thought that had to be stamped on at all costs. The arrival of Dyke as director-general appeared to confirm that view. William Hague demanded that his appointment be blocked, and cries of \"Labour stooge\" went up as soon as he was confirmed in the post. Now, however, Dyke presents something of a problem for politicians of the right. In moving the Nine o'Clock News to 10pm with such haste, he has incurred the wrath of Smith. In slashing management costs, he has shown himself to be a shrewd businessman. And in showing a determination to increase the BBC's revenue from external sources, he has displayed a commercial eye that was lacking in the previous regime.</p> <p> Hence, a marked change in tune from the Tories. \"Greg is a highly commercial individual,\" says Ainsworth. \"To his core he is a commercial operator. That has merits. It's a breath of fresh air, a management style that's welcomed. He's an engaging guy, all that is good. What gives some cause for concern is that there is a degree of impetuousness which we saw with the sudden decision to bring forward the move of the news. That was a highly commercial thing to do.\"</p> <p> But Ainsworth doubts whether the commercialism of Dyke is necessarily a good thing for the corporation. \"Is there going to be a culture clash between the BBC as an institution and a man who is so entrepreneurial?\"</p> <p> So far, so reasonable. Many in the BBC would say the same thing. But lest we be in any doubt, Ainsworth calls back later after thinking about what he has said. Dyke is still very much on probation as far as his political bias is concerned. \"We are watching him like hawks. It's not an issue that can simply be brushed aside. I wouldn't want to give the impression that I think everything is rosy in the garden.\"</p> <p> During his interview, in his cramped offices at Millbank, he expresses serious concerns about the ratings-driven strategy that appears to have been adopted by Dyke, Mark Thompson and Lorraine Heggessey at the BBC. While he acknowledges that BBC1 must continue to be popular if the argument for the licence fee (which he supports) is to be sustained, he believes that the corporation has over-stepped the mark. Moving the news was \"opportunistic\". And it calls into question the role of the BBC governors, and the whole way in which the BBC - and the rest of the broadcasting industry - is regulated.</p> <p> While he says that \"any new parliamentary measures should be as profoundly deregulatory as humanly possible\", he agrees with the commercial sector's argument that the corporation should be brought under an overarching broadcasting regulator. The BBC governors cannot be \"judge and jury\" any more. But he does not advocate their abolition: \"There is plenty for them to do.\" Instead, they would play the role of \"non-executive directors\".</p> <p> It is unfair, he says, that ITV should have had to jump through so many hoops when it wanted to move News at Ten, when the BBC could do it in a matter of weeks without reference to an independent body. And it is equally unfair that those who wish to complain about the BBC's actions are also referred to the governors, who are ultimately responsible for the decisions in the first place.</p> <p> But he is a supporter of the licence fee \"for the time being\", and would not countenance allowing advertising onto the BBC. \"It would be devastating for the commercial sector.\"</p> <p> And even in the light of the News of the World's dispatch of the Broadcasting Standards Commission's hapless Lord Holme, he does not favour a privacy law. The PCC works well, he says, and is about the only sector where backdoor deals appear to be worthwhile - most complainants are satisfied with a personal letter of apology from an editor, or a phone call of explanation.</p> <p> As the Dome scandal dies down - Ainsworth has been particularly active in keeping Smith on the ropes over this one - he is now preparing for another political rollercoaster over the broadcasting white paper. These are not dull times.</p> <p> \"It's a wonderful brief, full of interesting issues and worthwhile people creating all sorts of things that are worthwhile in their own right - and are contributing increasingly to the economy. And everybody's got an opinion. It's intrinsically interesting - the whole sector, from sport to the 'historic environment' to broadcasting. And it will all assume a greater importance in our lives as we live longer and spend less of our time at work. Any political philosophy that ignores this, does so at its peril.\" </p>",
  "Frantic efforts to save the Northern Ireland peace process from collapse were underway last night as Gerry Adams launched a vitriolic attack on the Ulster Unionist party leader, David Trimble. <p>The visibly angry Sinn Fein leader accused Mr Trimble of \"arrogant\" behaviour and \"stupid and unattainable demands\" in the wake of his threat to bar Sinn Fein from attending a cross-border council meeting later this week. </p> <p>He queried Mr Trimble's commitment to sharing power with nationalists and republicans at Stormont. \"Sinn Fein does not hold executive position by dint of patronage from the UUP. We have a mandate,\" he said. </p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, is expected to hold urgent talks this week with the Irish foreign minister, Brian Cowen, to find a formula to persuade all sides to keep faith with the process as the rift between unionists and republicans over IRA disarmament deepens. </p> <p>The peace process was thrown into a serious crisis on Saturday when Mr Trimble pledged to block Sinn Fein from attending the special cross-border ministerial council until the IRA lived up to its commitment to place its weapons \"completely and verifiably beyond use\". </p> <p>The move, which saw off a challenge from unionist hardliners opposed to Mr Trimble, infuriated Sinn Fein which said it would attend the next meeting of the cross-border body in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, on Friday. </p> <p>Sinn Fein regards the cross-border body as one of the most important elements of the Good Friday agreement because republicans can claim that the body is an embryonic united Ireland. Cross-party support is needed for a minister to attend any north-south council meeting. </p> <p>Speaking to party activists in Co Louth, Mr Adams said: \"Does Mr Trimble think what he said is going to sort this out? Of course it isn't and everyone knows that. </p> <p>\"People don't react, whether they are unionists or republicans, to threat and to diktat and to the type of gesture politics we saw the other day.\" </p> <p>Mr Adams also said the British and Irish governments must not pander to a \"unionist veto\", and must fulfil their commitments under the Good Friday agreement and provide effective political leadership. \"Republicans have serious concerns about the focus and intent of Mr Blair and his colleagues,\" he added. </p> <p>His remarks were condemned as a \"hysterical over-reaction\" by Michael McGimpsey, the Ulster Unionist arts minister in the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive. </p> <p>There was relief in London and Dublin that Mr Trimble had succeeded in defeating hardliners at a meeting of the Ulster Unionist council on Saturday. A relieved Mr Trimble won by 54% to 46%, a one point increase since the last meeting in May. </p> <p>Victory for the dissidents, led by the UUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson, would have dealt the peace process a potentially fatal blow because Mr Trimble would have been forced to abandon the power-sharing executive. </p> <p>However, there were fears last night that Mr Trimble's victory came at a dangerously high price. Both London and Dublin are acutely aware that excluding Sinn Fein from the next meeting of the north-south ministerial council on Friday would harden the IRA's opposition to disarmament. </p> <p>If a legal challenge to Mr Trimble, which is being considered by the SDLP, fails ministers may consider postponing Friday's meeting at which Sinn Fein's health minister, Bairbre de Brun, is due to set up a cross-border food standards agency with her southern Irish counterpart, Miche\u00e1l Martin. </p> <p>Beyond that, Mr Mandelson is expected to tell Mr Cowen that the IRA should live up to its pledge to press ahead with disarmament. Mr Cowen will make clear that threats from the unionists will guarantee that the IRA does not make any further gestures. </p> <p>The tension between unionists and republicans came amid fears that the loyalist paramilitary feud could erupt again after the shooting of a 21-year-old man in north Belfast. The body of David Greer, a member of the Ulster Defence Association, was found with a gunshot wound to the chest on Saturday night. The Ulster Democratic party, the UDA's political wing, blamed the killing on the rival Ulster Volunteer Force.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q: What are the regulations governing newspaper takeovers?</strong><br> A: Newspaper owners must obtain \"prior consent\" from the government to buy a newspaper which would take the joint circulation over 500,000.<br></p> <p><strong> Q: What happens if The Mail goes ahead with a formal bid?</strong><br> A: The bid will be referred to the competition commission, which will investigate whether the move is against the public interest. <br></p> <p><strong> Q. What does the law guard against? </strong><br> A. The 1973 Fair Trading Act protects against \"the increasing concentration of newspaper ownership which could threaten the freedom and variety of expression of opinion and perhaps even the unbiased presentation of news\".<br></p> <p><strong> Q: How would this apply in the case of the Mail and the Express?</strong><br> A. The competition commission would look at the newspapers' share of the market and look for any unfair competition it would create through domination of the mid-market. It would also assess the threat to jobs at the title and investigate whether the buyer will run its new publication efficiently. If concerns on any of these issues are raised, then the commission could decide the takevoer threatens free expression of opinion.<br></p> <p><strong> Q. Is there any way the Mail could bypass the public interest test? </strong><br> A. Yes. By proving the paper was going to close down unless it intervened. This is the so-called \"financial urgency\" clause of the Act.<br></p> <p><strong> Q. Has this rule ever been invoked before? </strong><br> A. Yes. Rupert Murdoch swooped on the Times in 1980 a year after he had brazenly said he \"would never buy the Times because it would be a highly irresponsible thing to do to your shareholders\". <br></p> <p><strong> Q. How did Murdoch prove The Times was in dire straits? </strong><br> A. Easy. Owner Roy Thomson said if would close the paper down before March 1981 if he didn't receive a bid.</p> <p><strong> Q.Has the financial urgency clause been invoked since? </strong><br> A. Yes. You've guessed it - by Rupert Murdoch. When he bought the Today newspaper in 1987, the full colour tabloid founded by Eddie Shah and owned by Lonrho at the time. He bought it for \u00a338m cash after delivering an ultimatum to Lord Young, the secretary of state for trade and industry. Murdoch warned if his the bid wasn't approved within 24 hours he would withdraw his offer.</p> <p><strong> Q. Will the Mail use this clause to get around the public interest test? </strong><br> A. It might try to argue the Express is a going concern, but it is unlikely to be a successful tack to take with the government. Besides it will only work if the newspaper, not its parent group, has no cash in the bank and its backers have given a specific date for withdrawal of funds or closure of the title.</p>",
  "With little more than a week to go, America's third best-known candidate is running neck to neck with her opponent in New York state. <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, is eight points clear of Rick Lazio, according to a poll in this morning's New York Times.</p> <p>But another reputable polling organisation, working for the Times's raucous rival the New York Post, puts Lazio two points ahead.</p> <p>Newspapers in the state agree that turn out will be crucial to Clinton's attempt to launch her own political career in the US Senate.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Times</a>, which has endorsed Al Gore in the main national race, points out the paradox that Clinton could be undermined by the apparently unassailable campaign by the Democrat presidential candidate.</p> <p>The paper says that, \"if it appears that vice president Al Gore is going to win New York easily - this poll suggests that he is 21 points ahead of George W Bush in New York, 52 percent to 31 percent - then Democrats may not bother to turn out in the numbers Mrs Clinton needs to win the race.\"</p> <p>The Times also slyly points out that Lazio may have scored an own goal by launching his most trenchant criticism of Clinton, over her role in health care legislation, during the sensational baseball World Series, featuring the New York Yankees and the New York Mets.</p> <p>Nobody in the city, it seems, was paying much attention to politics last week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nypostonline.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Post</a> rather underscores the point.</p> <p>Its lead story is the celebratory tickertape parade by the victorious Yankees.

Or is he just trying to have it both ways?\"</p> <p>It goes on to question Lieberman's apparently radical shift of views towards Al Gore's liberal line, and concludes: \"So maybe it's not all that surprising that Lieberman decided to maintain a Connecticut bolt-hole. It's all about what's best for Joe, no?\"</p> <p>The Post also gives prominence to the nasty tale of the Republican telephone campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton by linking her to the terror bombing of the US Navy destroyer Dole in Yemen a few weeks ago.</p> <p>The party has wisely dropped the outrageous message, which was relayed to thousands of non-Jewish voters and accused Clinton of accepting money from an Arab organisation that \"openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group, the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.\"</p> <p>The equally strident <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com\" target=\"_new\">New York Daily News</a> - one of its main news stories is headed \"Judge could nix slay rap\" - wastes little time on political analysis.</p> <p>But it does approve of Chelsea Clinton.

  "<p>The Department of Trade and Industry is to launch an investigation into allegations that tobacco giant British American Tobacco is implicated in smuggling, it said today.</p> <p>Secretary of State Stephen Byers said that he had appointed investigators to look into the allegations in response to a Health Select Committee report on the tobacco industry.</p> <p>He said: \"I have given careful consideration to the unanimous recommendation of the select committee that the DTI should investigate the allegations of BAT's involvement in smuggling.</p> <p>\"I have decided to appoint investigators to look into this and to report back to me as soon as possible.</p> <p>\"I will then decide what further steps I must take and whether the facts support a reference to other authorities.\"</p> <p>BAT said in a statement that it was \"naturally disappointed\" at the move by Mr Byers.</p> <p>\"We will, of course, cooperate fully with the investigators, but will be making no further comments during the course of their work,\" it said.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Conservative former chancellor Kenneth Clarke said that Mr Clarke, as deputy chairman for BAT, had no comment to make.</p> <p>\"Mr Clarke is not making a statement. The company has done so,\" she said.</p> <p>In February, Mr Clarke sought to rebut accusations that BAT was involved in large-scale cigarette smuggling and that it indirectly encouraged drug runners' money laundering operations.</p> <p>The accusations stemmed from research conducted by the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) and investigative journalist Duncan Campbell.</p> <p>The allegations have also been aired by Channel 4 News. It was claimed that BAT's own internal documentation demonstrated that the company was involved in orchestrating, managing and controlling cigarette smuggling in Asia and Latin America in the early 1990s, with BAT exercising control over illegal distribution channels through intermediaries.</p> <p>But Mr Clarke, a former health secretary as well as chancellor, told the House of Commons select committee on health that the accusations were unfounded.</p> <p>Mr Clarke acknowledged that cigarettes were smuggled into markets such as Colombia, but insisted that BAT was not involved in that process.</p> <p>\"There is no evidence I have ever seen that BAT is a participant in this smuggling. We seek to minimise it and avoid it,\" Mr Clarke told the committee.</p> <p>Mr Clarke insisted that BAT was \"a company of integrity and a good corporate citizen\", which observed not only the requirements of the law in the countries in which it operated, but also \"good ethical standards\".</p> <p>BAT chairman Martin Broughton also denied, before the committee's February hearing, any wrongdoing on his company's part.</p> <p>Asked if he refuted the accusations that the company was involved in managing cigarette smuggling and money laundering, he insisted: \"I refute those (accusations) completely.\"</p> <p>In what was often a heated session, at one point Mr Broughton demonstrated his feelings about Mr Campbell's research by tearing up one document that the journalist presented as part of his efforts to substantiate his claims.</p> <p>In his evidence to the committee, Mr Campbell explained that South American-based drug runners raise huge sums by smuggling narcotics such as cocaine and heroin into the United States, then \"launder\" the dollars generated by using them to buy cigarettes, which are smuggled back into their own countries.</p> <p>Mr Campbell claimed that BAT \"assiduously\" and \"deliberately\" supported the cigarette smuggling market.</p> <p>In June, in a report it published on the impact of smoking, the committee called for an inquiry into the allegations.</p> <p>Director of Ash Clive Bates said: \"We think the evidence that BAT has been controlling and facilitating tobacco smuggling is overwhelming.</p> <p>\"We are just delighted that the DTI is going to hold them to account. I think this will be a turning point in the fight against tobacco smuggling, because the authorities will have the evidence that the tobacco industry itself is a major player in global smuggling.</p> <p>\"The tobacco industry will no longer be seen as friends but somebody working hand-in-glove with organised crime.</p> <p>\"While not doing the smuggling themselves, they are doing everything necessary to make sure smuggling happens in their commercial interests and on a very large scale,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>I've always been uncomfortable with the idea of \"surfing\". It always seems a perfectly adequate metaphor for 26-year-old American web kids, lean, bronzed and teetering with cat-like agility on the breaking edge of the technological tsunami. But I'm British. The idea of an Englishman \"surfing\" is inherently daft. I've always rather felt that \"Pottering\" was the proper term. </p> <p>Unfortunately \"searching\" and \"surfing\" have become the two defining patterns for web use. Marketers fondly imagine web users are either diligently hunting for tiny nuggets of relevance or are richocheting wildly around a funhouse of weird, free content. So the strategy for a successful web operation is a) advertise hugely so they know what to search for and b) make the site \"sticky\" so they don't just surf off to some far more compelling site concerned with cheerleaders' underwear or pirate garage. </p> <p>Marketers refer to these issues as \"acquisition\" and \"retention\" and the debate rages daily on how a budget is split between the two. Last week first-e, the internet bank, pulled its advertising campaign, quoting acquisition costs of up to \u00a3250 per customer. That is clearly too high, particularly in a sector where margins are being eroded so fast, but until now it's never seemed to be a problem for web companies who have historically chucked unbelievable amounts of investor cash at customer acquisition. According to management consultants McKinsey, 98.7% of visitors to a web site never return, regardless of whether or not they've made or attempted a purchase. First-e realised that getting customers in is only part of the story. It's quite another keeping them long enough to recoup that acquisition investment in a market characterised by \"endemic consumer disloyalty\". </p> <p>For users, of course, neither searching nor surfing really answers their needs. Search engines are neither comprehensive nor accurate and surfing pretty soon bears out Bruce Springsteen's memorable observation - \"57 channels and still nothing on\". Five years ago, the MIT futurist Nicholas Negroponte was talking about the answer, in the form of \"agent technology\", software that the user briefs to deliver relevant content. </p> <p>Personalisation has been offered as an interim solution but it doesn't come cheap for web site owners. Naturally, most want lots of personal details in exchange for relevant content delivery, which can be a problem. Registration is a chore and most people just can't be arsed. Customers also have a sneaking suspicion that they'll be carpet-bombed with irrelevant marketing junk if they divulge their email address. Sadly, they're usually right. </p> <p>Several technology companies are currently punting enhancements to browsers which go out onto the web and get the stuff you've specifically requested, without you having to surf - check the usual raft of daft names, Octopus, PurpleYogi, Yodlee, Dodots, and a UK version, KeepUpdated. They are beginning to fulfil Negroponte's vision of a constant feed of blindingly relevant stuff he called the \"Daily Me\". KeepUpdated handily does this while retaining the user's anonymity, avoiding the need to register a name or an email address. </p> <p>This might be permission marketing at its most elegant. If users can go to a web site just once, declare their interest through an anonymous profiling exercise, and then get only what they've asked for, they might get over their apathy. </p> <p>If KeepUpdated tells me there's a two-bedroom flat in my price range which has just come on the market I might peek at the page on the host web site (anonymously) and decide to declare my interest if I make an appointment to view. Moreover.com users will be familiar with this concept for news. Choose your area and they'll serve up the stories you want to read as they're published on the web. Imagine this service applied to everything on the web and you're getting close to what these sites can do. </p> <p>If I'm a website owner this is great news. There might just be another way of getting the sale which doesn't involve me reminding people to come back to my site. Let them decide what they want and only come back when they know what they're going to get. That way I won't have to worry about \"stickiness\", and I can stop generic web advertising for anything but awareness. The technology is free to both consumers and web site owners. Money is made from matching consumers with content they've already asked for. Neat. </p> <p>This might be the end of web surfing and the hideous mental image of fat, pasty Brits falling off longboards, or it might just be an overdue break for frustrated marketers. Just one tiny shift in the right direction on that \"98.7% of visitors never return\" figure makes a huge difference to results and, given market sentiment right now, we all need all the help we can get.</p>",
  "<p>It's dubbed the ministry of fun, and if you believe the papers, Tory culture spokesman Peter Ainsworth is a fun kind of guy. He smoked dope at college, so he can't be all bad. And shadowing Chris Smith in parliament is hardly a tough task - the culture secretary has not exactly covered himself in glory recently. It would be hard to cock it up. \"It is one of the best portfolios,\" admits Ainsworth with a smile. </p> <p>It is not, however, easy to take a Tory culture spokesman seriously. In government, the Conservatives' broadcasting legacy was the discredited auction system that turned ITV into a free-for-all for the highest bidder. Successive national heritage secretaries were lambasted for being ineffectual (think Stephen Dorrell and Virginia Bottomley). And the Broadcasting Standards Commission, set up as a sop to the right-wing clean-up campaigners, has turned out to be a toothless tiger. Arts groups remember the Tories for slashing arts spending - even though it was the Conservative government that set up the national lottery. The one consolation is that the Tories at least enjoy plenty of friends in the press. </p> <p>So when Ainsworth was appointed to the brief after the last election, he had a hard task ahead of him. He could have just made a name for himself by providing handy quotes to the Daily Mail when it gets outraged about Channel 5 (and he has done his fair share of that), and wait until something better comes along. </p> <p>But, instead, Ainsworth has quietly been doing the rounds of the media circles. He is known to all the major broadcasters and lunches newspaper editors. He has immersed himself in all the issues that concern his wide brief (today the \"historic environment\" is at the front of his mind, following a meeting with English Heritage), and by all accounts, he has taken on board what people have said. Yet until the Mail on Sunday outed a crop of Tory frontbenchers as having tried cannabis in their youth, there was nothing much more to say about him. </p> <p>But with a white paper imminent, it is important for the Tories to be seen to have a thought-out communications policy. It's not enough just to moan about the BBC, you've got to have a view about what to do about it. </p> <p>And at least he watches TV and reads the papers. (There's a photocopy of the Sun's mocking front page the day after Greg Dyke was appointed to the BBC on his wall.) He enthuses about My Family, the BBC sitcom that has debuted to mixed reviews (\"very high-quality comedy\"), Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? (\"great theatre\"), and, of course: \"I became addicted to Big Brother. And yes, I voted.\" So did he go for Scouse builder Craig, or lesbian former nun Anna? \"I was one of the 49%.\" An Anna man, then. </p> <p>So that takes care of BBC, ITV and Channel 4. What about Channel 5, which he condemned as \"gross\" in the Mail earlier this year after it exposed Keith Chegwin's bodily parts to an undeserving public? He makes the right noises about protecting children, but adds: \"Well, you can switch it off. You don't have to watch it.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, he swaps his smooth Oxford-educated received pronunciation for a mock-south London accent to imitate a constituent who complained about the channel. \"He said to me, 'It's absolute filth innit, it goes on all night.' I replied, 'You don't have to watch it, there is the off button. And he said, 'Funnily enough, that's what my wife says.'\" Clearly Ainsworth isn't that concerned about Channel Filth. </p> <p>He is far more exercised with the BBC. It's not surprising: for the Conservatives, the corporation has always been a handy whipping boy. Full of pinko liberal subversives, it was a corrosive source of counter-revolutionary thought that had to be stamped on at all costs. The arrival of Dyke as director-general appeared to confirm that view. William Hague demanded that his appointment be blocked, and cries of \"Labour stooge\" went up as soon as he was confirmed in the post. Now, however, Dyke presents something of a problem for politicians of the right. In moving the Nine o'Clock News to 10pm with such haste, he has incurred the wrath of Smith. In slashing management costs, he has shown himself to be a shrewd businessman. And in showing a determination to increase the BBC's revenue from external sources, he has displayed a commercial eye that was lacking in the previous regime. </p> <p>Hence, a marked change in tune from the Tories. \"Greg is a highly commercial individual,\" says Ainsworth. \"To his core he is a commercial operator. That has merits. It's a breath of fresh air, a management style that's welcomed. He's an engaging guy, all that is good. What gives some cause for concern is that there is a degree of impetuousness which we saw with the sudden decision to bring forward the move of the news. That was a highly commercial thing to do.\" </p> <p>But Ainsworth doubts whether the commercialism of Dyke is necessarily a good thing for the corporation. \"Is there going to be a culture clash between the BBC as an institution and a man who is so entrepreneurial?\" </p> <p>So far, so reasonable. Many in the BBC would say the same thing. But lest we be in any doubt, Ainsworth calls back later after thinking about what he has said. Dyke is still very much on probation as far as his political bias is concerned. \"We are watching him like hawks. It's not an issue that can simply be brushed aside. I wouldn't want to give the impression that I think everything is rosy in the garden.\" </p> <p>During his interview, in his cramped offices at Millbank, he expresses serious concerns about the ratings-driven strategy that appears to have been adopted by Dyke, Mark Thompson and Lorraine Heggessey at the BBC. While he acknowledges that BBC1 must continue to be popular if the argument for the licence fee (which he supports) is to be sustained, he believes that the corporation has over-stepped the mark. Moving the news was \"opportunistic\". And it calls into question the role of the BBC governors, and the whole way in which the BBC - and the rest of the broadcasting industry - is regulated. </p> <p>While he says that \"any new parliamentary measures should be as profoundly deregulatory as humanly possible\", he agrees with the commercial sector's argument that the corporation should be brought under an overarching broadcasting regulator. The BBC governors cannot be \"judge and jury\" any more. But he does not advocate their abolition: \"There is plenty for them to do.\" Instead, they would play the role of \"non-executive directors\". </p> <p>It is unfair, he says, that ITV should have had to jump through so many hoops when it wanted to move News at Ten, when the BBC could do it in a matter of weeks without reference to an independent body. And it is equally unfair that those who wish to complain about the BBC's actions are also referred to the governors, who are ultimately responsible for the decisions in the first place. </p> <p>But he is a supporter of the licence fee \"for the time being\", and would not countenance allowing advertising onto the BBC. \"It would be devastating for the commercial sector.\" </p> <p>And even in the light of the News of the World's dispatch of the Broadcasting Standards Commission's hapless Lord Holme, he does not favour a privacy law. The PCC works well, he says, and is about the only sector where backdoor deals appear to be worthwhile - most complainants are satisfied with a personal letter of apology from an editor, or a phone call of explanation. </p> <p>As the Dome scandal dies down - Ainsworth has been particularly active in keeping Smith on the ropes over this one - he is now preparing for another political rollercoaster over the broadcasting white paper. These are not dull times. </p> <p>\"It's a wonderful brief, full of interesting issues and worthwhile people creating all sorts of things that are worthwhile in their own right - and are contributing increasingly to the economy. And everybody's got an opinion. It's intrinsically interesting - the whole sector, from sport to the 'historic environment' to broadcasting. And it will all assume a greater importance in our lives as we live longer and spend less of our time at work. Any political philosophy that ignores this, does so at its peril.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you read any papers besides the Guardian, the Times and the FT you will no doubt have recently spotted one of several full-page colour ads for MegaStar, the Daily Star's website. Carried in titles including the Telegraph, the Independent and the London Evening Standard, the ads have featured a variety of topless women covering up their ample curves with large placards. These have carried a range of straight news headlines such as \"Aptitude tests aid entry to elite academic institutions\" and \"Polo aims to be populist not elitist sport, says lord\". </p> <p>This somewhat unlikely juxtaposition of nudity with rather posh news has been aimed at highlighting the fact that MegaStar offers online users \"visionary and definitive sports analysis\" and even \"in-depth news and current affairs\" as well as, erm, the rather more colourful, titillating fare of scantily-clad women. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, several broadsheets have refused to carry them, some no doubt worrying about eyebrows being raised in Milton Keynes and bulging postbags. </p> <p>But this is not unusual - newspapers and magazines often reject one-off ads and even whole campaigns. While TV stations cannot make independent decisions on what commercials to allow (all TV ads are pre-vetted by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre), individual print media organisations have the power to decide which advertisements they want to carry - and which not. </p> <p>Gary Ward, head of communications at the Advertising Standards Authority, the print advertising watchdog which monitors complaints about ads after they have been published, explains: \"There is no equivalent of the BACC in print. There is no pre-vetting system - that would be impossible because there are over 30m print ads a year. The decision is therefore left to the discretion of the individual publishers and media owners.\" </p> <p>Aside from making sure ads are not misleading or unlawful, as laid out in the British Code of Advertising, the press mostly vet copy supplied by advertisers because they want to \"protect\" their readers and safeguard their product's reputation. This manifests itself in general issues of taste and decency - the most common reasons for ads being rejected. Kevin Brown, a partner at MegaStar's ad agency Soul, says: \"We wanted to run the ads in quality newspapers because our target audience is ABC1 men - and they read the broadsheets. We were simply using the media environment and our creative message to stand out and grab attention. The ads are not tasteless but fun, pretty harmless and very striking in that environment. It seems over the top to me that those papers refused to carry them.\" </p> <p>The Guardian maintains it rejected them \"because editorially we did not agree with the way they represented the site\". Brown says other reasons given were variations on the theme of \"they would upset our readers\" or \"the ads are too over the top for our publication\": in short, it was the naked flesh that was judged unacceptable, with one title even suggesting that if the women were put in sarongs and T-shirts they would reconsider. </p> <p>While nudity might be offensive to some papers, however, swearing can cause ructions elsewhere. A Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ad for the NSPCC in 1995 carried a picture of a clenched fist with the word \"love\" tattooed on it. The copy below read: \"The only love I ever got from my father. Bastard.\" Despite the power of this idea, the Sun refused to run the advert, loftily stating at the time: \"We are a family paper and we don't allow swearing.\" </p> <p>Cosmopolitan has also been known to take a stance against ads it perceives to be sexist. There was a Wonderbra advertisement last year featuring a girl in a Santa outfit beside the saucy line: \"The tree won't be the only thing that lights up this Xmas\". Cosmo rejected it, apparently, for belittling women. </p> <p>Chatlines or overtly sexy advertisements are also frequently outlawed. But it is most often charity ads which fall foul of the press's sense of taste and decency, largely because they depend on shocking imagery to pack their punch. </p> <p>Earlier this year, a very hard- hitting advertisement by Bartle Bogle Hegarty for Barnado's was rejected by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday. It featured a baby sitting in a filthy room with a tourniquet round its arm, as if preparing to shoot up heroin. </p> <p>The Mail has also just thrown out the latest Barnado's advertisement which features a young boy lying lifeless beside a sawn-off shotgun outside a bank, having seemingly bungled a raid. John Teal, ad director on the newpaper, explains: \"We have carried other adverts in the campaign, but the one showing a baby jacking up and the other with a child and a shotgun were considered by the editorial department to be distasteful and unsuitable, and offensive to the readers. We have run editorial articles about the campaign but as far as these ads are concerned we decided not to carry them.\" </p> <p> Given that it is the editorial departments that tend to rule on advertisement acceptance (the ad departments being more driven to accept anyone's cash), some decisions are often simply down to the whim of an editor. He or she might want fox-hunting banned and therefore refuse to carry pro-hunting ads from the Countryside Alliance, while pro-euro or Europe advertising might be banned by, say, the Sun. </p> <p>Political ads might also be refused on the grounds that they don't fit in with editorial policy. A right-leaning paper could, for instance, refuse to carry ads for New Labour - or at least charge them a prohibitively expensive rate which effectively rules them out of appearing. </p> <p>Other moral stands are sometimes taken. The FT, for instance, unlike most other national newspapers, refuses to carry tobacco advertisements at all. </p> <p>But, perhaps most predictably, it is ads for competitive products that invariably fail to make it - if they even bother to try. Peter Barrie, display ad manager on the Telegraph, explains: \"Commercial issues could well make us refuse an ad, for instance if it was for a rival newspaper. We would probably charge ratecard, and so not do them any deal, but if it really was a direct rival like the Times we would probably turn them down altogether.\" </p> <p>The issue which most frustrates advertisers and their agencies when dealing with rejected ads is the lack of understanding and the apparent inconsistency of policy from one paper to the next - or indeed from the same publication. In the case of the MegaStar campaign, the aforementioned broadsheets refused it but it was warmly welcomed by such august journals as Legal Week, Golf International and even the Spectator. At the same time, the Daily Mail rejected the heroin baby but was happy to carry another Barnado's ad that featured a young girl standing like a soliciting prostitute on a street corner beside a parked car. </p> <p>Press editors simply take the view that it is their prerogative to accept or reject adverts, on whatever seemingly unreasonable or inconsistent grounds those might be. In general, however, they would rather be broad-minded enough to carry every ad that is booked into their publication - not least because of the financial implications of rejecting something. With a campaign of full-page colour press ads being worth as much as \u00a3500,000, they reject too much copy at their peril. </p> <p>Barrie concludes: \"We are extremely liberal, within the law. Why would we turn something down? It's money, and it's up to the readers. Some papers might claim an ad is in poor taste, but so is the Sun - and 4m people happily read that.\"</p>",
  "<p>The owners of the Daily Mail are poised to join the bidding for its arch rival Express Newspapers. Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which also owns the Mail on Sunday and a string of evening newspapers, is understood to be weighing up an offer of more than \u00a3100m. </p> <p>He will face competition from the wealthy Indian businessmen the Hinduja brothers, who are expected to formally lodge their bid for the newspapers later today. Conrad Black, owner of the Telegraph group, has also expressed an interest as has David Montgomery, former Mirror Group chief executive. </p> <p>If Lord Rothermere is successful, the bid will mark final victory in a once bitter struggle for the mid-market that has witnessed the inexorable rise of the Daily Mail and steady slide of the Daily Express. The Express, which once sold more than 4m copies a day, now hovers above 1m. </p> <p>The bid could face substantial political and commercial hurdles, however. To assuage government fears, DMGT is considering a separate editorial board and independence for the Express titles, which were reshaped as New Labour supporters under the current editor, Rosie Boycott. </p> <p>It would probably guarantee that the Labour stance would be maintained until at least after the general election, and could keep Ms Boycott in office. </p> <p>DMGT would also promise investment in the newspapers of up to \u00a350m a year over the next five years. The group is understood to be keen that Express Newspapers does not end up in the hands of its chief rival, the Telegraph group. </p> <p>It is believed that DMGT does not plan to close down the Express, but, perhaps turn it into a more politically neutral paper, like its Metro, and use it to cement its dominance of the middle market. The Daily Star could also be used to compete with the other red-top tabloids. </p> <p>Ms Boycott was surprised by the news, but described the move as a \"brilliant idea\". She added: \"I guess it does make sense and I can see the logic to it. But I would be surprised if the regulatory authorities allow it because one company would control the whole middle market. As newspaper managers, Associated are fantastic and the Daily Mail can't be bettered in its market. You might not like it, but it is the best at what it does.\" </p> <p>An offer from DMGT would face automatic referral to the competition commission. The company will take heart, however, from previous investigations hingeing on share of the total newspaper market rather than sub-sectors such as mid-market tabloids. DMGT would still have less market share than Rupert Murdoch's News International, which owns the Times and the Sun. </p> <p>The present auction was sparked when an offer from the billionaire Barclay brothers, who own Sunday Business and the Scotsman, leaked out. The Barclays, who made an offer of \u00a375m, have since withdrawn. United News &amp; Media, the present owner of Express Newspapers, has found itself under increasing pressure to sell the division, which barely breaks even. </p> <p>Lord Hollick, the Labour peer who runs United News, has gained a reputation during his stewardship of being an aggressive cost-cutter. Four years ago the editorial teams of the Daily and Sunday Express titles were merged in an attempt to make the operation more efficient. </p> <p>Ms Boycott said she was \"weary at all these offers day after day\" and just hoped \"something happens soon for the good of the paper and the staff\".</p>",
  "<p>Imagine a future in which you live under an assumed name, scared to get in touch with your parents or any of your relatives. You must conceal your real identity and your history from everyone you meet, possibly including the person you may marry and any children you might have. For the rest of your life you must live a lie, fearing every knock at the door, frightened of your own shadow. This is the fate awaiting Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the boys who killed James Bulger. </p> <p>Yet this awful prospect doesn't move many tabloid newspaper editors to tears. In their twisted scales of justice, compassion is outweighed by circulation. They play to the gallery, to the views of the lowest common denominator. Their arguments, often defying logic, reveal them as mob orators leading a hue and cry demanding lynch law. </p> <p>\"The idea that the two boys - now almost men - could soon be free will horrify every parent,\" says the Sun, before asking: \"Where is the justice for James's parents?\" Then, in a scandalous aside after noting that the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, had remarked that the boys were \"making progress\", the Sun said: \"Who cares? After what they did, the idea that they will be corrupted if they aren't freed is laughable.\" </p> <p>In other words, the paper believes that the boys who committed a foul murder aged 10, and who eight years later have shown extreme remorse for their crime and no propensity to violence ever since, should go to an adult jail. It doesn't matter what happens to them there. The Sun doesn't care. Let them suffer. The Sunday People, showing a similar disregard for the concept of redemption, took the same line. It claimed that an adult prison didn't do any harm to Mary Bell, who committed murder aged 11, and since her release has \"built a useful and honest life\". </p> <p>That is no comparison. First, the Bell case happened more than 30 years ago and in this more enlightened era - enlightened, of course, despite the tabloids' dis-regard for acts of redemption - the authorities might well have taken a different course. Second, prisons for women are infinitely more humane than those for men. </p> <p>People columnist, and former Tory minister, David Mellor, was withering in his condemnation of the judge who thinks the boys deserve to be paroled after serving eight years. For him, clearly, an evil act aged 10 means the person will be evil for ever, and his illiberal rant was redolent of those typical lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key arguments one can hear in any pub. Has Mr Mellor spent too much time in recent years listening to yobs in football grounds? </p> <p> Nastiest of all by far was the threat implied in yesterday's News of the World leading article. Railing against the plan to give the boys anonymity, and the likelihood that it would be an offence for newspapers to reveal their new identities, the paper argued: \"The public has a right to know about them.\" </p> <p>I view that as a prior justification for what the News of the World, and its red-top rivals, might do in future. Citing the \"public interest\", they might well be tempted to defy the law. This would take the naming and shaming campaign to a new level. But it would be just as unacceptable. Does anyone really think that these boys will reoffend after what has happened to them and what they will be forced to remember every minute of their future existence? For a long time to come they are going to be monitored. They are not going to be to live normal lives. In that sense, they face a life sentence. </p> <p>These tabloids, and I excuse the Mirror because its leader showed a full measure of mercy and wisdom, justify their sadism by siding with the bereaved mother, Denise Fergus. No one can have anything other than sympathy for the woman. But the law in a civilised society exists to prevent the victims of crime setting the punishment. In a similar circumstance, I would need protecting from my own outraged response. </p> <p>In my head, I know that to exact a life for a life is neither humane or rational. In my heart, given the pain of bereavement, I might just succumb. I would therefore be grateful for others to make sober decisions not only on my behalf but on society's, taking into account all the circumstances. </p> <p>Why do the Sun, News of the World and Sunday People reject this most basic tenet of justice? Why do they appeal instead to the baser prejudices of their audiences? </p> <p>While I'm sure that the editors and journalists responsible genuinely believe what they write, the real reasoning is altogether more cynical because it is based on commercial realities. Guiding people towards a more benevolent view of the human condition might just threaten sales. It is safer to put the more simplistic viewpoint, to demonise individuals, to reinforce the notion that evil exists independently of society. </p> <p>It is, of course, truly barbaric. The rest of the press, along with the Press Complaints Commission and the authorities, must ensure that these tabloids do not break the law once these boys are released. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>TV fiction is governed by naturalism, we've been taught to believe. But is it? Except in drama made or influenced by Ken Loach and Tony Garnett - This Life, The Cops, The Royle Family - telly characters follow a set of rules as detached from normality as those obeyed by figures in fairy tales. </p> <p>1. Travelling: public transport is only used for life-changing cross-country journeys or (typically with the protagonist on the London Underground, surrounded by unspoken menace) to symbolise urban alienation. For everyday travel, middle-class characters use cars, playing opera or soul tracks from their teens; working class characters use taxis; eccentrics cycle. Ever seen a bus stop in Weatherfield, Emmerdale, Brookside, Walford, or hear anyone talk about catching a bus? Thought not. </p> <p>2. Shopping: big weekly shops in out-of-town supermarkets, long queues, curt exchanges with check- out staff, not recognising a soul there - these joys are unknown to TV characters (unless a psychopathic slayer pursues them to Tesco in a thriller). Instead, they pick up a handful of items - they're never seen lugging three or four plastic bags home, or unloading a bootful of food - at a corner shop or Coronation Street's Freshco, where they chat with the cashier and can rely on bumping into neighbours. As in Big Brother, the rest of their requirements must be delivered overnight by elves. </p> <p>.3 Shagging: normally preceded by a candlelit supper, even if a glance at the window suggests it's mid-afternoon. Beneath the bedclothes, a brand of hands-off condom only available to TV characters pops out of the wrapper magically and sheaths the penis without any need for fumbling. Coitus is followed by a curious coyness: women wrap sheets primly around their upper torso like starlets in a 50s movie, although the only person who might be looking is their lover. Anyone getting up grabs a blanket or duvet as covering, as if sex and central heating were incompatible. </p> <p>4. Eating and drinking: many characters, such as Inspector Morse, exist on a purely fluid diet. This may be wise, as no sit-down meal with three or more present ever takes place without someone storming out or sulking. As for drink, TV characters are rarely seen without a cup or mug - but it's at the wrong angle for drinking, their lips aren't wet and you don't see them swallow. When alcohol is supposedly being drunk, characters are either stone-cold sober or slurring, sentimental, confessional, amorous and about to vomit at any moment, with no transition via slowly growing exuberance and gradual loss of inhibitions. </p> <p>5. Peeing: although soap characters spend every evening necking diuretic fluids in the pub, they never, ever need to spend a penny. In other drama, peeing is allowed - and in Ally McBeal, with its unisex toilet, seems to be necessary roughly every 10 minutes (is providing a water-cooler necessarily a good idea?) - but going to the loo without encountering anyone else is not: women go to Ladies where they mutter about their menfolk as they add more lippy, men to Gents where they exchange manly ban ter, growl at rivals and not infrequently get beaten up. </p> <p>6. Washing: middle-class characters use power-showers, with semi-translucent glass or plastic walls (never fully transparent, or just a tacky curtain); unless they're depressed, in which case they opt for a bath, invariably submerging their head as well as the rest of their body. Working-class characters don't appear to wash themselves at all, although they're occasionally seen bathing their kids or using mutual back-soaping as foreplay. </p> <p>7. Speaking: as the one part of their everyday persona actors are incapable of shedding is their vocal training, characters speak with crystal clarity and stagey projection, rendering much of TV fiction instantly implausible: so domestic comedies, from The Good Life via A Fine Romance to the current My Family, are really about the problems of eating breakfast or sharing a bed with an RSC star, not their nominal themes; cop shows are peopled by booming hams; sitcoms about young flat-sharers are unmistakably about recent Rada graduates. This at least explains why TV characters never mishear each other or need to have anything repeated. </p> <p>8. Watching and listening: except in The Royle Family, television exists for TV people only as a fire-like glow rather than as specific programmes; and soap characters - presumably to avert the dreadful risk of their seeing themselves and so Destroying the Viewer's Illusions - never watch it, preferring to devote all their leisure time to a fantasy version of the old-fashioned communal pub life the telly has largely destroyed. Radio serves only to broadcast pop songs that perfectly sum up characters' moods or dilemmas, or bulletins that contain disturbing news for them - just at the very moment they switch on, by an extraordinary coincidence. </p> <p>9. Phoning: except where the plot requires it, people phoned are instantly available - those called at home are always in, and getting through to those at work never entails voicemail hell or 10 minutes on hold listening to Vivaldi. Calls are made with gesticulations and exaggerated facial reactions a Neapolitan market trader would envy, as if performing to an invisible audience; a trait perhaps more credible since mass use of mobile phones, but also standard in period drama. </p> <p>10. Computing: laptops are always wire-free (but never seem to run out of battery power) and with them the \"shut down\" command must not be used - simply snapping them shut is de rigueur. Like phoning, computing on TV is a surprisingly glitch-free activity, in which users never make errors, computers never crash (unless the plot demands it, as in Attachments), search engines produce perfect results on first go and download time averages two seconds.</p>",
  "Hold the faux filet, the chateaubriand and the tournedos; say \"non\" to the bourguignon, the entrecte and the steak hach\u00e9. The French have lost faith in their beef. <p>This is of course something of a blow to national pride - the rough equivalent, say, of the country that invented the steam locomotive discovering that its railways are marginally less safe than those of Guinea-Bissau. </p> <p>Depending on the area and the shop, according to the press last week, sales of French beef have plummeted by up to 50%. </p> <p>The mad cows are, if you'll pardon the expression, coming home to roost. My butcher in the Rue Cadet may have plastered his display cabinets with certificates of origin and farm-to-fork dockets but the customers are still boycotting his boeuf. </p> <p>Given that the French are still flouting EU law by refusing British beef, this crisis of confidence in the home-grown stuff might be mildly amusing. But since everyone who watches French TV has by now also seen Channel 4's horrifying pictures of young Zoe dying of human variant Creuzfeld-Jakob disease, it isn't. </p> <p>Especially when you know that a French meat trader and his son spent last week in jail accused of knowingly selling a BSE-infected cow to an abattoir. Worse, he is accused of trying to hide the sick animal in a batch of healthy ones, and sold part of the original herd which, under French law, should have been destroyed. The suspect meat, over eight tons of it, ended up in three major national supermarket chains. </p> <p>The French government announced that from now on France would move towards testing for BSE all the 5-6m cattle it slaughters each year. But for the first time, the farm minister, Jean Glavany, admitted he could not actually say how safe French beef was. </p> <p>\"We are dealing with a risk we do not know about, about which scientists know very little,\" he said. \"If you ask me what the danger is, I have to tell you that I do not know. But I can say clearly that no country takes more precautions than France.\" </p> <p>Is that really true? France, certainly, boasts a policy of \"extreme precaution\", developed in the wake of the devastating AIDS-tainted blood scandal of the mid-1980s. That was what prompted it, alone in the EU, to maintain the ban on British beef. </p> <p>It was also the first EU country to embark on a systematic BSE testing programme, aimed at examining some 48,000 cattle thought to have died of BSE or killed by vets. But despite all that, there are some serious doubts about just how \"cautious\" the French have really been. </p> <p>In a country devoted not just to tournedos and tartare but to rti de porc and fricass\u00e9e de poulet too, the all-powerful agricultural lobby, for one, has ensured Paris is not quite as tough as it would like to make out. </p> <p>For example, ground-up cow is still permitted here in fodder for chickens and pigs, despite the fact that French scientists believe most BSE cases in France over the past few years could be attributed to cows eating contaminated pig or chicken feed. </p> <p>This is because chicken and pig farmers have managed to fight off an all-out ban on cow remains in animal feed - a measure that has been in force in Britain since 1996, and the subject, it should be said, of President Chirac's intervention last week - because of the cost. </p> <p>Equally importantly, France has not imposed the 30-month rule applicable in Britain that outlaws the sale for human consumption of beef from cows more than two-and-a-half years old. And only earlier this month, over the furious protests of charcuterie manufacturers, did it finally ban the use of cow intestines in traditional saucisson-making. </p> <p>In the light of last week's British BSE report, the delays, the excuses and the attempts at damage limitation all sound horribly familiar. And the number of BSE cases, which is falling in Britain, is rising here. There may only have been only 160 recorded in France in the past decade, against some 180,000 in Britain, but 80 of those have been detected this year - compared to 30 in 1999 and just 18 in 1998. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, the French could greet with shrugs and Gallic disdain the words of Harriet Kimbell, a BSE adviser to the British government, who said she had advised her family to shun French beef because it was not as safe as British. Now they are wondering. </p> <p>* Napoleon Bonaparte may have put the wind up most of the armies of Europe in his day, but an American musical producer called Francesca Zambello seems to have put the jinx on him. Not only has Ms Zambello's West End show about the diminutive emperor's love life been panned by the London critics, but War and Peace, her new all-singing, all-dancing Paris musical based on Tolstoy's epic about Boney's retreat from Moscow, has so far been unable even to open at the Opera Bastille. A strike by bolshy French stage hands has put paid to the press performances and looks set to threaten the first night, too.</p>",
  "Though no one knows for sure, Afghanistan's long and bitter war may be coming to an end. Not this month, not this year, but perhaps as early as next summer. <p>Over the past four months, the Taliban have made considerable territorial gains at the expense of the opposition Northern Alliance, and now control 95 per cent of the country.</p> <p>Four weeks ago, Taliban forces dealt a major blow to the opposition, led by General Ahmad Shah Masood, when they captured his political capital, Taloqan.</p> <p>Masood has since counter-attacked and recaptured ground to the west of the town. But his empire - also that of Afghanistan's ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani - is shrinking fast.</p> <p>After 20 years of Soviet occupation and civil war, Afghanis may soon find themselves in the novel situation of being at peace. Since sweeping into Kabul in September 1996, the Taliban have almost completed their victory over numerous rival factions.</p> <p>Masood, a Mujaheddin leader who fought against the Russians from his impregnable base in the Panjshir valley, is the only remaining obstacle.</p> <p>Reports suggest he has recently received aid and military equipment from the Russians - his one-time enemies - and Iran. But the territory that he controls is now just one remote north-eastern province, Badakhshan.</p> <p>His problem now is not money but manpower. He has too few fighters left to defeat the Taliban.</p> <p>After a break for the winter, which is bitterly cold in Afghanistan, hostilities are expected to resume in the spring. The Taliban will hope to sever Masood's supply lines and ultimately drive him out of the country for good.</p> <p>Reports suggest that he has already moved much of his equipment to a base across the Afghan border into Tajikistan. But most observers have not written him off quite yet.</p> <p>Masood is a very brave man. He will continue fighting even if he has to seek exile in Tajikistan, Rahimullah Yusafzai, a Pakistani journalist based in Peshawar, said last night.</p> <p>But he conceded that the Taliban were now poised for complete victory.</p> <p>The Taliban have surprised everybody. Nobody thought they would achieve this much, he added.</p> <p>With the fighting now confined to the extreme north east, the Taliban are turning their attention to the outside world and, in particular, their more difficult struggle for international recognition.</p> <p>Faiz Ahmed Faiz, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, yesterday told The Guardian it was an \"unacceptable injustice\" that his government should be denied a UN seat, still occupied by President Rabbini's ousted regime.</p> <p>Only three countries recognise the Taliban - Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>It is likely to be a long time before the Americans join them. They imposed sanctions last year, accusing the Taliban of promoting terrorism, harbouring Osama bin Laden, and being the world's biggest opium exporter.</p> <p>But the regime the west does recognise, as Mr Faiz pointed out, has \"no physical existence\".</p> <p>The problem is the Taliban's refusal to accommodate western sensibilities. Last month, a man accused of carrying out a bomb blast in Kabul, Meya Gul, was publicly hanged from a crane.</p> <p>Mullah Omah, the Taliban's reclusive leader, has recently decreed that women are not allowed to travel in taxis on their own.</p> <p>There have been no executions in Kabul's football stadium for four months, but thieves still routinely have their hands and legs amputated.</p> <p>And, of course, women are forced to wear burqhas, a practice that was prevalent in rural southern Afghanistan before the Taliban seized power but alien to Kabul and its educated elite, most of whom have now fled.</p> <p>Most aid workers in Afghanistan, together with some western diplomats, now accept that the Taliban are here to stay. Sooner or later the west will have to engage with them.</p> <p>The only victims of sanctions are not the Taliban, who are well off, but ordinary Afghans and, in particular, women, who, without work, sit in the streets and beg.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:luke.harding@theguardian.com\">luke.harding@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28luke+harding%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=luke+harding&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Luke Harding</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\" http://www.afghangovernment.org/\" target=\"_new\">Islamic State of Afghanistan</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.taleban.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Taliban website</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.afghan-web.com \" target=\"_new\">Afghanistan Online</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.afghan-web.com/aop/ \" target=\"_new\">Afghan online press</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.afghan-network.net/News/ \" target=\"_new\">Afghan News Channel</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.afghan-ie.com/ \" target=\"_new\">Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.afghan-web.com/www.html \" target=\"_new\">Afghan links</a></p>",
  "The US is ready to break rank with its Nato partners by conceding for the first time that Kosovo can become independent from Serbia. <p>The shift in policy, discussed in secret talks this month between the US special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, and US diplomats in the Balkans, will anger Britain and other Nato members and risks creating a rift with Russia, which retains close ties with Serbia. </p> <p>The change of direction emerged in the Kosovan capital, Pristina, as votes were being counted yesterday in the province's first democratic elections. The three big Kosovan Albanian parties all stood on an independence platform. The Kosovan Serbs almost unanimously boycotted the elections, for local authorities. </p> <p>The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), led by the moderate nationalist Ibrahim Rugova, was sweeping to power throughout the province, according to independent observers. The official results are expected today. </p> <p>Nato and the UN security council have maintained that, in spite of the Nato-led war last year which forced Serbian troops out of the province, Kosovo should remain a sovereign part of Yugoslavia. </p> <p>British officials recently ruled out independence as an option, saying that further fragmentation in the Balkans would increase instability and that a state as small as Kosovo would be unsustainable. </p> <p>Security council resolution 1244, passed in June last year at the end of the war, reaffirmed \"the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\". </p> <p>But a senior US official in Pristina, who spent last week with Mr Holbrooke, has for the first time disputed the widely-held interpretation of the resolution. </p> <p>He said that 1244 \"explicitly recognises the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia but it does not mean Kosovo cannot be independent\". </p> <p>US government lawyers spent the past few weeks looking at the resolution in detail and they concluded that it did not rule out independence. </p> <p>The US source agreed that independence was fast becoming a reality on the ground because almost half the Kosovan Serbs had left the province and the Kosovo Albanians were setting up their own judicial and political system. </p> <p>Acknowledging that few Kosovo Albanians were prepared to consider even a loose federation with Belgrade, he said: \"Kosovo will not be pushed back into Serbia.\" </p> <p>The US is unlikely to go public on its policy switch in the near future in case it undermines Yugoslavia's new democratically elected president, Vojislav Kostunica. </p> <p>The loss of Kosovo, which is an important historical symbol for Serbia, would inflame Serbian nationalist hardliners. </p> <p>The US source ruled out partitioning the province between the northern part, predominantly populated by Serbs, which would join Serbia while the rest of the country, mainly Kosovo Albanians, would enter into a Greater Albania. </p> <p>He hoped the Kosovo Serbs and Albanians could reach an accommodation. \"They will never be friends sitting around the campfire singing Kumbaya... but they will learn to live with one another.\" </p> <p>The elections held in Kosovo on Saturday were for control of the province's 30 municipalities, but the Kosovo Albanians treated them as a referendum on independence. The main contenders were Mr Rugova's LDK and the Democratic Party of Kosovo, led by Hashim Thaci, a nationalist hardliner and former commander of the Kosovan Liberation Army, which fought a guerrilla campaign against the Yugoslav army. </p> <p>Mr Thaci wants Kosovo to become independent from Serbia as soon as possible and join Albania. Mr Rugova also wants independence but at a more cautious pace and for Kosovo to be a state in its own right, free of both Serbia and Albania.</p>",
  "Instant paralysis has struck the government on how to handle the railway crisis. The situation will get much worse than the scenes of chaos which thousands of passengers witnessed yesterday as they struggled to get home after the weekend break. <p>The cabinet has overruled a fuming deputy prime minister, John Prescott, saying that Railtrack must be given one more chance before it decides to act. Officially, it has no powers to run the company but it could and almost certainly will, force out Railtrack's chief executive, Gerald Corbett, and the entire board if public confidence in the industry continues to evaporate. </p> <p>The prime minister seems to have no idea how to proceed. He called in Mr Corbett last week, not to give him a dressing down, but to insist that Railtrack runs the trains, while making sure that the operation is safe. But these aims are not necessarily compatible. A smoothly oiled public relations exercise by Railtrack's advisors, relying somewhat sickeningly on the goodwill of the Paddington rail victims, has kept Mr Corbett afloat. It has also allowed him to slag off the rail regulator, Tom Winsor at every opportunity despite the fact that Railtrack has just been promised \u00a315bn from the taxpayer and the fares box over the next five years. British Rail was getting a paltry \u00a31bn a year from the Treasury in 1995, when Railtrack took over, and reckoned to be running a safe system. </p> <p>Railtrack may be a private company, but ministers say that Mr Corbett can only be at the helm for the short-term until Railtrack sorts out its problems. They say that having run the company for the past five years, he at least has some understanding of the industry and should be entrusted to carry through drastic changes, the most pressing being safety and the company's attitude towards its contractors. </p> <p>British Rail was certainly no shining example of progressive management, but at least it had a proper career structure and chain of command. At Railtrack that does not exist. Mr Corbett has not been grooming a successor. His latest recruit to run Railtrack's operations is the former head of Yorkshire Water, which has an unfortunate history of bad management and service to the public. </p> <p>When the government emerges from its shell-shocked state, it will begin to see that the industry cannot remain untouched. The rail regulator has the power to deal with Railtrack's shortcomings. If Mr Winsor believes that the company is failing to meet performance targets and running the industry ineffectively, he could threaten to revoke its licence. The final decision would rest with the government, which in this situation could read the riot act. </p> <p>Mr Prescott could hand over its business to another company or split up Railtrack's signalling, rail track and stations operation and offer it to several companies, or it could take the extraordinary step of taking it back into public ownership. Industry sources were last night arguing that this may be the only way out of the mess. </p> <p>In spite of the horrors first of Southall, then Paddington and now Hatfield, safety is the one issue where some progress is being belatedly made. Mr Prescott has been a champion of an independent railway safety authority for the past two years and by next spring his dreams will probably be realised. Lord Cullen's exhaustive inquiry into Paddington is expected to propose the establishment of a national body, spelling the end of the inadequate Railway Inspectorate - understaffed and in some respects too close to the industry for comfort. Railtrack's power to investigate its own accidents will be finally outlawed. </p> <p>The privatised monopoly has no proper supervision of what work is being done, and relies far too heavily on the say-so of individual companies on individual projects. Its senior managers remain largely ignorant of what is done on the ground in the name of safety. </p> <p>Compare this with the UK's only other large railway, the London Underground. The LU has many faults - clapped out lifts, erratic signalling and unreliable rolling stock - but its performance is relatively good. The chain of command between management and contractors is direct, track faults and repairs have to be rectified between 1am and 5am with immediate checks by LU before the system can be passed as safe. Railtrack should adopt this approach, even though it would clearly add to costs. </p> <p>The government's paralysis is in some part due to the fact that more than three years after the election, it has still failed to get its transport legislation through parliament. A month before the Queen's Speech it may at best be able to launch its successor to BR, the Strategic Rail Authority, which has so far failed to produce even a strategy for a blinkered industry. The rail system requires a scalpel and some common sense. It needs to be more efficiently regulated. The roles of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority and the rail regulator often overlap. They could be combined. </p> <p>Lord Cullen could provide the remedy. But the disgraceful state of the industry is an example of the government's timidity to act when it had the chance. A \u00a315bn lifesaver is commendable, but it had better not be taxpayers' money poured down the drain. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: keith.harper@theguardian.com\">keith.harper@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Britain is to send 500 commandos and a naval task force to Sierra Leone for the second time this year, the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, is expected to tell MPs today. <p>The navy's amphibious ready group - consisting of the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, with 42 Royal Marine Commando on board, the landing ship HMS Fearless, and four support ships - is expected to reach Sierra Leone in 11 days. </p> <p>The group has been on training exercises in the eastern Mediterranean and is picking up supplies in Turkey before heading for the west African country, where the government and an uneasy assemblage of forces making up the army are under challenge by the Revolutionary United Front. Behind years of conflict is the drive to control the country's diamond wealth. </p> <p>The task force is likely to stay on board and may not disembark unless the situation deteriorates. </p> <p>Defence sources said yesterday that the move was designed to demonstrate \"Britain's ability to deploy its rapid reaction capability\". And they insisted that the security situation in Sierra Leone was \"not falling apart\". </p> <p>But the decision - following a visit to Freetown last week by General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff - comes amid growing concern about the ability of president Ahmed Kabbah's government to face up to the RUF rebels. </p> <p>There are also doubts about the UN's commitment to maintaining a peacekeeping force in the country. India, Jordan and Egypt, which have provided the bulk of the current UN force in Sierra Leone, all say they will withdraw thousands of their troops. </p> <p>A document leaked from UN headquarters in New York last week said the force was \"in serious danger of collapse\" unless Britain provided troops for \"operational and tactical-level work.\" Mr Hoon announced earlier this month that the number of British troops training Sierra Leone's army was being increased to about 400 from about 200. </p> <p>A senior British officer is also being sent to Freetown with his own brigade headquarters effectively setting up a parallel British command structure in the former colony. </p> <p>Ministry of defence sources insist British troops will not be involved in combat and will not join the UN peacekeeping force. </p> <p>Yet the imminent rundown of the 13,000-strong UN force will put new pressure on Britain to step up its open-ended commitment to Sierra Leone. </p> <p>The presence of the naval task force off the country's coast - presumably for a strictly limited period - may help to boost the morale of the Kabbah government, but it will not help the security situation on the ground. </p> <p>Iain Duncan-Smith, the Conservatives' shadow defence secretary, warned at the weekend that the government was risking \"dragging our military deeper and deeper into the mess and muddle of Sierra Leone\". He singled out the foreign secretary for blame: \"Again our servicemen and women are paying the price of Robin Cook's failed foreign policy in Sierra Leone. His policies in Sierra Leone change from day to day but our armed forces involvement increases week to week.\" </p> <p>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said British troops should be assigned to the UN. </p> <p>Earlier this year, in May, Britain rushed marines and paratroopers to Sierra Leone after RUF rebels captured 500 UN peacekeepers and headed towards the capital Freetown. Many ordinary people were sad and upset when they left. </p> <p>In September, British troops, including SAS soldiers, rescued soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment held by the West Side Boys, a disorganised militia that he been thought friendly to the government. One soldier was killed in the rescue mission.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's blood services rely on good citizenship and an altruistic desire to help others in need, coupled, of course, with the attraction to donors of free tea and biscuits. </p> <p>About 2m people a year donate blood, some more than once, but demand is inexorably rising as once impossible surgical procedures become practical and there is a drive to cut waiting lists for non-urgent surgery. </p> <p>Demography is also having its effect. There are fewer young people to donate blood and more older people needing it. </p> <p>In addition, there are periodic concerns about safety. In the 1980s haemophiliacs contracted HIV and other patients were infected with hepatitis C from donated blood. </p> <p>More recently there have been fears that the agent responsible for causing variant CJD, the human form of BSE, can theoretically be transmitted through blood donations. </p> <p>This has meant that all donated blood is now leucodepleted - the white cells thought most likely to carry the infection are filtered out - while plasma-derived products are imported from the US. These are mainly used as coagulation factors for haemophiliacs, albumin to maintain blood volume and immunoglobulins to treat immune deficiencies. </p> <p>But many thousands of people a year are still given fresh frozen plasma from British donors to clot the blood of victims of trauma or those involved in long, complicated operations needing large transfusions. </p> <p>In the past few months research has indicated that sheep can transfer a BSE-like disease to another sheep through blood transfusion, long before displaying outward signs of the disease. That has made everyone think again. </p> <p>Scientists on the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee have recommended tests, again using sheep, to check whether leucodepletion eliminates the risk of transmission of vCJD through transfusions or simply reduces it. </p> <p>There is also increasing scientific evidence that mice showing clinical signs of BSE carry low levels of infectivity in their blood plasma. </p> <p>It would have further damaging consequences for confidence in human blood safety if it was shown that the plasma was infective before those outward signs of the disease were displayed. </p> <p>This nervousness has prompted new debate within the medical profession and among government advisers as to whether the public should be made far more aware of opportunities either to store their own blood in the weeks leading up to operations or to have their blood effectively recycled during the operations. </p> <p>Encouraging more use of such techniques would ensure that donated blood could be saved for those patients who had no alternative. </p> <p>NHS trusts were told in a Department of Health circular two years ago to explore whether they could do more in this direction but the suspicion is that little has changed. Few patients are actively encouraged to \"pre-deposit\" their own blood despite a lower risk of infection. Many orthopaedic patients particularly might benefit. </p> <p>But it can be difficult for patients to travel to centres to donate their own blood, the blood has to be separately labelled and stored and it will not keep long, so there is a problem if operations are cancelled. </p> <p>The blood is wasted if that happens since it cannot be added to the general \"donated\" pool. </p> <p>In the US it thought that about 5% of blood used in operations comes from this source. </p> <p>Another technique involves removing up to three pints of blood from patients just before operations and replacing it with biological fluids. If the patient bleeds the blood can be then replaced during the operation. </p> <p>This system is being re-evaluated. It makes operations longer and is unsuitable for patients with some conditions. </p> <p>The third option, called perioperative cell salvage (PCS), has more backing within the health service. This involves using machinery that gathers blood lost during surgery, washing and processing the red cells and delivering for transfusion back into the patient. </p> <p>The system was developed three decades ago as heart surgery, particularly in the US, expanded and made huge demands on blood supplies. Enthusiasts argue that it is also of significant benefit in major vasculary, orthopaedic and genito-urinary operations. In major operations where patients bleed profusely it can also help stretch supplies of donated blood. </p> <p>It now promises economic benefits too. Leucodepletion has vastly increased the cost of donated blood so that hiring the equipment for PCS is now attractive. </p> <p>In some places Jehovah's Witnesses have paid for it because of their religious objections to other forms of transfusion. Yet the guess is that only about 10% of the major hospitals in Britain are using the technique to any significant extent and that all three so-called autologous techniques probably account for under 2% of blood use in this country. An official review is about to be conducted. </p> <p>Supporters of PCS believe use could increase 10-fold if inertia in hospital and transfusion services could be overcome. Some argue that other moves should take precedence, including cutting the use of all blood in operations first. </p> <p>They point out that though mistakes and accidents in blood transfusions are few, too many are avoidable. About 250 incidents were reported in 1998-99, more than half involving \"wrong blood\". They fear that too much publicity for the recycling options will only further undermine public confidence in the safety of blood, causing a spiral of further problems.</p>",
  "Even since publication of the BSE inquiry report just four days ago, events have moved on. The youngest victim of vCJD, the human form of BSE, 14-year-old Zoe Jeffries, died on Saturday. The oldest, a 74-year-old unnamed man, was confirmed as a vCJD victim on Friday. Until now, the age span of victims has been between 15 and 54. As our health correspondent, James Meikle, noted on Saturday, the death of the old man would seem to support the conclusion of Lord Phillips, chairman of the inquiry, that the BSE infection of the national herd began in the 1970s, not the 1980s. If so, do scientists have to think again about the potential risk to human health? Just how exposed were people who ate infected meat in the 1970s, long before any control measures to combat BSE, were introduced? Does the death of Zoe Jeffries, who became a victim aged 12, mean contaminated meat was getting into the human food chain, despite the controls that were applied in 1989? <p>Reassessment will follow both deaths but particularly the older victim's. Even before Zoe's death, there were worrying signs that BSE was entering the human food chain after the 1989 controls were put in place. The Phillips report pointed to three dangers: the delay in banning the mechanically recovered meat process until 1995; the failure to enforce new safety procedures in slaughterhouses until 1995; and cross contamination of feed, both at the factory where beef offal was allowed in pig and poultry feeds, and at the farm. Other reassessments are being made on the use of beef sources in the 1970s for some vaccines and cosmetics. </p> <p>What is Joe Public to make of all these reviews? Here is an opportunity for the health and agriculture secretaries, plus even more importantly their officials, to demonstrate that a new era has begun. Whatever happens to the freedom of information bill in parliament, let them signal that the secrecy and false messages with which Whitehall attempted to sedate the British public for most of this epidemic, are over. From now on, let the public be treated both openly and honestly. As Phillips noted, only in this way can public confidence begin to be restored in government warnings. If ministers, or chief medical officers, don't know, let them say so. Let paragraph 1301 be reproduced and placed above Whitehall desks: \"We believe that food scares and vaccine scares thrive on a belief that the government is withholding information. If doubts are openly expressed and publicly explored, the public are capable of responding rationally.\" </p> <p>There are three fronts on which ministers should move quickly. First on risk assessments. These range from a few hundred projected deaths from vCJD to 136,000. The specialists should not be blamed for such a wide variation, there are so many unknowns. Some earlier estimates, when links between BSE and vCJD were first established, talked of millions. What is needed is an update, in light of Phillips, of the latest estimate on risk. By all means put them in perspective, so the public are better able to gauge them. Second, contingency planning: Phillips found it was far from adequate. Some are now proceeding (see today's story on new blood procedures in surgery). But what plans have health and social services drawn up in case vCJD deaths reach the projected death a day? They have averaged 10 a year in the last five, but already reached 25 this year. Third, reassessments by scientists: precisely what is being reassessed, by whom and when will they be ready? Ministers must guarantee publication, no matter how inconvenient or embarrassing the results.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "Terrific news from the Archbishop of Canterbury: we have become a society of atheists. In a startlingly pessimistic analysis of the role of the church in contemporary Britain, Dr George Carey admits that \"a tacit atheism prevails\" and that people have stopped believing in life after death. Not that he is throwing in the towel; Dr Carey has also appealed to Anglicans to redouble their efforts and reach out to unbelievers. But his sermon, delivered at St German's Cathedral on the Isle of Man at the end of last week, contained a dramatic acknowledgment that a majority of the population no longer accepts the central tenets of Christianity. <p>This shift has, in terms of church attendance at least, been apparent for some time. In a population of 60m, the number of people who turn up at Anglican services on Sundays has dropped below one million. Other religions are doing better, but we have certainly moved, in the course of a century, from being a Christian society to one that is much more diverse in its beliefs. This is in my view a very good thing, although I am not sure that Dr Carey is accurate in diagnosing a surge in atheism. I am dismayed by how often people express views that resemble deism or even animism, suggesting disillusionment with traditional forms of worship as much as the notion of a supreme being. </p> <p>The Anglican establishment might well conclude that this is almost as bad as straightforward unbelief, and from a self-interested point of view it would be right. The church's authority has been undermined, perhaps terminally so, with its traditional teachings on sex and marriage widely disregarded. Few of us believe that fornication, as it was once quaintly called, will lead to the torments of hell, no matter how often Dr Carey insists that lifelong heterosexual monogamy is the only acceptable expression of adult sexuality. </p> <p>But his critique of contemporary society goes further. The idea that death is the end of life is \"bleak\", he suggested last week, and results in a narrowing-down of human aspiration. </p> <p>\"If we need hope to clutch to our breast at all it will be in such greatly scaled down forms, such as our longings for family happiness, the next holiday or personal fulfilment.\" If human beings have nothing to strive for or fear in another life, so the argument runs, they will necessarily be diminished in this one. </p> <p>At its most reductive, the question that is being asked here is why anyone would bother to be altruistic if individual extinction is very nearly certain. Why not just blow your savings on a new car or taking your family to the Bahamas, and let the poor shift for themselves? There are several fallacies here, all of them in need of urgent deconstruction before the archbishop's conflation of godlessness and immorality is seized upon and exaggerated into a full-scale moral panic. (That process has already started, by the way. \"Archbishop warns of loss of morality\" was the front-page claim in Saturday's Daily Telegraph.) </p> <p>One fallacy is the notion that religious convictions are the sine qua non of leading a moral existence. Of course it depends how you define morality, and there is no doubt that, according to the church's traditional teaching, many of us are leading flagrantly immoral lives: we enthusiastically (and according to taste) indulge in sex before and after marriage, serial monogamy and so on. </p> <p> But that is because we have seen through one of the great con tricks of religion, which is an unhealthy obsession with the regulation of private life. This can lead, in its most extreme form, to a situation in which a vegetarian who works for Aids charities can be characterised as immoral, solely because he has sex with other men. </p> <p>We have, for the most part, outgrown such infantile attitudes in this country. It has also become apparent that, far from having a monopoly on goodness, Christians are no more likely than atheists to behave well to their fellow human beings. On the contrary, the Roman Catholic church had a deplorable record of colluding with fascism throughout the 20th century, from the congratulations it bestowed on General Franco after the Spanish civil war, to its recent efforts on behalf of General Pinochet. Hitler was not a Catholic but the wartime pontiff, Pius XII, was happy enough to come to an arrangement with him and steer clear of potential embarrassments like denouncing the Holocaust. </p> <p>It is perfectly clear that you can be committed to equality and justice without being told to subscribe to them by a higher authority. The movement towards establishing universal human rights, in the form of international conventions and domestic law, is being driven as much by atheists and agnostics as believers. On the contrary, if you are not distracted by the prospect of an afterlife, it is all the more important to change the society we live in now and that we will hand on to future generations. </p> <p>Some of the world's most inspiring thinkers, such as the poet Shelley, were atheists long before it was safe to declare themselves so. Lord Byron, stopping in 1816 at an inn in Switzerland where Shelley had stayed, was dismayed to discover that his friend had inscribed the word \"atheist\" in Greek after his name in the register. Byron swiftly crossed it out but Shelley made a habit of the declaration and was subsequently denounced by other English tourists, including the devout (and inferior) poet Robert Southey. </p> <p>Perhaps the most revealing aspect of Dr Carey's sermon, however, was his contention that people who used to seek help from their parish priest when depressed are now more likely to ask their GP for pills. They are behaving, he said, \"as if doctors can cure all ills and even postpone death forever\". That postponing death is a reasonable ambition seems obvious, whether or not you believe in an after-life; far from hurrying to meet her maker, even Mother Teresa flew to Los Angeles in her later years for state-of-the-art medical treatment. </p> <p>But the archbishop's remarks are a timely reminder of the function of religion, in pre-Darwinian societies, as a means of mediating the terror of death. In that sense, believing in God was not so much altruistic as consolatory, and the bishops' quid pro quo was the power they gained over their congregation. Indeed Dr Carey's sermon last week may have been franker than he realised, acknowledging not just the loss of that power but the poverty of the church's contemporary vision. Clerics may disapprove of Prozac, but fairy stories are all they have to offer as an antidote to the human condition. </p> <p> Madeleine Bunting is away</p>",
  "Eight days left; a near dead heat in the polls; excitement and apprehension rise. What hangs on Bush? What swings with Gore? Time to calm down, even hose down. So I went to see the supreme guru of measured analysis for an extra helping of laid-back wisdom. Professor Seymour Martin Lipset, in London for a lecture tonight, has been America's best, most prolific political scientist for four decades now. He has watched all the presidents of that time come and go - but, more important, he has watched the changes in his country, too. He is in no sense cynical or battle-worn, but he is relaxed. <p>Is George Dubya a raving right-winger? Nah! He's a \"right centrist\"; just like Al Gore is a \"left centrist\". Both naturally congregate in the middle. Bush started off in the familiar out-of-town way, attacking Congress and Washington, but then McCain cropped up and he had to veer for a while to the right of his party. Now he has tacked back to where he started from. Gore, in parallel, had to see off Nader before turning turtle. </p> <p>Remember what Nixon told Bob Dole. \"You head right to get the nomination; you head left the moment you've got it.\" Remember that Ronnie Reagan's California was the first state to pass a pro-abortion bill and that Ron spent his time in the sun trawling round anti-abortion meetings making mood music but never doing a damned thing. \"Remember, except for foreign policy, that the president is weak. Clinton hasn't got his last budget yet.\" </p> <p>You can talk about what you intend to do. Doing it in office is wholly different - and the talkers and the promisers know that, just as the voters do. Look at the way Capitol Hill inevitably operates, seldom giving any one party control of the White House, the Senate and the Congress. No accident, because different constituencies. Choosing a president is one thing; choosing a senator to represent the broad swath of opinion in his state is another; choosing a congressman with a far narrower, more defined and partisan constituency is still another. There is an almost automatic balance. Maybe, just maybe, the Republicans will take all three this time, but if they do it will be by such a narrow margin that the soft blur of party lines - especially in the Senate - will leave scant room for manoeuvre anyway. </p> <p>And foreign policy? Lipset knows Condaleeza Rice, the likely national security adviser, well. A strong, bright lady. He knows Colin Powell, the likely secretary of state, and the other prospective aides clustering at his side. He is unalarmed. They are capable people. Whatever else Bush may or may not be, he looks like a good chooser. </p> <p>If you are as mellow as Lipset, you see awful (alleged) threats in a kindlier light. Whatever happened to the (1980s) threat of \"a natural Republican majority\"? Education happened. The Republicans still have an armlock on the deep South - except where the Democrats work to a strict black agenda - but their Golden West isn't so golden any longer. Folks got richer and thus they became more educated. Funny thing! That doesn't help the Republicans one jot. The more you know - in the broadest terms - the likelier you are to vote Democrat. And the awful threat of a swelling Hispanic population, the death of America as a homogeneous, English-speaking nation? Another defunct spectre. </p> <p>\"There isn't a Hispanic race. There are Argentines and Guatemalans and Spanish and Mexicans. They come from different countries - and they are different. I'm told Texan Mexicans and California Mexicans are different. But what happens to them all? They arrive, some of them prosper, and they become Americans who want to speak English, must speak English, because not being able to marks them out as second class.\" Natural, unafraid integration. </p> <p>Anyway, immigration is the key. \"I went to lecture in Japan a few years ago, when the Japanese miracle was going full speed, and I got annoyed. America, I told them, is an open society - and where would you be if we didn't buy your cars? Every society goes soft in the end and we've got the answer to that. We let in hungry people. I have no fear of you. Our Asians will beat you in the end.\" </p> <p>The temptation, as he rattles along, is to think him complacent. This is a temptation to resist. Lipset is a shrewd observer of what really comes to pass and what may happen next once the headlines have faded. He is absorbed not just by the activists of politics, but by the millions in the middle who, frankly, aren't that interested. Voter turnout heads down. Some 30m watched the recent televised debates, as opposed to 90m when they first started. </p> <p> But is that necessarily bad - or just that the missing ones don't think it makes much difference who wins, who holds the centre? If they think that, they may not be all wrong. But watch, with satisfaction, Pat Buchanan and the cracked shell of the Perot party disappear below 1% on the polls. Apathy can be the enemy of extremism. Because folk don't care this time, though, doesn't mean that they won't care next time if there is an issue they see clutching them by the throat. \"This is not an angry country, whatever the commentators say. Some have strong views, maybe strong religious views. But they're not angry now.\" </p> <p>The virtue of the political scientist lies in setting a broader context and noticing what happens offstage. Has American \"exceptionalism\" - the totality of factors that set it apart, and the theme of one of Lipset's most lauded books - changed in the last five years? Yes: and he offers an example from his time at Stanford University in the Palo Alto shadow of Silicon Valley. Call it the explosion of young wealth. </p> <p>Look at house prices in Palo Alto. Almost everyone who lives there is a millionaire; indeed, has to be to live there. \"I went to a cocktail party and there were 13 billionaires in the room.\" He has a daughter who works as a psychiatric social worker in the city and some of her patients have a recurring question for her. \"What am I going to do with my money?\" Maybe lose it; maybe pour it into the universities and charitable foundations, maybe build new palaces in Newport, Rhode Island, to dwarf the palaces that America's industrial rich built in the 1890s. </p> <p>At any rate, what's exceptional about the American future \"is a bigger, wealthier class\". It alters the balances; it chips away at the accustomed order of things. \"Elites, you know, are very anxious what people think of them. They want to be thought well of and they're anxious to help that process.\" </p> <p>A new era of philanthropy? Perhaps. But probably a new era of exceptionalism which leaves Europe and \"post- feudal\" Britain behind. Lipset's legacy: don't get mad, get reflective and get informed. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Lord Phillips, the new Master of the Rolls, may have produced an admirable report on the BSE scandal, but that doesn't mean he should have been asked to do the inquiry. It has occupied him for two years, during which time he hasn't been able to do a lot of judging. Even more strikingly, the law lord Lord Saville, for the past year and a half, has been preparing and is now chairing the Bloody Sunday inquiry in Derry. <p>It's expected to occupy him for another two years, during which time his talents will be almost entirely lost to his main job, judging in the House of Lords. What's the point of having excellent judges if they're taken away to do something else? The reason why Phillips and Saville were chosen was because they are so good; but that's also the reason they're needed in the courts. And it's no answer to say that top judges have always conducted important inquiries. Even if this is true, until relatively recently such inquiries took only weeks or months. Many are now taking years. The law cannot spare its best people for that long. </p> <p>\"T he one overriding mitigating feature of the offence is the age of the two boys when the crime was committed,\" said Lord Woolf when reaching his wise and courageous decision on the killers of James Bulger. It was not the occasion for him to comment on the way the two children were dealt with by the legal system, but it should not be forgotten that, according to the European court of human rights, they did not receive a \"fair trial\" under the human rights convention. They clearly did not understand the proceedings in the way that accused persons have the right to expect. </p> <p>Part of their confusion was due to the formalities of the trial itself. The authorities are taking steps to make it less formal and more comprehensible to children charged with serious crimes. But the question remains: is it right that children of that age - however horrific their alleged crime- should be subjected to what would still be a trial in open court, albeit with concessions to their age? The biggest fallacy is that 10-year-olds have perceptions of right and wrong, and an understanding of the consequences of their actions, that approximate to an adult's, thus rendering them liable to a similar legal process. Venables and Thompson may realise now the enormity of what they did nearly eight years ago; they certainly did not at the time. It seems that more, and younger, children are committing grave crimes. We need to look seriously at how the system is going to deal with them in future. </p> <p>They've had them in America, of course, but I believe that Vive magazine is the first in Britain to be aimed at people who have split up or are about to split up. If it's happy-coupledom or staying together you want to read about, this is not the magazine for you. It's rather jolly, with lots of pictures of celebs who have broken up, and, for the sake of balance, a few snaps of couples who are still together (the implication, no doubt, being that it's only a matter of time before they too will join the mag's readership). But Vive also offers a strong line in legal advice for splitters, and I was delighted to see it fulminating against the wrong and dangerous use of the term common-law wife. </p> <p>I've been going on for years at the media for using it as a convenient description of a woman in an unmarried relationship. It's not just a pedantic objection. The fact is that the constant use of \"common-law wife\" has led to a general belief that a woman living with her man for a certain number of years (three and seven are often quoted) has legal rights approximating to those of a wife. The distress of women who find out, when their relationship breaks up, that they may have no financial or legal rights is something most family lawyers have seen all too often. The consequences of their ignorance can last a lifetime. If Vive magazine can help dispel the myth of the common-law wife, I will forgive it the cheesy cover shot of Vanessa Feltz.</p>",
  "Jo Evans was furious when Robin Peverett, the prep school headmaster who had indecently assaulted her on a regular basis at school, walked free with an 18-month suspended sentence. \"It wasn't until we got home that it hit us: Peverett was free. This wasn't supposed to happen. Then I was angry. I felt such rage.\" <p>Welcome to the murky world of the plea bargain. Though she didn't know it then, defence and prosecution lawyers had done a deal with the cooperation of the judge. Peverett would plead guilty to nine charges involving seven pupils aged 10 to 13 from 1969 to 1977, but only if he could be sure of escaping prison. And his plea was on the basis that he merely made circles with his hands on his pupils' buttocks or tapped them there - to exert power over them rather than for sexual gratification. </p> <p>Evans and the other former pupils who came forward to accuse the 67-year-old former head of Dulwich College prep school were stunned at the outcome, particularly since the judge had told Peverett that he was guilty of \"an appalling abuse of a position of trust\". They were expecting a four- or five-year prison sentence. But they learned the truth about the shadowy deal only when the attorney general, who also thought the sentence was too light, decided to take the case to the appeal court. Ten days ago Evans and five other victims were in court to hear three senior judges throw it out. Peverett, holder of an OBE, had eluded the final bid to lock him up. </p> <p>Lord Justice Rose called the carve-up that let Peverett go free \"lamentable\". He pointed out that the appeal court had often warned against discussions between judge and counsel about pleas and sentences. \"The public are likely to be affronted by that sort of process and this case graphically illustrates the distress and dissatisfaction that can accrue to defendant and victim,\" he said. </p> <p>But since the crown, in the shape of the Crown Prosecution Service, had made representations to Peverett on which he had relied in pleading guilty, the crown, in the shape of the attorney general - who is, after all, the minister responsible for the CPS - could not be allowed to go back on the deal. Peverett had not been warned, when he agreed to plead guilty, that the appeal court could later impose a prison sentence if the attorney general thought the original sentence \"unduly lenient\". </p> <p>The attorney general, Lord Williams, has promised guidance next month banning discussions with judges about pleas or sentences in all but exceptional cases. He said: \"The public have the view 'What is going on behind the back door? Would such a bargain be available to someone of a different background?'\" Exceptional cases would have to be truly exceptional - for example, where a defendant was dying of cancer but it was felt he should not be told of his prognosis. </p> <p>But will the guidance stop plea bargaining? The appeal court laid down similar guidelines in strong terms as long ago as 1970, in a case called R v Turner. The court told judges that they must not say they would impose one sentence in response to a guilty plea and a more severe sentence for a plea of not guilty, because that put the defendant under undue pressure to plead guilty. But it is clear from a string of cases since then that this shadowy practice still goes on. </p> <p>This month at the bar conference, barristers were asked how many had in the past year gone to see judges in their rooms \"for an indication on sentence\". A sea of hands shot up. Around one in three barristers present had taken part in a plea bargain. </p> <p>The practice persists because, whatever the court of appeal thinks, barristers and judges at the coal face like it. A crown court survey for the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in 1993 found that nearly 90% of barristers and two out of three circuit judges favoured \"full and realistic discussion between counsel and judge about plea and especially sentence\". </p> <p>And while the attorney general wants to outlaw the practice, Lord Justice Auld, the appeal court judge whose review of the criminal courts is due in December, has asked consultees whether, \"to encourage proper pleas of guilty and having regard to the victim's and the public interest\", there should be a clearly defined and formal system of plea bargaining. </p> <p>The Criminal Bar Association supports the idea of such a system, with the defendant, excluded under the current informal system, present for all discussions and the judge stating in court in advance what the alternative sentences would be after a trial, and after a guilty plea. Douglas Day QC, a member of the CBA and part-time judge, says: \"It's worth exploring. The problem at present is that it's not transparent. Everyone walks into the back of the court in a furtive way and the defendant is not involved. It's like the boys getting together in the back room.\" </p> <p>The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice also favoured a formal system, renamed \"sentence canvass\" to distance it from the shady image of plea bargaining. In the presence of prosecution counsel in the judge's chambers, defence counsel could ask the judge one question: \"What would be the maximum sentence if my client were to plead guilty at this stage?\" </p> <p>Day points out: \"The best legal advice can only be given when all the relevant facts are known. In a criminal trial the sentence of the court is generally the most relevant fact to the defendant. A fully transparent system which involves the defendant at every stage would not be unfair.\" </p> <p>Michael Zander, emeritus professor of law at LSE, who was a member of the royal commission and carried out its crown court survey, thinks a plea-bargaining system is \"inevitable\". He says: \"Everyone benefits. The defendant benefits in getting a reduced sentence, the prosecution benefits in getting a conviction and a reasonable sentence, the system benefits in securing a guilty plea without the cost of a trial, and witnesses are spared having to give evidence. </p> <p>\"But everything depends on the judge supervising it. Providing the judge is watching out for inappropriate deals, it serves everyone's interests.\" He concedes there is pressure on defendants to plead guilty but feels this is inevitable if a guilty plea is to be rewarded with a sentence discount. </p> <p>In the crown court survey it initially appeared that there were a number of cases where innocent defendants had pleaded guilty to get a lighter sentence. \"But when these were investigated, it turned out there were hardly any. I don't think it's a major risk, but there is a risk. To pretend there isn't pressure in the system is nonsense.\" </p> <p>The royal commission's recommendation for a formal, open plea-bargaining system \"went down like a lead balloon\" with the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, recalls Zander. \"Peter Taylor said, 'Absolutely not.' The court of appeal views the case at a distance. They get the cases where it's gone wrong. The judges in the crown court are anxious to dispose of cases efficiently and may therefore be willing to have such discussions more often than the appeal judges would like.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a few days' time two things will happen that could reshape the global economy. The United States will elect a new president amid blanket media coverage. And, very quietly in New York, a door will close on the chance to influence the best kept secret in global economic governance - the United Nations-led finance for development process. </p> <p>The campaign that took Bill Clinton to the White House had as its slogan, \"it's the economy, stupid\". It answered the unspoken question: \"what's the big issue?\" If the question were now asked about globalisation, the reply would be: \"it's democracy, stupid\". </p> <p>Two thirds of the world's countries lack democratic control over their economies. In an age when financial institutions proclaim transparency, a simple comprehensive list of countries that are subject to hugely influential agreements with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund is not readily available, even to many of the bank's own staff. </p> <p>But why does it matter? The poet Dante said that, of all the hidden truths, the \"most useful and most unknown\" was knowledge of temporal world governance. </p> <p>If you tried to buy votes in a national election there would be allegations and court cases. At the international financial institutions, buying votes has been considered a virtue since Harry Dexter White of the US treasury department said at the founding of the World Bank and IMF, \"the more money you put in, the more votes you have\". That is how the Group of Seven wealthy countries, who do not use the organisations' services, came to control nearly 50% of the votes on their boards. It is the modern equivalent of 17th-century rule by aristocracy. </p> <p>All the developing and transitional economies put together, who rely on the institutions' services, control only around four in every 10 votes. At the United Nations General Assembly those same countries have more than eight out of 10 votes. </p> <p>Adding insult to penury, a committee set up to reformulate voting allocations at the IMF recently came to an embarrassingly wrong conclusion. The so-called \"Cooper Report\" suggested a scheme that would increase the United States' already dominant influence, and shrink Africa's small voice. The fact that Asia, too, would benefit little from proposed quota changes is likely to encourage those calling for a separate Asian Monetary Fund, one more in tune with the region's needs. </p> <p>The original vision for the UN included a role in global economic management to ensure more equal distribution of the benefits from trade and development. But, as the bank and fund have grown more influential, UN agencies have been undermined, attempts to control multinational corporations shelved and senior staff removed. </p> <p>Conservative philosopher Karl Popper wrote that an open society needed democratic institutions. He believed only genuinely democratic institutions could solve problems. The World Bank and IMF have proved appalling at solving problems. Popper also crystallised the inherent contradiction of the free markets, writing: \"The paradox of economic freedom, which makes possible the unrestrained exploitation of the poor by the rich ... results in the almost complete loss of economic freedom by the poor.\" </p> <p>Seen like this the financial institutions become enemies of an open global society. While they aspire to be universal, they ferociously protect minority rule of the world economy. Under this regime the anomalies and inequalities of globalisation have darkly flowered. But now there is a chance to correct historical wrongs, and reshape global governance. The UN has begun a little talked about process called finance for development. </p> <p>Technically, it is meant to try to give poor countries a better deal in everything from trade to aid. Its deeper mission is to write new terms of engagement between the UN and the World Bank, IMF and World Trade Organisation. But the first opportunity to influence the outcome and set the scope of the process will be over next week, almost before anyone is aware that it has begun. </p> <p>The street protests that seem set to haunt every international economic meeting are just another symptom of the global democratic deficit. They will welcome the new US president as representative of the largest vote holder in the institutions that guarantee minority rule. When his advisers wring their hands and in the coming months inevitably cry, \"why are the protesters getting at us?\" the president should turn to them and sagely whisper, \"it's democracy, stupid\". </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Simms is head of the global economy programme at the New Economics Foundation</p>",
  "<p>Thomas Keneally takes an unprecious view of his new novel, Bettany's Book, which he calls \"the last act of bravado by an ugly old sexist bastard from Australia\", issuing a filthy cackle that resonates like a motorbike engine and lifts him clean out of his seat. A troll-like 64-year-old with tombstone teeth and whiskers on his chin, he is more like a creation of the science fantasy writer Terry Pratchett than the revered author of Schindler's Ark. </p> <p>The \"bravado\" of Bettany's Book is that it is written from the perspective of two beautiful sisters, Dimple and Primrose Bettany, a feat of imagination that even its author admits to having found a little stretching. Like the best self-deprecators, Keneally mocks himself in a manner that only amplifies his charm. \"The great thing about Britain, as opposed to a muscular country like Australia, is that you can stay indoors and just be a portly gent,\" he says, fondly contemplating his girth and explaining that beauty, though he has never possessed it, has always fascinated him. </p> <p>Bettany's Book is 600 pages long, which by Keneally's reckoning \"just sneaks in under the limit of what's tolerable\". It is ambitious, unfolding on two continents and in two centuries, modern Sudan and 1830s Australia. The issues it tackles are huge: the politics of food distribution (\"the question of whether famine is an act of god or an act of politics\"), land ownership (\"If we are so enamoured of Australia after three or four generations, imagine what a sense of possession the Aborigines have after 12,500 generations?\") and the real biggie, original sin. \"It's the old sense of temptation being at the heart of every great virtue that we inherited from you blokes.\" </p> <p>He draws breath for a moment. \"Madam, your next question.\" </p> <p>The aim of the book was to redeem the history of the Australian outback from the damage done to it by bad schooling. \"As children, we were raised to do projects on wool, and it always bored the crap out of us,\" he says. He considered splitting this and the Sudanese material into two books, but his publishers dissuaded him, confident that he is at his best when at the helm of a sweeping epic. </p> <p>They were right. All Keneally's big \"issue\" books - Nazi genocide in Schindler's Ark, the Irish diaspora in The River Town and The Great Shame (cut from 2,000 to 600 pages) and now Bettany's Book, are deliv ered from worthiness by an ironic touch that has him introducing his latest protagonist as \"Sir Jonathan Bettany, great man of sheep\", and congratulating the Bettany sisters' parents for dying an \"exemplary death\". The story travels between Sudan and Australia via the conceit of Prim obtaining a job in an aid agency and Dimp stumbling across her great grandfather's journal, through which is told the story of Australia's convict pioneers. </p> <p>Keneally insists that this is not as random a juxtaposition as it seems. \"Most Australians wouldn't see any connection between themselves and a country like the Sudan,\" he says. \"But there is this one.\" </p> <p>The connection is post-colonial identity, a subject the author is loath to make too much of lest he tumble into the arms of pretension or be accused of \"pom-bashing\". None the less, he says, just as Sudan struggled to redefine itself, culturally and territorially, after British rule ended in 1956, so Australia derives edginess from its status as an ex-penal colony. </p> <p>\"Behind that assertiveness is an insecurity. The participation of a lot of Australians in the two world wars was down to that, I think. My wife's eldest brother flew 90 missions in bomber command before the age of 22 - 90 missions! Preposterous bravado - and when I asked him why, he said: 'I wanted to show 'em what Australians are made of.' That impulse to show the Brits that Australians had turned out well, had moral fibre, I'm sure derives in part from the stain of convictism.\" </p> <p>Keneally's own ancestors were Irish convicts exported to New South Wales in the mid-19th century. John Keneally, his great uncle, was a political prisoner convicted in Ireland for his republicanism - something his great nephew looks on warmly in light of his own politics - and eventually pardoned by Gladstone. To Keneally the writer, such a history is a gift. But to the child in Sydney it was an unenviable background. \"This was not looked upon as an inheritance of which to be proud,\" he says, wryly. \"It took a little time for Australians to understand they had an idiosyncratic social history of which much could be made.\" </p> <p>All of this makes Keneally, Australian descendant of Irish Catholics, an unlikely chronicler of European Jewry's darkest hour. When Schindler's Ark was published in 1982, it was greeted sceptically in some quarters as the work of a man who had no \"claim\" on the story. Similarly, his knowledge of Sudan is based on half a dozen stopovers on the way to visit a friend in Eritrea and a long time spent researching on the internet. \"Writers are such arrogant pricks that they only need to know a little bit about something and they'll write a bloody book about it,\" he says. </p> <p>Despite such bullishness, the question of ownership is one Keneally takes seriously. In Bettany's Book, he protects himself from accusations of arrogance by filtering his observations about Africa through a narrator from his own culture. He believes there are limits to where his imagination can decently take him. \"When I was young, I wrote a novel called the Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, which was about Aboriginal Australians [It was also made into a film]. I would not dare write such a book now, because there are so many splendid Aboriginal Australian writers.\" </p> <p>What he doesn't countenance is the writing school ethic of sticking to what you know. \"I find it surprising even a little reckless, that I undertook the project of writing about the Sudan. But I believe writers should be reckless. The old proposition that you should only write about what you know is wrong, because I believe that you don't know what you know until you've written it.\" </p> <p>Any doubts about Keneally's virtuosity as the right man to have written Schindler's Ark, were swept aside by the novel's phenomenal success: it won the Booker prize the year it was published and 11 years later was made into a multi-Oscar winning film by Steven Spielberg. In the aftermath of the film, Keneally was inundated with requests from aggrieved races the world over, begging him to \"do\" their stories. </p> <p>This tickled him, the notion that you could be coldly commissioned to write a story rather than being ambushed by it. He is a great believer in that pseudo-religious experience, much favoured by writers, of being \"seized\" by a narrative. It is this, he says, which explains his choice of subjects. \"It is like being in love. I had no right to get seized by the Schindler story but I became obsessed by it.\" </p> <p>It was the obsession that vaulted Keneally from his status as a critically acclaimed but relatively obscure author, to one of mass appeal. Schindler's Ark, republished after the film's release as Schindler's List, was one of the 20 best-selling fiction titles of the 90s, selling more than 600,000 copies in Britain and spending 20 weeks in the bestseller list. The anti-climax that inevitably followed was lessened for Keneally, by the long gap between the writing of the book and the making of the film - he knocked out another six titles in the interim. </p> <p>Still, it is the book he is likely to be remembered for, a fact he is cheerfully ambivalent about. \"All writers hate to be typecast by the one book of theirs that everyone knows. But it gives us something to do in our old age, which is try to unseat that book, to get another book on our epitaph.\" </p> <p>Keneally's \"old-age\" is spent in a house on the beach, near Sydney, with his wife Judy and their two grown-up daughters. He is involved in the local surf club, where he feeds his inferiority complex by hanging out with lifeguards who can swim \"half way to New Zealand\" to pluck some tourist out of the surf and deposit her on safely on the sand. He is involved in various constitutional movements, produces journalism, accompanies his wife and daughters, all \"world-class shoppers\", on expeditions. The trick of being a good writer, he says, is to find the \"right degree of distraction\". </p> <p>Does writing make him feel more beautiful, I wonder? \"In my case, writing delivers me from plainness, yes, and ageing and all that stuff. It delivers me from a sense of the imminence of death, too, so it's a bit like a drug. It doesn't necessarily make me happy, because it's too solitary for my tastes. But writing is a way of potentially redeeming oneself from the passage of time and from the reality of one's own ordinariness.\" </p> <p>It is this that Bettany's Book does for Keneally's country. \"Bettany is a hero ancestor, taking all his human ambiguity into the vacant space that so intrigued the European imagination. I wanted to explore his wonderment at the ...\" he pauses, searching for the right term, cracks a grin. \"At the dreaming of sheep.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Bettany's Book is published by Sceptre next month.</p>",
  "<p>Shareholders aiming to shake up the Lazard investment banking group today voice their disquiet when one of the four companies that control the group holds a board meeting. </p> <p>The meeting of the Eurafrance holding company takes place amid speculation that Germany's Deutsche Bank is preparing a bid for the 150-year-old France-based group. </p> <p>One of the most respected but secretive investment banking groups in the world, Lazards has been under pressure for six months to sort out its intricate ownership structure. Shareholders seeking change include French corporate raider Vincent Bollor\u00e9 and Swiss-owned investment banking group UBS Warburg as well as some former partners of the group. </p> <p>Lazards is one of the last banking empires that can claim to be \"independent\", not having been swallowed by a larger group. Banking sources said last night this in part was because of the complicated ownership structure. </p> <p>A web of companies, some with cross-holdings in each other, control a group which has struggled to maintain dominance in recent years as US-owned investment banks trampled on its once safe territory in Europe. In addition, more than 100 partners have stakes in the business. </p> <p>Michel David-Weill, the autocratic chairman and descendant of the company founders, took the first steps to reorganise the company six months ago when the three related yet separate hubs of the empire in London, Paris and New York were brought under one management structure. </p> <p>That failed, however, to tackle the main demand from Mr Bollor\u00e9 and Warburg, to narrow the discount between the price of the companies' shares and the value of the assets they own. These discounts vary on a daily basis between 20% and 40%. </p> <p>Suggestions that a full-scale dismantling of the Lazard structure would be announced today were considered to be premature by senior banking sources last night. More likely, the meeting of Eurafrance will explore ways of enhancing the return to investors. </p> <p>It is believed that Warburg, which owns stakes of 7%-12% in the four companies that control Lazards, has ruled out making bids for the companies, preferring to give Mr David-Weill and his senior management team more time to improve the share price. </p> <p>Whether a sale to acquisitive Deutsche Bank would solve this problem was far from clear last night amid conflicting signals about how advanced any such talks were. Speculation about a Deutsche bid has swirled since a number of senior partners of Lazards defected in recent weeks, most notably respected deal maker Pierre Tattevin who has joined Rothschild, the last independent investment banking dynasty. </p> <p>\u0095 Barclays executives dismissed reports last night that it was planning to resurrect its investment banking arm, three years after BZW was broken up.

  "The Northern Ireland life peer, Lord McConnell of Lisburn, who has died aged 77, was a late example of how the Ulster Unionist old boys' network in South Antrim could survive for a former political figure. Prior to 1995, he had been on the shelf for 30 years, but came off it after John Major, losing his government majority in the Commons, offered concessions to the Ulster Unionists to prevent them throwing in their votes with Labour to bring the Conservatives down, a pattern previously set by James Callaghan. <p>One of the douceurs offered was additional representation in the Lords. When the Ulster Unionists' ageing leader, James Molyneaux, offered McConnell the peerage, it was understood that he would like a friendly echo on Ulster in the Lords, into which he himself would soon be retiring. But there was still some surprise because, as the province's commissioner for national insurance and then social security, McConnell had been out of politics for nearly 30 years. </p> <p>That padded shelf had been found for him after he became the fall guy for failing to anticipate, as home affairs minister at Stormont, a disruptive demonstration in June 1966 by the Rev Ian Paisley at a meeting of the Presbyterian general assembly. All the Ulster bigwigs in attendance were jostled and harangued, including the Northern Ireland governor, Lord Erskine, and his lady. </p> <p>It was McConnell's head that was selected to roll, although he had been away in London at the time. He was reproached and demoted, and took the hint that his political life was over. This came as a shock to someone whose future seemed so bright that he had been made a privy counsellor only two years earlier, at the age of 42, as one of the then Ulster leader Terence O'Neill's bright young men. </p> <p>McConnell had been born into a well-connected farming family in Belfast. After Sedbergh school, he returned to Northern Ireland to read law at Queen's University, being called to the local bar in 1948. </p> <p>As an Ulster Unionist and member of the Orange Order in South Antrim, he had a cushy entry into Stormont, being elected in 1951, then re-elected unopposed in 1953 and 1962, before being returned in 1965, this time after beating a Labour opponent. A whip by 1962, then deputy chairman of ways and means, by 1963 he had become parliamentary secretary for health, before moving, the following year, to the vulnerable post of home affairs minister. </p> <p>Because his legal career had not flourished, in 1968 he took the option of becoming, for 19 years, the province's national insurance commissioner. For much of the time, he was also president of the local industrial court. </p> <p>One of the things that surprised Ulster Unionists when McConnell's name emerged again in 1995, was the difference between his views and those of his leader on Europe. Molyneaux was, and remains, a strong Eurosceptic, while McConnell was a longtime vice-chairman and chairman of Ulster's European Movement. </p> <p>He leaves his wife of 49 years, Sylvia Elizabeth Joyce (Agnew), two sons and a daughter. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert William Brian McConnell, Baron McConnell of Lisburn, politician and life peer, born November 25 1922; died October 24 2000</p>",
  "More than 50 soldiers led by a middle-ranking commander vowing to safeguard the honour of the army, and refusing to recognise the authority of President Alberto Fujimori, took control of a prominent mining town in southern Peru yesterday, blocking passage in or out. <p>The uprising, in Toquepala, near the Chilean border, came a day after Mr Fujimori sacked his armed forces chief and three top generals in an effort to strengthen his grip on power, which is apparently being challenged by his fugitive former chief of intelligence, Vladimiro Montesinos.</p> <p>\"I will only lay down my arms when the chain of command is legitimate and there is a president who has been truly elected by the people to whom I would swear subordination and valour,\" the commander, Ollanta Moises Humala Tasso, told Reuters in a fax addressed to the Peruvian nation.</p> <p>The army condemned the uprising as \"a serious situation of indiscipline\" and said it would take \"appropriate action to put an end to this activity and safeguard the social and political stability of the country\".</p> <p>It said two officers, 49 soldiers and three unidentified civilians had also taken over the nearby copper mine. This was confirmed by a resident of the town who called a local radio station, contradicting earlier denials by mine officials.</p> <p>\"They're not letting anyone out,\" the caller said. \"My husband is working [in the mining complex] and he can't come home.

  "While the most familiar image of the would-be migrant to the US may be that of the impoverished central American trying to slip over the border by moonlight, a new breed will be arriving first-class at the airports of big American cities. <p>Techno-migrants with all the necessary skills of the new technology are being actively courted and this month their path into the US has this month been smoothed by the president himself. They arrive at a time when the percentage of immigrants in the workforce is at its highest since the 1930s. </p> <p>Earlier this month Bill Clinton signed into law legislation to increase the annual quota of H-1B visas available for skilled foreign workers from 115,000 to 195,000 over the next three years. The law came after pressure from technology companies worried by the shortage of qualified workers and anxious to snap up the cream of foreign brainpower, particularly from India. </p> <p>The US has been attracted by the talented graduates of the Indian institutes of technology set up by Nehru in the 1950s. At the other end of the scale, the presence of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from central America provides a cheap and compliant labour pool for the service industries and allows companies to keep their overheads low. </p> <p>\"My administration has made clear that any increase in H-1B visas should be temporary and limited in number,\" Mr Clinton said. He added that the fee charged to employers for each visa should be increased significantly [to $1,000] and that most of the money generated should go to \"fund training for US workers seeking the necessary skills for these jobs\". It is estimated that the extra visas will raise $170m for training Americans. </p> <p>What the legislation does not address is the position of a large number of immigrants who are either illegal or of uncertain status. Mr Clinton was unable to persuade the Republicans to extend the immigration largesse to those who do not have specific technical skills, and he has expressed his regret. \"We need to meet the needs of the hi-tech industry by raising the number of visas for temporary hi-tech workers,\" he said. \"But we also must ensure fairness for immigrants who have been in this country for years, working hard and paying taxes.\" </p> <p>This is a tacit acknowledgement of the essential part played by immigrants, legal and illegal, in the US economy. According to the bureau of labour statistics, there are now 15.7m immigrants in the workforce, around 5m of them illegal. They amount to 12% of the workforce, a rise of 17% in the past three years alone. </p> <p>Many of the illegal immigrants work in sweatshops, as farm workers and in the service industries, sometimes for as little as $3 an hour. They are unable to complain for fear of being deported. </p> <p>There are an estimated 6m illegal immigrants - this includes children and those who are not in the workforce - in the US, and an estimated 260,000 enter every year. There is now pressure, particularly from the growing Latino constituency, for an amnesty for those who have entered and settled in the US. </p> <p>The latest annual figures from the immigration and naturalisation service show that 789,378 people entered the US as legal immigrants. The largest number of those entering both legally and illegally came from Mexico, of whom 146,865 had legal status. </p> <p>Earlier this year the AFL-CIO trade union federation dropped its opposition to illegal undocumented labour. This is partly in recognition of the fact that many of the most active union supporters come from the Latino immigrant community, and that the worst labour abuses are in the areas in which they work. This change is seen as the harbinger of a possible amnesty. </p> <p>It was 1883 when Emma Lazarus wrote the words which are inscribed as a welcome on the statue of liberty: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free.\" Were she writing today, she might be inclined to swap the tired, poor and huddled for \"your wired, your computer-literate and your techno-savvy.\" </p> <p>The less qualified will still have to wait their turn.</p>",
  "<p>The success of Billy Elliot at the box office has added a whole new dimension to Rachel Keen's job. As PA to the director and assistant director at the west London-based Royal Ballet School, Keen has found herself with far more on her hands than taking letters and opening the post. </p> <p>Since starting her job in September this year, Keen, 34, has been dealing with camera crews in the school corridors and journalists on the phone - all searching for an insight into the life of a dancer. \"The film has been great at exploding the myth about dance just being something for boys from a specific background,\" she says. \"We have 75 students here in the upper school; almost half are boys and they are from all backgrounds.\" </p> <p>As she points out, ballet is not for the weak. \"I would like to find a footballer who could lift a seven stone dancer with one hand and hold her up there in front of two thousand people.\" When she is not dealing with the press, Keen finds herself with a mixture of the usual, and more unusual, PA duties, such as getting the tutus dyed or entertaining international dancers. Both her bosses (director Gailene Stock and assistant director Jay Jolley) were \"star dancers\" before moving into education. \"We really work together as a team here,\" says Keen. \"They are both great at doing their own emails and correspondence and their time management is wonderful.\" </p> <p>But what about the legendary \"artistic temperament\"? Are we talking temper tantrums before coffee? Keen is quick to defend. \"They are both really good humoured,\" she insists. \"We have a committed, dynamic and creative energy in the school that you wouldn't see in the corporate world.\" The school has a long and rich history. It started as the Sadler's Wells School in 1947 and the boys department came a year later in 1948. It wasn't until October 1956 that the school became known as the Royal Ballet School. </p> <p>Since then the school has trained leading dancers such as Darcey Bussell, now a school governor, and Jonathan Cope, a dancer with the Royal Ballet. Picking through Keen's CV, it is plain to see that her move to the Royal Ballet School was a perfectly logical step. She spent time in a local dance school but realised quite quickly that she did not have the required flexibility to progress in dance and turned her sights to music. With an indecent number of grades in flute and piano to her name, she later took a music and dance degree at Birmingham University. </p> <p>After graduating, she enrolled on a secretarial course to make herself marketable. One area she had no problems with was the keyboard. \"Having trained as a pianist, the keyboard came naturally to me and I am a very fast typist,\" she says. After three years working in arts administration in Sydney, she spent seven years at the Royal Academy of Dancing, as PA to the chief executive and later as registrar for the Royal Academy's BA course. </p> <p>Before moving to the Royal Ballet school she notched up two and a half years at College of Art and Design as PA to the dean and head of college. \"At that time I really wanted to learn about education in a broader sense,\" she explains. But the temptation of the Royal Ballet School was not to be passed over. \"I have always wanted to work in the ballet world and give back something I gained in childhood,\" she says. </p> <p>Despite the artistic setting, her job does have the more mundane correspondence, diary and travel arrangement duties. But there's also the exceptional: \"We have gala performances that we hold in the summer at the Royal Opera House and this year I'll be helping organise the Young British Dancer of the Year.\" The big project which is riding alongside the day-to-day running of the school is the proposed relocation to Covent Garden, to a building which will cost \u00a315m to construct and is due to be finished by 2002. Needless to say, Keen is involved in the fundraising. </p> <p>Even so, she still finds time to get out and about. \"The students have performance opportunities in Swan Lake and The Nutcracker and they get to go to the rehearsals so it's great when the invitation is extended to the staff.\" She may also find herself visiting dance venues, sorting out seating plans or picking up a visa. </p> <p>But what she really appreciates about her job is something that is fed into her office every day. \"One of the wonderful aspects is the music and the sound of the piano playing. I go home with the repertoires singing in my ears.\"</p>",
  "<p>Why is it that your attempts to join in board-level discussions are greeted with a patronising smile and a firmly closed door? Don't they appreciate what you have to contribute? Maybe not - but have you considered the possibility that it might be your fault? </p> <p>* Like it or not, if you want to be accepted at senior level you have to talk the talk. If you've set your sights on joining the executive club, you need to get fluent in business-speak. This doesn't mean transforming yourself into a jargon-spouting automaton, but apposite nuggets dropped strategically into your conversation will help you to be taken more seriously. </p> <p>* Begin by scrutinising your speech. Women tend to use emotional vocabulary, which can cloud your message. Try to replace the touchy-feely words such as \"like\", \"love\", \"hate\" and \"touchy-feely\". Find a more businesslike way to express your ideas. Don't say, \"I don't think the guys in IT are going to like being moved to the fourth floor\". Try, \"I'm concerned that the IT team may not function as well on the fourth floor\". </p> <p>* Clear out all the obscuring fluff from your sentences. Drop words such as \"just\", \"maybe\", \"perhaps\", and never put \"-y\" or \"-ish\" on the end of your words. Why? Because they just make you sound sort of uncertain-ish, which doesn't go down well in business-y circles. (See what I mean?) </p> <p>* Listen to senior executives. When did your managing director last say, \"I really think it would be nice if we could find some money from somewhere, otherwise we're in trouble\"? It would more likely be, \"Sourcing new revenue streams is key if we're to maintain our current trading position\". You don't have to go that far, but you do need to think about how you express your thoughts in the business arena. Jot down management's \"in\" words and try to use them. For example, if everything is \"key\" in your firm at the moment, make it your favourite adjective too. (But beware of over-use: it's not \"key\" that you get to lunch on time, nor is it \"key\" to phone your mum). </p> <p>* Read around the business world. You don't have to absorb the Economist from cover to cover, but a regular browse of the business pages will help you to see who and what is making the news. Pick up the terms, check the definitions, and use them. </p> <p>* Immediate buy-in to the project is vital to bringing the desired outcome to your key objective. (Which, roughly translated, means: do it now, if you want to succeed.)</p>",
  "<p>Up to 20% of all blood used in hospital operations may soon be recycled from patients themselves, to help combat blood shortages and allay fears of the human form of BSE contaminating transfusions. </p> <p>NHS officials and doctors will have to persuade hospitals to invest in the technology that makes the procedure possible. This involves equipment that sucks blood lost in operations into a container before forcing it through a centrifuge that separates and cleans the vital red blood cells and then transfers them into a bag ready for transfusion back to the patient. </p> <p>Only about 10% of major hospitals are thought to have access to such equipment at the moment and this and other self-donating procedures are thought to account for under 2% of all blood used in operations in Britain. Experts in the field believe this could be increased 10-fold, including in cardiac and vascular surgery, orthopaedic procedures and genito-urinary operations. </p> <p>They believe the present system of voluntary public donations is safer than it has ever been but it is not enough and alternatives must be made more available. </p> <p>The Department of Health is anxious to develop the recycling options much further, as well as extending opportunities for patients who wish to donate their own blood in the weeks before operations. </p> <p>But this \"pre-deposit\" scheme, already on offer at some blood transfusion centres, can be expensive, difficult to organise and wasteful if the patients' operations have to be cancelled. </p> <p>Low-key discussion on the techniques, some of which are said to improve markedly the quality of blood given to patients and help reduce demand on donated blood supplies, has been under way for years. However, higher costs and disagreements over the health benefits and economic justification for changes have made progress slow. </p> <p>But the continuing unease that using transfusions from unwitting carriers of the human form of BSE might infect patients with variant CJD has kickstarted the whole debate once more. </p> <p>The government has already recognised the theoretical risk and introduced a series of control measures, including removal of white blood cells and a ban on British-sourced plasma products. </p> <p>Last month, however, it was revealed that a BSE-like disease had been spread by blood transfusion between two sheep and the government is anxious to make contingency plans, especially since a test to detect vCJD in blood is unlikely to be available in the near future. </p> <p>The Department of Health has commissioned an audit on how many NHS trusts have followed up a 1998 circular encouraging wider use of so-called autologous blood donation. </p> <p>It said yesterday: \"The results of the audit should be available before the end of the financial year. They will allow us to provide further advice and support to NHS blood services.\" </p> <p>Tim Wallington, medical spokesman for the national blood service, said: \"The most important thing is to ensure blood is used properly, not because it is dangerous, but because it is scarce and valuable. </p> <p>\"There is a big effort to improve practice going on. We can be proud of that. But there is a real concern not to overplay it so as not to frighten people too much. There is a duty also to get it right.\" </p> <p>Michael Thomas, a spokesman for the autologous group of the British Blood Transfusion Society, said: \"To raise public expectations before the facilities [for recycling blood] are there is unethical.

  "<p>Prize-winning cheerleaders Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku) and Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) have visited East Compton High School to check out their rival squad, The Clovers. With horror, Torrance realises that the routine her coach Big Red has taught them has been stolen from The Clovers. As Missy and Torrance head for the parking lot, they're followed by head Clover Isis (Gabrielle Union) and her colleagues Jenelope (Natina Reed) and Lava (Shamara Fears). </p> <p>\"Hey,\" Isis bawls. \"You guys enjoy the show?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" sneers Jenelope, \"were the ethnic festivities to your liking today?\" </p> <p>Torrance turns, attempting to appear enthused. </p> <p>\"You guys are awesome.\" </p> <p>\"Really?\" Isis retorts. \"So, ready to share those trophies?\" </p> <p>Lava turns to her friends. </p> <p>\"Can we just beat these Buffys down so we can go home?\" </p> <p>\"Look,\" stutters Missy, \"there's no need for that...\" </p> <p>\"She's right,\" says Isis. \"Because then we'd be doing them a favour.

  "<p>Does your company offer you the chance to de-stress with t'ai chi or yoga classes at lunchtimes? An on-site vicar with whom you can discuss those concerns of work taking over your life? An afternoon philosophy workshop on ways to bring \"soul\" into the office? If not, it may only be a matter of time. Spirituality is set to become the biggest workplace fad of the millennium. </p> <p>Glenn Hoddle was among those who started the trend a couple of years back. Determined to improve the England football team's chances in the World Cup (ahem), he enlisted the help of Eileen Drewery, a faith healer. Around the same time, businesswoman of the year Prue Leith turned to a spiritual counsellor to map out her career. </p> <p>Law firm Mishcon de Reya was among the first companies to get employees involved. \"We sponsored a poet in residence who conducted seminars for everyone from secretaries to senior partners,\" says a spokesperson. \"All employees agreed that writing and analysing poems helped create an environment where 'deep' issues could be explored and then transferred to workplace matters. In turn, that broke down barriers and improved staff morale.\" </p> <p>Words are the tools of a law firm's trade, explains the spokesperson. \"So trying to think about other, more spiritual, areas, where words are equally important, seemed the per fect way in which to enhance our working environment.\" </p> <p>Rob Briner, an organisational psychologist who specialises in the link between work and well-being, agrees: \"It is finally being recognised that we need to appeal to employees' hearts and souls as well as to their minds and pockets.\" </p> <p>Indeed, workers in the UK may be among the most highly paid in the developed world, but they are also among the most unhappy, according to a recent survey. \"A mere 36% of British employees enjoy their work, with only Hungary and Japan more unhappy still,\" says Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at the University of Warwick, who conducted the survey alongside David Blanchflower from Dartmouth College in the US. </p> <p>\"There are far too many damaged people in workplaces up and down this country,\" agrees Father Dermot Tredget, a Benedictine monk from Douia Abbey, who campaigned for spirituality at work at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) conference last week. \"They have suffered through overwork, failing to balance work and home, failing to develop their emotional intelligence and being the victims of a 24-hour work-orientated culture. No wonder they're starting to insist, 'We're here to make a life, not just a living.'\" </p> <p>So stressed out have workers in the City of London become that they are flocking to the Reverend Peter Delany, vicar of All Hallows, close to the Tower of London. \"I get commodities brokers, traders, dealers and their support staff increasingly approaching me to heal the rift between work and the spirit - even if it's just during lunchtimes,\" he says, adding that it isn't necessarily a religious experience. \"Many of the people who come have never been to church in their lives. They're just after someone in the business of seeking deeper meaning to life.\" </p> <p>As a result of the growing interest, the local business community has helped the churches in that area to fund a stress clinic. \"It offers a range of holistic therapies such as chiropractic, dietary and osteopathic advice. These can work hand in hand with the spiritual chats employees have with the vicars,\" explains Reverend Delany. </p> <p>Mori, which has carried out research on \"spirituality as a phenomenon\", recently found that, along with reports of stress among the British workforce, there is also quite simply a growing sense of wanting more from the work experience. \"It seems to come from the recent focus on business ethics, environmental concern, socio-economic values and a rejection of hard-nosed capitalism,\" says Susan Walker, the managing director of human resources research at Mori. </p> <p>Professor Oswald adds that job insecurity is prevalent in the UK. \"In fact, a lot of people, particularly support staff, who feel this insecurity are unhappy, not because they constantly get laid off but because they constantly leave jobs of their own free will. The fear of insecurity, it appears, can leave workers feeling out of control, and they try to win it back by moving on before there's a chance that they can be asked to move on. The problem is that this is a vicious circle, causing them inevitable unhappiness as well as a failure to find any purpose in their working lives.\" </p> <p>Briner believes the trend towards employee assistance programmes and emotional intelligence has encouraged an office culture in which emotions are no longer taboo. \"Mention spirituality in the work place 10 years ago and there's a good chance you'd have got nothing but a snigger. Mention it today, and there's a good chance you'll get people who are genuinely interested.\" </p> <p>Indeed, in Bristol, the Reverend Harold Clarke, who leads the Council for Industry and Social Responsibility, has a range of business people approaching him on a variety of issues. \"A colleague is chaplain to Economic Life in Swindon, where two or three 'women in business' groups meet regularly,\" he adds. </p> <p>The 90s emphasis on teamwork is also responsible for the search for the spiritual, believes Briner. In fact, he says, improving collective working is one of the chief areas where employers - rather than just employees - can gain from spirituality at work, whatever form it takes. The theory is that understanding the role the spiritual dimension can play in our lives will help build better relationships at work and thus enable people to work more effectively. </p> <p>Father Tredget agrees. \"A spiritually-friendly workplace will be more than just a nice place to work. It will also be more profitable. Such workplaces will have greater staff retention rates, so lowering recruitment costs; see an increase in creativity and innovation; see improved morale, co-operation and teamwork and will see an improvement of the interface between the organisation and its customer-base.\" </p> <p>Relationships out of work can also be improved, he says. After all, research shows that the single biggest wedge between millennial couples is caused by work. \"People want to make sense of where work should fit into their lives, and have the chance to put their families first.\" </p> <p>Father Tredget predicts that \"understanding the spiritual will become such an important part of workplace human development that it will begin to regularly feature in management training, and will eventually have a place in some form or another in every organisation, no matter how small.\" </p> <p>So is it goodbye to traditional interviews, where you're asked to reveal your word processing skills, and hello to theatre and painting workshops where you'll be asked to reveal your \"inner child\"? Maybe not yet. But don't be surprised if your flexible benefits package starts to include the options of personal gurus and a lifelong subscription to a feng shui magazine.</p>",
  "<p>Only the hawks that hover over the ancient woodlands in the hills above Bath can see the whole of the big stone, steel and concrete E that is one of the finest new company headquarters in Europe. At ground level, the new Wessex Water Operations Centre is almost invisible, tucked into a tumbling landscape that offers misty views over the Limpley Stoke valley to distant Cley Hill and Salisbury Plain. </p> <p>The amazing thing is that virtually everyone in the building has access to these views, for this big office block, home to Wessex Water's 520 staff, is about as transparent as such a building can be. A lightweight building boasting high, coffered ceilings, big windows that actually open, and three tiers of open-plan offices sheltering two imaginatively landscaped courtyards, it is awash with daylight. </p> <p>By night, the building all but vanishes: architect and client wanted to keep night lighting levels as low as possible, so that the stars will continue to shine here. </p> <p>A concern for low-energy design and construction, artworks and landscaping has informed the building at every stage of its development. This is possibly the most energy-efficient company headquarters in Europe. Yet it is not some worthy, over-polite design, but a handsome, convincing modern building that manages to combine elements of the best new university buildings and air terminals. If you're going to spend much of your life in an office, it ought to be as good as this. </p> <p>The architects are Bennetts Associates, the engineers Buro Happold. The landscaping is by Bernard Ede/Grant Associates, the contractor Mace. Jonathon Porritt advised on ecological issues. The person who speaks for the management is Colin Skellett, chairman and chief executive of Wessex Water Services, a man who can proudly proclaim: \"I'm a water and sewage man, have been since I was 16.\" </p> <p>\"We want to work with the landscape and our natural resources as naturally, sensitively and efficiently as we can,\" Skellett says. \"And we want the staff to enjoy working here.\" </p> <p>Skellett attended a weekly 7.30am meeting with his architects. He saw the building through to completion and says there is nothing about it that he would change now that it is finished. He ought to be proud of it. For here is a building designed from the inside out that connects intimately to the landscape it lies so low in. Its lavatories are flushed by rainwater drained from its stainless steel and meadow grass roofs. </p> <p>The building runs broadly east to west, which reduces overheating from the sun on fine days and makes the most of the prevailing winds. In 2000 it is almost a privilege to walk through and work in a building without air conditioning or any other forms of health-threatening and dispiriting mechanical ventilation. Here is a building with relatively low levels of lighting: neither electric lights nor low winter sun dazzle. </p> <p>\"Perhaps it will be a little hotter on some days in summer,\" says Ian Taylor of Bennetts Associates, \"and a little cooler in winter than office workers have come to expect, but we're talking of a building in which staff have quite a degree of control over their environment and in which the total energy cost is about a third of that of a conventional office building.\" </p> <p>Similar concerns made themselves felt during construction. Old railway sleepers, for example, made up 40% of the rough aggregate used in making the concrete needed for part of the building. The idea was to cut down on the energy used in making concrete; this was further reduced by having the concrete roof vaults - good for thermal insulation - held up by a lightweight stainless steel frame. </p> <p>\"Throughout,\" says Taylor, \"we've tried to keep out any form of mechanical or electrical service that is either wasteful of energy or likely to go wrong. The building is sophisticated yet pretty innocent from a technological and ecological viewpoint.\" </p> <p>From the staff's point of view, too, the building has a transparency and serenity absent from most office buildings. Each of the three office wings connects seamlessly with an internal street where the library, meeting rooms and cafeteria are located. </p> <p>The manager of the secure 24-hour control centre and incident room is explaining how his box of computers works when he is distracted by a hawk hovering outside the windows. \"We see deer here in the morning,\" he says. This is a man used to working in windowless rooms and underground bunkers. Now he and his colleagues have some of the best views of all. </p> <p>\"It has made a difference already in terms of staff motivation,\" says Skellett. \"Since we've moved in, absenteeism has fallen - not that it was a problem. We offer a free bus service to staff that runs to Bath city centre; we expected a bit of mass emigration at lunchtime, but it hasn't happened. It's a lovely place to be.\" </p> <p>And it will be lovelier still come spring, when the gardens laced with meadow will become a romantic tapestry of wild English flowers, the pond will be alive with newts and dragonflies, and the gardens will be in full bloom. The idea is that staff can work outside in the courtyards and gardens on sunny days, eat their lunch outside or just sunbathe. </p> <p>This welcoming place is a million miles from the kind of local authority office of 20 or 30 years ago. The Wessex Water team positively welcomes visitors: there is an education room for schoolchildren and, when the gardens are in bloom, it would make a nice afternoon out on the free bus from Bath station. Perhaps the staff won't really want hordes of curious visitors trampling around their workplace, but when the architects have been encouraged to design the equivalent of a latter-day Oxbridge College with gardens to match, they might just have to get used to the idea.</p>"
