  "<p>Without a hint of irony, Alma Custic, a support team member for the BT Global Challenge yacht race, says it's an event that requires \"all hands on deck\". </p> <p>This Sunday, 12 identical boats will leave Southampton to spend 10 months racing 30,000 miles \"the hard way\" around the world, against the prevailing winds. Custic, 26, who works with the Norwich Union boat, has been involved in everything from sorting out the crew kit to organising food for the start. She joined the Croydon-based team only in June, and was immediately thrust into the thick of preparations for the world's most famous amateur yacht race. </p> <p>\"And there's a crisis almost every day,\" she admits, whether it's sending out rebranded clothing at short notice following the merger of the yacht's sponsor, insurance firm CGU, with Norwich Union, or chasing the crew's families and VIPs for replies to invitations to join a specially hired ferry for the send-off in Southampton. </p> <p>Quite a challenge for someone who describes herself as \"a complete landlubber\" with no previous sailing experience. That is, until an unusual perk of the job allowed her to try her hand at a day's sailing on the 72ft Norwich Union yacht. \"It was brilliant, apart from scraping my knuckles trying to hoist sails. I even had a go at the helm, and actually 'drove' the thing,\" she enthuses. \"And now I'm really bitten by the sailing bug.\" </p> <p>The BT Global Challenge 2000-2001 is the third such race and the brainchild of pioneering yachtsman Sir Chay Blyth. He wanted to give amateur sailors of all ages and backgrounds the chance of an adventure of a lifetime. But the experience comes at a price - each crew member, apart from the professional skippers, pays \u00a325,000 for the privilege of sharing cramped conditions for weeks on end and the prospect of monster seas. </p> <p>But all that is a long way away from Custic's busy office. \"There's so much to keep on top of - imagine organising a huge event, and then remember that it lasts for 10 months,\" she says. Her responsibilities are incredibly diverse: \"I distribute information before and during the race, provide regular updates to all staff, help keep the website <a href=\"http://www.CGNUchallenge.com\">www.CGNUchallenge.com</a> updated, write our internal monthly news- letter and liaise with our PR agency.\" </p> <p>Once the race has started, she'll also co-ordinate events with her boss, the project manager, who will be at all the stopovers, including Wellington and Cape Town. \"But, unfortunately, I'll be here in Croydon,\" she points out. </p> <p>She is contracted to work for the team only until next July, just after the race finishes, but Custic is used to short-term work. \"After I graduated from Southampton University with a degree in politics and international relations, I had to do some temping, which at least gave me office skills.\" </p> <p>A three-month stint at a London-based publishing company followed. \"After that I worked in marketing for Royal Vopak, an oil and chemical distribution company, for two years. That was great experience - having to talk to directors around the world at 3am or travelling to meetings at the Rotterdam headquarters.\" </p> <p>By chance, through that job, she met the sailmakers for the BT Global Challenge yachts, and they were able to give her useful background material for her Norwich Union interview. This job may be short-term, she says, but at least no two days are ever the same. \"The best thing is having complete ownership of a project, you really feel that you're achieving something. There's a great camaraderie and team spirit, too. We even get invited to the crew parties.\" </p> <p>So would she like to swap her job for a crew member's? \"I'd love to do just one leg, and if I had the money, maybe I'd think about doing the whole race, but I'd be petrified of the Southern Ocean! I certainly admire those who have the guts to do it. But, yes, I'll be envious waving them all off at the start.\" Time will tell if her preparation and organising skills will pay off for the crew, and how much plain sailing they - and Custic - can expect over the next nine months.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair was one of thousands of UK workers who last week returned to work after a summer vacation. But while he appears in the newspapers looking revitalised following his family's three-week holiday in Italy and France, it is probably safe to assume that he kept a watchful eye on what work was piling up for him \"back at the office\" during his time abroad. </p> <p>A new survey by web travel agent Travelocity has found that the reality for most of us is that we never stop thinking about work, even when miles from the office. And the study claims that although there are some lucky workers who do manage to switch off during time away, the mountain of work that awaits them on their return means their relaxed state has evaporated completely within days. In fact, claims another recent poll, by <a href=\"http://www.Totaljobs.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Totaljobs.com</a>, increasing numbers of employees are concluding that it's better not to take a break in the first place. </p> <p>\"The ever-increasing backlog of work that people return to is enough to make anyone incapable of unwinding while on holiday,\" says a spokesperson for Travelocity. Indeed, three-quarters of the survey's respondents said that they felt as though they'd never been away within a week of being back in the office. </p> <p>Paul Jacobs, corporate communications director for recruitment consultancy Office Angels, is not surprised. \"Today's secretaries are working an additional 40 hours to make up for time they take off, the equivalent of an extra week,\" he says. \"It tends to be 20 hours before and 20 hours after the break\" - which means office staff leave for their holidays exhausted and soon work off their revived energy when they return. </p> <p>\"In some European countries, and in some UK companies in the past, companies would close down for a designated period every year,\" says Jacobs. \"But that is almost unheard of in this country now. As a result, during the summer months, and especially around the school holidays, many organisations run on a skeleton workforce. This can have serious repercussions on the morale and productivity of staff by the time September has arrived.\" </p> <p>In fact, studies show that September sees the most dramatic demand for temporary staff, up 5.8% on the previous month. \"This echoes the almost desperate situation that the end of the summer can bring,\" says a spokesperson from recruitment consultancy Adecco. </p> <p>But stress management consultant Andrew Evans claims it's not all doom and gloom. \"Even if you don't feel like you've had a holiday, your body does recharge itself and so you will find it easier to cope - even if it's subconsciously,\" he says. </p> <p>There are ways of avoiding post-vacation stresses. Cary Cooper, professor of occupational psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, advises that those returning to work should let the holiday \"spill over\" into the first few weeks of work. \"People should prioritise and do only the most important tasks,\" he said recently. \"They should also set an exit time for the first couple of weeks after they are back, and stick to it.\" </p> <p>Another solution is to have shorter, more frequent breaks. \"This option can help employees more than working like mad all year round, and just stopping for a couple of weeks every summer.\" </p> <p>When employees don't take time off at all, the most common reason is the extra hours involved in compensating for (or earning) a break, according to Totaljobs.com. \"But there are some additional reasons which differ among men and women,\" says Adele Kimber, the website's editor. \"When women don't take holidays, one reason can be down to guilt, although this is not for the sake of employers, but for colleagues. Women show more loyalty to supporting their teams and colleagues than men. Men take a much more individual approach to work, often being more ambitious and working hard to impress the boss.\" </p> <p>About 25% of workers admitted to missing out on their full holiday entitlement in a recent poll by Expedia. And, although lost leave is a nation-wide problem, employees in some parts of the country are suffering more than others. Scottish workers admit to losing the most number of days (four), closely followed by workers in London and the south-east (3.7). Many feel that they are indispensable, or that their work will not be covered by others while they are away, meaning more hours when they return. </p> <p>There are, of course, other reasons for not taking a break, such as being short on cash. After all, both Bermuda and Blackpool cost. But, says Laura Nichols, business psychologist at business consultancy Nicholson McBride, \"Even if you don't go away, you should take time off work. A few days at home can be just as effective.\" </p> <p>Evans believes employers are shooting themselves in the foot by allowing the \"September blues\" trend to continue. \"Staff morale and mental health are being severely affected,\" he says. \"In the long-term, employers will suffer as much as employees.\"</p>",
  "<p>You are the senior administrator in a fairly large company with supervisor privileges on the computer. The boss phones at a weekend to say vital data, essential to winning a key contract, is in an email message sent between two of his co-directors, the previous Friday. You are to look at the message and forward its contents to him at home. </p> <p>Do you do exactly as he asks, do so with reservations, or refuse? </p> <p>This ethics puzzle was recently set by Simon Rogerson, director at the centre for computing and social responsibility at de Montfort University, and it indicates that there is more to current debates on email privacy than most staff or managers realise. </p> <p>By next month, the Human Rights Act will have made its appearance, and office staff everywhere will have to be told if their employers are monitoring their emails. On the face of it, this is the real Big Brother coming into play - although it will be software, rather than surveillance cameras or the boss peering over your shoulder, that will be watching you. </p> <p>Or maybe already is watching you. In practice, virtually anyone can monitor emails and voice messages, many businesses already do, and because email abuse is already so widespread, it is not altogether clear whether it is staff or employers who need protection most. </p> <p>Content Technologies, which distributes Mimesweeper surveillance software, has recently collated some of the more alarming examples. Two infamous British cases involve an insurance company and its \u00a3450,000 payment for alleged defamation of a competitor by email, and the management consultant fired for allegedly using email to book holidays. One of our biggest tyre and exhaust companies has sacked employees for exchanging obscene emails over the internal system; a consultant was convicted for sending an abusive email to a female employee of a customer company. </p> <p>But these are insignificant compared to instances of international abuse - and every company using email is now an international communicator. </p> <p>The second-biggest chemical company in the US has fired 50 workers and suspended 200 for sending pornographic and violent email messages; an oil company has paid $2.2m (\u00a31.5m) to four female employees sexually harassed via its email system. Twenty employees of an international newspaper were fired for sending \"inappropriate and offensive\" email, and the US Navy disciplined more than 500 shore employees for sending sexually explicit messages over an electronic network. </p> <p>International courts have imposed millions of dollars in fines for sexual or racial harassment over company-based email; staff have gone to jail for it. So what price the employee's right to privacy in their email? </p> <p>It depends where you are. Europe and the US have different rules, which makes things tricky for multinational companies. American courts have historically taken the view that \"an employee's right to privacy is trumped by an employer's business interests\", and while staff have been challenging employer access to their email since 1990, commentators say that no employee has yet won a case. Typically, two Californians who were fired for \"inappropriate sexual humour\" in emails, and who filed a counterclaim for invasion of privacy, were told by the judge that they could not expect privacy in their use of equipment provided for company business. </p> <p>The law in Europe is different, says Rogerson. He cites a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights only two years ago, which determined that workers have a \"reasonable expectation\" of privacy in making and receiving calls at work. </p> <p>\"Some organisations contend that because they own the computer resources on which email messages are transmitted, they should have an unconditional right to control and monitor the contents of those messages,\" he reports. \"The ECHR was quite clear that ownership does not permit surveillance.\" </p> <p>Yet surveillance already exists. The Mimesweeper email monitoring software has 5,000 users worldwide; the American Management Association spoke to 32,000 companies and found that one in seven reviewed messages. By comparison, the Peapod software company of London has noted that \"only\" 38% of major British corporations do so. </p> <p>Software houses say that businesses without monitoring simply do not understand the dangers of email. The Integralis group questioned 800 FTSE-1000 companies, and found that, while the majority of directors accepted that email is misused, they had no awareness of \"cyberliabilities\" arising from cyberlibel, copyright infringement, breach of confidence, negligent virus transmission, inadvertent contracts, or computer hacking... and five of those six can be caused by any junior member of staff. </p> <p>Those employers who do monitor email use specialist software; simplistically, it is the \"find\" facility in text-processing, multiplied to a vast degree. Some software uses directories of undesirable words and phrases, and more complex ones allow custom-built dictionaries of certain words - perhaps the names of competitors or project names - which will alarm the system and capture messages. These are referred to an administrator, who checks the message and either lets it through or blows the whistle. </p> <p>Some employees have dubbed the products \"censorware\", but software houses protest that staff are not the target. Their software protects equally against incoming obscenity, spam and even mailbombing, as suffered by the two British companies brought to a standstill with 300,000 preprogrammed messages over a 10-hour period, or the Swedish medical research houses similarly bombarded by animal rights groups. Being \"censored\" would probably have saved the staffer in an international group who accidentally sent confidential personnel emails to a trade union; it could have saved the travel agency worker who mistakenly emailed his entire customer list to a competitor. </p> <p>It might even have stopped the defamatory email which the British manager of a gas distributor sent to a rival's staff - and could have saved his company \u00a3101,000 in libel. </p> <p>Joanne Ashley, of London lawyers Sprecher Grier Halberstam, organises seminars to help managers understand the full hazards of instant messaging, and why policies should be drawn up to protect staff and employer. \"Email has removed the safety net of drafting letters and getting them back to re-read and sign - once you've pressed the \"send\" button, you can't rush to the post room and get it back,\" she explains. </p> <p>Understanding comes before technology, agrees Dave Hunt of C2C Systems in London. Only when managers appreciate the full hazards of email can they realistically lay down a meaningful policy, and that understanding can require a very open mind. \"Whether you think tolerances in the UK are liberal or puritanical, they are certainly different from other countries,\" he says. \"Political, sexual and religious beliefs and rights vary widely and cannot be taken for granted. At best, an inappropriate joke in an international email may cause offence. At worst, it could go to law against you.\" </p> <p>To talk of monitoring may itself be too late. As Simon Rogerson points out, there is already little control over who reads what - as any email can now be intentionally or accidentally forwarded to thousands of people at a keystroke, it is dangerous to assume any message will be read by only the addressee. He suggests, the best rule for staff may simply be a chilling word of advice: never send anything you would not like to see in a newspaper with your name beside it.</p>",
  "<p>It's about being in control and being free,\" says New Zealander Tracey Ward, 30, who has worked as a temp for 12 years. \"I love the flexibility of being able to take holiday whenever I like, particularly as I have family on the other side of the world. No full-time employer would let me take 10 weeks holiday a year, or accept that I would work for them for only six months. But temping offers me the freedom to have total control over my life - when and where I work, how long for and how many weeks holiday I want to take.\" </p> <p>Ward is one of an increasing number of people who see temping as a permanent career choice, rather than as a stop-gap between jobs, post- college or pre-travelling. With contract and flexible working on the increase, temping is more acceptable than ever - and more appealing to a generation of workers who don't want the restrictions of a permanent job. </p> <p>\"We have temps who have been on our books for five years,\" says Samantha Webster, manager at Gordon Yates. \"There are all sorts of advantages to temping, primarily the flexibility, but also there is less responsibility, less involvement in office politics, and the chance constantly to meet new people and experience different situations. A lot of the long-term temps on our books use temping to finance another career - acting or writing - and they temp between those jobs.\" </p> <p>\"Temping is a fantastic way to keep regular money coming in if you have an irregular career,\" confirms freelance magazine journalist Joanne Morrison. \"Some months I can have a lot of commissions and don't need to temp; other times money can be really tight. It's great to know I can ring my agency one day, be in work the next, and have money in my bank account at the end of the following week. And it breaks up the isolation of working from home - I get to be in an office, chatting to new people, which really helps with generating ideas for my writing.\" </p> <p>\"Increasingly, I think a lot of people see work as a way to fund other interests - and temping is a perfect way to do this,\" says Helene Miller, director of the temporaries division at Roc Recruitment. \"Some people temp to enable them to travel - they work, go away for a few months and then come back and work again. I have other long-term temps who are mothers, who want the flexibility of not working in the school holidays.\" </p> <p>Convenience aside, Morrison believes that even if she were to make a comfortable living from writing, she would still temp now and then. \"I've been temping on and off for four years,\" she says, \"and I have several companies that always ask for me - and I've worked for them often enough to have made lots of friends. I really enjoy the social side of temping. You're often invited down to the pub, or for drinks after work, but rather than the same faces week after week, it's a different crowd.\" </p> <p>Many people dismiss temping as a career choice, believing that most temp positions consist of little more than endless typing and stuffing envelopes, but for long-term temps, this is rarely the case. </p> <p>\"I have career temps who are requested again and again by the same clients,\" says Miller. \"It's great for the temp - they hit the ground running, they know the company and the staff, and they are given a good degree of responsibility. Employers are far more accepting about career-temps these days. Most understand that the concept of a job for life is pretty outdated and that people want the kind of flexibility and freedom afforded by temping.\" </p> <p>Another common worry about temping is that the work is irregular - unlike the reliability of a permanent job with a regular pay cheque. \"In my experience, if you're a good temp you'll be kept in plenty of work,\" says Ward. \"I consider myself a 'professional' temp - I never go into a job and think I don't have to care about it because I'm only temporary. If work needs doing, then I'll stay late until it's done. I take pride in my work, and don't see why it should be any less well done simply because I'm not a permanent member of staff.\" </p> <p>As the structure of the workplace changes, the perception of temping as an insecure, inadequate way to make a living is no longer relevant. Instead it is a seriously viable option for the increasing number of people who value freedom and flexibility - and fresh faces every few weeks. \"I've been offered plenty of jobs,\" says Ward. \"But I'm rarely tempted to take them. I love the fact that each job is only as permanent as I want it to be - and that there's always something new on the horizon.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kerry Packer, who was reported last week to have lost $20 million in a single night at the blackjack tables of Las Vegas, may be gratified to know that his name is no longer mud over here. Indeed, Cornhill Insurance - for whom The Oval represents the end of 23 years of Test sponsorship - say the Australian magnate 'did us all a favour'. </p> <p>In 1977, the shock and fear created by Packer's cricket 'circus' caused David Evans - later a Conservative MP and Luton Town chairman - to announce on television that his office-cleaning firm, Brengreen Holdings, was prepared to sponsor every England Test player to the tune of \u00a31,000. Evans invited someone else to join him in a total sponsorship deal. Cornhill jumped at the opportunity. In 10 days they finalised an agreement to sponsor England Test matches and, indirectly, the national team. It is thought to have been the first Test match sponsorship outside the sub-continent. </p> <p>In retrospect, Cornhill's gamble has not been as big as Packer's at blackjack. Over the 23 years, the insurance company have put \u00a327.7 million into cricket. And they have seen their brand awareness rise from an almost invisible two per cent in 1978 to 27 per cent today. </p> <p>Much to the delight of the sponsoring beer company, village cricket has come up with an old-fashioned stereotype for today's annual final at Lord's. Former winners Elvaston of Derbyshire, who play Eversholt of Bedfordshire, boast a player whose size greatly exceeds that of the traditional blacksmith. Pete Moult is a trainee chef with a 54-inch chest for whom the sponsors, Wadworth's 6X, had to make a special shirt. At Elvaston, they cheerfully describe how, when last weighed, the big man pushed the scales well beyond their 23-stone limit. 'He's a batsman and a bowler,' says a spokesman. And where does he field? 'Out of the way. He doesn't move far.' </p> <p>*****</p> <p>For once, The Oval isn't revealing its ribs. That is, the lines of the irrigation pipes that show up when the outfield gets brown. For one thing, it has been a moist summer. More importantly, The Oval has gone ahead of all our major Test grounds by installing a sophisticated network of pop-up sprinklers. Sixty-five of them lurk just beneath the surface in holes small enough for a player to be unaware that they are there beneath his boot. </p> <p>Computer control allows each to 'play', in sequence, for between one and 10 minutes. In theory, they could be activated overnight, without need of supervision. Wisely, groundsman Paul Brind has not yet gone that far. Cricket grounds, water, computers and Murphy's Law are not a good combination. </p> <p>*****</p> <p>The re-emergence of Alvin Kallicharran has both delighted and frustrated Middlesex in the national over-50's tournament. As already recounted here, the little left-hander had scored heavily in earlier rounds, with no innings below 60, but a business trip to the West Indies saw him arrive back at Heathrow last Wednesday at 12.30 - with the semi-final against Lancashire due to start in Manchester at 1.30. He could have flown on, and joined the game late, but Middlesex felt it wouldn't look good. 'Any other player, yes, but with someone of his stature it seemed morally wrong.' Kalli-less Middlesex lost.</p>",

  "<p>The rain clouds were gathering, Gough and Caddick had come off and West Indies were comfortably placed at 32 without loss. A draw seemed the only possible result. </p> <p>But nothing is certain with the new soaraway successful England team. Cork bowled a wicket maiden. White responded with a double-wicket maiden - including Brian Lara bowled round his legs for his first golden duck against England ('Can't play the English quicks, that lad'). </p> <p>In the next over Cork levelled the wicket score at 2-2 only for White to edge ahead 3-2 with the precious wicket of Sarwan. West Indies 39 for five, 42 runs away from saving the follow-on. England with the first series win against West Indies for 31 years in the bag. Cue general euphoria. </p> <p>And the real hero was a man who was averaging a little over seventeen for the series, doesn't bowl, and during the extraordinary opening hour didn't even field the ball. England would not have been in the position they were in yesterday if it hadn't been for Michael Atherton. </p> <p>To understand this, you have to cast your mind back to the first Test, in which no England batsman made more than 34 in either innings and they were walloped by the Windies. Then move on to Lord's and that extraordinary 100th Test. On the first day, West Indies cruised past 150 for one wicket. On the second day, a part of all four innings was played on the same day for the first time in Test history. After all the mayhem, England needed 180-odd to win with all their wickets standing. The most important of which was Mike Atherton's. </p> <p>On this everyone at Lord's was agreed. 'It all depends on Mike,' said one. 'It's up to Mike,' said another. 'Mike needs to make 70,' said yet another. There could be no argument. If Mike succeeded England would level the series; if he failed they would be 2-0 down and effectively out of the series. </p> <p>The next morning it was Atherton v Ambrose. Time after time Curtly came in from the Pavilion End, beat the outside of Atherton's bat and grimaced. Time after time Atherton grinned back at him. It was even better than his confrontation with Allan Donald. </p> <p>He batted for 214 minutes in making his 45 and by the time he was finally out, England needed fifty-something to win with six wickets in hand. Naturally, they nearly blew it. Indeed, if it hadn't been for that most unlikely of heroes, Dominic Cork, they would have blown it. Unlikely because ever since he took a hat-trick against West Indies five years earlier, The Corkster had being convinced that he was destined to be a hero. And pratfall after pratfall had done nothing to rid him of this conviction. </p> <p>But this, at last, was his moment. Jumping up and down like a nervous Derek Randall and barking instructions like a parody sergeant-major, Cork took control and guided his side to victory. </p> <p>Yet without Atherton there could have been no Cork. And no victory. </p> <p>All sports rely on streaks and it is only with hindsight that you can pinpoint the moment when a losing run ended and a winning sequence began. The Saturday of the Lord's Test may prove to be such a turning point. </p> <p>If it is, then Atherton may be able to do something he must have been despairing of ever doing, leaving the Test team on a high. Last week, in an interview with The New Statesman he said: 'I can't really envisage going beyond next year. Not much longer than a year, that's for sure. </p> <p>'Whether it be for Lancashire or England, the next year would be the maximum period. (Pause.) I said that without really thinking about it.' Which is normally a sign that someone means what they're saying. </p> <p>In between now and then England play Pakistan (a), Sri Lanka (a) and Australia (h). On known form you'd expect them to lose all three but that's the funny thing about streaks. Once one gets up and running, the most unlikely results occur. </p> <p>It may be that Atherton - after 102 Tests, more than half as captain - is finally about to be a member of a successful team. </p> <p>No one deserves it more. Throughout the Nineties - the infamous dirt-in-pocket episode and his damaged back notwithstanding - he has, unflinching and uncomplaining, given his all for his side. There has been no dissent and no tacky OK! covers. He has kept his head down and kept on batting. </p> <p>Now as he approaches the end of a distinguished - in terms of personal performance, if not team results - career, it would be gratifying if he were to receive the success that has long been due to him.</p>",
  "<p>Last week's historic meeting in Zurich about how football should respond to the European Union's determination to ban transfer fees underlines more than ever exactly why sport, and professional football in particular, needs to be given a special protocol. </p> <p>Perhaps encouraged by the Bosman ruling, the EU is interfering in sport as never before. But the best service the EU could perform for sport would be granting the sort of special consideration - a protocol - which it needs if it is to survive the huge changes the EU is proposing. </p> <p>The arts and broadcasting are already recognised as special cases, in that they are not mere 'businesses', so why not sport too? The issue of transfer fees and players' contracts illustrates perfectly why sport is different and should not be treated as just another business. </p> <p>At first sight it may appear right and proper that footballers should have the same rights as other workers. But it is not that simple. Business has copyright and patent laws to encourage and reward research and development; the transfer system is football's way of investing in development of talent. If football is to be compared to a business, it needs similar protection, and not de-regulation. </p> <p>The EU wants to end big-money transfers such as those we saw this summer involving Hernan Crespo and Luis Figo. But even if transfer fees are abolished, Figo's market value would still be \u00a337 million because that is how much a club is prepared to pay for his labour. So the European Commission's plans would mean that a player's market value would end up being reflected in his wages instead of the transfer fee. Thus Figo and anyone else at world-class level could soon be earning \u00a3250,000-a-week - that's \u00a335,000 a day - which is the equivalent of \u00a337 million over three years of a contract. Top players' wages will explode. </p> <p>Any large increase in wages would further undermine the financial viability of a sport in which Deloitte &amp; Touche report that players' salaries already account for 95 per cent of the turnover of Third Division clubs and 58 per cent of the Premier League's turnover. </p> <p>Without wishing to sound alarmist, this could destroy many of the smaller clubs in England, Scotland and across Europe. These clubs rely on selling players on to bigger clubs for a fee to help keep afloat. A club like Crewe Alexandra would have their incentive to develop players such as David Platt, Neil Lennon and Ashley Ward removed at a stroke. The way these clubs have managed to stay alive, their lifeline, would disappear. Unless, of course, the EU accepts that proper compensation should be paid. </p> <p>Among the proposals agreed in Zurich by Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League and Fifpro, the international confederation of players unions, was that there must be a compensation system so that when a player under 24 moves clubs, the selling club are rewarded for the part they have played in his development. The amount would be based on the club's training programme, the value of the player's contract and his first-team and international experience. Without such a system, the EU's latest foray into sport could destroy countless clubs and jobs - footballers' jobs. People may wonder why the chief executive of the players union is arguing against a move that will make many of my members significantly richer. The answer is that, without the EU agreeing to proper compensation and the creation of an annual 'transfer window' during which players can move - then and only then - the price would be too high. There's no point creating greater freedom for professional footballers if as a result of that freedom there are fewer clubs left to employ them. </p> <p>While I understand the EU's motives in pursuing this, they have barely consulted the players, the 'workers' whose rights they are so keen to extend. If they had I would have told them that none of our 3,000 members is unhappy with the current system. The present standard contract gives players security and protection to a much greater degree than they would have under the EU's proposals. </p> <p>If this change is not thought about, planned and implemented in a sensible way, football clubs will become like Euston station, with different players arriving, staying for a short while and leaving again almost non-stop. Nobody wants that - and the EU should do everything possible to ensure that this chaos is avoided. Fans certainly do not want that. </p> <p>Concern has already been expressed by a wide range of respected voices in football, including the Uefa president, Lennart Johansson, that the increasing influx of foreign players into British football is making it harder for fans to identify with certain teams because so few British players play for them, sometimes none at all. </p> <p>The special protocol would recognise that sport was indeed different from any other business, and therefore grant it a limited exemption from European principles of free trade and free movement of labour. </p> <p>The key point is this: sport is not simply another business. Most businesses try to reduce competition through mergers and market forces; sport without competition, without 'uncertainty of result', would descend into monopoly and monotony. </p> <p>The recycling of money through football via transfer fees helps guarantee that clubs can potentially 'do a Wimbledon'. We end that trickle-down of funds at our peril. A protocol would enshrine in law sport's right to sometimes do things differently. In the view of Fifa, Uefa and the PFA, it would also let us control the influx of foreign players into our game. </p> <p>The movement of European players within the EU is unchecked because 'free movement of labour' is a sacrosanct principle. But surely there is a level beyond which 'free movement' is no longer beneficial. We could soon have a situation in football like the one in British ice hockey where there are only half-a-dozen English-born players left in the Super League; the national team suffers, obviously. While the EU encourages 'free movement of labour', it should also recognise that national and local identity are important too, especially in sport, and that a balance has to be struck between the two. </p> <p>Sport is different. Thirteen of the 15 EU member states support some sort of protocol for sport. The only two governments that do not are the Danes and our own. Although the Culture Secretary, Chris Smith, backs us, I understand that the Trade and Industry Secretary, Stephen Byers, is against a protocol, believing that it would 'open the floodgates' and that other industries would start demanding special treatment. </p> <p>Anyone who cares about the future of sport should back the campaign for a protocol. Football fans can help by writing to their MP, MEP or even Tony Blair, asking them to urge the EU to give sport the special consideration it needs and deserves. </p> <p><em>Gordon Taylor is chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association</em></p>",
  "<p>West Ham United have turned down another bid to sell Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United for \u00a315million - despite knowing that transfers could be scrapped within a year. Hammers boss Harry Redknapp admits that the central defender could walk out of Upton Park at the end of the season, but still decided to keep him at the club. In his column in the Racing Post, Redknapp said: 'Leeds have come back in with another \u00a315million bid for Rio Ferdinand and the news that transfers could soon be scrapped made it a massive temptation to sell. 'I had a long talk with the chairman and we decided to resist again, even though in a year Rio could just walk out. 'That's what could well happen if the European Commission gets its way and bans transfers.' Redknapp believes scrapping the transfer system would be 'a disastrous move' with players' salaries spiralling out of control. He added: 'We'd have to put a revolving door in at Upton Park because we wouldn't be able to pay the wages.' </p> <p>Paul Merson claims he will have to go into management when he stops playing football to avoid ending up like former Manchester United star George Best. The Aston Villa midfielder has battled against alcoholism, drug addiction and gambling for several years and spent some time in rehabilitation while he was at Arsenal. </p> <p>Now Merson has revealed that watching a recent documentary about the sad decline of Best, who was recently admitted to a London hospital suffering from a liver condition brought on by years of alcohol abuse, has made him think hard about his own future. </p> <p>'It hit home when he said he turned to drink after he finished playing football because he felt lost without the game he had known all his life,' Merson told FourFourTwo magazine. </p> <p>'That frightened me. I was sitting on my own indoors and thought, \"I don't want the same thing to happen to me.\" </p> <p>'What happens when you finish with football? What a horrible feeling that must be. I want to stay in football, because I can't be without the game. </p> <p>'I would like to go into management and being a player-manager is something that appeals to me, especially as you are out there with your team. I know I have to start planning for life without football so it doesn't just hit me.' </p> <p>World Cup qualifying games continue today, with 15 ties taking place around the world. In Europe there are seven games, the most attractive of which is Italy's visit to Hungary. Giovanni Trapattoni takes over from Dino Zoff at the helm of the azzurri and the game in Budapest will not be an easy start for the beaten Euro 2000 finallists. </p> <p>Italy's Serie A does not start for another month, because of the country's participation in the Olympic football tournament in Australia, so his squad could suffer from some rustiness, which means this group-eight encounter could throw up a surprise result. </p> <p>The other match in the group sees Romania host Lithuania. England's conquerors at both France 98 and this summer's European championship must get used to life without the talismanic Gheorghe Hagi. </p> <p>Portugal will have a first chance to put their heartbreaking semi-final defeat at the hands of eventual champions France in Euro 2000 behind them when they head to Tallinn where they will tackle Estonia, who beat Andorra 1-0 in the first European World Cup qualifier on 16 August. </p> <p>On the other side of the Atlantic, qualifying is in full swing. In Concacaf group C, the picture could become much clearer by late tonight. Canada need an away win in Trinidad &amp; Tobago in order to cling on to any hope of progressing. Panama would appear to need a miracle in Mexico City. In group D, Jamaica play hosts to tiny St Vincent while in group E the US face a crucial game with Guatemala while Costa Rica could make qualification easier if they beat Barbados. </p> <p>Brazil's defeat to Chile still reverberates in South America. The four-time world champions definitely need a convincing win over Bolivia to get back on track. Uruguay face a crucial home match against Ecuador who have only one point fewer. </p> <p>Argentina travel to Lima with the intention of extending their lead in the qualifying competition in South America where they should have little trouble in disposing of Peru. The top four go through automatically.</p>",
  "<p>Neil McCann's late winning goal - left-footing the ball over the line after the marauding Don Hutchison's shot had been deflected across the goalmouth - gave a mediocre Scotland team a victorious start to their World Cup campaign on a night in Riga when they came perilously close to embarrassment. </p> <p>Most professional observers who travel with Scotland tend to expect the worst and hope for the best, a philosophy which seemed entirely appropriate to a match in which Latvia spent disconcertingly lengthy periods in control. </p> <p>Craig Brown's extraordinary decision to play Matt Elliott, the towering Leicester City defender, in attack may have been an attempt at introducing a wild card which would trump whatever pre-planning the Englishman, Gary Johnson, the coach of the home side, may have formulated. </p> <p>But the rippling effect on his own team, pulling Don Hutchison back into midfield and allowing the veteran Tom Boyd to return to the wide-right role in which he seems to have no future under Martin O'Neill at Celtic seemed to be more damaging than anything Johnson may have contrived. </p> <p>During a first half in which the Scots barely raised a creditable attempt on the home goal, all of the bullish confidence the manager had exuded on the eve of the game was made to look like seriously flawed judgment. Elliott seemed to put the frighteners on the home side to such an extent that they decided to keep the ball most of the time in the Scottish half of the field. </p> <p>Inspired by Vitalijs Astafjevs, from midfield, who seemed to be never off the ball, releasing the quick forwards, Marian Pahars and Andreijs Stolcers, into the area with alarming regularity, the Latvians, however, betrayed their own potentially fatal weakness - an inability to convert the opportunities presented them. </p> <p>Shots were either pulled or sliced weakly wide or too high, and, close to the inter val, when Astafjevs provided Imants Bleidelis with a golden opportunity close to the six-yard box on the right, Neil Sullivan made the save when he deflected the low drive just wide of his right-hand post. </p> <p>Having made a terrible start to the game where they were seemingly incapable of completing a pass during the first five minutes, the Scots looked anxious and clumsy, threatening only mildly with the occasional corner kick. Then fact that it took them 15 minutes to win the first of these signified their ineffectiveness. </p> <p>Most of theplayers looked unhappy in their allotted positions, and Elliott looked like a defender on the loose when he left-footed the ball straight at Aleksandrs Kolinko after Hutchison had headed a corner kick from McCann down towards the 'striker' </p> <p>In fact, the majority of the visiting team during the first half - Colin Hendry, Christian Dailly and David Weir in central defence can be excused - were disappointing, although McCann, who constantly appeared to be too easily swept aside by his opponents on the left, had a drive which would have counted had it not been intercepted by the chest of Kolinko. </p> <p>Even the home supporters, however, would not have been surprised by the second-half transformation of the Scots, in personnel, deployment and the overall standard of play. With Elliott recalled to central defence, Gary Naysmith of Hearts replacing Callum Davidson wide on the left and Colin Cameron, also of Hearts, in midfield to replace Weir, Brown resorted to his favoured 3-5-2 formation, with McCann and Dodds in attack supported by the always-eager Cameron. And Scotland completed more passes in the opening two minutes than they had during the entire first period with one scintillating move almost resulting in what would have been an exceptional goal. </p> <p>Ferguson played the ball down the left to McCann, whose precise cross was met by Dodds and knocked back to Cameron, the midfielder's right-foot drive from the edge of the area forcing Kolinko to dive left to make the save near his post. </p> <p>The Scots were suddenly suffused with a composure which had seemed unattainable earlier in the match, and it had a predictable effect on the Latvians, making them much more edgy in defence. They did, to their credit, however, retain a willingness to skirmish into forward areas which might have brought rewards but for the vital blocking tackles of Hendry, Elliott and Dailly. </p> <p>Brown's team should have taken the lead midway through the second half when McCann's tenacious work on the left allowed the Rangers' man to deliver a precise centre to Dodds, utterly without challenge as he came in to meet the ball from the right, some eight yards from goal. Unfortunately, the little Rangers striker sliced the header several feet wide. </p> <p>Not even the most fertile imagination could even attempt to parlay this performance into an impressive start to Scotland's campaign. And a significant improvement will be required if they are to cope with looming assignments against apparently more powerful adversaries such as Belgium and Croatia. </p> <p> <strong> Latvia</strong> Kolinko, Laizans, Lobanovs, Stepanovs, Blagonadezdins, Bleidelis, Ivanovs, Astafjevs, Rubins, Pahars, Stolcers.

  "<p>FIFA has accepted that players will no longer be sold for exorbitant sums of money. Uefa have voiced their outrage, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has talked of a strike, and other reactions from Franz Beckenbauer through Bobby Charlton to Ron Noades have verged on the apocalyptic: the end of the game as we know it. In the new era scores of clubs across Britain could die, starved of transfer revenue, while top players could be earning \u00a3250,000 a week. And all thanks to the European Commission's simple but far-reaching insistence that clubs must not make a profit out of players' career movement. </p> <p>The EC decided to investigate the transfer system after Italian side Perugia complained that they should not have to pay a transfer fee for a Swiss-Italian layer, Massimo Lombardo. Fees were a restraint on trade, claimed Perugia. The EC agreed - and that means football will undergo revolutionary changes whether it likes it or not. Now that the key principle of non-profit transfers has been established by Brussels and accepted by the game's world governing body, only the details remain to be worked out. What system will replace the way things have always been done? Will compensation be payable to the club a player leaves, and if so how should that be calculated? And will the EC accept Fifa's proposal that compensation should always be paid for player aged 18-24 in recognition of the cost of training them, or will that be deemed restraint of trade too? </p> <p>Like the Bosman ruling in 1995, this latest EC bombshell on sport is based on the four basic freedoms as enshrined in the Treaty of Rome - the free movement of goods, capital, people and labour. These are sacrosanct, inviolable principles which, as football is finding out, are applied rigorously across the board. That is why the EC has now decided that transfer fees represent a restriction on the free movement of labour, on the grounds that they can stop a player joining the club of his choice. In the Eurocrats' view, footballers should not be treated any different to any other group of workers. They believe players should have the same rights as everyone else, including the ability to leave their employment after a set notice period. That is why the PFA chief executive, Gordon Taylor, warns that 'football clubs will become like Euston station', with players coming and going with dizzying frequency. </p> <p>Now that the EC has told football 'Thou shalt not profit from transfers' the game - two years after Brussels advised soccer to come up with a replacement system - is finally trying to work out what this all means and how it will cope with such traumatic change. In Zurich last Thursday Fifa, backed by the Premier League and Gordon Taylor on behalf of players' unions around Europe, suggested a new three-tier system: </p> <p> \u0095 No international transfers on players under 18; </p> <p> \u0095 Compensation to be paid for those aged 18-24 who have been developed by the selling club; </p> <p> \u0095 No transfer fees of any sort for those over 24. </p> <p>The media reported all this on Friday as what will happen. But it's not necessarily so. </p> <p>First, Uefa have objected to Fifa's plans and criticised them for throwing in the towel too quickly. Second, and much more important, the EC has not agreed to Fifa's wishes. For example, it has already said that the proposed ban on under-18 transfers is almost certainly a breach of the principle of free movement of labour. And it may also refuse to endorse the compensation plan. It doesn't happen with other 'workers', so why should footballers be treated differently? </p> <p>However, the ban on transfer fees should bring some benefits. Unscrupulous agents could well disappear and European football may at last bring in American-style rules, such as an annual draft of talent, designed to keep the sport competitive. </p> <p>Football agent Terry Parris, who represents Premiership players, believes the end of transfer fees should also mean the end of rogue agents, the unscrupulous ones who make a killing by continually moving their client from club to club, picking up a slice of signing-on fees as he goes. In one such move only a month ago, one agent asked for, and was given, \u00a31.2million simply for persuading his client to sign on the dotted line for a Premiership club. </p> <p>'Agents will have to work much harder and will no longer be able to get away with just waiting around for the next big payday. They will no longer be getting their percentage of players' moves, so they will have to become more aggressive in pursuing commercial opportunities for their clients,' says Parris. Agents will become more accountable to their players, and that's a good thing, he says. </p> <p>However, because the explosion in wages will mean many players earn as much in a week as some small businesses turn over in a year, footballers will need a far greater range of advisers. Commercial negotiators, lawyers and investment advisers will be needed. Parris predicts that, as very few people can offer all such help, agencies will take over managing players' affairs from individual agents. </p> <p>Sports lawyer Darren Bailey, managing partner of sports law specialists Townleys, says Nicolas Anelka's short-lived stay at Highbury highlights the intrinsically unfair nature of the transfer system as it has existed until now. </p> <p>'Arsenal bought him for \u00a3500,000 from Paris Saint Germain and sold him two years later for a profit of \u00a322.5 million. Yet PSG, who developed Anelka, got nothing,' explains Bailey. 'In future PSG would receive compensation for the first deal, and after that any money would go straight to the player.' Which, if the 'buying' club were still willing to invest as much, would be an awful lot of cash. </p> <p>Under whatever new system is brought in, clubs like Arsenal will have to accustom themselves to there no longer being any profit in transfers; there will be only compensation for 'research and development' - the nurturing of talent. Players under 24 might be regarded as still being 'in development' and so a fee would still be payable as a reward for their investment of time and teaching. </p> <p>Bailey agrees with the bodies around the table at last Thursday's crisis summit in Zurich - Fifa, the Premier League and players' boss Gordon Taylor - that, for the sake of football's integrity, players in the brave new world post-transfer fees should have to stay at a club for at least a year. Players, clubs, agents and federations - everyone would agree to impose this, as they do in the United States. Allied to a transfer window and long periods of notice, it would be easy to ensure that a player finished the season at the same club where he started. One-year contracts would be the norm. Each club could have a roster at the start of the season, with the names of everyone in their squad, and those on it would not be eligible to play for another team until the next rosters were drawn up. </p> <p>Bailey predicts that an elite group of players, and elite group of clubs, will benefit from the pending changes. 'But is that right for football?' he asks. He cites the example of America, where players, agents and administrators jointly endorse genuine collective agreements, but doubts that European football - riven by too many adversarial relationships - could agree on anything similar. </p> <p>Significantly, it could be in a new pan-European league of the sort made more likely by the EC's action that a draft sys tem would work effectively, with a salary cap, suggests Bailey. The league would own the registration of the players and pick them by rota. </p> <p>'We've had some American sports people over for a conference and they just can't believe some of the practices in Europe,' says Bailey. Until now transfers have been regulated by nothing more than a 'mystery market' which has been impossible to follow and fluctuates wildly. Clubs have apparently picked transfer values out of thin air. There has been no objective criteria for measuring a player's worth, and the recent deals involving Luis Figo (\u00a337m) and Hernan Crespo (\u00a335m) could not have come at a worse time for Fifa, highlighting as they did the overblown, overheated nature of the beast. </p> <p>Bailey also highlights some potential pitfalls in Fifa's proposed three-tier system of dealing differently with players in different age groups. In theory a club could sign a boy at nine, train him until he turns 18, get one season out of him on a one-year contract agreed by his agent and then lose him to another club. Result: their investment in research and development would be a waste of money. Also, do the new short-term contracts mean players who pick up injuries or lose form could be given notice by the club? So not all players will benefit. Clearly many crucial elements of the replacement transfer system need some hard thinking. Another problem will be international call-ups: who would pay the seven-figure compensation if a club lost a player to an injury suffered in a World Cup game, for instance? </p> <p>Another top sports lawyer, Jay Gillman-Wells of London firm Nicholson, Graham and Jones, knows about high finance and talent management through her stints with marketing giants ISL and IMG. 'The American system works,' she says. 'It's what the public wants, it's what the public gets and it keeps their sport competitive.' Giving the sporting public what they want. Now there's a novel concept. </p> <p> denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</p>",

  "<p>Trading standards officers are cracking down on what they describe as 'virtual reality pricing' by some tour operators. There are concerns that fluid pricing - whereby prices go up or down depending on availability and demand - is becoming widespread among the major holiday companies. An investigation is under way to find out whether certain tour operators are breaking the law by printing misleading brochure prices. </p> <p>Thomson brought the issue into the spotlight by printing a warning in its 2001 brochures that prices may go up or down, prompting concern that other operators will follow suit and make brochure prices redundant. </p> <p>Trading Standards Officer Bruce Treloar said: 'We want to avoid a situation where people are going into a travel agent with a brochure to book a holiday and being charged \u00a350 more because the operator has decided to shove the prices up.' </p> <p>The Package Travel Regulations state that if a brochure is produced it must give an accurate price. Legally, operators can add a surcharge after the holiday has been sold for unforeseen extras such as fuel charges, fluctuating exchange rates and airport taxes. All other extras, including flight sup plements, should be included in the brochure price. </p> <p>Treloar said operators were not always upfront about these last-minute price hikes, occasionally disguising them as 'flight supplements' or selling packages at a higher price under another name or brand. </p> <p>Tour operators say they are just responding to market forces: the more demand there is for a holiday, the more people will have to pay. A Thomson spokeswoman said: 'We are living in the age of the internet and customers have come to expect real-time pricing. The whole e-commerce culture is built on \"what's it worth now\". </p> <p>'Brochures struggle to keep up with this and by printing the warning we are just being honest and open about a practice that is widespread.' </p> <p>Operators are looking for ways around the problem, one of which is to stop printing brochure prices altogether. </p> <p>Airtours managing director Richard Carrick said next year's brochures could feature price bands which would give a minimum and maximum price. </p> <p>'Brochures are out of date from the moment they are printed. We owe it to customers to find a better way of indicating the price of a holiday,' said Carrick.</p>",

  "<p> I am going to crash in four seconds. Momentarily, as my paraglider skirts the edge of the hill, I recall my practice emergency landings. But to do a parachute roll I need to land on my feet and I can already tell they won't be the bit that hits the ground first. Second one... I try to move my left hand to change the direction of the canopy away from the hillside but my arm, entangled in one of the brake lines, is paralysed into inac tion. Second two... the canopy skims the ground, as though I am performing some daring manoeuvre with a stunt kite. Second three... as the right edge of the canopy scrapes along the low scrub, my wing starts to crumple and deflate. Second four... impact. For a few, longer seconds there is silence and a mental and physical numbness. Then my right knee and thigh scream into life. God, that hurt. </p> <p>Several weeks before my paragliding course, family and friends began warning me about how dangerous paragliding is. Now, I will have to face those told-you-so looks. But let's keep things in perspective. Any insurance firm will advise that riding and skiing are dangerous sports too. So why is a cheap skiing holiday in the Alps virtually on the national curriculum? And why does every 12-year-old girl either take riding lessons or long to take them? </p> <p>My desire to learn to paraglide was roused several years ago. As I was crossing a field, a dark shape moved silently over me and, looking up, I saw a huge bird hovering in front of the sun. Then almost at once it turned, and I saw my mistake: it was a man hanging beneath a thin whisp of colour. Over the far end of the field he had circled, found some lift and risen until he was no bigger than a distant gull. Since that day I had wanted to be a birdman too. </p> <p>And here, on the Isle of Wight, I was getting my chance. Phil Keen, of High Adventure, the island's paragliding school, had invited me to a two-day introductory course. He met me at his base in Freshwater Bay with a dozen of his trainee pilots. Apart from me and another novice, Tim, they had already earned, if not their wings, at least a feather or two. It takes anything from 10 days to a lifetime to gain a paragliding pilot's licence - depending on your co-ordination, commitment and the vagaries of the British weather. Although not everyone who attends wants to learn to fly - Phil also caters for casual thrillseekers, including stag parties - those who complete the course usually pass in anything from eight to 15 flying days. </p> <p>The school's flying site on Compton Down, overlooking the bay, offers dramatic views of Tennyson Down, the poet's favourite haunt, and the great chalk pillars of the Needles. There are paragliding schools across Britain but beginners could do no better than learn on the island. Because the wind arriving on the down comes straight off the sea, it is undisturbed by the obstacles - houses, hedges, trees - that usually cause turbulence. </p> <p>Or rather the wind would be perfect were it not on this particular day also bringing in waves of fog. No matter, Phil says, Tim and I can practise take-offs even in low visibility. As he and the advanced party disappear into the mist, Tim and I are left with two instructors - Phil's girlfriend, Sam, and Mike, a wiry Yorkshireman who when not airborne is a guard at Albany jail. Mike opens out our canopies, revealing a complex array of lines connecting them to the harness. These lines determine the canopy's shape and angle in flight, ensure its internal pockets are filled with air, and are used to control the paraglider's direction. Mastery of them, as I will discover during my accident, when I have grown a little too confident, is essential. </p> <p>Do-it-yourself flying started in the Sixties when a few brave souls put their faith in the aerodynamics of a triangular bit of climbing frame and sail. The hangglider was not easy to master: it had a fixed wing that needed to be carefully transported and assembled, and then the weighty frame carried up a hill before a flight. Not surprising then that a young upstart was stealing the show in the Eighties. The paraglider needed no frame, could be packed into a rucksack and weighed only a few pounds. And best of all you could be airborne after just a few hours' training. Now many flying schools have abandoned hanggliding altogether. </p> <p>On fine weekends groups of paragliders can be seen crowding the skies above dozens of ridges across the country, but the sport's profile has remained at ground level. This is surprising because from the few thousand members of the British Hanggliding and Paragliding Association (BHPA) have come a crop of world champions, both male and female. According to Phil, the reason is simple: the weather. While pilots here are forced to develop finely attuned antennae to seek out the fickle thermals that offer the chance of lift to several thousand feet, the French and Italians start out at such heights, selecting an Alpine slope and pointing their canopies in the direction of a bar below. </p> <p>Once we have completed our checks, Sam tells us to prepare for take-off. It all seems a bit sudden - after all, we have been out of doors for less than an hour. But I soon realise why she is happy to let us loose. Sam calls it bunnyhopping - but, as far as I am concerned, it involves running downhill mimicking a dodo that refuses to acknowledge its evolutionary drawback. The slope is so gentle and we are so far out of the wind that even when I charge downhill at full speed I am lucky to get more than a few feet off the ground. Every time I take off, my legs still frantically pedalling mid-air for my return to earth, I have visions of Terry-Thomas in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines . Is the fog hiding a thick layer of pigsty muck waiting to receive me, slapstick fashion, at the end of my flight? </p> <p>No one has prepared me for how exhausting learning to paraglide will be. Things are easier when you can remain aloft, but for a trainee each flight involves losing hundreds of feet of height in seconds. After landing you have to gather up the canopy and drag it to the top again. A day's training may require walking up the hill a dozen times. Do the maths and you realise why every muscle aches. </p> <p>After half a dozen practice flights, Tim and I are taken to join Phil and the others on the big slope. They have waited all morning for a chance to fly but only as we arrive does the sun finally tease the mist apart. The two of us are moved down the slope to do some advanced bunnyhopping, while the others soar impressively overhead from the ridge. After each flight we are allowed to start a little further up the hill. Finally, running from half way up the slope I realise that not only have my madly gyrating feet left the ground but that the ground is leaving me. I am actually flying - gracelessly and without control, but it is flight. Almost immediately the wind changes its mind, withdraws its lift and I am sinking. Back on earth the flight is little more than a brief and heady blur. But looking back I can see I have flown several hundred yards. </p> <p>Next comes my little accident. It is an important reminder of the seriousness of the sport. 'Don't ever forget that as soon as you get in the harness you are a pilot - you are in charge of an aircraft,' warns Phil. As though appalled by my negligence, the fog builds again and flying has to be abandoned. </p> <p>The next day the sun has triumphed. From the ridge I can see not only the valley floor 300ft below, but fields stretching to the cliffs and Tennyson Down. Phil gives me the all-clear and I pull hard on the lines forcing the canopy to rise. Briefly the canopy holds me as though I am a puppet and it a giant, unpredictable hand, but as I strain to beat the drag the wing slowly starts to move with me. I gain control and then run with all my might towards the edge of the ridge. As I reach its lip, the canopy tugs on my shoulders and takes my weight. Suddenly there is a surge of air lifting me. I am riding a thermal, taking me higher than the cliffs and the down. Hundreds of feet below, my dark outline is hurrying across the valley floor, chasing a crow startled out of the grass by the monstrous shadow over it. Finally I am the birdman. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Cook undertook a two-day introductory paragliding course - cost \u00a3150 - with High Adventure (01983 752322).

  "Trevor Phillips, one of London's most senior politicians, yesterday accused police officers who had attacked the Notting Hill Carnival of stoking up a race row. <p>The chair of the Greater London Assembly said the debate on policing revellers had been twisted to reawaken old complaints that the Macpherson report on the death of teenager Stephen Lawrence had stopped officers confronting black criminals. </p> <p>'What some of the police and some of the critics are trying to do is reopen the Macpherson debate,' he said. 'They are trying to make it about race when Carnival is no longer even a black event. </p> <p>'They are trying to reopen the argument about the police having control of the streets. That was last year's battle, it was settled, it was closed and they should forget it.' </p> <p>London's Mayor Ken Livingstone, his race adviser Lee Jasper and Phillips have been working on proposals likely to be announced this week for a review of how the Notting Hill Carnival can be 'modernised' to maximise safety, after the two deaths at last week's event. </p> <p>'Our position is that what happened was obviously very serious and these things have to be properly investigated, but this is an event of one and a half million people, it attracts all sorts of people and all kinds of things happen,' said Phillips. </p> <p>'To use this as an opportunity to throw carnival itself into doubt is grotesque.' </p> <p>Livingstone is expected to echo his comments this week when he announces the review, involving carnival organisers, police, the London Arts Board and other interested bodies. </p> <p>It will look at expanding the carnival over a wider area of Notting Hill, and raising more money - including the possibility of a GLA grant - so that more carnival stewards can be deployed. </p> <p>'The opportunity is here to modernise this thing, which is something I have long wanted to do,' Phillips added. </p> <p>'My fundamental fear is not about crime at all, but what if there is an accident, if a sound stage falls down, if there's a panic?

  "<p>When finance ministers gather in Prague later this month for the World Bank/IMF annual meeting, a crucial item on the agenda will be called 'Strengthening the international financial architecture'. </p> <p>But the recent G7 report on this subject suggests that now they are over their initial scare after the 1997 Asian crisis, finance ministers no longer envisage any radical reform of the global financial system. The report sees such crises as primarily due to faulty policies in individual countries, to be tackled by stricter IMF surveillance rather than a consequence of the endemic instability of global capital markets. </p> <p>There are three closely interrelated sources of instability in the present system: the volatility of international capital flows, bubbles in stock market prices and exchange rate instability. In a typical crisis, inflows of foreign capital and booms in share prices feed on each other and put upward pressure on exchange rates. Then a sudden reversal of sentiment leads to an outflow of capital, a stock market collapse and a fall in exchange rates, leading to bankruptcies and unemployment. The flood of bank lending from the West to the so-called 'Asian miracle' countries and its abrupt reversal was not a reflection of any weaknesses in macro-economic policies that could have been prevented by stricter IMF surveillance - rather it was tribute to their successful rates of growth. </p> <p>Improved surveillance of financial institutions by the IMF and national regulatory authorities could help to alert all concerned to the systemic risks being incurred by excessive investment lending to particular countries. But, there is no guarantee that such knowledge would in itself curb these excesses: it might only encourage others to get in on the act and make sure their investment portfolios follow the prevailing pattern. Nobody gets the sack for following the herd. </p> <p>One of the prime causes of instability in capital markets is excessive 'leverage', that is the ability to place a large bet on asset prices and interest or exchange rates, for only a small stake. When the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund was on the verge of collapse in 1998, and had to be rescued by a consortium, it was operating on a leverage ratio of over 25:1, with assets nominally valued at about $120 billion and a capital base of \u00a34.8 billion. A fall of only 4 per cent in the price of its assets would have been sufficient to wipe out the whole of its capital and leave it unable to repay its debt. </p> <p>A major objective of any reform of financial markets should be to reduce the amount of leverage in the system. The Basel committee on banking supervision has put forward proposals for adjusting the pattern of 'capital backing' for different types of loans; but it has notably failed to address the question of raising the general level of backing required, although if it was appropriate when first introduced, it must, with the growing use of derivatives, be too low today. </p> <p>The new financial stability forum set up by the G7 has acknowledged the importance of leverage, but has a long way to go before putting forward proposals for any comprehensive attack. One instrument for damping down speculation is the taxation of financial transactions. The time has come for a concerted international approach to taxing share transactions and for introducing a similar tax on foreign exchange transactions - the so-called Tobin tax. </p> <p>The most striking omission from discussions is any attempt to tackle exchange rate instability. This should be at the top of the IMF agenda. Crises apart, industry worldwide is now faced with the problem that exchange rates are dominated by movements in capital markets and may be wildly out of line with comparative costs in different countries. The only moves to achieve greater stability have been the extreme ones of either adopting a common currency in the EMU, or pegging a currency to the dollar. </p> <p>We should be examining ways of managing exchange rates flexibly enough to allow for changes in circumstances such as differing rates of inflation, but ensuring that otherwise rates remain stable. This applies both to the relation between the major currencies such as the euro, the dollar and the yen, and also within regional groupings such as the EMU and non-EMU countries in the EU. There has to be a two-tier approach, with differing arrangements in different regions and global management of the rates between them. </p> <p>Any such moves must be based on a recognition that exchange rates are a matter of mutual concern between trading partners, not, as current IMF doctrine suggests, something for which each country is responsible - with potential support from the IMF when it is in difficulties. </p> <p>Instead of being suspicious of regional initiatives as trespassing on its prerogatives, the Fund should encourage currency arrangements at regional level and see its role as that of providing the machinery for managing the relations between them. If smaller countries are to play a part, international economic co-operation must depend on a combination of regional and global arrangements to ensure that capital markets serve the needs of industry and trade rather than becoming a law unto themselves. </p> <p>Finance ministers seem to be under the illusion that because global financial markets have avoided any major incident for a year or two, there is no need for any changes in the system. If industrial managers failed to take safety precautions because no serious accidents had happened recently they would be regarded as criminally negligent. </p> <p>\u0095 John Grieve Smith is author of the Fabian Society pamphlet 'Closing the Casino: Reform of the Global Financial System'.</p>",
  "<p>It started with a roar, but ended in a whimper. <a href=\"http://www.jungle.com/\">Jungle.com</a>'s launch party a year ago was one of dotcom land's most lavish. Entrepreneur Steve Bennett's brash new Birmingham firm hired one of London's largest nightclubs, Tiger Tiger, and packed it with young models dressed in leopardskin bikinis. Tight Fit's hit The Lion Sleeps Tonight played as vodka splashed down a sculptured ice monkey. </p> <p>Backed by a \u00a35 million launch budget, jungle.com aimed to revolutionise music and computer buying on the internet. In February, at the height of the dotcom craze, 34-year-old Bennett appointed City advisers UBS Warburg to prepare for a stock market flotation. Barely six months after going live, bankers were talking of a \u00a3750m valuation. The hyperbole made <a href=\"http://www.boo.com/\">boo.com</a> look tame. </p> <p>The reality turned out to be more sobering. Last Friday jungle.com was snapped up by Great Universal Stores (GUS), owner of the Argos catalogue chain, for \u00a325m, plus \u00a312m for its debt. Jungle.com staff learnt the news, appropriately enough, at a sales conference at Woburn Abbey Safari Park. </p> <p>The timing, too, was typically Bennett. This Saturday the former door-to-door computer salesman is due to marry his girlfriend and wanted the deal out of the way beforehand. His 30 per cent stake will net him \u00a37.5m - enough for a lavish honeymoon. But staff with share options who hoped to become millionaires overnight have seen their dreams dashed. </p> <p>GUS's takeover of jungle.com marks the demise of the third UK internet retailer in as many months. True, Bennett's landing has been softer than that of boo.com, which went spectacularly bust, or clickmango, which is winding itself up after running out of cash. But the background to jungle's sale shows the great 'e-tail' clear-out is here with a vengeance. </p> <p>'Any idea of the business being worth \u00a3750m was fantasy. The idea was that if you were a first mover, could get ahead and get scale, you could dominate the sector,' one top retail executive said. 'The concept never held water. The economics don't work. And the trend will continue. Clicks will go bust or seek refuge with bricks.' </p> <p>Despite the huge fanfare, with promises of a \u00a310m product giveaway, jungle.com had teething problems from the start. Swamped by millions of 'hits' on its website, it had difficulties fulfilling orders before Christmas. Bennett went on to BBC's Watchdog to defend his delivery record. Sources close to jungle say those niggles never went away, even though in May it bought the mail order and fulfilment side of Bennett's retail venture, Software Warehouse (which went bust last month), to beef itself up. </p> <p>Many staff and friends swear devotion to Bennett. But his zeal sometimes also caused friction, insiders say. Jungle's public relations agency, Cohn &amp; Wolf, quit in June, as did marketing director Patricia Rubio. </p> <p>None the less, if any e-tailer should have made it on its own, it was jungle. Its website was among the top five visited in the UK and the firm sold \u00a375m of goods up to July. Venture capitalists 3i put \u00a31m in at the start and pumped in more money in the summer. So what else went wrong? </p> <p>'The difficulty for Steve was jungle couldn't earn enough gross profits to cover costs,' one insider said. 'So month by month, creditworthiness got worse. Suppliers start to keep you on a short lease and you can't get enough stock. That affected jungle seriously.' </p> <p>By the time of the GUS deal, 3i already owned around a third of jungle, and Bennett's stake faced even further dilution, with no guarantee the credit issue would go away. </p> <p>As another retailer says: 'In those conditions, a sale is the sensible answer. There are many dotcoms in the same boat but few like jungle are attractive enough to the GUSs, Dixons or Kingfishers waiting to pick up the pieces.'</p>",
  "<p>I have not had a pay rise in the last eight years even though I have written, phoned and made personal representations to my employers. Am I entitled to a cost of living rise? Can I make retrospective claims?</p> <p> You do not have a legal right to a cost of living pay rise (unless you could argue the rather specialist case that you are earning less than people of the opposite sex who are doing a similar job).

  "<p>So you want to make a film? Before you do that, you have to prove you can. And the only way round this Catch-22 is to make your film a short, an affordable five- or 10-minute calling card showing your mastery of structure, photography and coaxing decent performances from your stars - at best drama students, most likely complete amateurs. </p> <p>Doug Miller, co-founder of the non-profit Short Film Bureau, thinks this is the best way to learn the trade. 'We took the perspective that for the British film industry to be globally competitive, its indigenous filmmakers have to truly understand the market they are working with, and the only way to truly understand that market is through participation in it.' The Short Film Bureau has set up the Filmgoer's Award for Cinematic Excellence (F.A.C.E), co-sponsored by The Observer, to offer a selection of shorts a choice spot before a mainstream feature. </p> <p>Kicking off a career via shorts has become a dominant British way: without a full-scale industry, the chances for directors to work their way from production assistant to second unit director or editor and then director are few and far between. That's not to say that the American directors don't also make shorts; the movie brat generation, especially, grew up with little home Super 8s or 16mm cameras in their hands; Spielberg and Scorsese both made notable short films. And George Lucas's debut feature THX 1138 was a reworking of a 15-minute movie he had made three years earlier. But they all had intermediate stages to go through before making films that their reputations rested on. </p> <p>In Britain, the short film can be all important. 'There is a difference in the way this industry matures its talent,' Miller contin ues. 'There is a culture in this country that says \"go out and prove yourself by making a short\". And that's not necessarily a bad thing. It creates an irony and a Catch-22 in that it is difficult for these new film-makers to get their shorts shown. But it is a good thing that film-makers grow up by making films, and the Lottery funding has really helped elevate the quality level.' </p> <p>You can see the successful products of this path: Shane Meadows, Guy Ritchie and Lynne Ramsey have all followed it, while successful short director Jamie Thraves won praise when his debut feature film The Low Down premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival recently. Ramsey is the shining example: being showered with prizes for her shorts put her in the position to make the daring Ratcatcher as a first film. </p> <p>Over recent years this seems to have taken over from the traditional route of learning the ropes at the BBC and then branching out into feature films. Opportunities no longer exist at the BBC in the way they did in the heyday of Alan Clarke, Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. Which is why the Short Film Bureau thinks that the directors whose work is in competition for the Audience Choice Awards are the future. 'The Bureau's emphasis is not on the short films themselves but on the film-makers,' says Miller. </p> <p>For not everyone sees short films as something you do on the way to making a feature. Most short-film directors will never make anything longer. And shorts do exist as an artform in themselves. The only real definition of a short film, after all, is that it is a film not long enough to be considered a feature. That can mean as long as an hour, although most festivals and the Short Film Bureau prefer under 30 minutes, while 10 minutes is the ideal time if you're hoping to run it before a feature; at the artier end of things, under a minute is not unknown. </p> <p>There are feature film directors who intersperse long movies with shorts. Not many, admittedly, but Werner Herzog has done it throughout his strange and never dull career, and so has Hal Hartley. </p> <p>Then there are the films that are so important that their shortness is often overlooked. Take the trio of Bu\u00f1uel and Dali's Un Chien Andalou (1929), Chris Marker's La Jet\u00e9e (1962) and Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising (1964) - three films that wouldn't have been viable at feature length, three films that took advantage of how much more abstract you can be in a shorter film, relying on startling imagery rather than narrative to keep people interested. All three were seen as strange, obscure and - in the case of Un Chien Andalou and Scorpio Rising - obscene, at the time, and all three have had an influence that has seeped into mainstream culture. </p> <p>This has been largely in indirect ways, but sometimes as blatant as a classic pop song ( Un Chien Andalou inspiring the Pixies's 'Debaser') or a hit film starring Bruce Willis (the reworking of La Jet\u00e9e as Twelve Monkeys ). </p> <p>All of Anger's films, in fact, are shorts, which must have been a matter of choice because at the same time Andy Warhol was proving that no-budget, experimental films could be as long as you liked. Which brings us to the blurred line between short films and film art: what are Gillian Wearing, Jane and Louise Wilson and Steve McQueen (the British artist, not the dead American icon) doing if not making short films? </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the world of short films that call themselves short films, things are bustling. All films, in this era of cheap DV cameras and iMacs, are easier to make. But budget, logic and a certain amount of realism mean most aspiring film-makers aren't starting out by shooting something three hours long. There are short film festivals besides the Audience Choice Awards: the Rushes Soho Shorts Festival that runs in August, Brief Encounters in Bristol in November and the BBC British Short Film Festival which runs in September. </p> <p>Apart from these there are the short film evenings, most famously run by London's Hallowe'en Society, which use shorts as part of a night out rather than a traditional filmgoing experience, often throwing in a bit of music along the way. I remember one event - not organised by the Hallowe'en Society - in which a couple of terrible shorts starring The Fall's Mark E. Smith were sandwiched around a ramshackle performance by the man himself. </p> <p>But that's the fun of short films: at best, you never know what you're going to get. Often, the ones that just leave you dumbfounded prove more memorable than the big star-slumming and the all too predictable plot twist you often get with the bigger budget variety. Too often, short films seem to have caught the disease of written short stories, relying on some kind of tricky punchline. </p> <p>Most of all, though, short films are prospering because they are perfect for the internet. Just this week a new and, at first glance, well-organised British short film website (<a href=\"http://www.in-movies.co.uk\">www.in-movies.co.uk</a>) was launched. Fears of mass web piracy of features seem exaggerated for the moment because of slow download times, but running a two-minute film seems to be within the capacity of most home computers. And so there are thousands of mini-movies out there. </p> <p>Which has to be good.

  "The body set up to defend human rights in Northern Ireland helped block the early introduction of the Human Rights Act for the Province. <p>The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has admitted that it delayed Peter Mandelson's plans to enact the legislation in the spring of this year because it could have bolstered loyalist rights to campaign during the marching season. </p> <p>Mandelson wanted to introduce the Act into Northern Ireland, which under Article 9 would have enshrined Orangemen's and Apprentice Boys' right to free assembly. </p> <p>But minutes of a meeting of the commission, set up by Labour following the Good Friday Agreement, warn about 'the proposed premature introduction of the Human Rights Act with respect to parades'. </p> <p>Unionists claim the commission's opposition to the early introduction of the Act is proof that the body is weighted in favour of nationalists. </p> <p>Brice Dickson, NIHRC chairman, said the commission opposed the implementation of the Act ahead of the rest of the UK because it was 'piecemeal and premature'. </p> <p>'Peter Mandelson thought it would show the Government was doing something for the Orange Order and the other loyal orders. But it would have been wrong to introduce prematurely just to tackle one aspect of one issue, namely parades. </p> <p>'We felt it was premature because the police, the judges and the Parades Commission were not up to speed on the legislation when the Secretary of State wanted to introduce it. I want to stress that we are delighted that we are getting a Human Rights Act but we felt the time was not right. </p> <p>'As for the legislation helping the loyal orders, that is not necessarily the case, although we can expect to see legal challenges to Parades Commission determinations on marches in the future,' Dickson said. </p> <p>On 16 February, the Northern Ireland Secretary indicated he wanted the Human Rights Act implemented earlier than in the rest of the UK, because it would help end disputes relating to parades. </p> <p>However, a spokesman for Mandelson accepted that opposition scuppered his plans. The other major institution opposed to the early introduction of the Act was the Orange Order: it ignored suggestions by David Trimble, Ulster Unionist leader and First Minister, that the Act would help its case in the marching dispute. </p> <p>Willie Thompson, Ulster Unionist MP for West Tyrone, called on the loyal orders to use the new legislation to their own advantage. 'Some unionists are asking why the commission didn't want the Act introduced during the marching season. Now that we are getting this Act, I think there is scope for the Orange Order, the Apprentice Boys and the Royal Black Preceptory to take any future determinations by the Parades Commission to court,' Thompson said. </p> <p>Human rights campaigners believe Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights backs the loyal orders' campaign to march along contentious routes. It guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion and declares that the 'freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitation as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.'</p>",
  "William Hague will this week set his party on a collision course with Europe by vowing to renounce European Union authority over major areas of national life. <p>He will make his most provocative appeal yet to patriotism at the launch of the Tories' mini-manifesto on Tuesday, accusing Labour of selling out 'the rights and independence that so many of our countrymen lived for, sweated for, died for'. </p> <p>And he will promise a future Tory government would enshrine in law areas where the Tories would not negotiate with Brussels - from tax and defence to welfare, health and education. That will be seen as the first step to withdrawing from the EU altogether. </p> <p>The shift to the eurosceptic right heralds the start of what promises to be an exceptionally bitter general election campaign. </p> <p>It comes as the all-party anti-euro campaign launches a multi-million pound advertising spree tomorrow, with posters featuring a pair of handcuffs to exploit fears of being 'locked in' to the euro, under the blunt slogan 'Europe Yes. Euro No'. </p> <p>The organisers, Business for Sterling, frankly admit it is timed to beat pending legislation to cap referendum spending - meant to prevent such a financial 'arms race' over the euro - but insist it was not meant to coincide with the Tory launch. </p> <p>Unveiling his mini-manifesto, Believing in Britain, Hague will say: 'By a combination of deliberate acts and complacent failure to act, within a decade - perhaps less - many of the things that make our country a country, that make our nation a nation, that make Britain Britain, could have disappeared. </p> <p>'Say what you like about a Conservative Britain, at least a Conservative Britain will still be Britain.' </p> <p>Downing Street's reaction is expected to be fierce. Tony Blair has made 'standing up for Britain' a New Labour mantra - and the new hard line also risks exasperating pro-European Tories. </p> <p>The policy effectively rewrites original Tory promises to tear up the Treaty of Rome on which the EU is founded to prevent closer integration. They quickly backtracked when that was exposed as hopelessly impractical. </p> <p>The new tactic is a limited form of written constitution establishing permanent British sovereignty over certain areas. Once enacted, UK courts would defy challenges from European Court of Justice rulings in those areas, making relations with the EU extremely fraught. </p> <p>'We will be saying to Brussels \"It's pointless even talking about this area, we are never going to put it on the table\",' said a senior Tory source. 'We are not talking about revoking anything. But our view is that we are getting federalism by stealth, and we have to draw a line.' </p> <p>The mini-manifesto, which will now be approved by party members, triggered an immediate Labour reaction. </p> <p>Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, writing in The Observer, urged Labour voters to shake off 'surliness' about the Government and consider the bleak prospect of an extreme right alternative. </p> <p>'If people want us to do more, then stick by us and we will deliver more: but don't overlook or try to deny what we have done already,' he added. </p> <p>And social security secretary Alistair Darling said Tory hopes of slashing \u00a33 billion from welfare spending to fund their programme 'collapses under close examination'. Labour calculates it relies on forcing 210,000 lone parents on income support back to work - even though 6,000 are pensioners and 40,000 disabled. </p> <p>But Business for Sterling, who with pressure group New Europe are behind this week's advertising campaign, are unrepentant. 'We could be facing a referendum potentially in 12 months' time,' said BFS chair Nick Herbert. </p> <p>'We want to raise funds and spend money in advance of any restrictions. We would be limited to \u00a35 million and we think we could raise that at the click of a finger once the starting gun went off.' </p> <p>The campaign, designed by M&amp;C Saatchi, includes newspaper ads and mailshots to a million businesses canvassing for funds. </p>",
  "<p>The food lover's year starts here. I roasted the first of the golden squash from Borough Market last night, each no bigger than a Bramley apple, their hollows stuffed with butter, sea salt and finely chopped red chilli (just less than an hour at gas mark 6). I have already steamed a net of the new season's mussels with white wine and, as a change from the usual tarragon, some leaves of lemon thyme. So tiny, so sweet. They took less than a minute with the lid on tight and full steam up. We sponged up their fishy-winey-lemony liquor with tufts torn from a sourdough loaf, leaving be the inevitable grit at the bottom of our bowls. </p> <p>Wild duck came into season a couple of days ago. It is smaller, neater and leaner than the farmyard birds and, conveniently, just enough for two. No fiddly knifework; you just hack it down the breast bone with your scariest knife. Whether you choose this or a plump farm bird, you may like to abandon the traditional cherry sauce or green olives - its rich flesh needs neither. Just rub salt all over the skin and up its flue - thoroughly, laddishly, with your hands, rather than delicately ground from a mill - then tuck a halved and peeled onion deep inside. Roast in a very hot oven till the skin is crisp and the flesh is more brown than pink. Rare duck, despite what French chefs tell us, tastes of nothing. The wild version will be done in 20-25 minutes, maybe even less, at 230 C/gas mark 8. </p> <p>On the side I would add a soft mound of just-cooked spinach, still emerald bright. Unusual, I know, but there are some fine bunches around now and the juicy leaf works well with the salty duck. Peas would be eminently suitable here, too, and I am tempted by the home-grown pods that are still around in the market, though I haven't had the courage to try them this late before. </p> <p>Don't miss Royalty, the purple-black dwarf bean that is around for the next few weeks, if only for its fleeting novelty value (it turns green when you cook it), and make the most of the late runner beans. Have you noticed how they curl up as the season progresses? Perhaps they're feeling the cold. We will miss the locally grown when they are gone. For a change, boil the sliced beans briefly, then shake them in a shallow pan of warm butter in which you have softened a shallot, chopped so finely it almost melts in the heat. </p> <p>The majestic blood-red and bottle-green ruby chard is here again and, if you are lucky, the harlequin rainbow variety with its ribbed stems - a Bridget Rileyesque mix of orange, candy pink and saffron. Steam the stripped leaves, then butter them; then boil the stalks and drizzle with olive oil and the juice of a sweet, fat lemon. I have been known to throw in some rough-cut mint into the butter, too. Not so strange, really - mint and butter please an earthy vegetable. </p> <p>Round, green-freckled summer squash such as Ronde de Nice and the crisp, warm yellow Gold Rush zucchini make a quick, light late-summer supper. I slice them into thick rounds, steam them for a minute or two, then let them soften and colour in olive oil and chopped herbs such as lovage or tarragon. Or eat them as they do at Levant (76 Wigmore Street, London W1; 020 224 1111), Liam Carson's new basement eaterie, which serves blissful, spice-laden, warm Arab breads and baba ganoush. Here the zucchini come softly fried with olive oil and chopped mint. An idea I have copied twice at home since eating them chez Levant. </p> <p>Basil of all kinds - pot, purple, lemon or cinnamon - are at their heady best. Don't forget the Thai variety tastes of aniseed. As it is pointless to cook with anything so delicate, I add the torn leaves at the last minute to warm couscous or white rice with a spoonful of molten butter and, of course, pasta with some thick olive oil. A little warmth rather than heat makes them even more spicy. Look out for exceptionally large, flat leaves in Italian delis; they look coarse, but they have the deepest, most peppery flavour of all. Mash them by the handful with plump, tight garlic, salt and olive oil to make a loose pesto. It will keep in the fridge for a few days, but you must cover the surface with a layer of olive oil. </p> <p>I like to give waxy, torpedo-style Charlotte salad potatoes their last shout of the year in a clean-edged salad with sliced rollmops, shredded dill fronds and sweet red onion. Reckon on one fillet of fish for every two potatoes. I use one of the Danish or German bottled varieties, which seem to contain less onion and citric acid than the Scottish ones. Last week I boiled the knobbly Charlotte potatoes, peeled off their pink-brown skins and cut them into hefty chunks before tossing them with the fish, herbs and a dressing of cider vinegar and walnut oil. (Use 1 tbsp of vinegar to 4 tbsp of oil.) I offered them with that dark, chewy, granular rye bread that comes in vac-packs. </p> <p>Cheeses in particularly fine fettle at this time of the year include melting Brie de Meaux, with its faintly fungal scent and softly oozing centre. We shouldn't take this cheese for granted, but we do. For something firmer, try a wedge of sheep's milk Wigmore from a British cheese specialist such as Neal's Yard - its mottled rind hides a nutty flavoured, clean-tasting cheese. Made in the south-east of England by Anne Wigmore, it is not inappropriate offered with the mild and crunchy Kentish cob nuts whose season is so short. You can't miss them in their frilly green dresses. </p> <p>We can say goodbye to apples from down under till spring. There's new year's fruit at the farmer's market - cheeky, crimson-blushed Discoveries, with their rose-tinted flesh. A tiny short-season fruit to munch in the hand - my favourite apple, though for nostalgic reasons rather than flavour. Hot on their tail is the scarlet and yellow Katy. The Worcesters will be along soon. But stop. Let's not rush into autumn - there are still blackcurrants for crumble and the tail end of the redcurrants and raspberries for the last summer pudding till 2001. </p> <p>September belongs the plum. Look out for Opal, which comes small, sweet and luminous, in every shade of ochre to purple. Avalon, a larger egg-shaped fruit is here, too, but wait till its green blush has all but gone. The more purple, the richer the flavour. Eat these tender early-bird plums as they are; we can cook with the bigger ones later. </p> <p>Greengages, no bigger than a blackbird's egg, are this month's dessert fruit. Ripen them on a warm sill until they're tender and honey-scented. I reckon they should appear virtually translucent. An after-dinner plate with more of those crunchy green cob nuts. </p> <p>Damsons are here for the first crumble of the year. Leave the stones in, toss 750g of the wet fruit in sugar, then cover with a pebble-dash crust of 125g each of flour, butter and ground almonds with 3 tbsp of sugar blitzed to loose crumbs in the Magimix. Bake at 180 C/gas mark 4 till the fruits' purple-black juice bubbles through. I added some Dorset blueberries to mine, though I could have used the blackberries from the garden. </p> <p>There are new cookbooks at the end of the month from Nigella Lawson and Rowley Leigh (and me), and of which more another time, but look out next week for Wolf in the Kitchen by Lindsay Bareham (\u00a39.99, Penguin). Give one to every student who is just about to head back and bookmark the Masoor dhal (page 216). It's cheap, and mildly spiced, and will become a trusted blueprint on which to base a few hundred variations from their store of lentils. </p> <p>To paraphrase the Wolf: peel and chop a few onions and 3 large garlic cloves, heat 3 tbsp of oil in a saucepan, then add the onions, stirring till they are brown. With the heat reduced, stir in the garlic, a pinch of cayenne, 175g red split lentils, tsp of ground cumin and 600ml of water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer till the dhal is thick and the lentils tender. Stir in tsp of salt, pepper, cumin, a squeeze of lemon juice and about 30 mint leaves. Enough for 4, and I can't stop eating it. </p> <p>Those who can manage more than a banana for breakfast might like to check out the buttermilk fruit pancakes with maple syrup or the Proven\u00e7al yogurt, fruit and honey at Villandry's new bar (170 Great Portland Street, London W1; 020 7631 3131). </p> <p>It is not all good news, of course. The unstoppable march of the bland has reached Marks and Spencer's feta cheese, which is not only totally devoid of this toothsome Greek's characteristic salty-piquancy, but boasts the legend 'Made in France'. Do track down the yummy sweet-potato fritters from its new Fusion range, inspired by New Zealander Peter Gordon, before it discontinues them. And, while I'm having a moan, did you know that Hartley's depressing new range of That's Fruity jams come in a squeezable tube - like toothpaste? </p> <p>To end on a high note, the best news of all is that there are deep claret-coloured, late-season raspberries from Scotland around again. A perfect finale to your roast grouse, with its puddle of bread sauce and clear gravy. No meal quite reflects the change from summer to autumn so perfectly.</p>",
  "<p>It has become almost a custom now for the Venice Film Festival to screen the latest Woody Allen movie out of competition, and this year they're showing his Small Time Crooks. The festival is also honouring Clint Eastwood with a 10-film retrospective that includes his latest picture, Space Cowboys, to accompany the special Lifetime Achievement Award which was presented to him at the opening ceremony last week.</p> <p> On the face of it they seem an incongruous pair; Allen, the short 64-year-old New York liberal, son of first generation Jews from Eastern Europe, and Eastwood, the tall (6ft 4ins), 70-year-old Californian conservative whose Wasp ancestry can be traced back to colonial days. Yet there's more that unites them than sets them apart. </p> <p>Both are autodidacts addicted to jazz, the clarinettist Allen being an aficionado of the hot New Orleans style, the pianist Eastwood preferring cool modern jazz. Both have had their sexual activities brutally exposed in the courts, attracting considerable public censure for their behaviour and their preference in their later years for women less than half their years. Most importantly, however, they are Hollywood's two greatest actor-directors since Chaplin, and have been major forces, entirely for the good, in a profligate, disorganised industry. They came after the cinema's old masters, but before the emergence of the film school movie-brats and each has stuck to his last. They've controlled their own careers, keeping a slight distance from Hollywood life, they invariably bring their films in under budget, and have produced large and serious bodies of work. </p> <p>Eastwood has romanticised his background a little, following an inverse-Gatsby syndrome of exaggerating the poverty he endured. He has claimed the blue-collar world of Oakland across the bay from San Francisco as the tough setting of his youth rather than the more genteel suburb of Piedmont where he was born. Neverthless, his lower-middle-class family was badly affected by the Depression, and the drifting life forced on his father and the sight of poverty around him clearly affected his ideas about thrift, hard work and self-reliance. </p> <p>His undistinguished schooldays and his military service as a swimming instructor were followed by a business course at Los Angeles City College. His lackadaisical studies were interrupted when he was spotted by a scout for Universal Studios and signed to a short-term contract. Though this was to change his life, it didn't turn out to be the immediate break it must have seemed. During those last days of the big studio system, Universal was churning out low-budget genre movies - westerns, SF fantasies, horror, broad comedies - for release as double-bills, and Eastwood got to appear in a dozen of them, all without distinction. As he later recalled: 'I'd always play the young lieutenant or the lab technician who came in and said, \"He went that way\", or \"Doctor, here are the X-rays\", and the doctor would say, \"Get lost, kid\". I'd go out and get lost and that would be that.' </p> <p>Universal didn't know what to do with this lanky, genial lad; and his voice was an uncertain instrument before it developed that deep, husky tone and the slow delivery, sometimes slightly skittish, in imitation, it's said, of Marilyn Monroe. But fortunately, just at the point that Eastwood was thinking of supporting himself and his wife by some more reliable means, he was noticed in 1959 by a producer in the MGM commmisary and introduced to Charles Marquis Warren, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Scott Fitzgerald, who was about to launch the TV Western series, Rawhide. Eastwood was cast as the hero's quiet sidekick, which provided regular, lucrative work for the next seven years, but no proper offers from Hollywood. </p> <p>Then came the European invitation that truly changed Eastwood's life - to come to Europe and make the spaghetti western A Fistful of Dollars. The director was the unknown Sergio Leone, for whom Eastwood had been the fourth choice after James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Cliff Robertson. Two other Leone horse operas followed, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly , and this 'Dollar Trilogy' not only made Eastwood world famous but gave him a new, hard identity as the mysterious, laconic cheroot-chewing 'Man With No Name'. At last Hollywood took notice. In the late Sixties, offers flooded in, and immediately the shrewd actor created his own company, Malpaso, named for a parcel of land he'd bought near California's coastal Highway 1, and most of his subsequent films have been co-productions with Malpaso. </p> <p>At this point Eastwood had another stroke of luck, when he was searching for someone to direct him in Coogan's Bluff, the tale of an Arizona cop pursuing a criminal to New York. Universal recommended a pair of third-raters, Don Taylor and Alex Segal. The studio computer, conflating the two, came up with the name of Don Siegel, a cult director in Europe but unknown to Eastwood, who famously asked 'Who the hell is Don Siegel?' before deciding to view some of his pictures. </p> <p> A five-movie partnership followed, including the seminal Dirty Harry in 1971, a politically ambivalent populist work that captured the temper of the time but deeply divided the critics. His implacable enemy Pauline Kael wrote in the New Yorker that the 'action genre has always had fascist potential, and it has finally surfaced... Dirty Harry is a deeply immoral movie'. But Norman Mailer observed: 'The movie is almost as open in its space as a western. Maybe that's why the violence works... Dirty Harry looks as clean and well turned out as any young senator with a promising future. In scenes where we see him walking down the street he could be walking from one campaign spot to another. Eastwood knows the buried buttons in his audience as well as any film-maker around. Is it out of measure to call him the most important small-town artist in America?' </p> <p>The role of the maverick San Francisco cop Harry Callahan shaped the future screen persona of the 41-year-old Eastwood as indelibly as the role of the rancher Tom Dunson in Red River had shaped that of John Wayne when he too was 41. Siegel generously encouraged Eastwood to direct and himself played the hero's favourite bartender in the thriller Play Misty For Me (1971). This impressive debut features Eastwood as a womanising, jazz-loving disc jockey, one of the two or three occasions when he's come near to a self portrait. </p> <p>Over the years as their fame grew, Leone and Eastwood tended to disparage each other's work, but the actor had learnt a lot about pacing, camera positioning and mood from the Italian, as well as gaining confidence in his own physical presence. The relationship with the veteran Siegel, who'd arrived in Hollywood not long after Eastwood's birth, was like that of father and son, and their friendship and mutual respect continued up to Siegel's death nine years ago. Eastwood credited Siegel with teaching him how to tell a story economically in the classic manner of Walsh, Hawks and Curtiz, and how to prepare a movie so that time and money aren't wasted. </p> <p>Fame and money came to Eastwood in abundance in the late Sixties and early Seventies. But respect from critics and his fellow film-makers came only gradually. His politics, as evidenced through his films, his support of Ronald Reagan, his alleged financing of the search for American PoWs in South-east Asia, and his successful bid to become Republican mayor of Carmel in 1986, offended many on the Left. He was for years dismissed as an actor of limited means, though in fact like Robert Mitchum, he's a minimalist performer who knows just how to address the camera. </p> <p>He's also been accused of being a low-brow crowd-pleaser, though this charge can be brought against only a handful of his pictures, most notably Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Any Which Way You Can (1980), neither directed by him, in which he plays a trucker and bareknuckle boxer accompanied everywhere by Clyde, an incontinent orang-utan. These two films seem like provocative gestures designed to affront respectable society; they stand at the opposite end of the spectrum from Bird, his fastidious cinebiography of Charlie Parker. </p> <p>Eastwood is in his manner and conduct neither pretentious nor boorish. He has a natural, relaxed, amused quality both on and off the screen. 'Clint Eastwood has an absolute fixation on an antihero,' Siegel told Peter Bogdanovich 30 years ago. 'It's his credo in life and in all the films he's done so far... I've never worked with an actor who was less concerned with his good image.' He is, of course, with that famous mole on his upper-lip, a warts-and-all man who doesn't have a good profile or wear a hair-piece. </p> <p>He still moves with grace and agility, but he's never tried to conceal his age or deny the ravages of time, which didn't prevent him taking a bath with Meryl Streep in The Bridges of Madison County or getting into bed with the young Laila Robins in True Crime. In Space Cowboys (which opens in Britain on 22 September) he does nothing to deny his advanced years. Along with the 72-year-old James Garner, the 65-year-old Donald Sutherland and the relatively youthful 54-year-old Tommy Lee Jones, he's one of a quartet of superannuated astronauts who never got into space and are brought out of retirement by Nasa for a special mission. In a scene that has united critics in their praise, the quartet line up naked for a medical, revealing every wrinkle of their scrawny bodies. </p> <p>From the time he attained power and independence, he's sought without any great beating of drums to push the cinema forward and to make thoughtful, popular pictures. </p> <p>Although he has been attacked for his parsimonious treatment of associates and employees, he's held a production team together for three decades, with virtually every movie since 1971 photographed by Bruce Surtees or Jack N. Green. He's encouraged young film-makers, giving Michael Cimino his first directing assignment on Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, and employing the debutant writer-director Richard Tuggle to make Tightrope in which Eastwood plays a deeply disturbed cop with a taste for bondage. Tightrope is a pro-feminist picture that set out to refute the charge of misogyny that has been brought against him, just as the second Dirty Harry movie, Magnum Force, took on the charge of fascism. His help has extended overseas as when, out of respect for Bertrand Tavernier and his admiration for saxophonist Dexter Gordon, the film's star, he used his influence to secure Warner Brothers' support for Tavernier's Round Midnight, a movie in which he had no financial interest. </p> <p>Proof of Eastwood's concern for his reputation is to be found in the fact that for many years he employed Pierre Rissient, the influential French cineaste and critic, to be his European adviser and low-key publicist. This has certainly helped ease his way in intellectual circles on the Continent and ultimately led to him being made a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and presiding over the jury at the 1994 Cannes Festival, the year Catherine Deneuve, one of his numerous former lovers, was vice-president. </p> <p>In 1976 I had the opportunity to observe Eastwood's informality quite closely when he and I were among the film-makers, historians, sociologists and critics invited to take part in a bicentennial conference on 'The Western Movie and American Society' staged at Sun Valley, Idaho, by the US National Endowment of the Arts. He was there to present the world premiere of The Outlaw Josey Wales in a hall holding no more than 200 people, and he was accompanied by his co-star and then lover Sondra Locke, and the Indian actor Chief Dan George, but no bodyguard and no PR adviser. Over several days he spoke on panels, talked and socialised, taking a keen interest in the proceedings. He always listened intently to other speakers and only talked of strictly industrial matters when directly questioned. </p> <p> The Outlaw Josey Wales, one of his masterpieces, is an allegorical western, the real subject of which is the healing of America after the Vietnam War. Oddly enough, although his name is more closely associated with the genre than anyone alive, he's only made three westerns in the past 27 years - The Outlaw Josey Wales, Pale Rider (1985), which is a cross between Shane and his own High Plains Drifter, and Unforgiven (1992). They are like beacons in his career and milestone commentaries on the state of the nation by one of its iconic citizens. The dark, savage, complex Unforgiven is a majestic film that observes the tragedy and absurdity of life as it examines American history and mythology. It at last brought Eastwood the recognition he deserved in the form of Oscars for best film and best direction. He recognised his debts in the film's simple dedication - 'For Don and Sergio'. </p> <p><strong> Clinton Eastwood Jr</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB:</strong> 31 May 1930, San Francisco, California </p> <p><strong> Educated:</strong> LA City College; Honorary Ph.D., Wesleyan University </p> <p><strong> Occupation:</strong> Actor, director, producer, musician, politician </p> <p><strong> Early TV: </strong> Rowdy Yates in Rawhide </p> <p><strong> Big Break:</strong> A Fistful of Dollars (1964) </p> <p><strong> Latest film:</strong> Space Cowboys </p> <p><strong> Married to:</strong> Dina Ruiz (one child, Morgan) </p> <p><strong> Other children:</strong> Kimber (with actress Roxanne Tunis); Kyle and Alison (with ex-wife Maggie Johnson); Francesca (with actress Frances Fisher)</p>",
  "<p>Bad news: journalists are suddenly fashionable. Sexy, even. This week, Cameron Crowe's new movie Almost Famous, premieres at the influential Toronto Film Festival. It stars Billy Crudup and Anna Paquin and is based on Crowe's time as a teenage writer on Rolling Stone in the Seventies, when rock journalists could still pretend to be almost as cool as their subjects. (Hunter S. Thompson meets a kid on work experience was probably the pitch.) </p> <p>Last week, Serendipity, directed by Peter Chelsom, started filming in New York with Jeremy (Grosse Point Blank) Piven playing the part of a charming obituary writer who happens to be John Cusack's best mate. And, in the autumn, NBC is screening a new series called Deadline which centres on a newspaper columnist played by Tom Conti who, in between banging out columns, cracks the occasional murder. (Jonathan Creek meets Nigel Dempster). </p> <p>Staggeringly, hacks are also becoming fashionable in another sense of the word. The September issue of W magazine, just out in New York, has a 16-page spread with assorted journos dressed in Hilfiger cashmere and 'camel and fur by Lang'. Which makes a change, for you can count the number of conventionally well-dressed journalists on the fingers of one hand: Damon Runyon, Tom Wolfe, Nigel Dempster, James Whitaker. Or maybe you can't. </p> <p>This development is unwelcome for cinema-goers, television viewers and magazine readers, but far, far worse for journalists. During my career - no, that's too strong a word. Having been employed in a series of different but tangentially linked jobs, I have seen the damage a successful TV programme can wreak on a profession. When I spent a brief spell as a barrister, Rumpole of the Bailey was all the rage. (Yes, internet-users, a series about a fat brief who called his wife She Who Must Be Obeyed was must-see television). During a shorter spell as a solicitor, LA Law was the nation's preferred viewing. And during a too-long period I spent on the fringes of the comedy world, Ben Elton had his own series on television, telling bad jokes. </p> <p>The effect of television series on these professions was disquieting. Barristers, pretty odd at the sanest of times, became even stranger as they added Rumpolian mannerisms to their bag of tics. The solicitors went beserk: acquiring year-round perma-tans, putting in consecutive all-nighters and adopting Tony Blackburn accents. As for the comedians... well, anyone who has been to a comedy club knows they shouldn't be encouraged, but Elton's success led them to the deluded, but as it transpired, correct belief that they could be boring on any subject and make oodles of money. </p> <p>Now it's the journalists' turn. They would be unique if they didn't let all this media coverage go to their heads. Snazzily dressed, they will hesitantly move from the pub to the club. Once in through the front door they will swiftly move from club occasionals to club bores. At a stroke, working in a newspaper office will be akin to working with an office-full of Griff Rhys-Joneses. A savagely depressing thought and worse will follow. </p> <p>Thousands of people doing media studies courses - the fastest growing degree subject in the country - will ignore all the evidence accrued while completing their degrees, start believing instead in the movies and conclude that hackery is glamorous. Which means more recruits, which means more competition, which, in my experience, means... well, perhaps there's no need to be maudlin. </p> <p>There is a chance that it won't happen. Even though a magazine editor, while dismissing eight pitches with a prescient sentence, once told me, 'I've noticed trends come from America to this country, my advice is to look West for your ideas,' she can't be 100 per cent correct. Can she? </p> <p>I reckoned the best way of nipping this nonsense in the bud would be to approach it from the grooming angle. So I rang Dylan Jones, editor of GQ , to ask if it had ever even crossed his mind to do a fashion shoot featuring hacks. 'We did it six months ago with New York journalists. And we featured Tony Parsons as a fashion model a couple of months ago,' he said. In short, the horse had well and truly bolted. </p> <p>So, Dylan, are journalists sexy? 'I know a lot of sexy female journalists. I know no sexy male journalists.' Different worlds, magazines and newspapers. </p> <p>Over at Esquire , Peter Howarth takes a different line. Hack shoot? 'Absolutely not. If you knew the scuzzy bunch I know... Part of the art of journalism is that we produce these products and everyone thinks we're going for drinks with Brad Pitt. But we're not. We're unshaven people who don't see enough daylight.' Too true. Journalists abhor pub gardens. </p> <p>Are they sexy? 'I don't think so, I really don't think so. Every journalist I know likes to think he's sexy. He read Scoop or Fear and Loathing and thought journalism will be a bit of a laugh and... well, you know.' Indeed. </p> <p>The BBC is said to be on the verge of buying Deadline and screening it here in prime time next year, but there's no guarantee it'll be the next Lou Grant. And Almost Famous and Serendipity may not cause that many shakes either. The great movies about journalism - The Sweet Smell of Success, The Front Page, Ace in the Hole - were all set in the days when newspapermen wore hats. Or at least corduroy jackets (Robert Redford in All The President's Men). A more recent example is provided by Perfect . This intriguing Eighties movie starred John Travolta as a Rolling Stone journalist stalking a health and fitness expert played by Jamie Lee Curtis. After its release Curtis's career took off and there was a health club boom. In contrast, after playing the part of a hack, Travolta didn't get a decent part for a decade and Rolling Stone went into terminal decline. </p> <p>The film flopped in part due to a critical panning. And those who seek to make journalists sexy should be aware that their biggest obstacle will be the journalists themselves. Barely a day goes by without a hack lamenting the passing of the days when Fleet Street was Fleet Street and a talented writer could file a thousand-word think-piece through to copy without, in the slightest, disrupting a four-bottle lunch. </p> <p>These pieces proliferate in part because the hacks are struggling to conjure up copy but in the main because it is in all their interests to maintain the illusion that journalism is no fun any more and thereby help maintain the closed shop. </p> <p>It's a scrubby, under-paid, unfashionable profession, as any journalist will tell you. Before waddling up to the bar, ordering a round, waddling back and having a very good laugh.</p>",
  "<p>Yasmina Reza was five when she discovered she was not going to live for ever. 'I thought it was a piece of luck to be alive, a kind of distinction - like a medal. I thought: if life is only a short piece of time, I must live with intensity.' Was she frightened of death? 'No. Not at all.' (She is emphatic: 'No. Not at all' is an absolute and her catchphrase). At eight, she wrote a poem about mortality. It was called 'La Mort et La Vie' and it won a 'little prize'. Could she still remember how it went? 'Of course,' she said in that indignant way - between reassurance and reproof - that French women have. </p> <p>We were sitting in Brasserie Lipp on the Boulevard St Germain, in Paris. On the wall alongside us was a tiled, tropical landscape of pastel cockatoos and parrots. Faded signs warned 'amateurs du pipe' to keep their tobacco to themselves. Reza reeled off her poem at speed; I followed after, dragging my schoolgirl French behind me. Life, according to the authoritative eight-year-old, was full of le bonheur and le malheur - the rest I asked her to write down. 'En subissant l'heure et la peur,/ plus tard la vie s'efface/ et l'ame part,/ en haut dans l'espace.' (Roughly: Undergoing time and fear/ life later will disappear/ and the soul part/ high up in space.) </p> <p>Now, at 40, not much has changed. Reza has returned to matters of life and death. Not that there is anything moribund about her career. She is about to enjoy a sparkling English season. Her play Conversations After a Burial, starring Claire Bloom, opens at the Almeida theatre and her autobiographical novel Hammerklavier, in part a memoir of her father, is published at the same time (Faber \u00a36.99). She is best known for Art, the intellectually chic comedy about three men who fall out over a white painting, although their quarrel is actually about friendship. Art 's success has been phenomenal; it has been translated into 35 languages and the trio can still be heard arguing in the West End every night. </p> <p>Reza has described time as 'the only subject'. She was absolutely punctual herself, thrifty about her own time. We almost collided in the entrance to the restaurant. I recognised her from photographs: dark, petite, with a slightly cross face, a sensual, contemptuous mouth, a bustling air. She removed her dark glasses to reveal lively brown eyes under elaborately curved brows. She is not strictly beautiful but has a simian intensity. She was severely dressed - apart from a skirt with a flirtatiously feathered hem - a business-like princess, with no necklace. </p> <p>Her appearance matters to her greatly. In one of the most memorable chapters of Hammerklavier, Reza describes the purchase of a midnight-blue satin suit with thin grey stripes. She bought it to attend an awards ceremony at the Savoy in London (where she was to pick up a prize for Art ). She was pleased with the suit: 'Restrained... understated elegance, slightly masculine, which is good for an author at lunchtime.' Then she blew it. She bought a necklace: two strings of costume pearls, one of which she converted into a bracelet. She knew the pearls were a mistake but asked her friend Serge (an extraordinary number of male characters in Reza's oeuvre end up being called Serge) to give his honest opinion of her jewellery. He judged the necklace 'dreadful' and the bracelet 'even worse'. She ended their conversation: 'You're right, but from now on we are no longer friends.' </p> <p>In real life, the conversation ended in laughter. She is still friends with Serge. She never wears the necklace. So why was she tempted to invent such an extreme ending? Friendship is a delicate business, it seems. The necklace incident recalls Art where a friendship is also jeopardised by an aesthetic difference of opinion. Should the white canvas and the costume pearls be insincerely praised? Is deception necessary to friendship? 'No. Not at all. It is not a question of lying. It is a question of manner.' It is style that counts. </p> <p>This may be true for Reza in more ways than one. Later, she concedes that lying may sometimes be necessary even though friendships must be founded in trust. She has a sort of tricky integrity, admirable in its way. She does not care if her friends hold unsympathetic opinions about art or politics, it is 'the moral differences' that count. She adds a sober PS: 'Real friendship is very rare.' </p> <p>Reza's father was her real friend. He was her axis: all her work turns on him in some way. As a child, she hardly knew him. Her parents were worldly. 'I first \"met\" my father when I was a teenager. I got to know him well in my twenties.' He was an engineer of bridges, then a businessman. He was also an amateur musician who played the piano badly but with passion (Reza plays too). He was a Persian Jew, born in Moscow. Reza's mother is Jewish, too, from Budapest. She is a violinist (Reza allows her mother one adjective: 'strong.') Reza believes her writing is more Jewish than French. But she worships French, adores its 'subtlety'. She has no time for English, dismissing it as if it were a flat cake that could never rise. </p> <p>Conversations After a Burial is about the relationship between sex and death. It is, like most of her plays, beautifully translated by Christopher Hampton. A man and a woman make love on the dead man's grave - an act that does not prove as private as they might have wished. As the rest of the mourners gather round a mighty pot au feu, there is more than leeks and carrots coming to the boil. </p> <p>You could be forgiven for assuming that Conversations After a Burial must have been written just after her father's death. But it is her first play, written 15 years ago, and her father knew it well. It was in the Brasserie Lipp that she handed him a published copy of the play. Later, walking home with him they ran, by chance, into Raymond Barre, a former French Prime Minister. Her father waylaid Barre - to her chagrin - and boasted about his daughter's talent. Not that he had been convinced of it himself, at first. It was only when audiences hailed her that he changed his tune. He never saw Art. It was written in six weeks to distract her from his death. She believed the play was dreadful - 'not worthy of me' or of him. </p> <p>She wrote Hammerklavier for herself. Writing was a way of keeping her father alive on paper. She was talked into publishing it. Did she have misgivings now? 'No. Not at all.' The novel is full of private glimpses: her dying father standing naked in the bathroom telling her that when he sees himself he thinks of Auschwitz. She says: 'It's true, Papa, you aren't looking great at the moment' - and they laugh. The book is full of unexpected laughter as well as despair. </p> <p>What did she miss most about her father? She stared back at me, flinching slightly. She was a little affronted, moved too by the question. 'Everything,' she said eventually. She added that when he was ill and she knew it was the end, 'I tried to fix him in my mind'. Her eyes filled with tears. She said that writing the book had 'fixed him for people who have never met him'. And that seemed to please her greatly. </p> <p>I stared back at her, at her plain, high-necked top - a colour somewhere between lemon and mustard but hard to place, like her character (mustard and lemon there, too, but with enough sugar to offset the sharpness - like a good salad dressing). Was she a good cook? 'No. Not at all.' She relented: 'I know very well how to do a pot au feu... maybe I am a cook compared to an English woman.' She gave a charming laugh and then there was an embarrassment between us that spread like spilt water - as if she could not decide whether or not she had committed a faux pas. She did not withdraw her remark. She is decided about everything, even kindly taking control of the menu and ordering my lunch: a beetroot and walnut salad, a plate of wild strawberries. </p> <p>She is as maternal as a swan. And it is not only her children she defends. 'I protect myself a lot. I say no. I say no to invitations, I don't appear anywhere. I don't sign books. I don't go on TV. I do very few interviews. I am very savage. That is why I can have a private life.' She has two children: a girl, 12, and a boy, seven, by her partner, the film-maker Didier Martigny. The boy minds most about her absences. He advises her on her wardrobe, alerting her when one colour does not get on with another. It was 'wonderful', she said, to have a son. He seemed a miracle because he was born only one month after her father died. She was moved by the way birth and death held hands. </p> <p>Reza's career is burgeoning all over the world. She has a new play Trois Versions de la Vie about to open in Vienna, Philippe Noiret is touring her second play The Unexpected Man in France (the RSC production is transferring to New York with Eileen Atkins and Alan Bates). And as if this were not enough, she is returning to acting, after 13 years, in a film called Terminus des Anges, directed by Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9, set in Tangiers. She plays a seductive woman writer. T\u00e9chin\u00e9 fell for Reza when they met in Cannes. 'I inspired him, physically speaking,' she reported, telling me in delighted detail about how she said 'no' when T\u00e9chin\u00e9 asked her to act in his film, before yielding. </p> <p>Reza seems content to be herself. But if she could choose to leave the brasserie as someone else, just for the afternoon, who would she like to be? 'Philip Roth,' she said. 'Otherwise, Julia Roberts - but only for the afternoon, the night would be too hard work.' She laughed. And if she could be somewhere else? 'Afghanistan,' for its landscapes. And she liked the idea of a yashmak so that no one would see anything but her eyes. </p> <p>After we parted in the late afternoon, I visited the Egyptian galleries at the Louvre. They are filled with sphinxes. And they all look like Reza. Something she said, towards the end of lunch, came back to me: 'I want to be searched but not understood.' </p> <p>\u0095 Conversations After a Burial runs at the Almeida, London N1, from 7 September to 21 October (020 7359 4404)</p>",

The focus intrigues because the chief protagonist is a deeply unpleasant merchant, Musa, left for dead by his long-suffering wife.</p> <p>Searching for water on his travels to the desert, Jesus enters Musa's apparently empty tent, and on hearing a faint groan, presses the fever out of him as simply as pressing 'the stone out from an olive'. Musa celebrates his miraculous recovery by beating his old donkey to death with horrific savagery. Then, while starvation in the desert turns the skin of Jesus and the other ascetics to a translucent amber, Musa exploits them shamelessly by selling them water, and unsuccessfully tempts the young Gallilean miracle-healer with packets of food. </p> <p>The unabridged reading immerses the listener in the detail and imagery which realises this distant world. Musa, the merchant of fabrics, is drawn to women by the fall of their robes; during his own quarantine on his desert caravan, the merchandise includes screeching monkeys strapped to camels, and birds baited with a tick on a thread, pulled in like fish when they swallow the lure.</p> <p>The creaky, petulant voice that narrator Peter Wickham gives to Musa conveys the merchant's obnoxious, wheedling nature and his cruel treatment of all living things, and also symbolises the harshness of the world in which Jesus lived and died. Remarkable listening.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Super-Cannes</strong><br>J.G. Ballard<br>Flamingo \u00a316.99, pp392<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502454390,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>J.G. Ballard is the Dr Moreau of British fiction, creator of controlled environments and out-of-control dystopias. He is, of course, uniquely qualified for the role: his Empire of the Sun years in a Shanghai detention camp allowed him grim, unrivalled childhood insight into the mechanics and effects of bizarre enclosure; he now sees constricting theme parks and open prisons everywhere he looks.</p> <p>His pebble-dashed Shepperton semi, exactly as old as he is, lies between the twin make-believes of the film studios and Heathrow Airport. Every morning he blinks out on this suburban world as through a Big Brother surveillance camera and the first thought to cross his mind is always: 'What is this?' However far we travel in outer space, he says, the worlds just outside our front doors will always be the ones most fundamentally alien to us. </p> <p>The fully realised visions Ballard creates in his novels are only ever five minutes away from that observed reality. In his last book, Cocaine Nights, he conjured the rarefied Spanish township of Estrella del Mar, home to a vicarious climate-controlled community of British money men, freed from their ties to the City by technology and from social responsibility by their cartoonish wealth. The only recreations in the whitewashed, sanitised resort were tennis, adultery and gratuitous violence. </p> <p>Here, he refines that concept further, to create Eden-Olympia, Europe's ultra-sophisticated answer to Silicon Valley in the hills above the French Riviera. The business park is the world's first intelligent city, one horribly logical conclusion of a corporatised continent in which 'freedom was the right to paid work, while leisure was the mark of the shiftless and untalented'; dreams here come equipped with airbags, and the only sounds are the whispers of sprinklers on lawns and the effortless combustion of computer-navigated German sports saloons.</p> <p>The city is home to techno-chic supernationals - Ciba-Geigy and Siemens, Mitsui and Monsanto - and to the Euro-elite of chief executives who control their strategies, a post-leisure class which derives its excitement from the imposition of systematic efficiencies. There is no need here for law or religion; Eden-Olympia polices itself; decisions are corporate not ethical, and sex is something one watches on customised adult channels. </p> <p>Ballard carefully constructs this serpentless paradise in perfectly engineered sentences. His images come together with the satisfying hiss of Japanese micro-hydraulics. 'There was a vast car park concealed behind a screen of cypresses, vehicles nose to tail like a week's unsold output at a Renault plant,' he writes. 'Somewhere in the office buildings the owners of these cars were staring at their screens, designing a new cathedral or cineplex, or watching the world's spot prices. The sense of focused brain power was bracing, but subtly unsettling.' </p> <p>Little disturbs the slick meniscus of this prose which coolly reflects its environment like the Eden-Olympia swimming pools into which no executive would ever dream of diving. But there is a great deal going on beneath its carefully maintained surface tension. More than any other writer Ballard understands the transformation technology may effect on human desire. This is his most potent statement yet of the outcome of that transformation, an elegant nightmare with all the internal coherence of an Escher engraving or a Calvino fable. </p> <p>Into this hothouse of millennial dreams, at the outset of this novel, drive a young British couple in a temperamental old Jag. Paul Sinclair is a commercial pilot recovering from a crash in his antique single-engined Harvard; his new wife Jane is a consultant paediatrician disillusioned with an NHS in which she has been forced to work as an auxiliary bedpan emptier. They met while he was recuperating, an affair accelerated in true Ballard style by the erotic qualities of Paul's leg brace.</p> <p>Jane has accepted a job at the Eden-Olympia medical centre, replacing an old friend, another British doctor, David Greenwood, who recently and inexplicably had gone berserk with an automatic rifle, apparently killing 10 of the residents of the park before turning his gun on himself.</p> <p>Their story is told through the eyes of Paul, who, along for the ride and sleeping in the serial murderer's bed, finds himself drawn to examine the motives for Greenwood's psychosis and in turn the reality of Eden-Olympia. Ballard unravels the secrets of his post-industrial elysium with panache, leading us into a society which is both an exaggerated parable for our times and a chill piece of futurology. Along the way there are some signature themes: Ballard's books always feel as though they are shot on security cameras and spotlit by police flash photography; their violence is both sterile and graphic. The worlds he describes are frequently immunised against human emotion. And in Eden-Olympia that deficiency has become a potentially fatal threat.</p> <p>This is a place in which illness has been almost eradicated by the constant daily monitoring of its sleek, toned population. Every morning each one of its citizens dials the clinic and logs in their health data: pulse, blood pressure, weight and so on. Stress is minimised through an unfailing network of support systems. The problem, if anything, as set out by the community's resident consultant psychiatrist and project leader Wilder Penrose 'is not that too many people are insane, but too few...' and that in the absence of conflict a certain aspect of humanity is atrophying.</p> <p>'The more civilised we are the fewer moral choices we have to make... a giant multinational like Fuji or General Motors sets its own morality: how you treat your spouse, where you educate your children, the sensible limits to stock-market investment...' and the fewer moral choices we make the less human we become. </p> <p>Penrose's extreme antidote to this dulling of his population's moral edge is to force feed the community regulated doses of antisocial behaviour. In his 1982 book Myths of the Near Future, Ballard was already asking the question that he here has Penrose answer: 'Perhaps violence, like pornography, is some kind of evolutionary stand-by system,' he wrote, 'a last-resort device for throwing a wild joker into the game?' </p> <p>The wild joker Penrose casts among the gently susurrating cypresses of Eden-Olympia could hardly be more extreme; under his instruction the corporate leaders have become a kind of designer fight club. They go down into the Arab ghettoes at night and make home movies of the beatings and robberies, murders and rapes they enact, all in order to remind themselves of their humanity. </p> <p>This 'weekend fascism' - assisted by the park's security staff who are paid-up members of the Front National - is a typical Ballard inversion. In this vision crime becomes recreation of the super-rich; the corporate overlords ride out to trample on the villagers. 'The middle class have run the world since the French Revolution,' Penrose argues. 'But they're the new proletariat. It's time for another elite to set the agenda.' </p> <p>As ever, Ballard gives this agenda its full realisation. His satire, however extreme, is always convincing because its governing ideas inhabit every detail. He sees a strain of totalitarianism running through particular dehumanised philosophies of engineering and design and management; sees the potential for dictatorship in the absence of democracy engendered by the colossal power of corporations.</p> <p>Set this against the credible notion that 'for the talented and ambitious the future means work, not play' (there is no place in Eden-Olympia for those who are 'not net contributors to society: poets, traffic wardens, ecologists...') and what you come up with is a place that is 'very civilised and very corrupt. Once you are there, they look after you for ever'. A place, too, that in this compelling novel is never made to seem not very far from our own front doors.</p>",
  "Teachers are being advised to encourage underage students who become pregnant to abort their babies under new government guidelines which will come into force tomorrow, pro-life campaigners have claimed. <p>It is the first time the Government has officially advised teachers to tackle abortion as part of standard sex education and offered guidelines on how to do so. </p> <p>The guidelines emphasise that, while respecting the religious convictions of pupils and parents, teachers must accept that pregnant girls 'need to know how to access relevant agencies if necessary'. Both pro-life and pro-choice campaigners agree that the term 'relevant agencies' refers to abortion clinics. </p> <p>The document also says that, while aiming to reduce the number of unwanted teenage pregnancies among students, teachers should encourage students to consider the benefits of abortion if pregnancy does occur. </p> <p>Pro-life groups are enraged by the campaign, launched after a report found the pregnancy rate among British girls aged 15 to 19 is the highest in Europe, and still rising. </p> <p>At 6 per cent, the British rate of teenage pregnancy is twice that of Germany's, three times the rate in France and six times that of the Netherlands. Only Canada, New Zealand and the United States have higher rates. </p> <p>But according to pro-life campaigners, the document, to be read by all head teachers, teachers and school governors, endorses under-age sex and fails to suggest any alternative to unwanted pregnancies other than abortion. </p> <p>'This document advises teachers to encourage children with unwanted pregnancies to turn immediately to abortion clinics without considering any other option,' said Josephine Quintavalle, campaign manager at the Pro-Life Alliance. 'That's an unacceptable and completely irresponsible thing to do. Abortion is just one of many options open to pregnant women,' she said. 'The Government is losing the plot on the abortion issue: the figures speak for themselves.' </p> <p>Quintavalle believes helping pregnant girls abort their babies rather than focusing on prevention will only exacerbate the problem of teenage pregnancy. </p> <p>'How can young people see that underage sex is wrong when they're getting the message in the classroom that underage pregnancies can be sorted out?' she asked. </p> <p>More than 90,000 teenagers in England fall pregnant each year - 8,000 of them under 16 - and 38 per cent of such pregnancies were terminated in 1998 - almost 39,000 abortions. </p> <p>The Government hopes the guidelines will protect children from the 'inappropriate teaching and materials' circulating in some schools which oppose abortion. </p> <p>But Paul Tully, general secretary of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, anticipates an outcry once teachers realise what they are being urged to do. </p> <p>'These new guidelines are incredibly disturbing,' he said. 'The only explicit references made are to abortion and that's a great concern. </p> <p>'The publication has not yet come to the attention of parents or religious groups but when it does, there will be a great outcry. Many teachers will be appalled by the fact that they are being put in this position where, to fulfil these guidelines, they are being pushed towards a situation where they're being expected to promote abortion.' </p> <p>The guidelines were welcomed by pro-choice groups, but many believe they do not go far enough. </p> <p>'Schools need to feel confident that they can provide information to help young people to understand the options open to them but the cowardly way it is dealt with in this document has obviously been influenced by people who will never regard abortion as a positive choice,' said Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association. </p> <p>Jane Roe of the Abortion Law Reform Association says the guidelines presume that abortion is morally wrong. </p> <p>'While never an easy decision, abortion could be the best option available to a young girl,' she said. 'We're very disappointed that the Government is still treating abortion as a problem in itself, rather than a solution.' </p> <p>'It's a powerful indication of what the Government wants schools to do,' said Sarah Colborne, chair of the National Abortion Campaign. 'It's giving teachers who aren't quite sure the clearance to point students in the direction of abortion clinics and giving a clear indication to those who are against choice that they would be failing in their duties if they exclude discussions about the issue from their lessons.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\"> amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A goal from substitute Michael Owen five minutes from the end earned England a highly creditable draw in a fiercely contested friendly against the best team around in world football at the moment. </p> <p>Anxious afterwards to stress that neither team had taken this fixture lightly, Kevin Keegan was already pleased with the performance of his reshaped post-Shearer side before Owen put a broad smile on his manager's face. This was a vastly different, more effervescent England than anything seen since the first 20 minutes of Euro 2000, and would have been even in defeat. The Stade de France was stunned by the cheekiest of equalisers, but long before that England had established they could live with the most illustrious of opponents. </p> <p>France are in the unique position of holding both World Cup and the European Championship, and certainly know how to make the most of it. After children in replica kits had paraded both trophies around the pitch, the start was delayed five minutes by presentations to the retiring Laurent Blanc, Didier Deschamps and Bernard Lama, then Zinedine Zidane was permitted to bring his child to the centre circle to perform a mock kick-off. </p> <p>England had little choice but to stand around whistling during this period of indulgence, and in the circumstances one could almost forgive Dennis Wise for fouling Zidane in the opening minute. </p> <p>England had promised to improve their passing and ball retention and were as good as their word from the outset. Both sets of supporters were rubbing their eyes in disbelief as Keegan's players tore into their opponents in the early stages, creating a couple of presentable scoring opportunities in the first 15 minutes. </p> <p>David Beckham found Darren Anderton easily on the right, but with Nick Barmby in particular showing mobility and awareness, England attacked through the middle and on the floor as if the last couple of years of ploughing predictable furrows down the flanks had just been a bad dream. </p> <p>Gareth Barry, coming forward confidently, swapped passes with Barmby and fired a warning shot at Lama's goal after six minutes, but the French goalkeeper was much more seriously tested five minutes later when Andy Cole got a header on target from Paul Scholes' ball into the box. Lama then nervously swatted an Anderton cross over his bar, and had to make the most agile of reaction saves when Beckham's corner bounced through to leave Barmby what looked like a simple header at the far post. </p> <p>If this makes it sound like it was all England, it was never quite that. Zidane escaped his midfield minders in the 10th minute to carry the ball past Barmby's flailing challenge to leave Nicolas Anelka a shot from the edge of the area, and Deschamps also went close before the interval. France came into the game more as Zidane began to make his presence felt towards the end of the first half, but England made encouraging progress practically every time they went forward. </p> <p>Beckham distributed with precision and economy from midfield, but more often than not it was Scholes' final ball which found an opening. England replaced Tony Adams, victim of a double tackle by Marcel Desailly and Deschamps, with Gareth Southgate for the second half, the captain's armband passing to Sol Campbell at right-back. France brought on Sylvain Wiltord, who immediately looked busier than Anelka, feeding Zidane for another defence-splitting pass in the 49th minute. Youri Djorkaeff was the recipient, but Campbell atoned for his initial mistake in playing him onside by dispossessing the Frenchman. </p> <p>Cole was next to sight goal, recovering his footing quicker than the French defence only to shoot tamely at Lama with more time than he perhaps realised. England's best chance of taking the lead, however, fell to one of their best players just before the hour. Barmby definitely had more time than he realised, perhaps more than he actually needed, when he ran round the back of the French defence to collect Wise's through ball. The Liverpool player was alone in possession with only Lama to beat, though could only man age a shot on the turn which cleared the bar. </p> <p>France held the game up again with hugs and kisses for the departing Deschamps and Blanc after an hour, but if England interpreted this as a sign that the remainder of the game would pass peacefully they could not have been more wrong. France put their foot down instead, a subtle change of pace indicated by Zidane's caution for a retaliatory foul on Wise. </p> <p>None the less the home side were preparing to substitute their most influential player when he played the most effective pass of the game, a simple inside ball for Emmanuel Petit to collect and run on to beat Seaman low to his right. Just to prove that was no fluke and that France were in complete control now, Lilian Thuram was inches away from a second on the next attack, and Wiltord and David Trezeguet both brought diving saves from Seaman. </p> <p>England only sent on Owen for the last 13 minutes, and even he would have been unable to make a difference had Trezeguet put away a good chance eight minutes from the end, but a trio of substitutes exposed French complacency five minutes from time. First Steve McManaman made good ground to establish an attacking position, Kieron Dyer whipped in a ball from the right and Owen ran through the French defence to volley past the surprised Lama. </p> <p>England had been impressive enough, this was better than anyone had dared hope. Dyer even managed a cross from which Cole was close to a winner at the death. Perhaps judgment had better be reserved until the real games start, but at least Germany are no longer the only ones staging a recovery. </p> <p> <strong> France</strong> Lama, Thuram (Candela, 80min), Blanc (Leboeuf, 57), Desailly, Djorkaeff, Deschamps (Vieira, 57), Petit, Zidane (Pires, 65), Henry (Tr\u00e9zeguet, 72), Anelka (Wiltord, h-t).

  "A bitter dispute over Canadian lobster fishing rights has erupted into violence and allegations of attempted murder after a Department of Fisheries and Oceans patrol boat was filmed ramming native Mi'kmaq fishing boats. <p>The incident took place at Burnt Church, New Brunswick, an Indian Reservation with a population of about 1,200. Burnt Church First Nation, the Indian council, has accused the law enforcers from the DFO of attempted murder and demanded that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigate the charge. </p> <p>The raid, the most recent and violent in a series that began early last month, was carried out last Tuesday when federal fisheries officers swept into the reservation's fishing grounds, confiscating 900 lobster traps. </p> <p>Twenty-two DFO and police patrol boats and Zodiacs (inflatable rafts), crewed by up to 100 armed law enforcers in riot gear, swooped into Miramichi Bay at 2.30am. The fisheries officers, armed with 9mm pistols, pepper spray canisters and batons, were joined by two police emergency response teams toting semi-automatic weapons. Their mission was to seize lobster pots, but the operation turned nasty. The Feds were joined at daybreak by 14 native craft that swarmed around the larger vesselsto protect their equipment. Nearly 100 Burnt Church locals watched from the shore as federal vessels charged at small native boats, swamping and sinking two, forcing the occupants to leap overboard. </p> <p>Moments later, a powerful DFO vessel charged towards another native boat, an aluminium craft, ramming its stern. Its Mi'kmaq passengers abandoned ship just before impact. Fishermen hurled stones and bricks at the law and in turn were sprayed with mace gas and struck with batons. There were minor injuries on both sides. </p> <p>James Ward, a Mi'kmaq fisherman and head of Burnt Church's own fishery management plan, was the first man on the water - and the first in it. 'We only had three boats in the water at that point,' he said. 'The officers pinned my boat with two Zodiacs. The hull of our boat was cracked and taking in water. Their boat came down on top of us. I was slightly injured. It didn't take long. </p> <p>His brother, Danny Ward, fared worse. 'He was in a skow, a two-man boat. They ran him over and filled the boat with water, forcing him overboard. They started macing him while he was in the water and beating him with batons. Then they handcuffed him and slammed his face down on the boat - his nose was cut open.' </p> <p>The confrontation was captured on video and broadcast across the nation in what has probably been the worst public relations disaster in the DFO's history. Indian nations across Canada are declaring solidarity with Burnt Church by refusing financial compromises to settle similar disputes. </p> <p>Some chiefs have called for the resignation of Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal. A meeting between Dhaliwal and Burnt Church Chief Wilbur Dedam is likely to take place tomorrow. </p> <p>Bob Allain, DFO official in East New Brunswick, told The Observer the incident was 'regrettable'. 'The department has begun a post-operational review of the situation. I'm not going to suggest reasons for why this [incident] has happened, that will be covered in the official report.' Allain says fisheries officials will continue to monitor 'all developments' in the area. Will there be further raids? 'We won't comment in advance. At the moment, the monitoring situation could turn into an enforcement issue at any time.' </p> <p>Karen Somerville, spokeswoman for Burnt Church First Nation, has witnessed 'raid upon raid', but nothing so 'drastic' as last Tuesday's. 'The fact is, non-native fishers have put a lot of pressure on the DFO and the officers to \"keep us in line\".' </p> <p>The dispute began on 10 August when the Mi'Kmaq Burnt Church Band decided to follow its own fishing policy, citing a 240-year-old treaty granting them control of their own fishing management. The treaty right was upheld by a Supreme Court ruling last year allowing natives to fish all year round and without quotas. </p> <p>The government disagrees, saying the court also ruled the Indian nation would be subject to gov ernment regulations - hence the DFO raids to seize fishing equipment considered to be illegal. </p> <p>The Burnt Church First Nation insists it is within its rights. Somerville explains: 'If we continue fishing lobsters, it's got nothing to do with defiance. People are grateful about being able to exercise their treaty right, they were restrained from doing so for many years. </p> <p>'That right has been re-affirmed and reconfirmed by the Supreme Court. It's not illegal in our eyes, it's legal fishing. The issue for the DFO is that we want to manage ourselves.'</p>",
  "Concerned politicians are pressing the Scottish Health Minister for more information on possible adverse reactions to the meningitis C vaccine after The Observer's revelations last week that parents were being denied access to statistics. <p>New figures released last week revealed that there have been 12 associated deaths, including that of 14-year-old schoolboy footballer Keith MacGregor from Inverurie in Aberdeenshire, who died in March five days after being vaccinated. </p> <p>Brian Adam, Scottish Nationalist MSP for North West Scotland and a biochemist, tabled a parliamentary question asking if there was an independent probe into Keith's death. </p> <p>The question is one of six he tabled on Friday evening.

  "John Bruton, the leader of the Irish opposition, challenged the Taoiseach yesterday to exert more pressure on Sinn Fein to help catch the Omagh bombers. <p>The Fine Gael leader said Bertie Ahern should call on Sinn Fein to ask the republican community to provide information about the Real IRA gang behind the atrocity. </p> <p>Bruton also questioned why anti-terrorist legislation brought in by both the British and Irish governments had not been deployed against the Real IRA. </p> <p>Addressing a meeting of the Irish Association at Belfast's Waterfront Hall, he said: 'Republicans are being advised not to give information and this has not been challenged to the degree it should have by the Taoiseach. And I also believe there are questions being asked about all the emergency powers that were put through in the wake of Omagh and why they are not being used. When the legislation was introduced the government must have felt it would be useful. If that was their position and they haven't used it then either they were wrong in their initial analysis or they are choosing not to use it.' </p> <p>Sinn Fein leaders have refused to call on republican supporters to co-operate with police forces on both sides of the border searching for the Omagh bombers. </p> <p>Only one person has been charged in connection with the atrocity that claimed the lives of 29 men, women and children two years ago. RUC and garda detectives working on the case know the identity of the gang that planned and carried out the attack. However, they complain that while they have detailed intelligence on the Real IRA, they have little hard evidence to convict those responsible. The inquest into the massacre will begin in Omagh on Wednesday. </p> <p>Bruton also ruled out any possibility of Fine Gael entering a coalition with Sinn Fein following the next general election. 'They would have to end their links with paramilitarism before we would even consider it,' he said. </p> <p>The former Taoiseach rejected unionist claims that there was no difference between Sinn Fein being in government in Northern Ireland and entering a possible coalition in the Republic. </p> <p>'It is different because the Executive in Northern Ireland does not have the power over the military and police. Power is exercised in London on those matters but in the Dail the government controls policing and the military powers. Therefore no party with paramilitary links can be in that government.'</p>",
  "Among the tributes and messages of condolences that poured in to the friends and family of the artist Euan Uglow, who died last week of cancer at the age of 68, one has gone unreported in the obituaries and news stories. It was a call to Prowse and Darby, Uglow's dealer in London's Cork Street, from Downing Street asking to be informed of the arrangements for the funeral of the man who was Britain's greatest living figurative artist. <p>Behind that telephone call is the hidden story of one of Uglow's most remarkable friendships - which he cherished and revealed only to his closest friends - but which the famously discreet artist protected fiercely from the scrutiny of the media and the outside world. It was his friendship with Cherie Blair, her husband the Prime Minister, and their common friend, Derry Irvine, the Lord Chancellor. </p> <p>And behind that friendship with the Blairs and Irvine lies an even more extraordinary story, of a sitting for a life study made by a young law student in the Seventies for an artist notoriously demanding of the forbearance of his models. Uglow's models would sometimes be required to sit for many sessions over several years in geometrically pleasing, if contorted and painful, positions while he worked on a single painting. That life sitting - for an uncompleted canvass - was with Cherie Booth, later to be Cherie Blair. </p> <p>It is a sitting that has become the source of controversy over repeated denials to the media by Cherie Blair's office that she had ever modelled for an Uglow life study. Yesterday her office conceded for the first time that as a student she had posed as an artist's model for Uglow. </p> <p>He produced only a small body of work, the best known of which were his female nudes. His famous perfectionism was responsible for a work rate which at his busiest saw him complete only two canvasses a year. </p> <p>Small, wiry, bearded, bespectacled - and inevitably in sandals - Uglow was the antithesis of the showy Saatchi generation of young artists, rarely giving interviews to the media and living a garret-like lifestyle in the studio-home he had occupied for almost four decades in south London. It was a fiercely regimented life that harked back to a previous age. </p> <p>Despite the high profile accorded to the Young British Artists invited to Downing Street for cocktails to meet the luminaries of the Blair project early in the New Labour administration, the truth is that if anyone could claim the soubriquet of 'New Labour's favourite artist' it was not the brash headline grabbers such as Damien Hirst or Tracey Emin, but Uglow, a man largely unknown to a wider public. </p> <p>Uglow met the young couple who would one day occupy Downing Street through Irvine, one of his oldest friends. Both served as pupils in Irvine's chambers and it was, perhaps, inevitable that the future Lord Chancellor should introduce two of his brightest prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to his artist friend. And given how attractive the young Cherie Booth was, it was also, perhaps, inevitable that Uglow should ask her to model for him - for a man then recognised as one of the most significant figures in contemporary British art. </p> <p>Uglow, however, was a famously difficult painter to sit for. Having decided what he wanted to paint, he would pose his life models in difficult positions, using plumblines and chalk markers to maintain them in position, insisting on absolute stillness while he painted. Sometimes he would work on the same subject for up to seven years. </p> <p>Indeed, Uglow admitted once that sitting for him could be a gruelling experience. 'The positions I ask my models to sustain,' he once said, 'are difficult, emotionally and physically.' </p> <p>And even if Uglow asked his models to sit only once a week, the commitment was long term, often lasting years as he worked on a single painting. In the case of the painting for which Cherie sat that was to be a problem. </p> <p>'While I am painting,' Uglow once said, '[my models] often go through a cycle of personal events. When one model first arrived, she had a boyfriend. Later she married, and by the time I was done, she was divorced.' In Cherie Booth's case she found the commitment as Uglow's muse to be too consuming. </p> <p>'The picture he worked on with Cherie has never been in the public domain. It was never completed,' said Uglow's friend and dealer William Darby last week. 'Euan was always quite adamant about it not being seen. He was always very protective of her. </p> <p>'She sat for him for a couple years when she was a law student in the Seventies. But she moved on and the painting was never finished. Euan began again, working on the same idea with a different model.' </p> <p>Indeed, since the Blairs have been in Downing Street the unfinished Uglow has become something of the stuff of journalistic legend - often assumed until last week to be the stuff of urban myth, its existence only hinted at in the diary columns. </p> <p>And until yesterday Cherie Blair's office has carefully denied the fact that any of Uglow's famous nudes included her. For his part, Uglow had been equally defensive - his silence, said a spokesman for Cherie Blair last night, was the 'mark of a true friend'. </p> <p>Indeed, when a tabloid journalist turned up on the doorstep of Uglow's mewshouse clutching a reproduction taken from a catalogue - demanding to know whether the model was Cherie Blair - he was turned away with a flea in his ear. </p> <p>Yesterday, however, Cherie Blair broke her silence over the sitting, her office conceding that she had sat for an unfinished painting. 'Both of the Blairs knew Euan Uglow through Derry Irvine when they were pupils in his chambers although they had not seen him for several years.' </p> <p>The sitting, say Uglow's friends, was the beginning of a long-term affection that continued on both sides although they saw less of each other in recent years. Indeed Uglow is credited with interesting Tony Blair in the work of one of his favourite artists - Pierro della Francesca - a major influence on Uglow's art. </p> <p>But Uglow's closest and most enduring friendship in New Labour has been with the bon vivant Lord Chancellor, with whom Uglow shared a passion for fine art, good food and even finer claret. </p> <p>Friends say that faced with the diagnosis of the cancer that would kill Uglow, Irvine accompanied the artist to Italy to see his favourite paintings for one last time. </p> <p> \u0095 Euan Uglow's last completed work, Nuria, is presently on show at the National Gallery in the exhibition Encounters</p>",
  "The government will come under fire from trade unions next week over 'fat cat' pay as one of its most successful pre-election stunts threatens to backfire on Labour. <p>The GMB is resurrecting its 'snouts in the trough' campaign - which made a villain of British Gas chairman Cedric Brown, and was used by the Opposition to embarrass a Tory government. This time it is Labour Ministers on the line. </p> <p>Trade Secretary Stephen Byers has been promising since early 1999 to strengthen shareholders' powers to intervene in boardroom pay packets, but unions are impatient for legislation. </p> <p>Cedric the pig, which the GMB once paraded at a British Gas annual meeting, will make a return appearance at next week's TUC conference in Glasgow - renamed after Luc Vandevelde, the new Marks &amp; Spencer chairman. </p> <p>His \u00a3650,000 salary plus \u00a3650,000 bonus infuriated the GMB, since his firm cancelled contracts with British clothing suppliers, leading to thousands of job losses. </p> <p>A meeting of shareholders in July also questioned whether directors' pay, particularly that of former chairman Peter Salisbury, should have risen given M&amp;S's problems. </p> <p>John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB, said: 'We had hoped that with the change of government Cedric would have been able to enjoy a long and happy retirement, but it's clear that boardroom greed is as rampant today as it ever was. </p> <p>'When thousands of loyal workers are sacked in a drive to cut costs and at the same time the man who wields the axe is burying his nose in the trough to the tune of two million pounds, then the time has clearly come for Ministers to act.' </p> <p>The original Cedric - who despite the name was a sow - was installed on a city farm in the Isle of Dogs after her part in the campaign and gave birth to seven piglets just before the election. Ironically, her former GMB minder, Phil Woolas, is now a Labour MP. While she has been tracked down by the union for one last curtain call, he is not likely to be joining her. </p> <p>As for Brown, he retired in 1996 admitting he was 'hurt' but still defending his salary of \u00a3471,000 - which by today's standards looks positively restrained. </p> <p>Behind the lighthearted stunt is a serious point. The unions fear there will be no legislation to strengthen shareholders' powers before the next election. </p> <p>In an interview earlier this month, Byers praised the shareholders of Vodafone for holding down directors' remuneration, pointing out that they had done so under existing powers, in comments that brought speculation he was retreating from legislating to provide new powers. </p> <p>A spokesman for Byers insisted he would be unveiling proposals soon but that executive pay was a matter for companies to resolve. </p> <p>The issue has proved politically difficult because of sustained pressure from the City arguing that top level pay in the private sector is not a matter for government. </p> <p>A recent survey of directors' pay carried out by the Guardian found rises running at 16.4 per cent, four times higher than for ordinary workers, despite Treasury calls for restraint in wage rises.</p>",
  "One in three criminals under the age of 25 owns or has access to a firearm, the Government's researchers have discovered. <p>A continuing parliamentary inquiry into the growing number of black market weapons has concluded that there are more than three million illegally held firearms in circulation - double the number believed to have been held 10 years ago - and that criminals are more willing than ever to use them. </p> <p>The events of the past week have provided sobering evidence of how deeply ingrained Britain's new gun culture has become. </p> <p>Officers patrolling the Notting Hill carnival last month said they had been prevented from searching a suspect, later found to be carrying a loaded 9mm pistol, for fear of inciting violence. Last Monday, doormen trying to break up a fight at the Epping Forest Country Club in Essex watched in horror as several revellers produced guns and began shooting at them. Two doormen were hit and seriously injured. A few hours later, a man was shot in the head during a 'road rage' row in south London. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, three people were left fighting for their lives after a group of young Rolex robbers ambushed them in the driveway of their luxury home in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. Millionaire Joe Martorana had just stepped out of his BMW when two men snatched the Rolex from his wrist. </p> <p>When his wife, Josephine, tried to raise the alarm, she was shot once in the back by a handgun. As she lay bleeding, the gunmen snatched her Rolex. The couple's son, 18-year-old Steven, and his girlfriend, Isabella, had heard the shot from inside the house. They rushed through the front door to confront the robbers who gunned them down. Steven was hit by a bullet in his chest, and Isabella was shot in the stomach. A few hours later, a 28-year-old man was seriously injured after being shot at a London nightclub. </p> <p>Last Wednesday, Essex builder Ronald Fuller was shot dead by a moped-riding gunman who waited near his home. Fuller, who has a child, was shot twice in the head and twice in the body at point-blank range. Fuller had been acquitted of stabbing a man to death at the Epping Forest Country Club. Police have not ruled out a link between his murder and the violence at the club. </p> <p>Between 1997 and 1999 there were 429 murders in the capital, the highest two-year figure for more than 10 years. At least 100 of them were drug-related; nearly two-thirds of those involved firearms. Dozens of other firearms incidents resulted in people being seriously injured. Last month eight people were wounded when a gunman began shooting indiscriminately outside Chicago's nightclub in Peckham High Street. </p> <p>The picture is the same across the country. Last month a small-time cannabis dealer, Paul Rogers, was shot dead in front of his young son after two gunmen burst into his Liverpool home. In Birmingham and Manchester, police attend more than 100 firearms incidents every month. In Wales, armed police have been called into action every day this year. </p> <p>Detectives say modern weapons are increasingly being held by young drug dealers protecting themselves and their territory. They fear many youngsters are being strongly influenced by the rash of British crime movies such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and its newly released follow-up, Snatch, which have made gangsters chic. </p> <p>Small shopkeepers, who in the past have found themselves threatened with iron bars, baseball bats or knives, are increasingly finding themselves facing handguns or even automatic weapons. A study by Independent Retail News shows that a third of all attacks now involve firearms. </p> <p>Lee Jasper, who advises the London Mayor, Ken Livingstone, on matters of race and policing, believes that, whereas guns were once reserved for the criminal \u00e9lite, they are increasingly falling into the hands of younger, less experienced criminals. </p> <p>'We have a culture developed where people think it is very cool to carry a gun, and are prepared to use it at the drop of a hat. The crime has moved on from just protecting your market and your market share to doling out punishment and intimidation. And the gun is the first resort - the weapon of choice - for settling arguments.' </p> <p>Government researchers are hoping to track the source of black market weapons to devise more effective ways of combating the trade. </p> <p>Controls such as the banning of handguns after the Dunblane tragedy have had no effect on the number of illegally held guns that are smuggled into the country, supplied by corrupt dealers or reactivated from supposedly decommissioned stock. </p> <p>Meanwhile, makers of bullet-proof vests are reporting record profits. Vest sales have quadrupled, with 60,000 snapped up in the past two years at about \u00a3400 a time.</p>",
  "Four of the medical experts advising the Government on whether the new meningitis C vaccine is safe have links to one or more of the drug companies that produce it, The Observer has discovered. The revelations, following last week's report of a cover-up of suspected adverse reactions to the drug, has prompted concern among parents and MPs about conflicts of interest in the medical profession. <p>The Department of Health last night confirmed that Professor Janet Darbyshire, a member of the Government's Committee on Safety of Medicines, had received support for academic research from US firms Wyeth and Chiron, who produce the two main meningitis products being used on children in Britain: Meningitec and Meninjugate. Darbyshire is professor of epidemiology at London University and director of the Medical Research Council. </p> <p>DoH officials also confirmed that three members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had declared interests in vaccine manufacturers. </p> <p>One of them, Dr David Goldblatt of the Institute of Child Health, has served on an expert advisory panel for Wyeth and received research grants from Wyeth and North American Vaccines, which produces a third meningitis C drug to be introduced this year. Another, Professor Keith Cartwright of the University of Bristol, received funding from the drug industry to 'evaluate candidate meningicoccal vaccines'. </p> <p>Exposure of the links between the advisers and drugs firms came as the Government's Chief Medical Officer reacted strongly to last week's Observer story of how information on possible adverse reactions to the vaccine was kept from parents. In a letter to The Observer, published today, Professor Liam Donaldson insists information on reactions to vaccinations is sent, on request, to members of the public, health professionals or MPs by the Medicines Con trol Agency. 'There is not, and never has been, a \"cover-up\" over releasing information about reported deaths or suspected adverse reactions following meningitis C vaccine,' he said. </p> <p>This week every GP in the country will receive a statement from the chairs of the two committees, assuring them of the safety of the meningitis C vaccine. The statement, from Professor Alasdair Breckenridge of the Committee on Safety of Medi cines, and Professor Michael Langman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, updates information made public by The Observer last weekend about bad reactions to the new vaccine reported by GPs and nurses. It says there have been 16,527 reported adverse reactions from 7,742 patients, and 12 deaths. It reiterates that none of the deaths reported by GPs was found to be connected to the vaccine. </p> <p>The statement ends: 'The balance of risk and benefit is overwhelmingly favourable. There is no suggestion that this vaccine has led to any deaths. We strongly recommend that those due for vaccination should receive meningitis C vaccine.' </p> <p>Latest figures show that more than 15 million doses of the meningitis C vaccine have been give to children and teenagers in the past 10 months. </p> <p>Statistics from the Public Health Laboratory Service show that, in the 15-to-17-year-old group, in the last 12 weeks only six cases of meningitis were reported, compared with 26 in the same period last year. And in children under one year old, there was only one case reported in this period, compared with 19 in 1999. </p> <p>Incidences of meningitis continue to rise in those who have not been vaccinated. </p> <p>Despite assurances that information on possible adverse reactions to the vaccine is freely available, parents calling the Medicines Control Agency told The Observer they were still being refused the data. </p> <p>In north Somerset, one mother of a 13-year-old was told 'it wasn't necessary' for her to have that information. </p> <p>'My son is about to have his vaccination and, after reading last week's Observer that figures on adverse reactions existed, I wanted to see them. I believe I have a right as a mother to have all the information to hand when I make a decision,' she said. She said the agency employee had told her: 'Stories like this should really be taken cum grano salis - that's a pinch of salt in English, madam.' </p> <p>Another caller was told that the MCA did not have the information and referred her to her doctor. A third caller eventually managed to get a copy of the letter sent to GPs. </p> <p>The figures collated by the agency are based on the 'yellow card reporting scheme'. This seeks reports of suspected adverse reactions to drugs from health professionals. They are requested to submit reports of reactions whether or not it is clear that a drug or vaccine caused it. The 12 deaths reported under this scheme may be an underestimation, since only around 15 per cent of GPs and healthcare professionals use the yellow card scheme. The Department of Health believes that the reporting rate is higher where a new drug is involved. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat consumer affairs spokesman, Norman Baker, has tabled parliamentary questions about the financial interests of members of Department of Health advisory committees. He said last night: 'This is a question of propriety. There must be enough independent people around to give advice without turning to those who clearly have a conflict of interests. I am not questioning their academic credentials, but with the best will in the world their judgments must be looked at in that context.' </p> <p>Tory Health spokesman Liam Fox, a GP, said the Government must reassure the public. </p> <p>The Secretary of State authorised the licence for the Wyeth vaccine, Meningitec, when the mass immunisation programme began last November, on advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation also recommended the vaccine. </p> <p>Wyeth spokesman Don Barrett said the amount of money paid to the academic departments of government committee members was confidential. Chiron, whose vaccine was introduced in April, stands to make $200 million from the NHS deal. </p> <p>Last night the National Meningitis Trust, sponsored by Wyeth, was drawn into the controversy when it refused to disclose how much money it received from the giant drug company. In a statement, Chief Executive Philip Kirby said: 'We would refute in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that any information we provide is anything other than totally objective and the best available.' </p> <p>This week Posh Spice Victoria Beckham revealed she had viral meningitis, a less serious type of the disease. After doctors ordered her to rest, she cancelled several appearances and flew home from Germany. Viral meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and usually clears up within a week or two without treatment.</p>",
  "With their stereotype image of battered caravans, rowdy children and unkempt dogs, Britain's Gypsies hardly look like the average art collectors. <p>But, according to senior art theft detectives, the Gypsy community in the United Kingdom has millions of pounds worth of art and antiques in its possession. </p> <p>Some are among the best-known stolen works in the world. They include the famous Titian stolen from the Marquess of Bath at Longleat House five years ago and Jean-Baptiste's Oudry's classic The White Duck, a nineteenth-century oil that was stolen from Houghton Hall in Norfolk in 1992. Turners, Constables, Lowrys and the odd C\u00e9zanne may also be in the Gypsies' possession, detectives believe. </p> <p>Last week Alan White, a businessman and former police informer, told The Observer that he believed The White Duck was being hidden in the attic of a remote and rundown house on moors near New-castle. White, speaking from his base in the Philippines, said that the work had been hidden shortly after the robbery and had not been moved since. </p> <p>Gypsy gangs - or 'pikeys' as they are known by police and art theft investigators - are suspected of involvement in the theft of C\u00e9zanne's masterpiece. Auvers-sur-Oise, from the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. 'The job had all the hallmarks of \"pikey\" involvement,' said one senior London-based art investigator last week. The theft of the \u00a33m painting on millennium night was carried out by a burglar who created a smokescreen to foil security cameras. With the noise of his break-in masked by celebratory fireworks, the burglar cut a hole in the roof of the Ashmolean and dropped down a rope ladder into the gallery. </p> <p>Having set off a smoke canister, he used a small fan to spread the smoke and obscure the view of the gallery's closed-circuit cameras before cutting the painting out of its frame and escaping. Some art investigators believe that the work was quickly passed into the hands of a Gypsy gang based in the region who 'laid it down'. </p> <p>There are believed to be around a dozen such gangs operating across South-east, East and Central England. </p> <p>'They are surprisingly organised,' said one art investigator. 'Every member of the gang has a designated craft and there is a high degree of co-ordination among the various teams operating in an area. They are very effective.' </p> <p>The problem for thieves is that major works of art are very difficult to sell on, as their notoriety makes them hard to launder. The two paintings by Turner, Shade and Darkness: Evening of the Deluge and Light and Colour: The Morning After, that were stolen in 1994 from an exhibition in Frankfurt by Serbian gangs are thought to be still in Belgrade. Though worth \u00a312m, the pair are impossible to sell. Detectives believe that the Longleat Titian is similarly unsaleable. </p> <p>Instead stolen paintings are often used as collateral for drug deals - as is believed to be the case with the two Turners - or used to raise fraudulent loans from banks. </p> <p>A number of paintings have been recovered from unlikely locations in recent years. In 1997 five Dutch old masters were found hidden in a lock-up in north London. On another occasion two Constables were recovered from a hotel room in West Drayton near Heathrow. The thieves turned out to be a second-hand car dealer and a bricklayer from Essex. </p> <p>Gypsy community leaders warned against branding them all thieves. 'It's an old stereotype. Though there may be a few bad apples, it's totally unfair on the law-abiding majority to consider us all criminals just because we don't have the same lifestyle as most people,' said David, an itinerant tree surgeon working on a fairground in north London.</p>",
  "They are anonymous, professional, highly paid and as mercenary as any of the combatants in the scores of wars from which they make their living. And when they fly their cargoes of weapons or troops into yet another bush conflict their primary aim, after getting out alive, is to keep their actions secret. <p>But now, in a rare breach of his profession's code of silence, one of the most experienced 'freelance cargo pilots' has spoken out about his 20-year career. </p> <p>In an interview with a United Nations investigator, passed to The Observer, Brian 'Sport' Martin describes how he has made his living flying armaments, including key components in nuclear weapons programmes, all over the world. Not only has he been able to work unhindered by Western governments, on several occasions - he claims - British and American officials hired him for clandestine work. </p> <p>Recently he has been flying general supplies, and 'whatever the military would turn up with', to Ugandan-backed rebels in the east of Congo from Entebbe airport. </p> <p>'We mostly carried brand new Kalashnikovs plus their ammunition,' Martin said. 'They were in quite beautiful condition. We could get 350 troops on board and their weapons. It is quite a standard operation for us. You don't really know there is a war on. You're not involved - you're just charter pilots.' </p> <p>Martin named British pilots - including senior ex-RAF officers - who were also transporting arms into Congo and surrounding countries. Many were recruited by companies based on England's south coast and in London. </p> <p>Others are hired by local agencies. One, Planetair, which employed Martin for the trips into Congo, are mentioned in a report into the reasons for the ongoing wars in Africa published by the US State Department last year. </p> <p>Martin also talks about his work in the early Eighties flying Chinese 'heavy water' - used in the construction of nuclear reactors and weapons - to India, Argentina and, in 1980, Libya. </p> <p>At the same time, Martin, 64, says, he was flying samples of new Soviet weaponry, clandestinely obtained behind the Iron Curtain, to testing grounds on the east coast of America from East German airfields. </p> <p>Campaigners say Martin's revelations provide 'shocking' evidence of how easy it is to exploit the loopholes in British arms-control legislation. If no arms touch British soil, no offence has been committed. The Observer knows of at least three British companies involved in the organisation of arms flights to conflicts in Africa and able to arrange the transport of hundreds of tonnes of weapons without breaking the law. Often the arms end up in countries such as Sierra Leone and Angola where the United Nations have imposed sanctions or are attempting to maintain peace. </p> <p>'Here we have concrete evidence of UK involvement in the supply of arms to conflict zones,' said David Bryer, the director of Oxfam, the British aid agency. 'In the absence of proper legislation to regulate those involved in the supply of arms, these people will continue to get away with it, making large amounts of money from the suffering of others. The Government has so far failed to deliver on the promises it made three years ago, which seems pretty outrageous in light of all the political mileage it made from the last government's record on arms control.' </p> <p>Although the pilots are unlikely to fall foul of British law, they are aware of the risks they are taking. Martin was jailed in Venezuela and spent three days in a filthy cell packed with violent and starved prisoners in Nigeria. He escaped only after paying a $10,000 bribe. </p> <p>On other occasions he has narrowly avoided being shot down. While flying government soldiers into the Sudan, rebels attempted to down his Boeing 707 with Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles. By approaching airstrips at speed Martin had avoided being hit by anything other than heavy-machine gun fire. </p> <p>Flying into the central African state of Burundi in the middle of a war also proved tricky. On his final approach into Bujumbura airport, Martin, who lives in Sussex, was unable to raise anybody in the control tower. When he finally did so he was told to abort the landing. While arguing with the controllers he heard a loud bang. The tower had been hit by a rocket and destroyed. </p> <p> Additional reporting: Nick Paton Walsh</p>",
  "<p>You sit back, sip a glass of wine, and flick between the Nine O'Clock News, Inspector Morse and Friends before settling down to watch a live Premiership football match.

Inmarsat says it can deliver 'a total in-flight entertainment package' for the international traveller because its satellite technology is already installed in three-quarters of the world's long-haul aircraft. </p> <p> 'Most planes use Inmarsat equipment for navigation, safety and arm-rest telephones, but there is spare capacity in the system,' a source close to the negotiations told The Observer. 'We can extend the communications system to cover seat-back TV screens, the internet, and mobile phones.' </p> <p>Inmarsat will beam TV pictures from the ground to the nearest of its nine satellites that orbit the Earth. The satellite will send the images on to a decoder on the plane's nose cone from where they will be relayed to seatback screens. Because it uses fixed connections on the aircraft, the new service does not interfere with aircraft safety systems. </p> <p>Programmes will be live, although news may be edited to remove stories about air safety. The new technology will also enable passengers to surf the web using a seatback keyboard and make and receive mobile phone calls. 'Hush zones' will be reserved for passengers who don't want to be disturbed by the clicking of keyboards or the trill of mobile phones. </p> <p>Airlines see the technology as a new weapon in the battle to attract high-spending passengers.

If a live sports event has not finished when the plane lands, airlines will screen the final minutes in the arrivals hall. </p> <p>One airline source said: 'From the moment they take off to the moment they land, passengers travelling for work or on holiday will be able to work and relax in the same way as they would if they were at home.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:john.arlidge@observer.co.uk\"> john.arlidge@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "A convicted sectarian killer recently released early from the Maze prison is moving to England to join the neo-Nazi terror group, Combat 18. <p>Stephen Irwin was sentenced to life for his part in the 'trick or treat' massacre at Greysteel in CoDerry seven years ago. </p> <p>The 26-year-old UDA member, who was befriended by English neo-Nazis while he was held in the Maze, will find himself in the middle of a violent dispute among British fascists. </p> <p>Anti-fascist campaigners in Britain claim Irwin sent out photographs of himself in prison posing in a Glasgow Rangers shirt in front of Combat 18 regalia. </p> <p>UDA sources told The Observer that Irwin is moving to London where he plans to link up with Mark Atkinson, a leading Combat 18 member who has convictions for distributing fascist material. </p> <p>Atkinson travelled regularly to Northern Ireland and visited Irwin in the Maze.

  "'Escama de pescado,' whispers the slouching Rastafarian as I turn the corner into Calle Media Luna, in Cartagena's red light district. 'Scale of the fish, you want some?' I take a step back to make sure I have heard him correctly. We are not, as far as I know, anywhere near La Boquilla, the village where they land most of the fish consumed in the fancy hotels in Cartagena and Bocagrande. The man leaning against the wall is definitely not a fishmonger. <p>'See how the light catches the flakes, mon,' he says, opening the paper wrapper concealed in his hand. 'Like the scale of the fish. That's best Colombiano.' It is two days before President Bill Clinton's historic visit to the picturesque city on Colombia's Caribbean coast. Cartagena is crawling with US secret service agents, White House advance staff and Colombian anti-terrorist police, yet a Rastafarian is offering to sell me a gramme of 80 per cent pure Colombian cocaine. </p> <p>'Only 10,000 pesos - five dollars, mon. You can afford it.' In the next few weeks the Clinton administration will begin releasing the first instalment in a $1.3 billion package of aid designed to eradicate the production of the coca leaf in Colombia for ever. At a press conference in Cartagena last Wednesday Clinton insisted his 'Plan Colombia' funds were to be used to train Colombian anti-narcotics brigades, not to escalate the war between the army and the Fuerza Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), the Marxist guerillas who control the area of southern Colombia where most of the cocaine destined for consumption in the US and Europe is produced. </p> <p>But those who have studied coca production in Colombia argue that the aid package flies in the face of history and economics. </p> <p>'It's prohibition in all but name,' says Jesus Idrobo, a taxonomist at the Botanical Gardens in Bogota and an expert on the coca leaf. 'The campesinos depend on the coca leaf for their livelihood. As long as they can make more money from coca production [than from other crops] you will never eradicate it.' According to Idrobo one hectare of coca produces about two kilograms of coca leaves every three months, or six kilos a year. To add value to their crop, the campesinos press and refine the leaves into a crude block, known as 'pasta' which they sell on to the cartels. For every kilo of coca paste they manufacture the campesinos can expect to receive $32,000 from the drug gangs. </p> <p>'That's enough to live well for several years,' explains Idrobo. 'What other crop can provide a similar rate of return?' Several years ago, Idrobo says, the US approached the botanical gardens with a request to release a fungus - fussarium oxysporum - that devours coca leaves. However, the plan was ruled out on the grounds that the fungus might also take over legal plantations, destroying leaves that ordinary Colombians depend on for a daily source of nutrition. 'Do you realise that the coca leaf contains a higher percentage of vitamins and minerals than any of the 52 other food plants grown in Colombia?' says Idrobo. 'Coca-chewing goes back 2,000 years to before the conquest. For the Indians it is a way of life.' </p> <p>To underline the scale of the challenge facing the Pastrana government, on the day of Clinton's visit to Cartagena the Colombian daily El Espectador published a huge picture on its front page of a grinning FARC guerilla posing beside a pile of coca leaves. The leaves were the product of the tri-annual harvest in Caguan, a department 450 kilometres south of Bogota in the de-militarised zone. In Caguan coca has become the motor of the local economy and the main source of arms for the guerillas. According to the latest US intelligence reports, Caguan produces 13,000 hectares of coca a year, or 75 tons of cocaine. Although the FARC denies profiting from drugs, the United States estimates the harvest is worth $100 million a year. </p> <p>When you consider that there are 122,000 hectares of coca under illicit cultivation in Colombia and that 60 percent of it is concentrated in areas controlled by the FARC, the money is staggering. Crudely speaking, in one year the coca plantations in Colombia generate as much income for the cartels as Clinton has pledged to the Colombian government to eradicate production over the next five. </p> <p>At street level, the police have long since abandoned attempts at prohibition. It may have escaped Clinton's attention during his visit last Wednesday that possession of a gramme of cocaine for personal use in Colombia is legal, but it certainly hasn't escaped the attention of the backpackers who flock to Cartagena to take advantage of the prices being quoted in Calle Media Luna. </p> <p>For the price of a meal, Milton, the slouching Rastafarian, agreed to explain to me how the business worked. Originally from British Guiana, he moved to Cartagena 11 years ago to be with his Colombian girlfriend. It was through her brother, a low-level functionary for the Medellin cartels, that he got his entr\u00e9e into the business. </p> <p>Milton's main stock in trade is marijuana and basuco, a raw, smokeable cocaine base. The cocaine, he explains, was mainly for the tourists. 'It's not just backpackers, mon. I get rich Americans coming down here all the time from the fancy hotels in Bocagrande. Its so cheap they buy an ounce at a time.' Wasn't he worried about being busted? </p> <p>'Yer kidding, mon? The police know all about me. As long as I keep a low profile they don't mind.' Milton claimed his police contact had told him to make himself scarce during Clinton's visit but this week it would be business as usual. 'Maybe Clinton would like to come back here when he's retired,' jokes Milton as we leave the restaurant. 'I could show him a good time.' </p> <p>As the Clinton cavalcade circled the port and the old walled city on Wednesday, Milton was nowhere to be seen. The previous day the police had picked up a less savvy dealer who had failed to get the message and busted him for 24 packets of basuco. </p> <p>Other 'sanitisation' measures included moving the homeless off the streets and rebuilding an unsightly hovel that lay along the presidential route. In total, the clean-up operation cost the city fathers $700,000, and all for a tour that lasted just nine hours. Of course Clinton's walkabout did not take him anywhere near Media Luna. </p> <p>Next morning I check out of my backpacker's hotel to catch a plane to Bogota. The papers are full of the death of Mauricio Andres Soto, a young policeman blown up by students in Bogota protesting at Clinton's visit as the inauguration of a 'new Vietnam'. True to his word, Milton is back on the same corner he had occupied two days before. 'Escama de pescado,' he whispers. 'Only five dollars. You can afford it.'</p>",
  "<p>Three times a week John Edward Robinson mowed the lawn outside his farmhouse and grilled hamburgers at the local cookout. That was the Robinson that his neighbours in the prairie town of Olathe, Kansas, saw. On the internet, however, he called himself The Slavemaster. </p> <p>To the FBI, Robinson has other names. He is emerging as a monster with two distinctions in the history of American crime: the Cyber Ripper - the first serial killer to lure his victims to their death by stalking them on the web. </p> <p>An even more grotesque detail has emerged in the case of the Kansas killer: one of the women he is accused of murdering left a daughter - who is now in her teens - who was adopted by Robinson's brother and raised in the family of her mother's killer. </p> <p>It is believed that the victims were killed because they had children. His motive was not only sado-sexual, but part of an adoption racket. </p> <p>Robinson was arrested in June after two women told the police that they had been assaulted and robbed by Robinson, having arranged meetings over the internet in order to have sado-masochistic sex. He was charged with sexual battery. </p> <p>The investigation was intensified after a Michigan woman, Suzette Trouten, was reported missing after leaving to work for Robinson. Meanwhile, a Texas woman said that she had escaped an attempted murder after meeting Robinson as the result of another internet rendezvous. </p> <p>The Robinson case then twisted into a nightmare: as the FBI began excavating his land in Linn County, Kansas, they found the rotting bodies of five women stashed into 55-gallon drums. Two of them were sitting in the yard, swathed in plastic.Three more bodies were discovered in a storage locker rented in Robinson's name. </p> <p>Two of the victims were a mother and daughter, Sheila and Deborah Faith. Deborah, a teenager, was disabled. The investigation revealed fake letters, received by relatives of the disappeared women and purportedly from them. One was sent to Mrs Faith's brother saying that Sheila had met a man from Australia who was taking her home 'to be happy'. </p> <p>Another letter written to the killer, by one of the women he had killed, Paula Godfrey, was addressed to John, and signed 'Love Ya, Paula'. The letter, found in a business associate's brief case, was a crucial piece in the jigsaw that led to Robinson's arrest. </p> <p>Most chilling of all was the addition to the indictment of a baby who went missing in the late 1980s. But even these investigations did not touch the bitter core of the case, the tragedy of Lisa Stasi and her daughter Tiffany. Tiffany Stasi was only a few months old when her mother - then aged 19 - disappeared in 1985. Lisa vanished after accepting a job with Robinson. Lisa was reported missing in January, 1985. </p> <p>The body of Lisa Stasi was never found, but the FBI added her name to a list of six women with whose murders Robinson is charged. </p> <p>Last week the FBI revealed that Tiffany had been adopted by a Midwestern couple who had changed her name to Tiffany Robinson. They were Robinson's brother and sister-in-law. </p> <p>All investigators would tell The Observer on Friday was that 'the inquiry obviously directs towards the adoptive family of the girl, who we have spoken to'. </p> <p>One FBI officer said: 'We shall be looking carefully at whether the other victims lured over the web or otherwise had children, and if so what happened to them.' </p> <p>But just to complete the drama, a bizarre reunion is now planned, whereby Tiffany will be reunited with her real father, pending a series of surreal DNA tests. </p> <p>Now that Robinson's brother has been accused as a party to the grotesque adoption, Kansas state law assigns responsibility for a minor to the widower of a dead woman.</p>",
  "You based your report about the Meningitis C vaccination programme (News, last week) on information captured in the yellow card reporting scheme, which requests that health professionals report suspected adverse reactions to drugs and vaccines. Reports should be made even when it is not clear whether the vaccine has caused the suspected reaction. <p>Given the millions of children being immunised, it is inevitable that some deaths will coincide with the vaccination programme. It is therefore not unexpected that a number of deaths have been reported through the yellow card scheme. This is no evidence that the two events are linked by anything other than timing. </p> <p>To date there have been 12 deaths reported through the yellow card scheme in association with Meningitis C vaccine. The Medicines Control Agency and the Committee on Safety of Medicines investigate all causes of death very carefully and assess all reports to detect whether any new safety issues have been associated with the vaccine. The reported deaths could not be attributed to the Meningitis C vaccine. </p> <p>Your report implies that The Observer had difficulty in obtaining such figures when, in fact, anonymised, aggregated data are freely available on request. There is not, and never has been, a 'cover up' over releasing information about reported deaths or suspected adverse reactions following Meningitis C vaccine. </p> <p>To date, more than 15 million doses of the Meningitis C vaccines have been distributed in the UK. Last winter there was approximately a 75 per cent reduction in the expected number of confirmed cases of Meningitis C disease in the first groups to be vaccinated compared to the previous winter. One in 10 people who suffer from Meningitis C disease die from the infection. These vaccines have already saved lives. </p> <p><b> Professor Liam Donaldson </b><br> Chief Medical Officer <br> London SW1 </p> <p>\u0095 The Observer is to be congratulated on the coverage given to the meningitis vaccine. It should serve as a wake-up call to all concerned parents about the risk-benefit ratio of this new vaccine. Two excellent sources of information are: the UK group 'What Doctors Don't Tell You', and the US National Vaccine Information Service (<a href=\"http://www.909shot.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.909shot.com</a>). It is understandable that the health authorities are concerned about maintaining a high level of 'herd immunity', but that is no reason to treat the public like sheep. </p> <p><b> Dr Andre Menache </b><br> President, Doctors and Lawyers for Responsible Medicine <br> London N8 </p> <p>\u0095 Your article caused concern to Meningitis Research Foundation members, many of whose children have died or suffered permanent damage as a result of meningitis and septicaemia. They were distressed to think that some parents would be afraid to have their children vaccinated against group C meningitis and septicaemia, resulting in needless deaths from a devastating disease which is now preventable. </p> <p>It is also important for readers to be aware that at the end of the Nineties cases of meningitis and septicaemia were at a 50-year high in the UK with group C responsible for 150 deaths and many more youngsters suffering permanent disabilities such as brain damage, deafness and amputations. For further information readers can contact the Meningitis Research Foundation's Freefone 24 Hour Helpline - 080 8800 3344. </p> <p><b> Julia Warren </b><br> Bristol </p> <p> \u0095 As father of a two-year-old child very recently vaccinated for Meningitis C I am naturally alarmed by your report. The public good should not preclude the right of individuals to make up their own minds on the basis of all the information that is currently available on both the benefits and the risks. Since the vaccine is new and GPs have reported a large number of adverse reactions to the Medicines Control Agency, there is a duty for the Department of Health to update the public. </p> <p>We were told by our doctor, health visitor and practice nurse that the vaccine is safe. If I had known of the risks reported in your article, I would have sought more information before allowing my son to be injected. I still wish to know possible adverse reactions so that I can be vigilant and act quickly if required. </p> <p><b> Professor David Hitchens</b> <br> Downpatrick Northern Ireland </p> <p>\u0095 In their determination to 'discover a cover up', your reporters have missed the point - some people die or become suddenly ill all the time, including some young people and children. If you give a vaccine to all the children in the country, those deaths and illnesses will occur following vaccination. That does not prove that the vaccine was the cause. </p> <p>Interviewing individuals and their families is a legitimate journalistic approach, but it seems perverse to fail to report the feelings of the families of children and teenagers who have recently been killed and maimed by Meningitis C infection. I predict that these people would not wish others to go through the same anguish and pain they have endured as a result of refusing this safe and effective vaccine. </p> <p><b> Dr Adam Finn </b><br> Director, Sheffield Institute for Vaccine Studies </p>",
  "<b> Monday:</b> Sad farewells to France. It's been a good last week - nothing to do but drink and sunbathe and potter over the latest reports of how the Tories are managing to make John Major's final days look like the early sunlit uplands of JFK's Camelot. Brave attempt by Hague, I suppose, to deny these rumours that he's growing ever more shameless to secure any coverage whatsoever: I do wonder whether the argument was perhaps slightly undermined by his then posing for a picture with Karen Slapper, of TV's Who Ever Watches This! , to advertise Cadbury's new Shameless bar, with a noose in one hand and conical white hat in the other. <p> <b> Tuesday:</b> I can still hear the cries as we left; what a lovely, soft language. B\u00e9b\u00e9 tendresse; l'amour; dommage; au revoir; but I tell myself sternly as we land in the rain that English, too, is capable of great beauty. </p> <p>Jack has just announced that he's going to force every schoolchild to learn to spell 600 words by the age of three or something. Entrepreneurship. Incarceration. Thatcherism. Outrage. Mediocre. Pomposity. </p> <p>Try to convince myself it's good to be home, but it's hard work.

  "This paper's disclosure last weekend that 11 - and now 12 - deaths have been reported in connection with the Department of Health's Meningitis C vaccination programme for all children under 18 has been greeted with criticism from Ministers, health officials and members of the medical profession. <p>The Observer is accused of scaremongering, of distorting the facts, and of risking lives by discouraging parents from having their children vaccinated. It was a response that, by its very tone, underlined why we believe it was necessary to publish the story. </p> <p>We do not believe it is the business of newspapers to make medical judgments. But we do believe it is the role of the media to make sure that the facts - however inconvenient to the Government - are made easily available for parents, and that there is an open and honest debate about any risks to children in such an ambitious and important programme. For if there is one lesson that has been learned the hard way from recent health scandals in this country, it is that scrutiny of medical issues cannot be left solely in the hands of the health professionals charged with administering them. 'Trust me, I'm a doctor' or 'trust me, I'm the Health Secretary' will no longer wash </p> <p>The Government has insisted that it has not tried to cover up any deaths reported in connection with its vaccination programme. It adds that any concerned parent who took the trouble to call up the relevant authority was supplied with figures relating to the risk. But, as we report this week, anxious callers to the Medicines Control Agency are still being refused access to the same official figures disclosed in The Observer. One parent was even told by an official to take all the stories with a 'pinch of salis - that's Latin for salt'. </p> <p> The Observer has no argument with evidence that suggests that the vaccine is effective in the vast majority of cases and will save children's lives. But there still remains a serious concern that there is a risk associated with it. But even if the benefits far outweigh the risks, a simple fact remains. The parents of Britain's children have the right to access the facts enabling them to make an informed choice.</p>",
  "With the Tories launching their 'pre-election manifesto' on Tuesday, it's beginning to be make-your-mind-up time about a second Labour term of government. Yet I still find some surliness among those with whom I marched - either actually or metaphorically - in various struggles for freedom and justice from the late Sixties onward. Perhaps I am different. I was never an all-or-nothing person; rather an all-or-something person. <p>There is an endemic culture of betrayal in progressive circles. Leaders are always accused of selling out. For some, being in opposition is actually easier. It is rather comfortable, just attacking the Tories. You don't have to make tough choices, face difficult compromises, grapple with the detail, answer awkward questions, or win the subsequent argument with voters. </p> <p>The progressive media tend to be similarly afflicted. Take a recent Guardian headline: 'Labour ditches ethical arms trade bill.' Simply not true. The Bill is in draft and we remain committed to it. We may or may not get our tougher controls on arms exports enacted before the next general election. That will depend on when it is and on how we manage the enormous pressure on parliamentary business. </p> <p>A Guardian headline focusing on that would have been explaining the truth to its readers, but it wouldn't have been as attention-grabbing, would it? I wonder whether the real spin doctors these days are the journalists. </p> <p>Where has it ever been properly reported that this Labour Government has made our arms exports more accountable and transparent than almost any other country, with annual reports of 300 pages detailing the licences we have agreed? That we have established for the first time a tough code blocking exports of arms for either internal repression or external aggression, and a European Union arms code doing the same thing? </p> <p>With Labour, Britain has been doing more to promote arms control than any previous Government and certainly any likely alternative: by banning land mines and the sale of torture equipment, promoting a ban on small arms to conflict zones, ratifying the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and pressing for effective implementation of the Biological and Chemicals Weapons Treaties. </p> <p>At the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference in New York in May, we played the key role in achieving an unprecedented agreement to the global elimination of nuclear weapons. I accept that may not satisfy unilateral disarmers. But instead of complaining about Government 'betrayal', they should acknowledge we have a bloody good record on disarmament and re-double their efforts to press us for improvements. If people want us to do more, then stick by us and we will deliver more: but don't overlook or try to deny what we have done already. </p> <p>We will soon have increased our overseas aid and development budget by a massive 72 per cent in real terms, reversing savage Tory cuts. And we have led the way on providing 100 per cent debt relief for the poorest countries. </p> <p>Pretty well everywhere in the world, I find that Labour's foreign policy is admired as progressive, modern and on the side of justice, human rights and freedom - in stark contrast to the Tories. </p> <p>So we should reject the cynical view that, because we cannot make the world perfect, we should stop trying to make it better. Because we cannot do everything, does not mean we should do nothing. For instance, acknowledgement of our military intervention to stop atrocities in Sierra Leone should not be withheld because we were unable to prevent atrocities in Chechnya. </p> <p>Much the same story applies to domestic policy. Of course there is pressure for the minimum wage to be higher. But from some of the grudging gripes about its level you would never have imagined that Tony Blair has achieved the 100-year dream of Keir Hardie, nor that 1.5 million workers, overwhelmingly women, have benefited. Although \u00a33.60 an hour may not seem much, it has doubled the income of some of my South Wales constituents. </p> <p>And don't we deserve at least some credit for establishing the minimum wage with hardly a murmur from a previously hostile business world, and in defiance of all those Tory scares about millions of job losses? </p> <p>Again, instead of sneering about the Government only looking after 'middle England', why not acknowledge our attack on poverty? It's only a beginning. But our Tax Credit reforms mean that no family with someone at work will be on less than \u00a310,000 a year, benefiting nearly one and a half million families, some hugely. </p> <p>You cannot turn everything around in three years after 18 destructive Tory ones. But wouldn't Clement Attlee and Nye Bevan have been proud to have one million more people in work since the general election? Or to have got more than 200,000 young people off the dole and into work through the Government's 'New Deal' programme? Some people might even call that a 'socialist' policy - but then that really would be giving us too much credit, wouldn't it? </p> <p>And on the economy, some take it as a badge of final betrayal that Labour enjoys the confidence of the markets, business and the City - as if it is better to have IMF crises, high inflation, runs on the pound and the general impression Labour couldn't run a whelk stall, let alone the country. Bring back the good old days of Labour governments - without exception, until now - running into an economic crisis and then losing the election afterwards. Much better to feel pure, than achieve the kind of economic stability which is now allowing us to expand and invest rather than retrench and cut. </p> <p>Hard decisions were taken to achieve this stability. Financing record Government borrowing cost taxpayers \u00a328 billion a year under the Tories, more than was being spent on schools. Reducing public borrowing and the national debt means Government interest payments on the national debt are down a whacking \u00a34 billion annually - money we are now spending on education, health and other public services, instead of throwing away to the capital markets. Low inflation and reduced borrowing also mean historically low interest rates, benefiting home owners and businesses alike. </p> <p>The truth is, we are more progressive than any previous British Government, on tackling poverty, on far-reaching constitutional reform, on record investment in education, health and infrastructure - and, yes, on promoting international human rights and justice too. </p> <p>Of course there is a lot more to do. As everyone knows from their own daily lives, changing things can take a long time. Ahead lies the great prize of being able to do all the things that Labour supporters really want us to do - and which we will do, step by step - if we win that historically unprecedented second full Labour term. We do not want another century like the last one, dominated by Tory governments. </p> <p>But this is not a plea from a Minister for sycophancy or blind loyalty. Merely for fairness, instead of corrosive cynicism. Yes, the Government must be held accountable, especially if we make mistakes. But our considerable achievements should be recognised too. And the alternative of an extreme right Tory administration never forgotten. </p> <p> \u0095 Peter Hain is Minister of State at the Foreign Office and MP for Neath</p>",
  "<p>Sir Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, clearly enjoys making himself a hostage to fortune. Having clung to his promise of producing 20 per cent earnings growth a year for far longer than was good for the health of the business, he has come up with a whole new set of targets. </p> <p>Within two to three years, Rentokil's businesses, he says, should be capable of producing annual sales growth of between 6 and 10 per cent and profit increases of between 8 and 15 per cent. Perhaps it is time he stopped talking targets and started meeting them. Judging by the performance of the first half he has some way to go. </p> <p>The core businesses such as pest control, plant care and security - those Thompson is relying on to meet his targets - managed to grow sales by a miserly 1.9 per cent. Profits dropped by 6.3 per cent as margins were eroded at virtually every one of its operations. </p> <p>That was caused by higher spending on incentives for salesmen, more effective trawling of its databases for leads and other measures intended to boost sales growth. </p> <p>Exactly how much was spent - and, more importantly, how much it is bringing in - Thompson will not say. But he is promising that the results will be evident by the end of the year. </p> <p>Let's hope the results are better than those from a previous big initiative, dropping contracts in its facilities management business which produced high sales but low margins. </p> <p>That started last year, so margins this year would be expected to benefit. Instead, they fell by more than a quarter because, Thompson admits, Rentokil omitted to shed all the costs of carrying out the work as well as the contracts themselves. The error, he promises, is now being corrected. </p> <p>But Thompson's biggest problem is that the City no longer believes his promises. He only admitted that the 20 per cent target was too ambitious after Rentokil had failed to achieve it and he still seems to take a more optimistic view of its prospects than some in the City. </p> <p>The clearest example is on margins, where he thinks they will 'at least stand still, if not grow' because it is so skilled in keeping ahead of the competition. </p> <p>He may be proved right next year but the results of this year and last suggest he is deluding himself. </p> <p>Contrast that with Hays, a rival services group, which also announced results last year. Its chairman, Ronnie Frost, doubtless has targets for the business but he is sensible enough to keep them for internal consumption. He is also likely to adjust them regularly to take account of the changing economic climate. </p> <p>Unlike Rentokil, so far Hays has managed to maintain its unbroken record of profits growth. Last year, sales grew by an underlying 13 per cent while profits rose 14 per cent. </p> <p>Rentokil talks about offering an integrated service to customers, including such things as subcontracting out tasks such as lift maintenance, which it does not do itself. Hays has been getting on and doing it - and winning new customers into the bargain. </p> <p>The key questions, however, are whether Hays can carry on growing sales, and whether Rentokil can get its sales rising again. </p> <p>The City is constantly bracing itself for a slowdown in Hays' growth rates but so far its fears have proved groundless. Indeed Thompson says new business prospects are 'the strongest in our history' and is clear about his targets . </p> <p>Thompson is now giving Rentokil his full attention, having ended his stint as head of the Confederation of British Industry. But that may not be enough to meet his targets. </p> <p>The difference in ratings is equally stark. Hays commands a premium 30 times prospective earnings, Rentokil a bargain 10 times. The former is, however, the better buy. </p> <p><strong> Burnishing metal</strong></p> <p>If you are feeling rather breathless about the pace of activity at Billiton then get into training now: there is likely to be lots more activity ahead. The metals and mining industry, once as inert as platinum, is showing a long overdue conversion to shareholder value. </p> <p>Billiton chairman Brian Gilbertson summed this up last week when he talked of 'unparalleled consolidation' in the industry 'with smaller companies disappearing and the larger ones growing in size and influence'. </p> <p>He predicts that the industry will be dominated by a small number of very large companies - and he is determined that Billiton will be one of them. </p> <p>The acquisition of the Rio Algom copper business in Canada and of an increased stake in the Worsley alumina refinery in Australia - announced within days of each other and costing $3.2 billion (\u00a32.2bn) - are key parts of that jigsaw. The former gives Billiton its first major stake in the copper industry, the latter achieves its goal of running an alumina refinery. </p> <p>Underlying all the deals, however, is a new focus on the need to maximise shareholder returns. While the industry will always be at the mercy of the commodity price cycle, there is much that can be done to improve efficiency and cut operating costs. </p> <p>Of course, mines will always need people, there is scope for sharing facilities such as railways, or for accessing cheaper power or getting closer to market - and just cutting head-office costs from some of the smaller mining companies can reap savings. </p> <p>At the heart of the activity - which is being mirrored at both Rio Tinto and Anglo American - is the desire to smooth out the cyclical peaks and troughs and to make the shares more attractive to investors weary of years of mediocre performance. </p> <p>The sharp fall in Billiton's price last week does not necessarily mean it has failed: it simply reflects concern about the pace of change and the need to absorb the $750 million worth of shares being placed to help finance the two deals. </p> <p>Despite that blip, the shares have recovered strongly from last year's trough. There should, however, be more to go - Merrill Lynch, for example, has a target price of 375p, more than 100p higher than last week's close. </p> <p>Those who do not mind a bit of exposure to the commodity cycle should tuck them away.</p>",
  "<p>At absolutely no one's request, we hereby announce the winners of Inside corporate America's first annual Golden Vulture Awards: </p> <p> <strong> The Call-My-Lawyer Award to... Sony Corporation.</strong> </p> <p> Only last month, Sony and other media giants won a court injunction in the US against Napster, the website that lets you record music CDs off the internet. </p> <p>Sony concedes that Napster doesn't actually steal the music - individuals use Napster technology to trade tracks. </p> <p>However, the recording industry seeks ruinous damages against Napster on grounds that the website's technology knowingly abets copyright infringement. </p> <p>Forget Napster, Sony. You now face an even bigger threat of music filching. One company has just begun to market a device just like a Walkman which the manufacturer openly advertises as making it 'easy to record music off the internet'. The music-snatching machine is made by, uh, Sony. Sony should sue. </p> <p> <strong> The Four's-A-Crowd Award to ... Sony Corporation.</strong> </p> <p> It could be that the world's skint youth pilfers music off Napster because of the stratospheric prices of CDs in stores. </p> <p>This column suggested (and Italian and US trustbusters agree) that suspiciously high CD prices might be explained by the extraordi nary fact that more than 95 per cent of all music CDs in the western world are distributed by just six big companies: BMG, Polygram, Universal, Warner, EMI and Sony. </p> <p>Not so, claims a huffy letter from BMG. 'You assert that six companies dominate the industry. [Due to] takeovers, there is (sic) currently five, and will soon be four when Warner and EMI merge.' </p> <p>The industry spokesman avers that my error should convince readers that there is no monopoly control of the market. </p> <p>I stand corrected. </p> <p> <strong> The Generous-To-A-Fault Award to... Ford Motor.</strong> </p> <p> As British citizens, you have a right to compensation from cartels that conspire to fix prices. But as British subjects, no consumer in the past hundred or so years has actually collected anything in a court of law from rip-off monopolists. </p> <p>Previously, I spotlighted the case of John Clare. I tried to get him back some loot from Volvo UK (a unit of American car maker Ford Motor). Despite a finding by the Office of Fair Trading that Clare's dealer participated in a price-fixing ring, he got nothing. Anti-trust experts say the presence of a manufacturer-aided price-fixing conspiracy would bend the whole market. Volvo did create a voluntary compensation fund, but when we first checked, of the 100,000 consumers who purchased a Volvo during the three-year period of collusive pricing, none had received compensation. </p> <p>Volvo told us that this is an indication that virtually all its customers believed they had paid a fair price. My own view is that this may have been the result of a minor oversight in the refund programme: Volvo didn't notify any of its customers. </p> <p>I can now report that Clare has received the handsome sum of \u00a3720 from his Volvo dealer and several lucky buyers have received \u00a325 M&amp;S gift vouchers. Thanks, guys. That only leaves, by my estimate, roughly 99,000 refund claims to go. </p> <p> <strong> The Last-Straw-Gilded-Cage Award goes to... Wackenhut Corporation.</strong> </p> <p> One year ago this week, we ran a story about Wackenhut Corrections, the operator of a private prison in New Mexico where sadism, greed and frightening incompetence risked lives and the public purse. </p> <p>Internal company documents and witnesses revealed, for example, that a chief guard warned company executives that their penny-pinching under-staffing was, 'a death sentence' for guards sent alone into cell blocks. A company executive responded: 'Better to lose one guard than two.' Two weeks after this glib comment, the prediction became reality: a lone guard was murdered along with a prisoner in a riot. </p> <p>Over the past months, Wackenhut has run into more trouble. The US Justice Department charged the company with using 'excessive force and gas grenades' in a youth detention centre in Louisiana, where guards beat a 17-year-old boy so severely that part of his intestines leaked into his colostomy bag. </p> <p>Then the state of Texas indicted 20 Wackenhut guards and officials on criminal charges of sexually abusing prisoners. Wackenhut's stock has tanked. </p> <p>Say what you like about Jack Straw, but in this case, the Home Secretary has shown us his soft-hearted side, granting the beleaguered Wackenhut political asylum in the UK. The Home Office handed the refugee company contracts to run the immigrant and asylum-seekers' detention centre in Manchester, and granted Wackenhut new contracts to operate prisons in Doncaster and Marchington. On the news that the Home Office also approved Wackenhut's opening a youth detention centre in Bristol, New Mexico's prison watchdog, state Senator Cisco McSorley, told The Observer : 'That's bordering on the bizarre.' </p> <p> <strong> And finally, The Dammed-If-You-Do Award to... Balfour Beatty.</strong> </p> <p> In July, Inside corporate America published comments by one of Britain's top corporate lawyers. He told us that, in 1997, at a Department of Trade reception, a man identified as chairman of construction company Balfour Beatty 'announced with enormous pride that he personally had handed over the cheque to the government minister for the Pergau dam bribe' in Malaysia. </p> <p>Not unexpectedly, that week's mail brought a note from Balfour Beatty. Spokesman Tim Sharp wrote that he had spoken to The Observer's source, who 'denies absolutely having said what is attributed to him'. The company demanded a retraction. </p> <p>There was something odd about this complaint. The company seemed to challenge only the wording of the allegation, not the substance. For clarification I wrote to the company asking for an answer to a simple, and far more relevant question: 'Did Balfour Beatty pay bribes in Malaysia - yes or no?' We received no reply. </p> <p>This is a difficult time for Balfour Beatty. A consortium to which the company belongs faces new charges of bribery, this time over another dam project in Lesotho in southern Africa.. I thought the company deserved an extra chance to clear its name. So I called Sharp. </p> <p> Obs: Was a payment made to a government official by Balfour Beatty, its chairman or an agent for its chairman regarding the Pergau Dam project, yes or no? </p> <p>BB: I tell you I've worked with some journalists in my time! </p> <p> Obs: Did you pay a bribe? </p> <p>BB: I like your approach. </p> <p> Obs: I just want to know if you bribed the Malaysians. </p> <p>BB: We could spend the rest of the afternoon... </p> <p>We nearly did. This continued for almost an hour. </p> <p> Obs: I'm worried about the issue of bribery and corruption. </p> <p>BB: Aren't we all? </p> <p> Obs: I'm happy to print 'Balfour Beatty states unequivocally that no payment was made to a Malaysian official.' </p> <p>BB: I suggested to you that you might have misled people. </p> <p>How had The Observer led our readers astray? </p> <p>BB: The thing you wrote has been denied flatly by your alleged source. </p> <p>Indeed, the company had received a letter from the lawyer this paper had quoted. I asked Sharp to read it twice during our interview. Only on the second reading did he include this: </p> <p>BB: [from the letter]'I do not deny the accuracy of the words attributed to me in the article.' </p> <p>Oh. Well, in that case, along with the company's Golden Vulture Award, which has been deposited in a numbered Swiss account, Inside corporate America offers the following correction: 'We hereby retract the statements made regarding Balfour Beatty's alleged boasting of corrupt practices on the grounds that our article was wholly accurate.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Union membership is set for another year of strong growth, matching 1999's total of 100,000 new members, according to an annual survey out this week. </p> <p>The research, by law firm Dibb Lupton Alsop, also found a strong rise in agreements with companies for recognition of unions in collective bargaining. </p> <p>The survey's authors, David Bradley and Paul Nicholls, argue that a second Labour government is likely to see an increase in union power and influence. They point to changes in employment law and the introduction of National Works Councils. DLA surveyed 42 unions and 202 companies representing a total of 2 million employees - around 8 per cent of the employed population. </p> <p>Of the unions surveyed, 58 per cent said membership was rising, while 32 per cent said it had stayed the same. Last year's survey showed figures of 57 and 29 per cent - indicating that this year's membership increase could be even higher. </p> <p>DLA found that 11 per cent of unions recorded a staggering 20 recognition deals or more, 8 per cent between 10 and 20 deals, 11 per cent between four and 10, 28 per cent between one and three and 42 per cent with none. </p> <p>The survey also confirms earlier TUC research indicating that strikes were falling, but that unions were effectively using ballots to win disputes with employers. </p> <p>'Union membership is up again on last year - the first increase for more than 20 years - and the situation continues to look fairly healthy,' said Bradley. </p> <p>However, he added that the density of membership, which means the proportion of the workforce that is a union member, is static, indicating that the increases are linked with falling unemployment. 'It will be interesting to see what happens to membership numbers once unemployment stops falling.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> What's the problem?</strong><br> </p> <p>This levy is one of the most unpopular government policies among businesses, and perhaps the key factor blamed for the cooling of relations between New Labour and UK plc. Notable recent objections have come from the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers' Federation, the British Chambers of Commerce and energy-intensive companies such as the steel giant Corus and industrial gas producer BOC. Last week, the Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo pledged to abolish the tax, if he gets the chance. </p> <p><strong> Why is the government doing it?</strong><br> </p> <p>Labour has been keen to display its green credentials. At the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, developed countries agreed to a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The Kyoto summit in 1997 called for further cuts between 2008 and 2012. Britain wants to be seen at the forefront. As the Treasury states: 'The levy will not only reduce the UK's emissions of carbon dioxide, but will also help stimulate energy efficiency across the business and public sectors.' The levy is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 5 million tonnes a year 2010. </p> <p><strong> How does it work?</strong><br> </p> <p>The tax is levied on companies' energy use. It will be levied in units of kilowatt hours, with different rates applied to the various energy sources. These are 0.07p a unit for liquefied petroleum gas, 0.15p per unit for coal and gas and 0.43p a unit for electricity from the grid. The tax overall will be 'revenue neutral' - meaning that the Government will not make anything from it because what is taken - an estimated \u00a31 billion - will be refunded through rebates on companies' National Insurance contributions. It is due to be implemented in April 2001. </p> <p><strong> When did the trouble start? </strong><br> </p> <p>Early complaints came from the intensive energy users, such as the steel, glass, paper, cement and chemicals industries. They said they stood to lose millions and would not recoup it through National Insurance rebates because their companies were capital-intensive rather than labour-intensive. The Government responded by offering reductions in the levy of up to 80 per cent to energy-intensive companies which introduce energy saving measures into their processes. </p> <p><strong> Why the latest difficulties?</strong><br> </p> <p>Negotiations between trade associations, companies and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on the 80 per cent reductions are proving tortuous. They are likely to drag past the end of October - when the DETR wants them wrapped up - and therefore threaten the April introduc tion date. The CBI said last month that details of the tax were in such a mess that its introduction ought to be delayed. for a year to allow them to be sorted out. </p> <p>Further problems have come from energy intensive companies not entitled to negotiate reduction agreements. BOC, for example, is not included. Neither are some glass and steelmaking processes which involve recycling This is because the only individual sites that will qualify are those covered by the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control directive. Some companies - particularly chemicals producers - say this is an arbitrary method of selection and is discriminatory. They say it focuses rebates on the heaviest polluters, and does not reward environmentally-friendly practices such as recycling. </p> <p><strong> Has the EU stuck its oar in?</strong><br> </p> <p>Yes. The Competition Commissioner Mario Monti needs convincing that the tax and its exemptions do not breach European regulations on state aid. </p> <p><strong> What next?</strong><br> </p> <p>Those taking part in the negotiations hope for a resolution. Those outside them hope to become involved in them. Everyone wants to avoid court. But there are already murmurings about m' learned friends.</p>",
  "<p>'Don't laugh,' said a veteran industry observer last week as he reflected on the latest vicissitudes of one of Britain's most famous and venerable 'old-economy' concerns. 'This company is like what a successful dotcom will be in five to 10 years.' </p> <p>The company's name? Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine, marine and energy engineering group. </p> <p>Is this an absurd attempt to attract attention to a once-mighty British national champion in an ignored and undervalued sector? No, maintains the analyst, Sandy Morris of ABN Amro. Rolls-Royce may have been as good as giving away its main product [the Trent aero engine], but it has created a high-value product and has a guaranteed subscriber base in future. 'It now has nearly 60,000 engines out there, which will be needing maintenance and repairs. And this is a subscriber base that won't churn.' </p> <p>Maybe. But a less flattering comparison with dotcoms is Rolls's ability to burn cash in the scramble for market share. Rolls has poured money into developing and discounting its Trent engines to grab 35 per cent of the civil aircraft engine market and lucrative maintenance work down the line. </p> <p>So, despite being profitable, cashflow has been gobbled up by development costs. And the shares have been uninspiring - Rolls has underperformed the market by 50 per cent in the last five years. </p> <p>Another similarity with dotcoms is the difficulty management has had in explaining the logic behind the company, and its propensity for springing nasty surprises. Last month Rolls shed 22 per cent off its shares - seeing them slump to below their 1987 privatisation price of \u00a31.70 - after chairman Sir Ralph Robins and chief executive John Rose issued a profits warning and abandoned their aspiration to deliver double-digit earnings growth. </p> <p>The Rolls announcement was bungled. The Financial Times's influential Lex column remarked: 'There is no reason why Rolls-Royce should do such an awful job of telling investors what is going on.' </p> <p>Rolls' management was also in the firing line last year when it unveiled a lightning deal to buy the marine and defence group Vickers for \u00a3576 million - a 53 per cent premium. Analysts didn't like the surprise, nor did they immediately take to the assets Rolls acquired - an ill-fitting defence business and a marine propulsion operation. </p> <p>Rolls chief executive John Rose sees it differently. He could not spread the news earlier because Rolls was in its closed period, and it only became aware of all the problems in early August.Asked whether targeting double-digit growth was making a rod for the company's back, he admitted: 'Yes, but we all have PhDs in hindsight. It was important to show we believed we could still increase profits with a heavy R&amp;D programme.' Profits he insist, will grow again from 2002. </p> <p>The uncharitable old hands of British industry will mutter that this is yet another example of problems going back decades. Roll-Royce, a beloved name in Britain's industrial pantheon, has disappointed investors and Ministers for decades. Its nadir came in 1971, when it had to be bailed out by the Heath government. The reason is haunting for investors in modern Rolls. The company - which then included the auto manufacturer - spent fortunes developing the Trent's predecessor, the RB211 aero engine, to win business from US competitors General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney on aircraft made by Boeing and the then fledgling Airbus. </p> <p>Rolls was investigated by the Government's Industrial Organisation Committee, which expressed concern about the RB211 development draining cash, and Rolls' preference for engineering over financial control. </p> <p>Warnings were loftily ignored. The Heath government gave \u00a342m to the RB211 programme. This was not enough, and receivers were called in in February 1971. The Government was forced to nationalise it - floating off the car manufacturer shortly afterwards. </p> <p>In state hands throughout the Seventies, Rolls concentrated on developing the RB211 to compete for market share, and flirted with alliances with GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney. </p> <p>After privatisation in 1987, Rolls won business from Airbus and Boeing, most recently in last week's important order by the giant International Lease Finance Corporation for the Airbus A3XX superjumbo, on which ILFC has specified Trent engines. </p> <p>But that good news has not stopped City disquiet. Double-digit growth was undermined in part because of the unexpected end of service for around 100 Tri Star and other aircraft which are powered by the RB211 - taking a nasty chunk out of the high-margin repair and maintenance work upon which profitability and cashflow is largely dependent. </p> <p>Alongside this came problems with the industrial variant of Trent, used to produce energy, which fell foul of emissions standards. </p> <p>Experts believe the problems for Rolls are bound up with the business model. Cut-throat competition between the three big players means that if engines are not given away free - as GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney have claimed about former Rolls deals with buyers such as Singapore Airlines - then they have been deeply discounted by up to 80 per cent of the estimated $10m price. With a development cost of around $2 billion for Trent, plus other R&amp;D spending throughout the group, this does violence to the balance sheet. Morris says: 'There is huge investment up front. The problem for Rolls as opposed to, say, a telecoms company is that the paybacks in aerospace are so long-term - up to 30 years.' </p> <p>This is all very well if the second part of the Rolls business model works: reaping the 60 per cent plus margins from maintenance work. But at best this is 10 years away. At worst planes can be retired early - as were the Tristars - or development costs for future projects can cancel out the benefits from repair work. </p> <p>But Rose insists the future is brighter. The average age of planes with R-R engines is getting younger - from nine years to 8.5 years, with a 2005 target of eight years - meaning more maintenance work before planes are taken out of service. </p> <p>Rolls'US competitors, particularly Jack Welsh's GE, have acted to break this cycle by offering leasing packages to airlines, which spreads purchase and maintenance costs in payments over the life of the engine. Rolls has tried to deal with these problems by spreading the risk and investment on development with partners, and it now has a complicated and obscure web of relationships, which it claims brought in \u00a3156m in the first half of this year. </p> <p>Bigger questions exist over Rolls' partnership options. Some observers can see the sense in the Vickers deal as the specialist shipping market is due to grow by 8 to 12 per cent.Vickers gives Rolls the ability to go to shipping operators and offer complete propulsion systems rather than simply engines. </p> <p>But a question hangs over what it will do with the Vickers defence business, whose value lies in its order book. With a full one it could fetch up to \u00a3150m, but digging Rolls out of the doldrums will need something bolder. </p> <p>The biggest questions hang over aero-engines. 'The only sensible acquisitions it could make here would be independent repair and maintenance shops,' says one analyst. 'Unfortunately GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney have stolen a march, and there is not much left to buy.' Rolls has had to go into partnerships with engineers - such as in Singapore and Hong Kong - building greenfield facilities. </p> <p>Rolls could itself be a takeover target. But a partnership, most likely with Pratt &amp; Whitney, would make more sense. This was rumoured at the turn of the year, when the European Commission let it be known it would not be happy about the competition implications, and the effect on prices - the only rationale for the link. So that looks unlikely. </p> <p>In the absence of a big deal, the company desperately needs to explain itself better. Sandy Morris concludes: 'The thing is that everyone wants this bloody thing to succeed so much and they get so frustrated when things don't go just right.' </p> <p>More, at least, than can be said for dotcoms. </p> <p><strong>Rolls-Royce powers through the decades</strong></p> <p><strong> 1884: </strong> Henry Royce sets up electrical and engineering company FH Royce </p> <p><strong> 1904: </strong> Royce builds his first car, meets car dealer Charles Rolls </p> <p><strong> World War One: </strong> Royce designs the Eagle, Rolls-Royce's first aero engine </p> <p><strong> World War Two: </strong> Rolls-Royce Merlin engines power Hurricane and Spitfire fighters as well as Lancaster bombers. 160,000 engines produced, launching Rolls-Royce into the major league of aero engine manufacture </p> <p><strong> 1944: </strong> Rolls-Royce engines power Britain's first jet fighter - the Gloster Meteor </p> <p><strong> 1948: </strong> Viscount airliner fitted with Dart gas-turbine engines </p> <p><strong> 1954: </strong> The 'flying bedstead', first non-helicopter vertical take off aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce engines </p> <p><strong> 1966: </strong> Rolls-Royce merges with Bristol Siddeley, consolidating UK aero engine manufacture </p> <p><strong> 1969: </strong> Harrier jump jet enters service, powered by Pegasus engines </p> <p><strong> 1970s: </strong> Rolls-Royce enters partnership with Pratt &amp; Whitney on engine development - abandoned in 1977 </p> <p><strong> 1971: </strong> Problems with RB211 bring Rolls-Royce first into receivership then into state ownership </p> <p><strong> 1973: </strong> Rolls-Royce motor car business floated as separate business </p> <p><strong> 1984: </strong> Partnership with General Electric but agreement terminated two years later </p> <p><strong> 1987: </strong> Rolls-Royce plc privatised </p> <p><strong> 1995: </strong> Acquires leading US engineer Allison </p> <p><strong> 1999: </strong> Buys Vickers</p>",
  "When it comes to the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle, there are, apparently, many ways in which we can have our cake and eat it. The proliferation of products that come with a 'low' prefix means that low-fat foods, low-tar cigarettes and low-alcohol drinks are all out there to be consumed with impunity - or so we believe. Yet one of these products has just been banned and others may not be as beneficial as you think. <p> <b> Cigarettes</b> </p> <p> By 2003, you will no longer be able to smoke a Marlboro Light, Silk Cut Ultra Low or any other low-tar cigarette in the UK. The European Commission has banned these terms from being used, seeing them as misleading, given that the reduction in health risks that 'low-tar' cigarettes offer over their counterparts is negligible. 'The fact is, many consumers don't realise this is a con,' says Clive Bates, director of ASH (Action on Smoking and Health). </p> <p>Low-tar cigarettes do not use different ingredients from high tar - there's no such thing as tar-free tobacco, for example. Instead, the tar level is lowered using filters inserted into the cigarette's end which trap tar as the smoke is drawn through. Very low-tar products further ventilate the filter with tiny holes that dilute the smoke even more. So, while a normal Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette yields 12mg of tar in laboratory tests (where a machine smokes the cigarette and measures the tar produced), a low-tar cigarette yields just 1mg - dramatically reducing its potentially carcinogenic effects. 'The trouble is that people aren't machines in laboratories,' says Dr Martin Jarvis from the Imperial Cancer Research Campaign. 'People smoke cigarettes to get nicotine, and this is cut along with the tar in a filtered cigarette. Therefore, to ensure that they still get the level their body \"needs\", smokers change the way they smoke low-tar brands.' </p> <p>How they do this varies, and is often determined by the brand they smoke. Those smoking 'light' cigarettes (which rely primarily on the filter action alone) tend to take more puffs per cigarette than average, or inhale more deeply, thereby increasing the amount of nicotine that gets through the filter intact. With ultra-low brands that use ventilation filters, smokers physically block the holes with their fingers or lips - in one trial, 76 per cent of cigarettes showed evidence of this. The end result is that the smokers take in far more tar than the companies calculate. In fact, in a previous test carried out by The Observer together with ASH in 1998, the average yield from a low-tar cigarette (a Silk Cut Ultra) smoked with the filter holes blocked, was 12mg of tar - exactly the same as a Benson &amp; Hedges Special Filter. </p> <p>'The result is that you're just as likely to die from smoking a low-tar cigarette as a normal one,' says Clive Bates. 'Which is bad news for all those people who decided that instead of quitting smoking, they'd switch to a low-tar brand. And we know there are thousands of them out there.' </p> <p> <b> Alcohol</b> </p> <p> Since his recent Priory visit, Ronnie Wood has reportedly been spotted nursing a bottle of Kaliber, which, according to Dr Abdulla Badawa, consultant clinical biochemist at Cardiff's Whitchurch Hospital, is no bad thing. 'Alcohol-free and low-alcohol drinks are certainly better for you than alcoholic drinks,' he says. 'Alcohol is toxic for our body. Even the slightly protective effect it gives our heart is cancelled out by the negative benefits it produces in the rest of the body. Therefore, anything you can do to reduce someone's alcohol intake is a good thing - and these products do that.' </p> <p>In general, alcohol-free beer contains less than 0.05 per cent alcohol per volume. This means a pint doesn't even register on the scale of 'healthy units' - and explains why Ronnie isn't breaking any rehab rules. Low-alcohol beers do contain alcohol - between 0.5 and 1.2 per cent per serving. However, normal beer ranges from 3 to 11 per cent, so to reach alcohol levels even close to two pints of beer, you'd have to consume 10 standard-sized cans of 1.2 per cent low-alcohol beer. So far so good. Low-alcohol wines are slightly different, however. To earn the title, a wine only has to be at the lower end of the alcohol limit for wine - normally around 12 per cent. While products such as brand leader Eisberg are technically alcohol free (ie, levels are so low as to be negligible), according to Alcohol Concern other 'low-alcohol' wines can be as much as 5 per cent, which equates to just under 1 unit per average pub measure. Three or four could therefore see you getting close to the legal limit before driving. </p> <p>Problems also occur if you switch to low-alcohol drinks after drinking regular alcohol. Studies by Dr Badawa and his team at Cardiff found that men who'd consumed enough alcohol to leave them just under the legal limit for driving (normally two to three pints of beer) went over that limit after just half a pint of 1.2 per cent low-alcohol lager consumed on top. 'It's a mistake to think that switching to low-alcohol lager when you are near your alcohol limit for driving is a reliable way to stay within the law,' Badawa says. And the danger is even greater for women, who don't metabolise alcohol as well. Badawa therefore recommends that drivers stick purely to low-alcohol drinks - or switch to soft drinks after one or two alcoholic ones. His choice would be orange juice, as the natural sugar increases the speed at which you metabolise the alcohol drunk so far. The orange-juice switch will also prevent you having to experience the real problem that comes with low-alcohol drinks: the taste. According to one recent Mintel survey, 42 per cent of people won't drink low-alcohol drinks because they taste foul - or at least nothing like the product they are meant to be replacing. </p> <p> <b> Food</b> </p> <p> Of course, neither low-tar cigarettes nor low-alcohol drinks are the real success stories of the 'low' industry. This prize goes to low-fat foods, which occupy increasing amounts of supermarket shelf. But, warns Dr Susan Jebb from the Medical Research Council Food and Nutrition Unit in Cambridge, 'lowered-fat foods are only a healthier option if they are used in an intelligent and informed way. The trouble is that manipulation by the food industry and our own attitudes mean this is not normally the case.' </p> <p>A big problem is that the different ways of labelling low-fat foods can mean widely different things, and some labels can hide foods containing high levels of fat and large amounts of calories. By law, 'virtually fat-free' foods can contain no more than 0.15g of fat per 100g of food. 'Low-fat foods' can contain no more than 3g of fat per 100g of food, and if you stuck only to products labelled in this way, your low-fat eating plan would be healthy. However, more tempting products - such as biscuits, crisps and curries - come with a totally different set of labels. </p> <p>Foods marked '5 per cent fat' - or similar - just use a different way of telling you how many grams of fat per 100g they have. Obviously the closer to three this is, the closer they are to truly being low fat. Then there's the '85 per cent (or similar) fat-free' school of labelling. It sounds impressive, but all it means is that the other 15 per cent of the food is fat, so it boasts 15g of fat per 100g of food. A 500g '85 per cent fat-free' ready meal would therefore contain more than a woman's entire day's fat allowance of 70g. Similarly, 'reduced'-fat foods - generally used as a label on higher-fat foods such as crisps and cakes - are foods that legally have to contain at least 25 per cent less fat than the standard version of that food - but that doesn't mean that a high-fat food has become low fat and a healthy option. A chocolate bar is still, relatively speaking, a high-fat product even when its fat content has been reduced. </p> <p>Susan Jebb also says that because most of us err on the side of optimism about how healthy our diet is, 'we tend to think that making any changes at all will mean huge gains for our health. This isn't the case - swapping to semi-skimmed milk and 85 per cent fat-free digestives will not protect you from heart attack if the rest of your diet is bad.' </p> <p>The final sting in the tail with low-fat food products is that their calorie count is often not dramatically different from that of the product they are replacing. 'When fat is taken out of a food, it's normally replaced with some kind of carbohydrate,' says Sue Dibbs, co-director of the Food Commission. 'This could be some kind of starchy filler, in the case of savoury foods, but in sweet foods it's more likely to be in the form of a sugar - maple syrup is very common - and this boosts the calories removed with the fat.' Studies show that the result is that most people who eat low-fat foods consume exactly the same number of calories as those who don't make the switch - and in the US, it has been shown that they eat even more, consuming say two or three low-fat chocolate bars where they would have had only one 'normal' one. </p> <p>'If you want lowered-fat foods to be healthy, you have to use them correctly,' says Jebb. 'If, every time you were going to eat a high-fat food, you swapped it with the lowest-fat alternative to that food available - and you didn't snack on extra foods because you think that low-fat foods don't count - then you would make significant health gains. It's just that most of us don't do that.' </p> <p>Stephen Langley, president of the Association of Naturopathic Practitioners, feels that 'with all doctored products, a moderate amount of the real thing is better for our bodies than large amounts of the replacement. When a product's been manipulated to make it \"healthier\", there's always some payback for our bodies. You have to look at the products concerned and ask if they outweigh the risks of moderate consumption in the first place. Time and time again, the answer will be no.'</p>",
  "<p>It was a fairly routine Orange County police call; a man was threatening to commit suicide by diving off the 17th floor of the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress Hotel, just two miles from Disneyworld, Florida. </p> <p>When they reached the balcony just before 10am on 20 February 1992, police officers found a deranged 42-year-old man perched on the balcony ledge. Police officer Stan Spanich spent 40 minutes coaxing the man back into his room, 1708. Inside, flat out on the bed suffering a cocaine overdose was 22-year-old Denise Wojcik from the local Escorts-in-a-Flash agency. Denise said she and an 'associate', Sherri, had spent the night in the room's sunken Jacuzzi with the would-be suicide snorting cocaine through rolled up $100 bills. The big man, 6ft 4in, paranoid on coke, said he was Irish, he was a businessman, and his name was Ben Dunne. </p> <p>None of it meant very much to the Florida police officers; arresting people strung out on cocaine was a daily occurrence in the Sunshine State. But 3,000 miles on the other, wetter side of the Atlantic in Ireland, Ben Dunne was a very big man indeed. Dunne was one of the most prominent businessmen in the Irish State. His billion-pound supermarket retail empire supplied the majority of Irish households with the food for their tables and the shirts on their backs. Dunne was also, in secret, a major benefactor of the Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey. </p> <p>For 30 years Haughey, whose hero was Napoleon, had bestrode the narrow Irish political stage dominating friend and foe. Charlie, as he was universally known, had held every major office of state and was Taoiseach of Ireland four times. </p> <p>Haughey was rich. He lived in a glorious 18th-century mansion, filled with art, on the outskirts of Dublin. In the 270 acres of his Kinsealy estate he ran a horse stud and bred racecourse winners. He owned an island off Ireland's west coast, Innishvicillaun, that was so remote the building materials for his house had to be helicoptered in. He had an ocean yacht. He spent lavishly, \u00a3700 Charvet shirts from Paris, \u00a31,000 meals in Dublin's most exclusive Le Coq Hardi restaurant, the best wine, vintage Cristal champagne, and even in Catholic Ireland, the best of mistresses. As Taoiseach he rubbed shoulders with the great and powerful - President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand was a friend, and there were the usual St Patrick's Day lunches at the White House and tea, albeit it frosty given the state of Anglo-Irish relations, with Prime Minister Thatcher in Downing Street. </p> <p>But the fall out from Dunne's cocaine binge would tortuously but relentlessly, destroy the achievements, the fortune and the entire reputation of a man who was once frequently compared to the legendary, romantic IRA leader Michael Collins. </p> <p> These days Haughey is still at the cen tre of the Irish political stage. But he is no longer welcoming Europe's leaders to EU summits in the splendour of Dublin Castle. Instead, for two hours every day, he is in the witness box at an anti-corruption tribunal answering questions as to where all the money for the mistress, the mansion and the racehorses came from. </p> <p>For the last two years lawyers at the specially convened Moriarty Tribunal have combed through every Haughey bank statement, every invoice, every property deal he was involved in over the past 30 years in search of evidence of bribery. What they found is damning. Haughey was a career politician whose annual salary even as Taoiseach in the 90s never exceeded \u00a375,000 per annum. Yet more than \u00a38.5m flowed through Haughey's secret bank accounts to fund his lavish lifestyle. </p> <p>The hidden accounts, the secret transfers, and the network of the rich and powerful who made out their cheques to 'Charles Haughey &amp; Co' point to one conclusion; that Charles Haughey ran for public office to make himself rich and then ran Ireland and the Irish State for the benefit of his cronies. It was a neat quid pro quo and the quid ended up in Charlie's pocket. </p> <p>'He was the boss. We all looked up to him, the whole Irish nation looked up to him. He stood up to Mrs Thatcher. But all that is undermined by the fact that he was conning us. What really cuts is that all he wanted was to be in power, to have power. And he abused it,' said Steven Kelly, a student who queued to be in the public gallery of the tribunal. </p> <p>Haughey may be unloved, but he is not defeated. Citing ill-health and age, he is 74, he is only allowed to be questioned for two hours a day. He is far from contrite. </p> <p>In the witness box, hood-eyed, he scowls at his interrogator as he is minutely led through one damning document after another highlighting his extravagance, his mysterious land-developer friends and their coincidental business dealings with the Irish State. His answers are a never-ending stream of denials, omissions and evasions. 'I can't remember, I do not recollect, not in any detail, I do not have any recollection.' When he is not taking the Irish equivalent of the Fifth Amendment - about self-incrimination - on the basis of his now allegedly faulty memory, Haughey lays the blame on his old financial manager and secret bagman Des Traynor who is wonderfully, discreetly, but indisputably dead. </p> <p>It is a bravura performance. But it cannot alter the truth. For the past 40 years, bribery and corruption, rather than elections, were the life-blood of Irish politics. The next Irish general election is less than two years away, but a political revolution is coming. All the established parties are facing wipe-out. The beneficiaries will be some of the smaller parties and Gerry Adams's Sinn Fein - fighting as the squeaky-clean newcomers. </p> <p>The taint of scandal has even touched the current Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Haughey's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Testifying to the Moriarty Tribunal, he admitted signing entire books of blank cheques for his former leader - cheques drawn on an Irish government account that Haughey later used to pay his Paris shirt bills. 'What Haughey says about Ireland is not very good. It says Ireland is a small coun try and a lot of people in the professions, pillars of the establishment, covered up for him out of fear and greed. It's easy to be abusive about Haughey now, but standing up to him 20 years ago was a different matter. All the stuff about Mafia-style leadership was not a joke,' said Joe Joyce, author of The Boss , a hostile biography of Haughey. </p> <p>In Haughey's potato republic, only little people paid their taxes. It was government of the people in favour of the few. But the web of power around Haughey was impenetrable. It would take Ben Dunne's suicide bid and a high-stakes legal battle for the Dunnes retail empire to finally expose the rotten core of Haughey's Ireland. </p> <p> Haughey was the Juan Peron of Irish politics. Like the glamorous Argentinian dictator, he inspired a fanatical following with his peculiar blend of nationalist fervour, right-wing views and appeasement of powerful trade union leaders. He was master of the small political gesture - granting tax exemption to artists and free travel to retirees - and was hugely popular. He was also the supreme practitioner of the Irish political art of 'cute hoorism' ('a clever whore'), slyly outmanoeuvring his opponents with backstage deals. He cultivated his image as the man of power, the man of decision, the very embodiment of the Irish nation. </p> <p>Party conferences were carefully orchestrated to create an aura around the leader with a personalised theme tune, 'Arise and Follow Charlie'. He loved photo-calls but hated reporters' prying questions; he was always acutely self-conscious of his height, 5ft 6in, and avoided situations where he physically looked up to those he politically looked down upon. </p> <p>'If you opposed him you were seen as not just being disloyal to him as an individual, but to the party and the country - words that were always mentioned in the same breath - as well. That's why it was so hugely dangerous and that's where you got the slightly fascist overtones of the whole thing,' said his bitter political rival Des O'Malley, who was expelled from the ruling Fianna Fail party on Haughey's orders. </p> <p>Irish corridors of power hummed with fear and tales of his cutting sarcastic tongue. Haughey, always aloof and imperious, once called a senator into his office to give him a furious dressing down. After a tirade of insults, Haughey dismissed him and returned to the work on his desk. The stunned senator, confused by the wood panelling, could not find his way out. After a few moments Haughey looked up. The hapless senator explained his predicament. 'Then why don't you jump out the fucking window,' retorted Haughey. </p> <p>Far from being shocked, the Irish fell in love with a politician whose earthy nature and soaring ambition they somehow saw as a better reflection of themselves than his bumbling saintly Fine Gael political rival Garret Fitzgerald. Charlie may have been a bit of a crook but, his followers reasoned, he was our sort of nice crook. </p> <p>He had chutzpah. One of his first acts as Taoiseach was to lecture the Irish people about living beyond their economic means. At the same time his own extravagance wildly outstripped his income. For decades he ran up a crippling personal IR\u00a3750,000 overdraft with one of Ireland's major banks, Allied Irish, when his annual salary at the time was IR\u00a35,500. Demands by the bank for repayment were met by threats and pointed remarks about his political power. 'It was blatantly obvious that he was living a lifestyle he could not afford. It was staring everyone in the face, the helicopters, the ridiculously expensive girlfriend. He was up to something,' says Vincent Browne, one of the few Irish journalists ever to question Haughey openly about his wealth. </p> <p> Haughey certainly needed money and lots of it. Although he married Maureen Lemass, the daughter of a former Taoiseach, and had four children, he also had a high-profile affair with a Dublin gos sip columnist. His mistress, Terry Keane, was a woman who expected and received the very best her lover could lavish upon her from vintage Cristal champagne at \u00a3200-a-bottle, jewellery from Tiffany's in New York to luxurious holidays abroad. Like his hero Napoleon, Haughey was no movie star, but he oozed, according to Keane, sex appeal and had 'the most beautiful mouth of anybody I'd ever seen'. </p> <p>Keane, now 60, is no longer quite the beauty that turned a Taoiseach's head, but she remains a spirited, spiky woman with an unashamed fondness for fur coats, heavy-set gold jewellery and la dolce vita. It was not, she insists, love at first sight, but it did become a tempestuous passion. 'We were both chancers and we shared the same cynical sense of humour. I knew it would be a mistake to let him know how mad I was about him. We often drank too much when we could get away together and had terrible rows, but usually we had them in private,' said Keane, who remained married to her husband, a Supreme Court judge. </p> <p>The couple met for weekly trysts in luxury hotels around Dublin or dined privately at their favourite restaurant Le Coq Hardi. 'Charlie was great fun, a great raconteur, and a good companion. He had an unwavering belief in himself. He always seemed very certain of where he was going and what he was going to achieve. He was never daunted by the obstacles, they were always challenges.' </p> <p>The affair, which began in 1972, was soon an open secret in Dublin media circles. Keane anointed herself with the semi-official title of Taoiseach's Mistress and terrorised those beneath her in the rigid Irish social pecking order, including once an unfortunate young policeman who had the audacity to give her a parking ticket. 'I am,' she would declare, 'the most powerful woman in Ireland; wife of a Supreme Court judge and mistress of a Taoiseach.' She even regularly hinted about 'sweetie' in her weekly gossip column for a Dublin newspaper. </p> <p>Keane was less popular in other Dublin circles where she was regarded as vain, empty-headed and bitchy. But the true nature of her relationship to Haughey, which would have scandalised a country that still banned condoms for unmarried couples, was never revealed to the Irish people. Ireland's strict libel laws kept Haughey's adultery off the front pages, even when he denounced attempts in 1986 to introduce divorce. Ireland was still too small a country, its ruling elite too tiny, for such secrets to be shared with the masses. For years the same cloying subservience towards power would protect Haughey's secret financial affairs. </p> <p> The source of Haughey's wealth may have been mysterious, but the scale of it certainly wasn't. In 1969, after a decade as a full-time government minister, Haughey bought Abbeville, the James Gandon-designed mansion that had been the summer home of the English Lord Lieutenants of Ireland, for IR\u00a3120,000. The 10-bedroom Georgian mansion, on the outskirts of Dublin, complete with 270 acres, was an astounding purchase. Gandon's other buildings in Ireland include the majestic Four Courts, home of the Irish judiciary, and the historic Dublin Custom House - a drawing of which adorns the back of Irish IR\u00a35 bill. </p> <p>Abbeville is one of the greatest houses in Ireland, the renovation and upkeep alone consumed vast sums, yet Haughey's ministerial salary in the 60s never exceeded IR\u00a35,500, a 20th of the purchase price. Nor was there any family wealth - Haughey had been brought up in a council house and money was tight. But when pressed about the origins of this impressive wealth, he refused to disclose his finances. 'Talk to my bank manager,' he retorted. </p> <p>Conveniently, Haughey's bank manager, Des Traynor, a secretive accountant who controlled all of his master's finances, did not give interviews. Indeed, Traynor, despite being on the board of a whole network of prestigious Irish companies - including the state airline, Aer Lingus - was virtually unknown to Irish journalists. </p> <p>Haughey's four administrations, in the 80s and 90s, were awash with scandals from the illegal bugging of journalists, to the discovery of a wanted double murderer in the attorney general's apartment and even to the arrest of Haughey's personal election agent Pat O'Connor Pat O'Connor, as he humorously became known, for voting twice in the same 1982 election. Most scandals were financial and, although not proven, were never far from Haughey's door. </p> <p>In early 1992, Haughey's luck finally ran out when an old phone-tapping scandal about the illegal bugging of journalists' telephones resurfaced. Haughey had blamed his minister of justice Sean Doherty and denied all personal knowledge of the telephone intercepts. Doherty willingly took the rap and was forced from government. But 10 years later, Doherty changed his story and said Haughey had ordered the bugging. Haughey resigned on 11 February 1992, with a vintage performance in which he quoted Othello. 'I have done the State some service, they know't; no more of that.' </p> <p>Nine days later, Ben Dunne's Florida escapade hit the Irish newspapers. Headlines come and go, but for Dunne's siblings, particularly his sister Margaret Heffernan, members of the Dunne family trust that had overall control of the retail chain of stores, it was the final straw. For years, the family had been angered by their brother's autocratic behaviour; she decided to oust him from the Dunnes' board. A full-scale family war for the billion-pound empire broke out during which details of Dunne's secret gifts, actually company money, to Haughey were revealed to Heffernan for the first time. She was amazed. Her late father, Bernard Dunne, the store's founder, had detested Haughey. Heffernan had a simple response: she wanted the money back. </p> <p>According to Dunne, he first learned that Haughey was in financial difficulties in 1987. Traynor, Haughey's accountant and secret bagman, had phoned up Dunne's legal advisor and asked for cash. Dunne agreed to pay IR\u00a31.3m from secret accounts within the far-flung Dunne empire. Traynor acted as a cut-out; the money was routed into offshore bank accounts. There was nothing to connect Dunne and Haughey. </p> <p>But then, by chance, in early November 1991, Dunne called on Haughey in Abbeville after playing a game of golf nearby. Haughey, besieged by the latest crisis in his government, looked uncharacteristically down. Dunne happened to have three blank sterling bank drafts for \u00a370,000 each in his pocket. He handed them to Haughey. 'Look, that is something for yourself.' Haughey responded: 'Thank you, big fellow.' The exchange of drafts was over within seconds, but it would in the end crucify Charles Haughey. </p> <p>Despite Dunne's evidence to Heffernan's lawyers, Haughey, now in retirement, continued to deny that he had ever received money. Heffernan went to Abbeville and confronted him. Haughey, playing for time, was careful to neither deny or affirm receiving the money There was no proof. </p> <p>Haughey's sophistry cut little ice with either legal team in the Dunnes' dispute. Dunne's payments to Haughey, indicative of Ben Dunne's abuse of the firm's finances, had become a weapon in their own legal clash. Haughey, despite his carefully studied aloofness on his personal finances, was in a panic. He knew that public disclosure of the Dunne money, and all the embarrassing questions it would raise about his wealth, would destroy him. </p> <p>Suddenly it was Charles Haughey who started making begging phone calls, 11 in total, to Dunne's lawyer. He invited Heffernan back to Abbeville to urge her to resolve the family feud in private. In November 1994, just days before the case reached open court, the Dunnes' legal dispute was settled with a huge IR\u00a385m payment to Ben Dunne. Evidence of Dunne's secret 'gifts' was consigned to the legal dustbin. Haughey thought he had survived. There was even talk in 1996 of a run for the Irish presidency. </p> <p>But then in 1997 his carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade collapsed. Ben Dunne was caught out making illegal payments to another government minister. It was hugely embarrassing for the then Fine Gael government and it was forced to appoint a tribunal of enquiry to investigate payments to members of parliament by Dunne. Within days the tribunal, under the formidable Honourable Mr Justice Brian McCracken, was on the track of Charlie. </p> <p>This time there was no escape. Statements from the Dunnes' legal battle were retrieved from the archives, witnesses were called, and lawyers interrogated in the full public gaze of an open tribunal. Haughey stonewalled, prevaricated, hoping he could brazen it out, but the tribunal's investigators were relentless in their pursuit. They uncovered an elaborate financial system, organised by Traynor, which could be used to disguise the payment of bribes and the systematic defrauding of the Irish state of tax revenue. </p> <p>The system was simple but ingenious. Traynor, chairman of the small legitimate merchant bank Guinness Mahon, had established an offshore bank, Ansbacher Cayman Ltd in the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, and acted as the Irish agent for its deposits. Money deposited would theoretically be held offshore beyond the scrutiny of the Irish tax authorities. Ansbacher Cayman then redeposited its funds in a consolidated account with Guinness Mahon in Dublin. </p> <p>Internal auditors for both banks expressed concern at the exposure to risk of mismanagement and fraud by Traynor's operation of the Ansbacher deposits. At one stage these reached IR\u00a338m and comprised one third of Guinness Mahon's liabilities. Access to the operations of the Ansbacher accounts and the coded names of the estimated 120 secret depositors was kept separate from all other bank business. None of the usual banking controls, paper documentation, independent supervision of staff, operated. The 'bank' was little more than a box of records that Traynor kept in the corner of his office. </p> <p>None of the money ever left Irish shores. When Haughey needed money Traynor simply transferred funds out of the hidden accounts and into the legitimate companies Haughey used to fund his lifestyle. </p> <p>'The guys running the show were ripping off taxes and all of it was being organised by Des Traynor. Charlie was a great Taoiseach to have around even if they did have to give him a bit of money. He was not exactly going to order an investigation into offshore accounts or give the revenue commissioners a new set of computers,' said a close observer of the tribunal proceedings. </p> <p>Despite the evidence against him Haughey still continued to deny all knowledge of money from Dunne until the very last moment. But the evidence of the bank drafts he had personally received from Ben Dunne was irrefutable. He was forced to issue a statement saying he had 'mistakenly' instructed his legal team and, yes, he had taken the money. He was a proven liar. </p> <p> Bizarrely, apart from Ben Dunne being top of the Haughey family wedding invitation list, McCracken found no evidence that Dunnes' companies received any favours from Haughey. 'Charlie would have had such a sense of noblesse oblige that he would think it was his entitlement. And he certainly would not have felt he was under an obligation. I suppose like Napoleon he went a bit barmy,' said his lover Keane. </p> <p>McCracken was not the end of Haughey's fall from grace; it was the beginning. McCracken was soon replaced by the Moriarty Tribunal tasked with trawling through his entire financial records. It discovered that businessmen keen for his favours invested tens of thousands of pounds in the Haughey family helicopter firm Celtic Helicopters. One such investor was Guy Snowden, the disgraced former American director of the national lottery firm Camelot, who lost his libel trial against Richard Branson over corruption allegations. </p> <p>As leader of Fianna Fail, Haughey also had control of the funds that the Irish state pays its political parties to help with staff and research costs. Money from that account, countersigned unknowingly by Bertie Ahern, ended up being used to pay his Charvet shirt bill, IR\u00a315, 000, and his bill, IR\u00a314,000, at Le Coq Hardi. An IR\u00a320,000 donation to the cancer fund of his seriously ill foreign minister Brian Lenihan, who received a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic, ended up in the account of Celtic Helicopters. </p> <p>The new Ireland, a country of computer firms and the vibrant economically successful Celtic Tiger, was shocked and outraged at its hidden past of sleazy deals, bribery and Charles Haughey. The people turned. Instead of the saviour he was now the scoundrel of the nation. 'Haughey represents the corruption that ran through Irish society. He represents the centre of it all,' said Kevin Scally, a teacher who also queued to see Haughey in the witness box. </p> <p>Finally, even his mistress Terry Keane betrayed him by selling her story, and some highly embarrassing pictures of the couple kissing, to a Dublin newspaper in May 1999 for IR\u00a365,000 and auctioning off his old love tokens. To Haughey's fury, Keane also appeared on a popular Irish television chat show to expand on their relationship. Their 27-year relationship ended in a terse phone call the following day. 'Charlie didn't so much think that he would not get caught, he thought it would not matter if he did,' said Keane tartly. </p> <p> Like his hero Napoleon, Haughey, when he is not in the witness box, spends his final days in a gilded mansion, Abbeville, that has become his prison. He is deserted and alone, railing against his enemies and lamenting what could have been. Nothing will erase the ignominy, the shame, of his fall. It may be just, but it is a bitter end to an illustrious career. Even Charles Haughey might be forgiven for cursing that Florida police officer, far away across the Atlantic, who stopped Ben Dunne, and his secrets, from jumping from the Hyatt Regency's 17th floor balcony.</p>",
  "<p>Nell Gifford's bright eyes are blazing. She's painted her lids with greeny-blue greasepaint, and her lips are an exaggerated chalky pink. Her cheeks are full of colour. Her long, blonde, wavy hair is loose around her broad shoulders and she's dressed in a black, 30s cocktail dress. The curtains open, and she gallops out from the late summer evening darkness into the bright lights of the circus ring. She sits, straight-backed on Eclipse, her fine, young, black-and-white horse, and a little girl in the front row gasps. It's not just the close proximity of the horse's hooves kicking up sawdust and sand that makes the child's eyes open wide, but the sight of Nell herself. Her smile is dazzling. </p> <p>For the few short minutes that she rides Eclipse round the small ring, expertly controlling the pony's every step, the audience is mesmerised. The 27-year-old is everything a circus show-girl should be: glamorous, glittering, Amazonian, wild and wayward. It's the stuff of little girls' dreams. </p> <p>It's opening night of Gifford's Circus on a grassy field in Minety, a tiny village in Wiltshire. Chris the Clown has spent most of the day erecting the hand-operated children's merry-go-round; Gerald, the stage manager has been setting out seats. The Big Top - a plain, cream marquee with a string of bare bulbs decked around the outside - has been tightened up. Sophia and Edwina are in the wardrobe trailer, sewing on sequins, and ironing costumes. Iris, the blue-blooded, ex-model who got sick of her life in front of the camera, and joined the circus when it started last May, is idly drawing in her sketch book. And in her blue transit van, Shaena, the aerial artist, and her partner, Helen, are mending the runs in their flesh-coloured tights from their last performance in Cheltenham. </p> <p>The generators are running. The Portaloos are ready and the box office - a 30s-style, maroon-painted trailer - has been washed and given a polish. There are only 35 seats left to sell out of a full house of 150. Husband-and-wife team, Toti and Nell Gifford, have been busy since the early hours, taking bookings on the mobile, in between mucking out the circus's two horses, helping with banging in tent pegs and building rides. It's been non-stop, and it's just half-an-hour before the show begins. </p> <p>Minety is a special place for Nell. It's the village where she grew up after her family moved from Oxford when she was 10. And it's where her mother had a terrible riding accident that was to leave her in a coma, and turn Nell's life inside out. 'It's really emotional for us to come back,' she says. </p> <p>For almost 10 years, the circus has been in Nell's blood. She fell into it by chance, on her gap year before an English degree at Oxford. Traumatised by her mother's accident, she visited her brother-in-law, Gerald, who'd joined Circus Flora in America. It was not long before Nell caught the bug, too. </p> <p>Most circus people are born into life in the Big Top. Circus families are close knit, and while outsiders like Nell might dream of running away to the circus, there are those who are part of it by birth, who dream of running away from it. Outsiders who join are nicknamed jossers, and that is what Nell became after she graduated, first at Richie Richards' Mega Circus, touring the north-west of England, and then at the UK-touring, French circus, Santus, where she was promoted from a life of mucking out horses to the more glamorous position of ring mistress. </p> <p>Nell's stories of life as a circus girl are told in her book, Josser , published last year by Virago. After Santus, she got a job as a rider at the prestigious German circus, Roncalli, which is run by Billy Smart's granddaughter, Yasmin Smart. While she was working at Roncalli, Nell became engaged to Toti Gifford, a landscape architect with no previous interest in the circus. Inevitably, Toti also caught the bug. In May 1999, Toti and Nell were married and back in England. As a result of her book, she was invited to attend the Hay Literary Festival - with her own circus. She accepted and Gifford's Circus was born. </p> <p>The 22-strong circus includes a clown, two aerial artists from a circus school in Bristol, three dancing girls, a contortionist, a juggler, a couple of musicians, and a wardrobe mistress. Interested friends volunteered to pitch in, including the model Iris Palmer. 'Nell needed someone in wardrobe, so I volunteered to help,' says Iris, who is a cousin of fellow model-turned-student, Honor Fraser, and niece of Lord Glenconner. Her mother is a member of the eccentric Scottish Tennant dynasty. A few years ago, Iris was an international model, posing for fashion shoots in Vogue , and walking the catwalk every season. She's still on the books of her agency, Storm, where she was signed after being 'discovered' by Isabella Blow. But the 23-year-old has now moved away from her jet-set London life, back to a country house in Gloucestershire and has pretty much given up modelling, which she describes as 'fruitless'. </p> <p>The circus interests Iris far more than fashion. She joined Gifford's for the first leg of the tour. She liked the fact the circus involves art and skill, as well as total discipline. 'Me and Sophia did the wardrobe and the curtains for the first tour between us. It meant living the circus 24 hours a day, with no heating, or anything. We survived on good spirit.' Sophia, a freelance theatrical costume maker, designed the costumes and helps with the horses. Tonight, she is also a curtain girl. 'You don't really have any other life, once you're in the circus,' she says. </p> <p>Doing the curtains means literally opening and closing them for each act to enter or exit the ring. The curtain girls wear glittery, sequinned butterfly-appliqu\u00e9 tops, little skirts and fishnet tights. They have to smile throughout the performance. </p> <p>For the Cotswolds tour, Iris is taking a back seat, concentrating instead on her drawing. Nell wants her to put an act together for next season. 'I have to find out what I'm best at - I could be an acrobat, or a gymnast. My legs and arms are really strong. I tried comedy, but it was a bit close to the bone.' According to Gerald, 'She's a natural.' </p> <p>Gifford's has some of the poshest and most glamorous curtain girls in the business. For the Cotswolds season, it is the turn of another Storm model, Lydia M, to take responsibility for the curtain, alongside Edwina Belmont, whose sister, Lara, starred in Tim Roth's movie, War Zone . Lydia happens to be part of the Gifford family; she's married to Nell's brother. Whenever she has a gap in her modelling schedule, she travels to the circus to put on her fishnets and smile sweetly for the audience. Edwina, another of Isabella Blow's young prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, has also had a stint on Storm's books. She's still only 19, but already she's modelled, worked as the coat girl at the Soho club Gaz's Rockin' Blues, made hats with Philip Treacy and travelled the world. Now's she's joined the circus, although she eventually hopes to get a place at Central Saint Martin's in London to do fashion. Edwina has taken over Iris's job for the six-week season. She sleeps in a small tent at the back of the Big Top. 'It's such a romantic idea... the costumes and the fantasy. Now I think I want to work as a cowgirl in Texas.' And no doubt she will. </p> <p>After the show, the audience hang around in the darkness of the field, the children pulling their parents' arms to go backstage and see the horses, and the little girls asking Helen and Shaena how they can stroke their arms with the flaming torches without getting burnt. The truth is, on close inspection, their arms have patches of hard skin and all the hairs have been torched off. </p> <p>It was almost a full house and the artists are on a high. Everyone piles down to the pub, desperately hoping that they serve food after 10pm. Nell's eyes, still smudged with theatrical make-up, are bloodshot. She looks exhausted, but she's happy. There's nothing like a big audience to boost morale. </p> <p>Gifford's is a traditional, 30s, village green circus. There's nothing grand about it. It doesn't have the fabulous airs and graces of Circus Roncalli, or the tacky commercialism that has come to typify English circus. 'We've put everything we have into it,' says Nell. 'We could have a comfortable house, nice clothes, three holidays a year.' Instead, they have a 20ft trailer with a gas cooker, a clapped-out leather sofa, and a bed at the back. In order to survive, they rely on Toti's income from his landscape business. </p> <p>Later, back at her caravan, Nell kicks off her cowboy boots and falls into bed. She has to be up at seven, to muck out the horses, feed the animals, organise the next day's parade through a nearby town to drum up publicity. To survive, the circus must keep on moving and keep on selling itself. On a nearby farm, the cockerels begin to crow. A new day dawns and it's showtime all over again.</p> <p>\u0095 Gifford's Circus is touring the Cotswolds until 17 September. For more information, call 07818 058 384</p>",
  "<p>Ah, the empurpled Lakeland hills! Mighty Scafell and Crinkle Crag! The splash of rill and babbling burn! And yet amid such majesty, might a vex'd traveller in a Fiat people carrier pause a while upon a crude, ill-tarmac'd precipice and marvel at what piece of intelligence is a sheep that has a million acres of grass at its disposal and still decides to park its arse in the middle of the road? </p> <p>I nudge the car up the hill towards the wool-witted miscreant. Handbrake. </p> <p>'Why don't you honk the horn, Dad?' </p> <p>'Remember, this is the sheep's home, not ours,' my wife coos. </p> <p>The sheep yawns and opens a newspaper. </p> <p>'Get out of the WAY!' I shout, revving, waving my arms. </p> <p>At last it gets up and joins its friends, who all give it high fives and slap it on the back. They go off, baaing in triumph. </p> <p>We're heading for Muncaster Castle, conveniently located at the other side of whatever this mountain is called, which according to the map is slightly further into the middle of nowhere than the rest of the Lake District. </p> <p>'Can it possibly be this far?' I say. </p> <p>'Look, they put the castle up 800 years ago,' says my wife. 'You can't blame them for not guessing where the motorway was going to be.' </p> <p>At last we're there. And actually it is quite brilliant. The place is huge, with its own little old church and views that look like paintings and a giant environmentally oriented vole maze and world-renowned owl conservation things going on, and enough dark, leafy trails into the surrounding acres of wild gardens to lose all your children in one go while you're having a beer. </p> <p>We leave the older ones swinging from a zipline in the playground while we go inside the castle, which not only has walls and a proper roof but the same family still live here who stopped marauding Scots getting into our country when the king couldn't be fagged to help, back in the year dot. Even to this day a twinkle-eyed grandfatherly figure in a tweed jacket stalks the Great Hall regaling unwary visitors with tales of Lord Muncasters past, in particular his father-in-law, who came second in the Grand National on a horse with one eye and was awarded a medal by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie for showing him how to use a lawnmower, and someone else who was British attach\u00e9 in Paris but was eaten by a bear in 1865. The grandfatherly figure in the jacket is Patrick, who happens to own the place. He's very nice. He shows us some stained-glass windows from 1550 and a cup owned by Henry VI and spooky rooms with four-posters, including one slept in not only by Edward VIII but also his granddaughter Kate (Patrick's granddaughter Kate, not Edward VIII's), who is staying for the weekend. At the top of the stairs there's a picture of Tom Fool, who was the jester here in the 1500s and who used to sit under a tree and direct lost travellers into the quicksand and eventually chopped the carpenter's head off, which in those days passed for having a well-developed sense of humour. Needless to say, he soon came to the attention of William Shakespeare, who couldn't stop laughing and by all accounts used him as the model for the Fool in King Lear . It is said that you can still hear old Tom clumping around the corridors, dragging his bumper book of excellent jests behind him. </p> <p>We go outside to see the owls being exercised on the lawn. The woman tells us that there's hardly any long grass any more and so barn owls are endangered mainly because they have to hunt near motorways and keep getting hit by lorries. </p> <p>We sit dribbling ice lollies and watch the fire-eater, before hiking through the forest, which is full of trees from the Himalayas. 'This is a Douglas fir,' I say knowledgeably. I have learnt that Douglas himself fell into a trap in Hawaii, where he was trampled to death by wild cows. He also invented lupins. Right at the top, we climb over the stile and on to the moor full of thistles and rocks and drystone walling and look out over the sea. On a good day, you can see the Isle of Man and Scotland and Wales and Tunisia. Even Sellafield looks like poetry out there, steaming in the distance. </p> <p>'Baa,' say the sheep, who are passing through on their way to the A595.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:phil.hogan@observer.co.uk\">phil.hogan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "What better way to keep your larder stocked with honey than to have your own hive of honeybees? It's an inexpensive hobby, but the best bit is that they will be doing all the hard work: it takes worker bees 10 million foraging trips to collect sufficient nectar for one pound of honey. Bees from one hive will make more than 4 million visits to flowers in one day's work, and in the height of summer, 1,000 may die daily from exhaustion. <p>An average \u00a3200-hive will have 10 or 11 frames. Eggs are laid in 'brood frames' and, divided by a 'queen excluder'; the honey is deposited in the 'super frames'. A 'hive tool', to lift the frames, is \u00a38. A small nucleus of honeybees is \u00a3100 and will consist of about 20,000 workers and one laying queen. This is an all-female workforce - male bees don't do much except mate the queen. </p> <p>There are 25,000 species of bee and generally the most productive are a darker colour and from more northerly areas. The Italian honeybee, for instance, which is an elegant pale-gold shade, is notoriously workshy. Britain's native black bee was decimated by disease after the First World War. </p> <p>To minimise the chances of getting stung, wear a one-piece protective suit (\u00a380). Bees are complex creatures, performing dances to describe the locations of flowers to others in the hive. They even have a built-in clock (accurate to within four minutes) that helps them navigate by tracking the movement of the sun. But they are not intelligent: it is thought that the smoker used when collecting honey works by tricking the bees into thinking they are threatened. The bees quickly gorge themselves on honey, but eat so much that they become lethargic and unable to fly. However, they are usually very fuel efficient, flying the equivalent of 2 million miles per gallon. </p> <p>Since the point of beekeeping is to collect honey, you should feed the bees a sugar syrup in the autumn and winter. But if your worst B-movie nightmares come true and they turn nasty on you, a pest-control expert can remove them for \u00a340. </p> <p><b> Hive </b> \u00a3200 <br><b>Nucleus of bees </b> \u00a3100 <br><b>Hive tool </b> \u00a38 <br><b>Protective clothing </b> \u00a380 <br><b>Smoker </b> \u00a325 <br><b>Feeder </b> \u00a310 <br><b>Honey strainer </b> \u00a33 <br><b>Pest control </b> \u00a340 <br><b>Total </b> \u00a3466</p>",
  "<p>It was a watershed week in the history of rock. A week when the old British establishment was toppled and a new wave of American bands took over. A week when the generational divide was reasserted, and teen-pop duo Daphne and Celeste were pelted with bottles full of urine. A week when Britt Ekland slipped on a melon and broke her ankle. It was that kind of week. Nothing will ever be the same again. </p> <p>It started last weekend, when the Reading and Leeds festivals, though headlined by Oasis, Stereophonics and Pulp, were dominated by the sound of nu metal: hordes of kids in baggy shorts moshed to Slipknot and Limp Bizkit and booed every mention of Oasis's name. One merchandise salesman revealed that, on Monday in Leeds, he had sold 14 Oasis T-shirts and 2,500 Slipknot T-shirts. The covers of both NME and Melody Maker featured Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit singing to a sea of faces at Reading. According to Wednesday's Independent, this was 'the night the Nineties ended'. </p> <p>On Tuesday, day zero of the new era, I went to the annual awards ceremony for Kerrang! magazine - until recently an anachronistic heavy rock magazine, now the bible of the nu-metal scene and the only music magazine in Britain with rising sales figures. The magazine's editor Paul Rees hailed 'a remarkable year for rock music'. Slipknot collected three awards, each time smashing up their chairs and tossing microphone stands from the stage. An hour later, Britt Ekland had her unfortunate accident, having to be carried up on to the stage in order to present an honorary award to Marilyn Manson, last year's scariest man in the world, who praised Slipknot for their 'honesty' and mused about being 'over the hill'. </p> <p>It was a bizarre evening, but the sense of being on the right side of a coup d'\u00e9tat was unmistakable. The Kerrang! Creativity Award, for example, went to Ross Robinson, the man who discovered and produced many of the bands at the heart of this new wave - including Slipknot - and who has just been given his own international record label by Virgin. With his bright white sneakers and clean-cut face, this 33-year-old Californian looks an unlikely revolutionary, but he talks the talk. In a booth at the Hammersmith Palais, while a succession of people come over to slap his back, Robinson explains the spirit that unites this new wave of rock bands: 'Passion and hunger,' he says. 'Absolute hunger. It's not about getting chicks or making money or any of that crap. It's about being pure and real, beautiful and extreme.' </p> <p>As with punk in the Seventies, the movement is spearheaded by two bands with markedly different agendas - Limp Bizkit, the Clash-like poster boys, and Slipknot, the Sex Pistols of their generation: mask-wearing nihilists who hate everything. </p> <p>Following in their slipstream are a legion of American bands, including established, million-selling acts like Korn, Kid Rock, Deftones and Rage Against the Machine, and newer bands such as Amen, Glass Jaw and At The Drive-In. </p> <p>Whatever you want to call this movement - nu metal, sports metal, adidas rock -it has its roots in the fusion of hard rock and hardcore rap. The bands are all white, as are most of their fans, but they revere and borrow from the musical and fashion stylings of black hip-hop culture, creating a massive new subculture which is energetic but nihilistic, angst-ridden but with the beats and riffs to get a frat party going. </p> <p>All these bands know each other, but they are not exactly friends. In the space of three days, I hear Slipknot diss Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson diss Limp Bizkit, and Limp Bizkit diss Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. As Fred Durst yells on Limp Bizkit's recent Top 3 single, 'Take A Look Around' (the theme to Mission Impossible 2 ), 'hate is all the world has seen lately'. </p> <p>To anyone over the age of 20, there is something comical about all this. I have seen few things funnier than Slipknot's unease at the Kerrang! Awards. 'We don't know how to feel about this,' one of the masked figures confessed gruffly as he clutched the Best International Live Act gong. 'It's way too formal and we're a band that likes to puke on each other and beat each other up.' Ten minutes later, pronounced Best Band in the World, they throw a table full of drinks to the floor, dedicate the award to 'my grandmother', then stand meekly in line to collect their gold discs. The ghost of Spinal Tap hovers in the background. </p> <p>But the fact that it's all been done before doesn't make this phenomenon any less meaningful. This is the sound of a generation - or at least of the half of a generation that isn't E'd off its collective head at the local club. Ecstasy and agony, it seems, are the only popular cultural options available to the modern teenager. </p> <p>Twenty-four hours later, in a Parisian boardroom, angst is still in the air as Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst and Wes Borland answer questions from the European press about Woodstock (the band were blamed by some people for the rioting and arson that took place at last year's festival), the title of their forthcoming album ( Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog-Coloured Water - it's lavatorial humour; 'the most stupid title we could think of'), and why they think everyone hates them. 'It is just marketing, yes?' probes one French journalist. Durst and Borland are articulate and dry-witted, but their message is familiar and deadly earnest. 'I'm not drinking alcohol and popping pills and taking heroin and fucking chicks all day,' says Durst, who is 26, gruffly good-looking and permanently baseball-capped. </p> <p>He is, rather, trying to express his feelings about the screwed-up nature of the world, and by extension the feelings of 'his' generation (albeit most of his generation are roughly half his age). The chorus to the band's new single, 'My Generation', goes: 'How can we give a fuck about anyone else if they don't give a fuck about us?' Outside on the street, hundreds of French skate-kids send up chants of approval. </p> <p>Like Slipknot, Korn and others, Limp Bizkit's main, abiding concern is for their fans. They are in the vanguard of bands using the internet to their advantage - their latest free-entry tour of the US was sponsored by Napster - and, in contrast to the rather high-minded, artistic ways of earlier rock bands, Limp Bizkit regard themselves as their fans' servants, much as boy-bands profess to do. 'We would never have a sudden change of musical direction and leave our fans behind,' Durst swears. 'Our new album is like the first two, only more so. If you like Limp Bizkit, you'll love the new album. If you don't like us, you'll hate it.' </p> <p>By 9pm a generation is sweating out its anxieties in a seething, sweltering, 2,000-capacity venue. All bare-chested boys and nose-ringed girls, the Parisian audience is in its late teens and knows every word to every noxious American rap ('Everything is fucked, everybody sucks... your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!'). At heart, though, Limp Bizkit are a powerful, theatrical rock band - entertainers who cover George Michael's 'Faith' and use fireworks, glitter confetti and jets of flame to give things a lift. Next March's European tour will, they promise, be a production '10 times bigger than anything seen in the last few years'. Afterwards the reviewer from Kerrang! sniffs something disdainful about 'metal cabaret'. </p> <p>As Durst well knows, mass success brings with it the seeds of destruction, particularly for bands as desperately, self-consciously 'real' as Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. At the Kerrang! Awards, Ross Robinson muttered darkly about nu metal already being 'about to die'. In the Paris press conference, Durst imagines, a few years down the line, that 'everyone will be like: \"Limp Bizkit? They suck, man!\" The best any band can hope for is to be a little moment in history.' </p> <p>Fasten your seatbelts, dudes. This is your moment. </p> <p><strong>The beginner's guide to Nu Metal</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> The bands </strong> Limp Bizkit. Slipknot. Korn. Rage Against the Machine. Deftones. Amen. Static-X. System of a Down. At the Drive-In. Snot. Orgy. </p> <p><strong> The music </strong> Loud and heavy guitars, big crashing drums - a bit like old metal (Metallica, Anthrax etc), but with hip-hop and dance rhythms, and often with rapped vocals. No guitar solos. </p> <p><strong> The fashion </strong> Multiple piercing, sometimes with chains. Tattoos and bodypaint. Baggy shorts. Trainers. No leather, spandex or long hair. </p> <p><strong> The influences </strong> Nu metal fans are generally unaware that music existed before 1991. Their Beatles are Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Eminem. </p> <p><strong> The lyrics </strong> Angst-ridden and filled with doom and bitterness. Lots of swearing and generalised swipes at the 'system'. Very little sex, no satanism.</p>",
  "<p>Practically anyone can set up as a credit broker peddling loans to people who cannot afford them. </p> <p> The Observer knows this because one of our journalists, then a trainee, obtained a licence with few questions asked. That was nearly three years ago but there has been no improvement since in the system for policing credit brokers. The system is run by the Office of Fair Trading, and its shortcomings were highlighted in a damning report on the watchdog's work last week by the Commons Public Accounts Committee. The OFT revoked only 18 out of 150,000 licences between 1998 and 1999. Out of 21,200 applications, only 15 were refused. The report notes that the number revoked had fallen by two-thirds in the three years up to that period. </p> <p>The committee believes the OFT has not done enough to protect consumers, not only those shopping for credit but in other fields, notably car repairs. </p> <p>In the OFT's defence, it has undertaken some valuable research, especially in relation to financial prod ucts, and has persuaded banks to undo unfair mortgage penalties. </p> <p>But the scope and quality of its work is inconsistent. It almost certainly lacks financial resources to act as an effective policeman and is hampered by inadequate legislation in several areas. Fixing this fusty bureaucracy may not be a headline grab ber for the Government, but long term the benefits for consumers could be huge. </p> <p>INSURER Axa Equity &amp; Law is on the hustings collecting votes from policyholders for its plan to share out 'orphan', or surplus, assets in its life insurance fund.

  "<b> Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</b> Royal Albert Hall/Radio 3 <br> <b> San Francisco Symphony</b> Royal Albert Hall/BBC2/Radio 3 <br> <b> Salvator Rosa </b> Dorset Opera, Sherborne School, Dorset <p>You know a great performance when, like a gripping book, you dread to reach the end. From the mysterious, exploratory opening of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony to the whirlwind finale, the <b> Berlin Philharmonic</b>'s performance was one to savour greedily, each bar demanding - and achieving - total concentration from listener and player alike. Attack, detail, dynamics, clarity of phrase and structure, beauty of sound, these are the ingredients of a world-class orchestra, possessed by the Berlin players in abundance and brought to fruition by Bernard Haitink (replacing an indisposed Claudio Abbado). Of course to some extent these matters are subjective, but not entirely: when an orchestra catches the audience's attention, the effect is palpable. No one coughs or moves as if the entire auditorium is engaged in a collective holding of breath - which in a full Albert Hall is quite some feat. </p> <p>The arrival of the major foreign orchestras at the Proms as they reach their home stretch always adds end-of-season zest and heightens expectation. In two programmes, the Berlin PO chose the standard, mainstream German repertoire for which they are celebrated: Wagner, Bruckner, Strauss, Beethoven and, for an encore, Schubert. Since they still do it better than anyone (sweeping statements must be allowed occasionally), their conservatism is justified - though whether Simon Rattle, when he takes over, will share that narrow view is another matter. To hear Beethoven played with such dazzling purity, in any case, is always an avant-garde adventure. </p> <p>The brisk performance highlighted the keen economy of Beethoven's score, in which not one note is wasted. How starkly this contrasts with Strauss's sprawling, episodic and somewhat inconsequential tone-poem, Don Quixote, played in the first half of the programme, with Natalia Gutman (cello) and Wolfram Christ (viola) as soloists. Despite using nearly twice the orchestral resources, this hybrid concerto sounds pale and inflated in comparison, the energy spent rather than sustained. Strauss, a conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic for one year in the 1890s, writes virtuosic solos for the orchestra and uses his forces to brilliant, showy effect. But to what end? </p> <p>The formidable Berliners were followed by that great showman among conductors, Michael Tilson Thomas who could make a pile of stones dance, given the challenge. Since becoming music director of the orchestra in 1995, he has poured his energies into the <b> San Francisco Symphony</b> which plays with renewed life and vigour, if not quite the finesse of its Berlin colleagues. </p> <p>Always a champion of the new, Tilson Thomas has worked hard to convince audiences of the elusive charms of Carl Ruggles (whose family crest apparently included the word 'struggle', a point not lost on this difficult composer - or his audiences). The irascible American modernist, who lived in a log cabin in New England and took years to complete each of the handful of pieces he wrote in his long life, never won much recognition. As a programme note reminds us, he was heckled at a concert in 1931, prompting his friend the composer Charles Ives to respond: 'You goddam sissy! When you hear strong masculine music like this, get up and use your ears like a man!' (i.e. Say not the Ruggles Naught Availeth). Sun-treader (1926-31), his tribute to Shelley, is loud, apocalyptic, dissonant and doleful. The San Francisco brass revelled in it but even their ardour could not quite convince, intriguing and valid though it was to hear the piece. It certainly warmed them up for an ear-piercing and electrifying account of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring after the interval. </p> <p>The work which the crowd had come to hear was Schumann's Piano Concerto in A minor, Op 54, played by the renowned Argentinian pianist Martha Argerich, whose public appearances are so rare and treasured that she quite deserves her living-legend reputation. Trying to define her particular qualities, especially a work in which piano and orchestra are evenly matched rather than in gladiatorial combat, is no easy task. Muscularity combined with complete musical and physical control and extraordinary fluidity is about half the story. Her reputation adds to the excitement of her performances, allowing occasional smudges to pass almost unnoticed while for a lesser artist they would matter - such is the unfairness of stardom. She was called back at least five times by a preparedly ecstatic audience. </p> <p>A brief, belated word of praise for <b> Dorset Opera</b>, a well-established semi-professional company which had the initiative to raise Salvator Rosa, if not from the dead, at least from a very deep sleep. The cue for its revival was this year's 'Brazil 500' festival in celebration of that country's half-millennial anniversary. Carlos Gomes (1836-1896) studied in Rio de Janeiro but spent most of his life in Italy, absorbing the grand operatic styles of Rossini, Donizetti and Verdi. Had Puccini not arrived on the scene and eclipsed this real but lesser talent, Gomes might have remained known today. His four-act opera, based on the life of the seventeenth-century Italian painter, bursts with conflict and bloodshed, grand choruses and pulsating melodies, reminiscent of middle-period Verdi. Dorset Opera, performing in high style on the enchanting, if tiny, stage of Sherborne School, made it enthralling. The very name Dorset conjures up a sleepy rurality: all the more rewarding then to encounter such musical excitement.</p>",
  "<p><strong> 1920s Germany: a class for teenagers</strong></p> <p> In a pilot study in Salford, teenagers in a secure unit were taught about the value and nature of money, and the effect of inflation over time by looking at German hyperinflation in the 1920s. </p> <p>They were shown large facsimiles of old German banknotes and then shown a video where a man went into a cafe, had a coffee, paid and walked out.

  "What is the difference between a documentary and a home movie? Modern technology can deliver unexpurgated reality off the internet to any computer screen near you. Big Brother can claim to record what we are really like with its 24-hour access to the lives of its performers. The pure visual document is surely at hand - no danger of dastardly film-makers misleading the audience. <p>Making London with my co-director Tom Roberts over the past few months has raised a gamut of questions about what documentaries today are trying to achieve and how. The film is deliberately based on the 'day in the life' concept, an old chestnut that goes back to the very beginnings of British documentary tradition. The form was conceived out of a political and artistic movement to find out how real people lived and felt. </p> <p>Perhaps the most influential example, certainly one that has inspired me, was Humphrey Jennings's Listen to Britain. Made during the Second World War, the film purports to capture the way people were responding to the German onslaught during the Blitz, and comes down to us as a celebration of that strange phenomenon called the British spirit. The film stretches from one afternoon to the next and is constructed to suggest immediacy and improvisation; real people expressing emotions caught in the moment. </p> <p>Today the film-makers would be hung out to dry on tabloid headlines for misleading the audience. Technology in 1941 did not allow observation in the form we understand it now; 35mm cameras could not be handheld, sound equipment was driven around in. Not only was Listen to Britain not filmed over one day but all the shooting was planned in advance. Canadian soldiers were hired to sing in specially lit railway carriages, which stood in sidings. What made it documentary was that the people were who they acted. The achievement of the film, and those like it, is to take you to the heart of a historical moment, an achievement finally shaped by the director, film editor and all involved. The film has a clear vision of what it is about. </p> <p>Faced with trying to achieve something similar in 2000, we decided to film everything in a single day - in this case the day after London's first mayoral election. We set out to exploit to the maximum the flexibility that lightweight cameras, CCTV and other modern gizmos give us. Our editorial intention was the opposite of Jennings's. While he had sought to communicate a society united despite all its social differences, we set out to capture the sheer variety of individual lives that exist in any modern city, rubbing together but essentially carrying on independently. </p> <p>For all the greater authenticity of the shooting, at heart the film-making process was similar. We made lists of scenes, places, types. We drew up a structure of characters and events that were prearranged to ensure that we had some sequences to edit at the end of the day. Yet we allowed directors and crews the maximum flexibility to pick up what happened in the town as they were passing: Jennings could never have caught a drunken couple feeling each other up in a dark underpass or two girls 'tripping' their way through Chinatown. </p> <p>Equally, we had worked out itineraries and goals - and in most cases characters and scenes to work with. We then tried to observe the world through their eyes, as opposed to restaging what we wanted, but the distinction in some cases is marginal. In the final film we use the bits that feel real, where the subjects have by and large forgotten the camera is there. No different, I suspect, from Jennings's film editor. </p> <p>By claiming or even seeking greater 'realism' from modern technology, have we created a rod for our own backs? The art of 'making' a film is sacrificed to the guidelines of broadcasters and regulators set down because the concepts of truth, authenticity and reality have all got confused. </p> <p>So a number of directors have moved back to staging their documentaries. Penny Woolcock's wonderful Tina Goes Shopping, shown on C4 last year, is just one that uses a method not that far from that of Jennings - but for different reasons. You research the story, structure it and then employ the people you researched to act themselves. Restaging reality. </p> <p>Ultimately London will succeed or fail on the same terms as Listen to Britain: the advance editorial selection, the skill on the day of the shoot and, in particular, the editing of hundreds of hours of material (that's only five days of internet-reality TV) into a shape or vision that says something more than the sum of its images. </p> <p>As Dai Vaughan wrote in his book on the making of Jennings's films: 'Films which simply remind us of what we have experienced are not documentaries, but home movies.' We must still make the documents.</p> <p>\u0095 London will be shown tonight on BBC2, 10pm. Angus Macqueen's Vodka, A Russian Fairytale is on next Saturday, C4, 7.45pm</p>",
  "<p>In 1996, the photographer Corinne Day collapsed in her apartment in New York and had a seizure. Her flatmate called the paramedics, and when she regained consciousness, she immediately asked him to bring her camera into the ambulance to record it all. Not the first instinct most of us would have in the circumstances, but then Day has never claimed to be ordinary. 'The camera becomes a part of your life,' she says matter-of-factly. 'I'm a photography junkie. I'm just driven. I don't know why.' </p> <p>And so it is, in her new book Diary, that you can see Day lying in a bed in Belvue hospital looking frightened and confused seconds after being told she had a brain tumour. You can see the needle being pushed into her forehead just before the operation to remove it, and you see her looking terrified in the lift going down to the theatre. These pictures were taken by her boyfriend of 13 years, Mark Szaszy, who says it was hard to do because his hands were shaking with emotion. 'But I knew if I did it, it would take her mind off what was happening.' </p> <p>Diary consists of 100 photographs taken over a 10-year period, a raw, unflinching look at the lives of Day and her friends. It's a high-quality art book, beautifully presented, but most of the images make uncomfortable viewing. Some are painfully intimate, some unbearably sad, many focusing around Tara St Hill, a single mother in her early twenties, struggling to bring up her baby daughter with little money and the pain of Crohn's Disease. </p> <p>Nothing is taboo, too private to show in this book. There's a picture of Day pretending to masturbate. Another shows her bloody knickers. We see Day and her friends taking drugs, having parties, in the bath, injured after accidents and fights. We see Tara pregnant, Tara crying, Tara having sex, Tara on the loo. 'To me, photography is about showing us things that we don't normally see,' explains Day. 'Getting as close as you can to real life. What I found interesting was to capture people's most intimate moments. And sometimes intimacy is sad. In photos, we're usually laughing and happy and having a good time. We don't normally see the other side, when we're not having such a good time.' </p> <p>Corrine Day has always been unconventional. She was bought up by her nan in the village of Ickenham just to the west of London. Her mother, she claims, ran a brothel. Her father was 'in and out of trouble' in his youth, then busy building a legitimate business empire. He wasn't that interested in kids, and she didn't really get to know him until she was older. It was his obsession with money, she says, that made her so indifferent to it. 'My dad was incredibly driven by money, and I felt like I lost him to it. When I was a kid he had a big house, but I hated going there. It never felt like home. There was no love there.' </p> <p>'Too busy being naughty' to learn much at school, she earned a meagre living afterwards flying round the world as a courier. A photographer she met on a plane suggested she take up modelling, and although she was considered short at 5ft 6in, she did a lot of catalogue work, living in Japan for a while - where she met Mark Szaszy - and then in LA. It was the mid-Eighties, when glamour was compulsory, but Day's face didn't take the required layers of make-up too well. </p> <p>'I don't have great cheekbones, or huge lips to pile lipstick on - it didn't suit me. I wasn't really a conventional beauty, I was quite plain-looking for a model. When I first saw Christy Turlington, all my hopes of ever getting on the cover of Vogue were gone. So I just made the best of it, and enjoyed it - I loved the travelling. We went to Australia, Spain, and ended up in Milan. That's where I started to take pictures. Mark had a camera, and he taught me how to use it.' </p> <p>Her subjects were other struggling models, photographed in their own clothes in the seedy hostels where they lived. 'I started to realise that it was ambiguous, the life. Even though you're surrounded by all this glamour, there was a lot of sadness. We couldn't buy the clothes that we were photographed in, couldn't afford to go out and do the things we would have liked to do as teenagers.' </p> <p>She took her work to The Face's art director Phil Bicker, who was opening up the magazine to a new generation of young, innovative talent at the end of the Eighties. Bicker asked her to shoot some fashion pictures, but having been away from England for five years, she had no contacts with models. So she trawled the London agencies looking for new talent, eventually spotting a Polaroid of a teenager from Croydon. At 14, Kate Moss was 10 years younger than Day, but they connected almost instantly. </p> <p>'She was a beauty, but there was also something quite ordinary about her: her hair was a bit scraggy, and with no make-up she just looked like the girl next door. I encouraged her to be natural. I'd chat to her and then take the pictures in the middle of the conversation. I was trying to get the person to just bring themselves to the camera.' </p> <p>Bicker made Kate Moss the face of The Face, and Day's best images of her summed up the mood of British youth after the rave explosion. But Moss and her agency weren't always happy with the pictures. Moss got teased at school for exposing her flat chest in one classic 1990 shoot, and the agency worried that the photographer deliberately left in imperfections like bags under the eyes that others would have retouched. But for Day, this was the point. 'It was something I just felt so deep inside, being a model and hating the way I was made up. The photographer always made me into someone I wasn't. I wanted to go in the opposite direction.' </p> <p>Working with stylist Melanie Ward, Day and a handful of other photographers such as David Sims began using second-hand clothes and ungroomed, unconventional-looking models discovered in the street. The look they pioneered began to take off, christened 'waif' at first, then merging seamlessly with the US grunge scene. At the Paris shows, Ward and Day would laugh to see the second-hand clothes they'd shot six months before being imitated on the catwalk. </p> <p>But Day was ambivalent about her growing success. She photographed the couture collections for Vogue, but hated it. She did a shoot with Linda Evangelista, and found it pointless. 'She just didn't excite me. Photographing someone you don't know and never plan to see again is so impersonal. The photograph means nothing. When Kate and I did our first Vogue cover, that was exciting.' </p> <p>As the look was assimilated into the mainstream, so were the group who created it. Kate Moss signed to Calvin Klein. Melanie Ward moved to New York to work for Harper's Bazaar. The photographers Day had come up with became the new stars of the fashion world, shooting big-budget advertising campaigns. Unimpressed by money or fame, Day instead became increasingly drawn to the kind of documentary art photographs taken by Nan Goldin. </p> <p>By 1993, she had alienated almost everyone she worked with - although she would probably say that they all let her down. She shot a sad-looking Kate Moss for Vogue wearing cheap undies, baggy tights and no make-up. Published during the summer lull when all news is gratefully pounced upon by the media, the story provoked outrage, with claims that it was promoting anorexia, drugs, even paedophilia. It was the end of her relationship with Vogue, and, for a while, with Moss. </p> <p>Corinne Day met Tara St Hill in 1991 and began photographing her and her boyfriend. By 1993, they were all involved with a dark, heavy British rock band called Pusherman, and as Day's fashion family fell apart, she replaced it instead with this new gang of friends. Everyone partied and took drugs - cannabis, ketamine, heroin - although Day says she never developed a habit. 'I never liked heroin that much. It's a very overrated drug.' </p> <p>The pictures she took over the next four years form the basis of Diary, and publishing them seems to have freed her to move on. Day and Szaszy haven't done drugs for over a year. He's making a documentary about her work. She's starting to take fashion pictures again. She did a shoot for Vogue recently, working with Kate Moss for the first time in seven years. It was fun, she says, like no time had passed at all. She's shooting for the magazines now, not for herself. </p> <p>'My attitude is more businesslike, not so aggressive. I'm keeping within the boundaries. It's interesting - I've actually come to a point in my life where I want to make money.' She laughs. 'I've realised that it can be quite useful.' </p> <p>She and Szaszy want a dog now. A house with a garden, possibly in LA. And then maybe children. The last shot in Diary shows a beautiful, palm-fringed beach littered with tin cans. It's a metaphor, she says, for the whole book. If there's a message she wants the viewer to take away, it is that life can be beautiful, and yet it's also fragile, and we often trash it. 'We don't realise how precious it is.' </p> <p>\u0095 Corinne Day's work is on show at the Photographer's Gallery in London, 5 Oct to 26 Nov, and at Gimpel Fils in London, 6 Oct to 17 Nov. Diary is published next month by Kruse Verlag.

  "My friend has suffered from anorexia and bulimia since she was a teenager. She was hospitalised when younger and saw a variety of specialists during her twenties and early thirties. She married during a 'good' spell, but her eating disorders returned and drove her husband away. Now almost 40, she seems to have given up trying to recover and continues to binge and starve herself. Her health is deteriorating: her teeth are becoming discoloured and she has bowel and intestinal problems. I am worried that unless she gets help soon she may not survive more than a few more years. But although we are close, it is almost impossible to discuss her eating disorder with her. I have considered getting together with two or three friends and confronting her with 'tough love', insisting that she checks into a clinic, but I fear she would see this as intrusive and cut off contact with us. What should I do? <br> <b> L.F. of Bristol</b> <p>Acknowledging that you have virtually no power or capacity to change your friend's behaviour may require more wisdom and compassion than straining against her stubbornness. </p> <p>Anorexia/bulimia are usually illnesses affecting young girls and women, but there are few if any long-term studies on what happens to sufferers as they move on into their mature years. It is supposed that most recover, but I've met middle-aged and elderly women who are certainly long-term anorexics, and who have managed somehow to steer through the shoals of their disorder, though seldom enjoying vibrant good health. It is said that as many as 10 per cent of young women with eating disorders die, though this is obviously an overestimate. But there are no figures for older women and I suspect death from this cause in this age group is actually exceedingly rare. </p> <p>I feel uneasy when there is any suggestion of coercion or even undue pressure imposed on a patient. I worry that the concept of 'tough love' has more to do with the crusading fervour of the donor than the benefit of the recipient. </p> <p>Well-wishers as well as health professionals must avoid being too domineering, for the freedom of the individual is sacrosanct as long as no harm to others results. The medical role is to inform, advise and assist, never to moralise or compel. </p> <p>We may believe patients with anorexia and other body dysmorphic syndromes are deluded and irrational, but we have only our own personal standards by which to judge them, and no rock of reference by which to assess our own opinions. As you have discovered, these patients can be intransigent, but pushing your own agenda will cause considerable pain and possibly alienation, when she needs every friend she can get. </p> <p>Of course you should continue to give her support, but find out how this can be done without causing undue stress. She may let you concentrate on alleviating collateral aspects of her physical health. You can engage her in activities which distract by stimulating her enthusiasm. You can try to identify triggers which cause binge/purge crises, and help to avoid them. If she ever does seem to be spiralling down towards depression and suicide, then certainly you would be justified in trying to connect her with professional help. </p> <p><b>Readers' replies</b> </p> <p>You state that your friend has undergone a variety of treatments over the years without success. It is quite likely that at the age of 40 she has accepted the condition as a way of life. Anorexia may have become her only means of feeling in control and, frankly, to have survived this complex disorder for so long must be seen positively. Don't you think that it is time you and your friends offered her the unconditional acceptance which she has possibly craved all her life - hence the eating disorder? <br> <b> B.M. (Clinical Nurse Specialist in Eating Disorders) of Northamptonshire</b> </p> <p>As the mother of a 20-year-old with an eating disorder I am familiar with the anxieties associated with seeing someone you love destroying themselves slowly. I would caution you against taking a tough stance - your friend cannot live without her eating disorder and she would not hesitate to cut you out of her life if she had to make a choice. Could you talk to her mother or sister who could in turn approach her GP? <br> <b> D.M.T.</b> </p> <p><b>Next week's dilema</b> </p> <p>My sister is 75 years old, five years old than me. She recently collapsed and at first the hospital thought she had had a stroke. However, they soon discovered she has a brain tumour. They think it is benign but are unwilling to operate as the risks are far too great. My sister still believes she has suffered a stroke and is hoping for a full recovery. Our family doctor (who has treated both of us for nearly 30 years) has told me they think the tumour is pressing on her brain and her condition will get worse. I hate having this knowledge but I'm worried that if I tell her the truth she may deteriorate more quickly. Does she have the right to know? <br> <b>G.R. of Kent</b></p> <p>Write to Observer Review or email <a href=\"mailto:margaret.cook@observer.co.uk\">margaret.cook@observer.co.uk</a>.

  "The counsellor couldn't tell me how many happily settled parents opt for an abortion rather than another child, just that 'quite a few clients choose termination because they feel that their family is complete'. So, maybe right, maybe wrong, but not abnormal. Not the kind of morality I advocate to my children. <p>The situation was this: I was 37, mother of Zoe (4) and Jack (2), longing to find at least a part-time paid job now Zoe was going to school, for the sake of my sanity as much as our finances. And I was pregnant again. Of course we must have an abortion. But... we see-sawed. </p> <p>If only I was younger. If only I had a secure job with maternity leave, flexible hours and pots of money... Our decision was essentially pragmatic with some comforting post hoc rationalisation: control of our fertility is crucial to women's struggle for equality. And given that (a) neither my partner nor I believed that a just-conceived foetus was a person, and (b) we were using contraceptives, termination was the logical next step. However, there were several interim steps first. </p> <p>Step 1. The visit to the doctor. As I explained that I needed an abortion, Jack started to cry. For a weird moment I thought it was because he had understood. Then I remembered the last time we were here it was for his injections. I put him on my breast to calm him and felt ridiculously relieved that this might show the doctor I was a loving mother. No questions asked, he gave me a letter to take to the clinic. </p> <p>Step 2. The clinic's waiting room TV provided its own ironic commentary: the titles for a film called Diagnosis Murder were on the screen as I went to my counselling session, while Tom and Barbara were happily living their childless Good Life on my return. A member of staff tactfully changed channels when children's TV started up. </p> <p>Step 3. Return to the clinic. Another building this time, recently redecorated, fresh flowers. More clients arrived. We smiled at each other but no one spoke. A long wait - a luxury to read so much of the paper first thing in the morning. Eventually I was called to change into my nightshirt. (I only own two - I didn't bring the one I wore to give birth to my children). </p> <p>The woman before me had opted for a local anaesthetic. I could hear her cries of pain. I began to ooze tears of self-pity. Embarrassed, I tried to chat. 'It's like the labour ward, hearing the howls of the other women.' Was I trying to advertise my status as a mother? Did I think it would make the nurse see me differently? 'But at least then you have a baby to take home with you,' she replied. </p> <p>At last the oblivion of the anaesthetic. It was only 20 minutes or so later when I joined two young women downstairs at a table. A nursing auxiliary asked if I wanted tea or coffee. We chatted about the weirdness of the experience and the number of lies we'd had to tell just to make our trips to the clinic possible. 'If you think how many women pass through this clinic every day, seven days a week,' said one, 'and yet no one ever talks about it...' </p> <p>I was discharged by a nurse - antibiotics for seven days, no sex or swimming for a fortnight. Then my partner arrived to take me home. </p> <p>And that was it.</p>",
  "Phan Thi Kim Phuc pulled back a corner of the curtain at the bedroom window. It was the only window in her tiny flat from which you could see further than the side wall of the house next door. If she had looked up over the roofs of Chinatown, where she lived, she could have seen Toronto's modern downtown skyline, but she wasn't thinking about the view. She scanned the pavement for anybody watching, then looked down at the uncovered porch below: nobody. But the evidence remained: a crushed drink can and the red-and-white carton of a Kentucky Fried Chicken lunch from the branch at the top of the street. <p>The previous evening, she and her husband, Toan Bui, believing they had entered their apartment unseen by coming up the back stairs, had looked from this window, and noticing the can and carton, realised the two women they had just met on the street had been staking out their flat for some time that day, at least long enough to get hungry. One of them had a camera. Kim had cautioned her husband against opening the front door to put out the rubbish. </p> <p>How did the two women know her address? Why had they been waiting outside all day? </p> <p>The day came to an end, marking the beginning of the weekend, when Kim's solicitor's office would be closed. By Sunday, she was relieved to be able to go to church in Ajax, an hour away from Toronto. Since she and her husband were the only Vietnamese in the congregation, it seemed unlikely her past would ever come up. But after the service, when she and Toan went to collect their 11-month-old son Thomas from the cr\u00e9che, one of the priests told them Kim's picture was in the newspaper. He held up a Toronto tabloid. 'The photograph that shocked the world' said the headline, above a picture of a young girl, naked and running in terror. There was another headline, 'Child of war is a woman living in Toronto' alongside another picture, one of Kim, wearing the coat she'd been wearing all week. </p> <p>Clearly, the two women had got the photograph they'd come looking for. 'Yes,' Kim told the priest, 'I am the girl in the picture.' </p> <p>The newspaper that broke the story - that the subject of one of the most famous images from the Vietnam war now lived in the West - was the Mail on Sunday. The date was 19 March 1995. Toronto's Sunday Sun bought the story and ran it across pages two and three. Accompanying the article were photographs of Kim and Toan pushing their baby in a buggy along a Toronto street, and of Kim's parents in front of their mud hut in Trang Bang, Vietnam. </p> <p>The story was picked up by the international wire services. Within a couple of days, Kim's phone began to ring, and didn't stop. The doorbell rang almost constantly. Kim grew afraid to leave the house. She hardly slept and, exhausted, spent entire days in her dressing grown. </p> <p>This was not the scenario she had contemplated when, a few months earlier, she had decided that, in order to support the family, she would re-emerge from her secret life and sell her story; it would be her 'work'. </p> <p>She had gone for advice to Nancy Pocock, a long-time adviser to Vietnamese refugees in Canada, who knew a prominent Toronto entertainment lawyer. Before making the introduction, Pocock had wanted to make certain that Kim understood something: once she invited publicity, there would be no going back. Kim had accepted this, but a month on she was having second thoughts. She worried that newspapers would get the story and pictures of her without paying a penny. She felt as though she was becoming a victim all over again. She told her husband: 'It's like another bomb falling out of the sky.' </p> <p><b>Trang Bang, 5 June 1972 </b><br> Communist troops have broken through Route 1, the highway running northwest from Saigon and over the border of South Vietnam with Cambodia to Phnom Penh, and are occupying the market place in Trang Bang. Soldiers from the US-backed South Vietnamese army have been called in and a bloody bombardment has begun. The villagers have abandoned their homes and moved into the nearby Codai temple. They think the holy place will be safe from 'the fire which falls from heaven'. </p> <p>On the morning of 8 June 1972 Associated Press photographer Nick Ut and his driver approached Trang Bang on Route 1. Refugees were clogging the road, heading east. Women carried babies, men shouldered poles balancing clothing and pots and pans, children carried babies and led water buffalo on ropes. The old and injured rode on oxcarts. Heavy smoke hung in the air above Trang Bang and planes were circling. The sound of Soviet- and Chinese-produced weapons confirmed the presence of North Vietnamese soldiers. Just outside the town, traffic was stopped behind concertina barbed wire stretched across the road. Ut flashed his pass to the military police, identifying himself as a journalist. He could go no farther than the small elevated bridge. As the morning progressed, more than a dozen foreign newsmen arrived. There were television crews from NBC and ITN and at least three other photographers. Three British journalists, among them William Shawcross for the Sunday Times, arrived by chance: the roadblock had waylaid their plans to take a sight-seeing trip to the Holy See. </p> <p>A senior officer from the South Vietnamese army told the journalists that the objective on this third day of fighting was to drive the Viet Cong into the treeline, and therefore out of town, so the highway could be reopened. The plan was to launch a ground assault with air support. Two or three times that morning, South Vietnamese planes came in on bombing runs. Ground assaults followed: government soldiers, moving in single file, swung in wide arcs through waist-high grass in the fields. Nick got shots of planes coming in. He shot soldiers on their bellies aiming grenade-launchers and firing machine guns, and soldiers rushing out the wounded on stretchers. These were images he had recorded hundreds of times before. </p> <p>The crowd at the roadblock, many of whom had been there three days, was like an audience at an air show. At the sound of an approaching aircraft, they would stand, transfixed, and then gaze at the explosion and fires half a mile away. In between times, a boy peddled ice-cream cones from his bicycle to the line of stalled traffic. Some of the crowd crouched in the shade of their vehicles, snacked on bananas and savoured the sticky, sweet pulp of the last of the star apples of the season. </p> <p>Sometimes, during the lulls, the crowd caught sight of uniformed North Vietnamese soldiers dragging wounded colleagues to safety. It was the first time many had seen 'soldiers from Hanoi'. Reassured by their presence they agreed that it was unthinkable that either the Communists or the government would attack a holy place. </p> <p>Late that morning the clouds had formed a low-lying blanket and the typical afternoon downpour of the wettest summer months began. The photographers and television cameramen covered their equipment with army-issue rain ponchos. The photographers looked about to see if anyone was thinking about calling it a day: the cloud cover would mean a halt in air strikes and, therefore, ground assaults. </p> <p>They compared notes about what 'today's picture' would be: refugees on the road, people fleeing the town. Ut took his lunch of French cheese and baguette from his camera bag. He decided to leave by 2pm, because of the heavy refugee traffic. One o'clock came and went without a break in the cloud cover. Some of his colleagues left, presuming that the Viet Cong would also take advantage of the weather to leave the town. The rain continued. The children inside the temple outbuilding were running around, playing. Perhaps an hour or more after it had begun, the rain stopped. The wind began to clear the clouds. A small observation aircraft circling in the north-eastern sky began an approach. Dipping low above the treeline behind the temple, it fired two phosphorous rockets that spewed white smoke upon impact. Immediately, several government soldiers ran out from a building outside the temple gates onto the temple grounds and popped violet- and mustard-coloured smoke grenades. The colourless smoke fired by the observation plane marked the enemy; the coloured smoke, popped by those on the ground, identified the South Vietnamese forward position. Perhaps 150 yards separated the opposing positions. What happened next was up to the pilots on the bombing missions. An argument broke out among the soldiers inside the outbuilding, apparently about the meaning of the smoke. Suddenly, they turned to the villagers and told them to get out of the temple: it was about to be attacked. </p> <p>Kim Phuc's father Phan Tung assembled his children and their cousins, instructing them all to make for the 'American base'. He sent out the smallest and oldest first, Kim Phuc's grandmother and her aunt Anh, who was carrying her nine-month-old son. Next, he sent out the middle children, including Kim Phuc and two of her brothers. Then, the oldest siblings. Some of the panicking soldiers had already run out with the first of the villagers. Others who remained behind shouted at the stragglers to run fast, or they would die. Phan Tung and Kim's mother Nu were among the last to go with their baby niece. </p> <p>The 30 to 40 soldiers and civilians sketched a ragged line from the outbuilding, past the side and front of the temple, through its main gate and onto Route 1. How they appeared from the air through the lens of a dirty, partly clearing sky is debatable. </p> <p>Nick Ut looked at his watch. It was well after one o'clock. I have one good shot already, he told himself, crouching low as a South Vietnamese Skyraider approached. Then, changing his mind, he scrambled out of the embankment and onto the road. He decided to get a couple more then go home. </p> <p>Quickly, it became apparent that the plane was off course and had crossed into government lines. Instead of aborting his run, the pilot dipped into a dive and dropped two bombs. No explosion came; the bombs were duds. Some moments later, a second Skyraider came in on an approach even more off-target than the first. It dipped in a kind of corkscrew motion, a manoeuvre normally used when under fire.The soldiers and journalists at the bridge flattened themselves to the ground. </p> <p>Ut did not move from the road. He kept his camera lens trained. The plane dipped so low that anyone on the road could plainly see its South Vietnamese identification, red stripes on yellow. There was an unwritten 'rule of engagement' that the Americans had established early in the war: no fire was to be directed at unarmed Vietnamese unless they were running. Anyone running could be assumed to be Viet Cong fleeing attack, and thus fair game. Nick followed the code of conduct when covering combat during a bombing run: stand still, and lift your face towards the pilot. </p> <p>Once the bombs had fallen from the Skyraider, Nick composed his shot: silhouetted figures in uniform on the road in the foreground; the temple against an expanse of sky as the background. He had time. Hard bombs drop heavily, but the lighter napalm canisters tumble end over end, making forward progress as they head towards the ground. </p> <p>The napalm ignited on impact in a fierce explosive splash across the highway and the fields on either side. Flame shot upwards. Shades of saffron, blood, fire and sunset filled the viewfinder. Nick was sorry that he was shooting black-and white instead of colour. </p> <p>Even from a distance of several hundred yards, the blast of heat was immense. Fire rolled out of the treetops. Heavy, dirty black smoke swirled upwards. Gradually, as ash rained down, the scene was repainted in shades of grey. Faint shouts and screams could be heard. </p> <p>The first discernible figures were a half dozen or so women and children and a small black dog. A boy carried a child on his hip; two girls clutched jute sacks. Two stragglers appeared. One woman was ahead of the other, on the left edge of the road; the second woman was on the right, by habit, keeping out of the way of vehicles. She carried a baby, its face and scalp smudged black, facing forwards. Its eyes were open but its body was limp in the woman's arms and with every flat-footed step she took charred skin flapped or fell from the child's limbs. </p> <p>The photographers knew this was the day's picture. They clicked frame after frame until there was no film in their cameras. Already they were thinking of the editing, of finding the frame that separated life from death. The living better convey the horror of war; the dead have no expression. </p> <p>Kim Phuc had fallen a step or two behind her two brothers. Once she had reached the highway, she heard the drone of a low-flying plane, and, curious, turned her head to look. She had never before seen a plane so close. Without breaking her stride, she watched it drop four bombs before it passed from sight. </p> <p>A minute later, Phuc was struck with such force from behind that she fell face first to the ground. At first, she felt unafraid, only curious. She did not realise what was happening until she was enveloped by fire. Then fear took over. Later, she would have no recollection of getting to her feet and pulling at the neck of her burning clothes, nor that what was left of them fell away. Her first memory was of flames licking her left arm, where there was an ugly, brownish-black gob of burnt flesh. She tried to brush it off, only to scream out at the pain of the burn that had now spread to the inside of her other hand. </p> <p>Kim had taken a hit of napalm to her left side, on her upper body. It incinerated her ponytail, burnt her neck, almost all of her back and her left arm. She knew she should keep running, but intense fatigue and weariness overtook her, and she felt desperately thirsty. There were still a few hundred yards to go to safety. </p> <p>Her brother (on her right in Ut's picture) pulled at Phuc to help keep her on her feet. Some photographers, having used the last frames in their cameras on the old lady and the child, had begun to rewind their films and reload. Leicas and Nikons in those days were finicky, and unless rewinding and reloading were done slowly, they could easily jam. Others among the journalists had turned their minds to making haste for Saigon. None thought there was anyone left to walk out of the flames. </p> <p>Then Kim Phuc came running, naked, screaming out of the flames, her arms held limply outwards. Her cry pierced the silence. ' Nong qua, nong qua! ' ['It's too hot, too hot!'] </p> <p>Nick Ut was among those who ran forward. He reached for the last of four cameras he had in his bag. Keeping a loaded camera in reserve was a quirk of his. Christopher Wain, an ITN journalist, put his hand out to bring Kim to a stop. From behind, the extent of her burn was already apparent. Her body radiated heat, and chunks of pink and black flesh were peeling off. Someone put a canteen of water to her lips. Other soldiers began to empty theirs over her still burning flesh. Nick went to get a poncho to cover the girl's nakedness. </p> <p>Realising they would have transport, Phan Tung begged the journalists to take his daughter to hospital. The nearest one was in Cu Chi, on the way to Saigon. </p> <p>Nick Ut, shaking at what he had witnessed, thought about his deadline and about the competition from UPI. He felt torn between trying to do the humane thing and getting back to Saigon as quickly as possible. It was getting dangerously late. There would be refugees on the road to slow the van, time lost stopping at the hospital. And the later it got, he realised, the more he was putting not only his own but the driver's life at risk. Nightfall was the 'hour of the Viet Cong'. </p> <p>The crowd at the bridge dispersed. The last villagers emerging from the strike went up the road, while the soldiers tended to their own wounded and the journalists raced to file their stories. The first army jeeps appeared on the scene to load the military's dead and wounded. The army refused to take civilian casualties. A policeman came by on a jeep, but said he couldn't take villagers to hospital without orders from his superior. </p> <p>Ut and his driver made good time to the hospital. They left Kim Phuc and another napalm victim with a nurse and set off for Saigon. </p> <p>Ut had not stopped sweating since leaving Trang Bang. His dilated pupils saw everything within a halo of red, an after-effect of the napalm. When he arrived at the AP office the only person there was a technician named Jackson. Ut handed over his film and Jackson disappeared into the darkroom. Nick paced to steady his nerves. </p> <p>Bureau chief Horst Faas returned an hour later. By this time his deputy, Carl Robinson, had already edited the day's shots and decided not to develop the negative of Nick Ut's shot of Kim Phuc because of AP's rule against full-frontal nudity. However, as soon as Faas saw the image he knew it was 'the one'. He decided at once to break the rules and submit the shot to AP's New York headquarters. If he had any doubts, they were dispelled by the correspondents who dropped in during the evening as usual to see what pictures AP was transmitting. Life photographer David Burnett, who had been at Trang Bang, saw the shot of the girl and said: 'Sure beats the shit out of anything I got.' </p> <p>That evening Faas waited around longer than usual. He had been prepared to raise hell if the desk in New York had killed the picture. He didn't have to. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an extract from Denise Chong's The Girl in the Picture.

Nick Ut's photograph of Kim Phuc had an extraordinary impact around the world. While it certainly influenced attitudes to the Vietnam War, the image also rose above the detail of place and time because it showed with terrible economy how war kills and damages children. The psychological history of the war seems inconceivable without it. </p> <p>Along with half a dozen other photographs, it helped to shape the popular feelings which in turn influenced policy. Kim Phuc's moment of terror deepened the scepticism with which, by mid-1972, the war was being viewed. The fact that the napalm strike was a case of friendly fire, the result of a mistake by the South Vietnamese, reinforced that message. </p> <p>Two of Kim Phuc's six brothers, one three years old, the other nine months, were killed in the attack on Trang Bang. She spent months in hospital afterwards, in pain all the time. Her sister fainted at the sight of her. Eventually, she was able to return to her family and to school. Her body was brutally scarred, she suffered constant headaches, and extremes of heat and cold caused her severe pain. But her face and hands were clear of burns and she might have slipped back into anonymity, were it not for a German journalist from Stern magazine who remembered the photograph and tracked her down. After that Hanoi recognised her propaganda value. She was called out of school and college so often to be interviewed by foreign journalists and to give talks against the evils of capitalism, often involving weeks of travel, that she couldn't complete her studies. She had hoped to become a doctor. </p> <p>In 1986, Kim Phuc was sent to Cuba to study and embark on 'goodwill missions' for the Communist cause. For six years, she attended the University of Havana, now studying English, where she fell in love with and married another Vietnamese student, Bui Huy Toan. During this time, she quietly planned her defection. </p> <p>In October 1992, Kim Phuc and her husband managed to buy plane tickets to Gander, in North-east Canada, where they pleaded for asylum. The couple moved to Toronto where they spent the next three years in hiding. </p> <p>Since her 'discovery' by the press, Kim Phuc, who has a six-year-old son called Thomas, has met and publicly forgiven John Plummer, the US pilot who dropped the napalm bomb on Trang Bang, and has rekindled her friendship with Nick Ut, who became a family friend after he saved her life. She has also become a goodwill ambassador for Unesco and founded the Chicago-based Kim Foundation to help child victims of war. </p> <p><b>Napalm: the chemical killer</b></p> <p>Napalm, first used during the Second World War, is a lethal weapon when dropped from the air. The bomb explodes and fragments, and the burning jellied napalm (the name comes from its combination of naphthenic and palmitic acids) sticks to whatever it lands on. It burns at 800 to 1,200\u00baC (by comparison, water boils at l00\u00baC) - and for a long time. A big enough mass of burning napalm will consume skin, hair follicles, sweat glands and sensory nerve endings. This is a third-degree burn, and appears red and oozing. If the napalm continues to burn down, feeding on fat, muscle and other deep tissue, the injury becomes fourth- or fifth-degree charring. </p> <p>Napalm wounds were as common in Vietnam as bayonet wounds had been in the First World War. Doctors did not expect to be asked to treat napalm burn victims as they were more likely to die than need medical aid. Victims taking a direct hit suffered burns to at least 25 per cent of their bodies. One-third of them died within a half-hour of burns or of asphyxiation. Many spread the napalm themselves by trying to remove it from their skin or clothes, or in stripping off burnt clothes. </p> <p>Kim Phuc sustained third-degree burns or worse to 30-35 per cent of her body surface. Those areas included almost her entire back, the left side of her chest, the back of her neck into her hairline, and her entire left arm. She also had lesser burns from napalm that splashed from her clothes on to her right arm, buttocks and stomach, and she had singeing to her left cheek and both ears. Life or death for victims of such major burns depends on making it to a specialist burns unit within 24 hours, 72 at the most.</p>",
  "<p>The TI Group, one of the best-known names in British engineering, has been talking to the US aerospace firm BF Goodrich about a \u00a32.5 billion merger. </p> <p>The American firm approached the UK group after a review carried out by TI chairman Sir Christopher Lewington in response to its languishing share price. During the process, which began in May, TI is also understood to have held talks with British engineering rival BBA. </p> <p>Goodrich is still best-known for its high-performance tyres, a business sold to Michelin in the late Eighties. Nowadays, with annual sales of \u00a34bn, it is a leading manufacturer of aircraft components, polymers, industrial seals, compressors and diesel and gas engines. </p> <p>TI, with sales of nearly \u00a33bn, is a world leader in motor components, aircraft engine parts and industrial sealing systems. </p> <p>Sources close to the group said the talks, involving Lewington, started during the summer. Working parties from both firms have explored the commercial aspects of a merger. A price of between 450p and 500p for each TI share has been discussed, sources say, valuing TI at up to \u00a32.5bn - a premium of over 30 per cent to the group's current 343p price. </p> <p>TI declined to comment on the talks. 'You would expect us to have conversations with companies all the time,' a TI spokesman said. 'There are a number of discussions we have had with companies in our peer group.' Goodrich could not be contacted. </p> <p>TI insiders, however, confirmed that an approach had been made by the US firm, which is ambitious for further growth. 'There are obviously synergies with Goodrich,' one TI source said, 'but the problems we have had in all talks is that we operate in three markets: aerospace, industrial and automotive. Very few other firms span the whole range of our activities.' </p> <p>At TI's interim results last month, Lewington said he was considering all options, including taking the firm private, in response to the group's share price slump. Like many engineers, TI has seen its shares nearly halve over the last year. </p> <p>However, Lewington is known to be cautious, and eager not to repeat the disastrous type of merger that rival Lucas struck with Varity of the US. That led to US control by the back door. </p> <p>US buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts holds a 4.7 per cent stake in TI. Following a series of deals, however, TI now has \u00a31bn of debt, and analysts believe a buyout would be difficult. </p> <p>To fund future growth TI is also expected to have to sell one of its four divisions. A merger with Goodrich could lead to spin-offs, possibly including motor components, which would be highly attractive to international rivals. </p> <p>Under Lewington, TI has transformed itself over the last 15 years, shedding businesses such as Raleigh cycles, Russell Hobbs and Creda. </p> <p>Goodrich, based in North Carolina, has been through a similar shake-up under chairman David Burner and, like TI, has been acquisitive. Last year it bought US rival Coltech for \u00a31.5bn.</p>",
  "<p>Listen: I don't care if they're French or Dutch or Taiwanese. If they're good, and they want to play for Arsenal (hello, Nicolas!), they're welcome. A recent newspaper columnist suspected that the average football fan was unable to 'relate to' the average foreign import, but ask anyone at Highbury whether they could 'relate to' Jimmy Carter, Steve Morrow, David Hillier, Vince Bartram, Eddie McGoldrick, Ian Selley, Andy Linighan, Colin Pates, John Hartson and Chris Kiwomya I personally couldn't relate to any of them, but a relationship was foisted on me anyway, through George Graham's side of the family, and they embarrassed me frequently, at weddings, parties and home games.</p> <p>Now, Tony Adams Everyone in the Clock End relates to him. But why? Is it because he comes from Essex? Is it because he used to drink himself stupid? Is it because he was sent to prison? Is it because he stopped drinking and started going to the theatre? Is it because he cares enough about his fellow professionals to want to set up a clinic for those who, like him, have addiction problems? Did you relate to him more then, or now? (After all, and contrary to the message of the popular song, there have been two Tony Adamses.) Or is it because he's been fantastic for a decade-and-a-half now? The answer is obvious, and it's got very little to do with his nationality - Patrick Vieira enjoys exactly the same relationship with the Arsenal fans - and everything to do with his character. Or characters</p> <p>The recent TV documentary about David Elleray, Martin Edwards's favourite referee, was terrifying in all sorts of ways. (Have you ever met a kid who collected newspaper cuttings about refs, as the boy Elleray did? And did he really say that being a housemaster at Harrow was 'the best job in the world'?) But the moment in the programme that would have chilled Tony Adams came when Elleray was wired for sound, back at the end of the Eighties, an ill-advised experiment that was never repeated. </p> <p>It was Elleray's misfortune to be officiating a match involving Millwall and George Graham's Arsenal, a group of players who liked to spend 90 minutes buzzing angrily round the referee like red and white wasps. (If the 10-yard dissent rule had existed back then, there would have been quite a few free-kicks floated back into the Arsenal penalty-area from the top of Muswell Hill.) And it was Elleray's double misfortune to wave play on after the ball had clearly crossed Millwall's goal line, thus denying Arsenal an equaliser. The resulting furore made the back pages of the newspapers, and it was Tony Adams's words - he called Elleray a 'cheat' - that were heard the clearest.</p> <p>It's the face, though, rather than the words, that strike you now. It was a face that was consumed by football, and, specifically at that moment, by football's injustices - the mouth is a round 'o' of incomprehension, the brows are furrowed with anxiety. There's not, in truth, much going on there, beyond the desire to win a cup-tie at the Den.</p> <p>Look at the 21st century Adams, on or off the pitch, and you can see a man with a life outside the game. This alarms some fans, and it is easy to see why: you don't pay good money to see a centre-back's complicated interior life. You pay to watch him head a corner away - an action which, if done repeatedly over many years, would seem to actively prevent a complicated interior life. In other words: if a man has discovered the joys of music and literature and sobriety, can he still be bothered to fling himself at Duncan Ferguson?</p> <p>When I ask Adams about the game at Millwall, the first two sentences of his answer reflect what must go on in him all the time. 'I was very, very emotional, wasn't I?' he says immediately. This is the Adams we have become accustomed to over the past four years - calm, rational, slightly baffled and repelled by his previous excesses. And then he laughs. 'But it did fucking cross the line, didn't it?'</p> <p>The fan in me breathes a sigh of relief. He hasn't forgotten that, in the appropriate circumstances, these things matter. He restates the terms of the conflict. 'I've got a great photo at home of me at Selhurst Park. It's in three stages, and I'm going mad at the referee, and my face I look at it and think, \"Jesus Christ, I don't know that person. What is going on in his life?\" It's quite frightening. I keep it in case I'm ever tempted to change my ways.' </p> <p>But he is at pains to point out that what he is reacting to in the photo is a penalty that has been given against him for 'a great tackle in our box, clean as a whistle. I've got that pride, and it had been punctured'. I remind him that he had been unhappy with the penalty awarded to Barcelona in the Champions League game at Wembley last season, and he smiles. 'Yes, and I think I expressed myself quite powerfully. I mean, I'm not going to say, \"Yes, referee, that was a penalty, you are correct.\" But, you know, I didn't get booked for dissent.'</p> <p>So it's all about balance, in a profession where balance is notoriously difficult - and maybe even beside the point. It is fair to say that balance is not a quality one associated with the old Tony Adams, in a physical or emotional sense. He lost his temper, he drank too much, he fell down stairs, he dropped fellow professionals on to the Wembley turf from a great height If it is part of a defender's job to learn to stay on his feet, then it is a wisdom that has, through a variety of circumstances, been harder for Adams to acquire than for most people. This, of course, is what makes him such an impressive and entirely admirable figure now: nothing has come easy for him.</p> <p>I had a theory that the spangly new Premiership, with its cerebral French managers and its pony-tails and its dietary regimes, is a more comfortable environment for the new Adams than the old First Division would have been. It is difficult to imagine that the team Adams broke into (which contained Charlie Nicholas, Kenny Sansom and several other players who were not, it is probably fair to say, teetotal bibliophiles) would have been terribly sympathetic to the character that has emerged since his treatment for alcohol addiction four years ago. And it is equally difficult to imagine that Manu Petit or Thierry Henry would be very challenged by the idea that going to the theatre is as pleasant a way of spending an evening as drinking gallons of Guinness and tumbling down nightclub stairs. </p> <p>When I attempt to put this to Adams, though, he is mildly - and, I suspect, artfully - resistant to the idea that there is a new Premiership culture. 'I think players are players, and I know some players, French, Spanish, whatever, who can put loads and loads of bottles of wine down their necks.'</p> <p>He is also at pains to point out that players thought about their refuelling strategies long before the arrival of M Wenger. 'Back in '86, '87, Steve Williams and Paul Davis and me were reading a book by Robert Hess called Eat to Win, and, you know, that's what we were doing, chewing for victory' </p> <p>But after you'd read the book you went down to the pub and drank 10 pints? </p> <p>'Exactly, it was going out of the window.' As if this were only a minor obstruction to the mid-Eighties dietary revolution. But what about the, you know, the books and plays and stuff? Isn't it easier to talk about that at work? He shrugs. 'I recommended the play Art to Lee Dixon and his wife, and we had a good chat about that afterwards.' Lee Dixon? Lee Dixon? Proof, if any were needed, that there is little correlation between an ability to cross the ball and an appreciation of contemporary theatre.</p> <p>But Adams does accept that his new lifestyle and interests raise the odd eyebrow. I tell him a story I'd heard about a friend of a friend, an Arsenal supporter and actor who was appearing in a play about Freud at the Bush Theatre. When he stepped out onto the stage and saw the Arsenal captain sitting in the front row he almost lost it. 'Yeah, people do seem to have a problem with it. I was at the opera last week and this old lady She nearly rugby-tackled me. \"I didn't expect to see you here! What are you doing here!\"'</p> <p>Adams seems anxious to dispel the notion that only in the past three or four years - since the arrival of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and sobriety - has he reached his full potential as a player. I remember an article by Simon Barnes in the Times, shortly after Arsenal had won the Championship in 1998, in which Barnes had wondered whether Adams was revelling in the football that Wenger allowed and encouraged him to play, or whether the player simply regretted that so much of his career had been spent serving George Graham's particular brand of pragmatism. </p> <p>But actually Adams talks with some relish about the old Arsenal - partly, it seems, because the inadequacies of Graham's team in its later years gave him the opportunity to do what he does best - defend. 'What about the Cup-Winners Cup final in '94? Jesus Christ, we went there with a nothing team, you know? If you compare the squad we have now with the squad we had then And Paris St Germain here, in the semi-final.' He nods towards the window of his Highbury box above the Clock End. 'Weah, Ginola, they didn't get a kick.' (That might not be how they remember the evening, incidentally - especially Ginola, who I recall got several kicks.)</p> <p>He feels that the Championship-winning team of '91 was every bit as good as the '98 team, and regrets that it didn't go on to do more - a failure that he admits was in part due to 'the way we were living outside the game'. And he sets the against-all-odds triumph of the '94 side against the bitterly disappointing Uefa Cup final defeat of last season, when an Arsenal team containing Henry, Kanu, Bergkamp, Petit, Overmars and Vieira (as opposed to Morrow, Selley, Jensen, Smith, Campbell et al) scarcely created a chance.</p> <p>'I said to Ars\u00e8ne before the game, \"I'm very worried.\" Because there were a few people who weren't at the races because of the Double - a few cracks had started to appear, and it's all about who wants it more, isn't it? But hopefully we've got rid of those people now.' </p> <p>And he laughs knowingly. For those who don't have an intimate knowledge of Arsenal's recent history, Marc Overmars of Holland and Emmanuel Petit of France were transferred to Barcelona over the summer; one suspects that it may well be these two who were not race-goers.</p> <p>I have good memories of '94, too - and of the same games. But there weren't very many of them, and it's hard to recall a decent league game at Highbury in Graham's last three seasons. (Carter, Hillier, Kiwom No. I can't go through that list again.) The most consistent pleasure any Arsenal side has given me came in that '97/98 season, and before I met Adams I had a vague dread that he would elevate the pre-Wenger years into a mythical time of solid achievement, and denigrate the current squad, write them off as talented but uncommitted foreigners. (I remember Adams once saying that he enjoyed the England get-togethers partly because 'everyone speaks English'.) </p> <p>But it's clear too that he adores his current manager, and that his recollection of the Graham years is not pure nostalgia. (He refers sadly at one stage in our conversation to playing 'with a lot of fear'.) 'Ars\u00e8ne's a gift, he really is a gift. He's got his faults, like all of us, but he's a pure joy to work for. I play for him now, and if I didn't have him I wouldn't be at Arsenal.' </p> <p>The very idea of Adams being anywhere else is alarming. How close did he come to leaving? 'I don't think during my drinking days I had the ability to move away. I think I was stuck. There was so much going on outside, and I was so fearful of the manager that I wouldn't dare rock the boat. But around the time I sobered up, and I got a bit of courage and self-worth I did have the ability to move on then if I needed to, but just at the right time, Ars\u00e8ne was sent'</p> <p>He talks about Wenger's obsessive devotion to the game with affectionate bemusement : 'When we were on pre-season training in Germany, he set his alarm for three in the morning so he could watch the Brazil World Cup qualifier live. Wouldn't watch it on video. And then he says at breakfast, [Adams does one of the worst cod-French accents I have ever heard, incidentally] \"Oh, Tonee, I am very tired zis morning.'''</p> <p>And, interestingly, given his earlier approving comments about the removal of the rogue elements within the camp over the summer, he pays an elaborate and intriguing compliment to the talents and character of Emmanuel Petit.</p> <p>'He's a very, very insecure boy, I think, deep down. I think he's misunderstood, very misunderstood. I think his ability is phenomenal. Defensively he was fantastic, he knew how to play, he had a good football brain, he could pass the ball I'm going to miss him. I wanted him to play for Arsenal and I think it's unfortunate he's not playing now.'</p> <p> But does Adams think he'll miss us? 'Sure. Yeah. I think he enjoyed playing here, I think he liked the atmosphere, he loved London, and he loved his team-mates. Whether the team-mates actually loved him' And Tony laughs enigmatically. Curiouser and curiouser.</p> <p>Like most people in the English game, he has his worries about the foreign invasion, but his argument makes more sense, and is more pragmatic, than anything I have heard from Kevin Keegan or Alan Hansen. 'My little boy, if he wants a career in football, I'm going to have to say to him, \"Maybe it might be better to go and play football in France. Go and learn your trade at Nantes or one of these clubs, 'cos you'll be playing first-team football and then you'll probably get a decent move to an English club.\" The kids coming through at the moment are finding it very difficult because of the amount of foreigners and because of the quality of the League.' </p> <p>This second reason is the main cause of the problem, of course: fans of big Premiership clubs want a strong England team, but their immediate concern is Liverpool away next Saturday, and most of them would rather see Batistuta up front than an 18-year-old who may or may not make it. 'Sure. I think that the foreigners are great from a supporter's point of view. I'm talking from an England point of view here, that's all I'm talking about. I think we could go backwards if we're not careful.'</p> <p>It's all coming to an end, now, the Adams era, although the vigour with which he has started the new season suggests that the last game may be a little further away than we thought. He's certainly more upbeat about the new season than the many Arsenal fans who were worried about the lack of transfer activity in the summer. 'I'm very confident and optimistic about this squad. We could do with a couple of new players, maybe. A forward, perhaps a centre-back, but I think the manager knows that. But the atmosphere's wonderful, and the squad as it is at the moment, between you and me, is very resilient and tough, and I think we're going to do all right.'</p> <p>I tell him that half the Arsenal crowd expect him to be the next manager, and he nearly chokes on his biscuit. ('I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do anything, so I'm going to have a custard cream when I want and bugger you.' This, clearly, is what passes for ill-discipline in the puritan Wenger regime.)</p> <p>'You know, I struggle with the boss at times on this one. I have to remember that I'm still a player and the club captain and that's it, and I have to let him pick the team from time to time But the only way I'd stay in the game is as manager of a football club. I'm a bit of a control freak, so I wouldn't want to do any other job.' In other words, it's looking likely, then - but not yet.</p> <p>'I spoke to Platty and he was talking about Vialli, how he really regrets not taking some time out, and I think he might do it at the end of the year. I think this might be his last season, because if he's unsuccessful they'll get rid of him anyway. So I think I'd like some time off before I thought about it. I'm not saying I'll be a better manager when I'm 55, but by the time I've wrapped up here it'll be 22 years, and that involves a lot of sacrifices, a lot of things I haven't done....I can't go skiing in the winter like a lot of people can. I'd like a proper Christmas Day with the kids. Play some party games, watch an old black-and-white film That all sounds wonderful. And don't get me wrong, it's been wonderful, and the pay-offs have been unbelievable, worth the sacrifice. But it has been a sacrifice....'</p> <p>I think that he, of all footballers, knows how much it has been appreciated.</p>"
