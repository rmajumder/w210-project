  "Government attempts to crack down on the drugs trade by seizing the assets of convicted dealers were dealt a severe blow yesterday when a Scottish court ruled confiscation orders were in breach of human rights law. <p>A panel of three judges at the court of appeal in Edinburgh ruled that the orders contravened the European convention on human rights as they required convicted criminals to prove they had made their money lawfully. </p> <p>The three judges said that this took away the presumption of innocence, but a spokesman for the crown office said it was considering an appeal. </p> <p>The ruling was made after lawyers acting for Robert McIntosh, a convicted drug trafficker, challenged a confiscation order which was made under the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act. </p> <p>McIntosh, 38, from Greenock, was jailed for four years at the high court in Paisley in June 1999 after pleading guilty to supplying heroin. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Scottish executive said it would continue its drive to confiscate profits made on the back of illegal activity, and in the light of yesterday's ruling, would look at ways of amending current legislation.</p>",
  "The Israeli left thought they had hit rock bottom five years ago. On that late evening in November 1995 when their leader and hero, Yitzhak Rabin, was gunned down by a fellow Jew, they saw their world fall apart. Not only was the Israeli nation eating itself, it was also destroying the country's best chance for peace. Rabin had signed the Oslo accords with the Palestinians two years earlier - a feat only a man with his trusted military credentials could have pulled off. With him gone, the road to peace would be blocked. <p>Now the Israeli left has realised that November 1995 was not the all-time low; things can get even worse. As one liberal Tel Aviv commentator put it yesterday, the mood is \"a gloomy blend of depression, anxiety and despair\". </p> <p>The immediate source of heartache is grief for what has been a fortnight of blood. They have seen their own people killed, along with a hundred Palestinians, including children. They hate what Israel is doing to its neighbours and they hate what this war is doing to them: making them the brutal occupier once more. </p> <p>But the pain goes deeper than mourning. The Israeli left is depressed to see years of progress reversed. They are shaking their heads in disbelief that Rabin's heir as the soldier-turned-peacemaker, Ehud Barak, has invited Ariel Sharon into his cabinet. Sharon is not only the man who ignited the current inferno - taking a stroll in the most contested piece of real estate in the world - he is also remembered by Palestinians and Israelis alike as the villain of the 1982 Lebanon war. That conflict was a defining moment for the Israeli peace movement, not least the Lebanese massacres of Palestinian refugees at Sabra and Shatila which took place under Sharon's nose. After that, Israel's own Kahan commission of inquiry branded Sharon unfit to serve as defence minister. Yet now he is back. </p> <p>The left is depressed to see its own leaders looking like strangers. In a CNN interview on Thursday, Barak's face was a taut, glaring study of fury. \"Bullshit!\" he bellowed to one question, all diplomatic niceties dropped. That same night the Nobel laureate, Rabin's partner Shimon Peres, appeared before a Jewish audience in London seeking to build support for Israel. Usually Peres is criticised as a naive idealist, dreaming of a Middle East living in hi-tech, e-commerce harmony. But here he was back on a 1970s agenda, arguing that the Jewish claim on Jerusalem was twice as old as the Muslim one and that the Palestinians should be grateful: Israel would give them a state when none of the Arab nations had ever done the same. Even the dreamer Peres has started talking like a Likudnik. </p> <p>But the root of the left's dismay lies with the Palestinians. For three decades, Israel's peaceniks have told their fellow citizens that one day they will have to make a painful compromise and share the land with their neighbours, the Palestinians. For years they were lambasted as traitors, for daring to propose the handover of territory. But slowly, with the election of Rabin and then Barak, they began to win the argument. This year, for the first time in Israel's 52-year history, a majority had come round to the notion of an independent Palestinian state. At Camp David in July, Barak went even further, proposing the partial handover of East Jerusalem and even agreeing to place the ultra-contentious holy sites outside Jewish control. By common consent, this package was the most generous Israel had ever offered: the chances of Barak getting it past Israeli public opinion were slim. </p> <p>Yet even this, the Israeli left now realises, was not enough. Yasser Arafat did not accept it. Instead, say Israel's peaceniks, he returned to a war footing, encouraging this new intifada. For the peace camp this has been a humiliation. The Israeli right had always regarded dealing with Arafat the way Ian Paisley regards talking to Sinn Fein: \"Negotiations are doomed; as soon as things don't go their way, they'll start fighting again.\" The left had insisted that, no, Arafat was sincere; he had chosen the path of talks and compromise. Even if the Palestinians don't get their way immediately, said the left, they'll carry on talking. Now the right looks vindicated and the left looks naive. </p> <p>That's why the Israeli left feels so betrayed by the Palestinians: Barak offered them a fair deal and they have thrown it back in his face. Now the Palestinians will get a rightwing, Likud regime who will give them nothing. </p> <p>To the Palestinians, of course, it all looks very different. Given their starting point - that Israel was the historic interloper - none of these \"handovers\" looks much like concessions. After all, Israel should never have been there in the first place. Far from being grateful to receive the West Bank and Gaza, Arafat sees these as merely partial restoration of what should be rightfully his. He is a man who's been mugged and is suddenly meant to be grateful when the mugger offers him 70p for the bus fare home. None of the little enclaves Israel was prepared to concede amounts to a viable state and nor was there any point staying at the table: the Americans were in charge and they are on Israel's side. </p> <p> Given that vast gulf or perception, what hope can there be for reconciliation? The dreamers hope Arafat will wake up to reality, realise that Barak is his best hope and agree at least to discuss the Camp David deal. Then Barak will persuade his nation to forget the past two weeks, give him another shot and trust the Palestinians once more. He will then hand over lots of land and spend billions to redress five decades of apartheid-style discrimination endured by the one million Palestinian citizens within Israel's borders. </p> <p>So much for the dream. The better course for optimists may be pessimism. They should assume that Barak is finished and that he will be ejected as soon as elections are called. Sharon or even Binyamin Netanyahu will then take over, elected on a promise of no surrender. But reality will soon impinge, even on them. It will take longer and they will do it through gritted teeth, but a Likud government will eventually have to make a deal with the Palestinians - probably the very same package on offer at Camp David in July. </p> <p>There is a precedent. After all, it was not a Labour PM who returned Sinai to Egypt, but the Likud's Menachem Begin. It was Nixon who went to China. So perhaps it will take Ariel Sharon to share Jerusalem with the Palestinians - and to confront and even evict those Jewish settlers from the lands that will finally have to be handed over. </p> <p>That is a pessimistic sort of optimism, the hope that a peace available three months ago will materialise three, five or 10 years from now. But it may be the best hope the peace camp, Israeli and Palestinian, have got. These two peoples have no choice but to share the land they both love. Whether they do that now or later, with Arafat and Barak or a new generation of leaders, is up to them. But they will do it - for it is the choice of life over death. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\"> jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "An international diplomatic effort was under way yesterday to impose a truce on two peoples who are hunkering down for war, a day after Israel rocketed Palestinian installations, in effect destroying the peace process. <p>After sporadic clashes in the West Bank that left at least one Palestinian dead and dozens injured, Washington and the United Nations were last night engaged in hectic attempts to arrange an international summit in Egypt to prevent the outbreak of a full-scale war. </p> <p>\"I do think there could be a summit,\" Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, said. He had hurriedly returned to Israel after Thursday's cataclysmic events, which saw combat helicopters rocket the perimeters of Yasser Arafat's Gaza headquarters following the brutal killings of two Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>In addition to Mr Arafat and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, the summit would include representatives from Egypt, Jordan, the US and the UN, Palestinian officials said. The White House last night dropped its insistence that both sides had to renounce violence before a summit could be held. \"We are not setting any conditions to a meeting,\" the White House spokesman Jake Siewert told reporters. </p> <p>However, with Mr Barak and Mr Arafat refusing to speak directly, the convening of a summit remained far from certain. Mr Arafat has demanded that Israel lift the siege on the West Bank, where soldiers now man checkpoints blocking the exit of all Palestinian cars. The Gaza Strip has also been sealed off. </p> <p>There was no end to the violent convulsions that have gripped the region for more than a fortnight after Islamist organisations declared a day of rage. In the West Bank town of Hebron one man was shot in the chest by Israeli gunfire after he ran towards the soldiers chanting slogans in support of the Islamist Hamas movement. </p> <p>In Ramallah, the scene of Thursday's brutal lynching of the Israeli soldiers, crews of three Israeli tanks trained machine-gun fire on the hilltop hideout of a Palestinian sniper. Ambulance workers said at least three people were injured in another gun battle, including one man who had his kneecap blown off. </p> <p>There were also clashes in Bethlehem, outside a heavily guarded Jewish pilgrimmage site, and a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Jerusalem, where crowds blocked local roads with rocks and metal spikes. </p> <p>By the standards of recent days, which have seen nearly 100 people killed, almost all Palestinians, yesterday's clashes were of relatively low intensity. Israel carried out an additional rocket attack in Jericho late on Thursday night, destroying a building of the Palestinian police academy, but yesterday its use of tanks and rockets was more restrained. </p> <p>But with the conflict crossing a new threshold on Thursday, with Israel's use of firepower and with the Palestinian descent into mob rule, there was little room for optimism. Israeli military officials say they expect a round of sui cide bombing attacks following Mr Arafat's release of several hundred jailed Islamist militants, including the masterminds of previous outrages. </p> <p>There is an atmosphere of mourning - and fear - following yesterday's funeral for one of the killed soldiers. Israeli newspapers reported a grisly cellphone conversation between the wife of one of the soldiers and his killers, deepening a sense of revulsion. </p> <p>Fears that the conflict in Israel would spark a wave of terrorism across the Middle East and beyond were heightened yesterday morning when a bomb was thrown over the wall of the British embassy in Yemen. Windows were smashed but no one was hurt. </p> <p>The embassy bomb came less than a day after the suicide attack on the American destroyer USS Cole moored in Aden. Seven bodies of American sailors have been recovered, while 10 are still missing presumed dead. </p> <p>Protesters in several Arab cities, as well as in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan, called for a jihad (holy war) against Israel. The ruling Taliban in Afghanistan also demanded immediate retaliation.Thousands of Indonesians protested in Jakarta, and Morocco recalled its envoy from Israel in protest. </p> <p>In Cairo, Sunni Islam's top authority, the sheikh of al-Azhar mosque, Mohammed Sayyid Tantawy, urged Muslims to cut all ties with Israel. </p> <p>Arab nations moved swiftly to provide aid to the Palestinians, sending five planeloads of medical supplies to Gaza via Egypt.</p>",
  "It may be war, but Raeda Ghazaleh, unusually amongst Palestinians, is still going to work each morning. A theatre director, she has been performing a play for schoolchildren in her home town of Bethlehem. The play is The Little Match Girl; the sad and dreamy match seller imagines a world where she can go to school, eat good food, find somewhere safe to live. <p>The parallels are painfully close. The schoolchildren in Bethlehem - some of only a handful whose schools are still open - are in shock, says Ghazaleh. They know that more than 100 Palestinians, many of them children, have been killed; all they talk of is blood and shooting, they jump at loud noises. A four-year-old came to school yesterday wearing five T-shirts, one layered on top of the other, because he thought it would protect him from the bullets. </p> <p>Of course there is fear amongst Palestinians; and of course there is anger. Every reporter this week has commented on the extent of the rage of those throwing stones in Gaza and Ramallah and Galilee; but why did it take the world by surprise? Palestinians on the ground - as opposed to those involved in peace talks - have been saying for years that they are disillusioned with this peace process, and for tangible reasons of poverty and exclusion, rather than simply politics. If the world had listened to the warnings, it might have been able to tackle the causes of the uprising before it was too late. </p> <p>A report by church charity World Vision stated it baldly back in May 1999: \"an increasing sense of disillusionment with the peace process by Palestinians may well ignite future violence\". The figures are startling: Palestinian GNP has fallen by 35% since the start of the Oslo peace process in 1993; unemployment has reached record levels, up to 40% in some areas; the average income is $1,500 per head in the West Bank and Gaza, compared with $2,500 in 1987, and with $17,000 in Israel. The closure policy, whereby cities are cut off from each other, has had disastrous economic and social consequences - disrupting trade, but also feeding a mounting sense of injustice. As a tourist with a British passport you are free to travel wherever you like in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel; but a Muslim Palestinian from Ramallah may not visit Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, 10 miles away; and a Christian Palestinian from Bethlehem may not visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site of Christ's crucifixion, a distance of seven miles. </p> <p>About 18 months ago, I visited the Amari refugee camp between Jerusalem and Ramallah. The makeshift homes are poor and far too small for the large families who live in them, but inside they are neat, with wall-hangings of Mecca and mosque-shaped clocks. A Palestinian woman there, while bringing me tea, apologised for the fact that her children had dirty faces and clothes; it was because the camp received water only twice a week, she said. I looked up the hill to see a gleaming settlement, Bet-El, illegally built on Palestinian land outside of Israel, the grass on its lawns green and lush, watered with sprinklers. </p> <p>No wonder there is rage. Ordinary Palestinians always felt that the peace process was weighted against them - a fact apparently reflected by an anonymous Israeli government source quoted this week in the Independent: \"The Palestinians always complain that we know the details of every proposal from the Americans before they do,\" he said. \"There's a good reason for that; we write them.\" </p> <p>The Palestinians have always known that they are the racial underclass, but the overwhelmingly unequal nature of the conflict is so often left out of the peace equation. This is not a Balkan-style confrontation of two ancient hatreds. It was European Christians, not Muslims or Arabs, who led the persecution and ghettoisation of the Jewish people for most of the past 2,000 years. This is a modern conflict over land between an occupier and a subject people, the occupation long accepted as illegal by the United Nations; between a state with all the cards (a hugely powerful army, the support of the world's only superpower, control of electricity, water, most of the land) and a population with none. It is not a war between equals, and it is overwhelmingly Palestinians who are being killed. </p> <p> An end to conflict must be the priority. But peace does not happen just because we want it to - if the Palestinian population does not believe it has received justice, it's clear that there will not be peace. Ehud Barak, the prime minister of Israel, may have gone as far as he could at Camp David, and his public may not allow him to go further in the current circumstances. But in its own interests, Israel will have to do so, sooner or later. The \"East Jerusalem\" earmarked for the Palestinians at Camp David did not include the Arab part of the Old City, the bustling Damascus Gate, the shop-lined Salah al-Din Street or the Mount of Olives - all of which are currently Arab sections of the city. The \"East Jerusalem\" on offer at Camp David in fact effectively constituted the suburb of Abu Dis and the village of Bethany - like asking for Trafalgar Square and being required to settle for Croydon. No Palestinian leader could accept it and survive. </p> <p>There is a solution, probably still some way off, although the peace process went some way towards it. Yesterday I asked a Palestinian in Ramallah how this will end. \"The only end would be the end of the occupation,\" he said, his phone conversation broken up by the sound of shooting. If Palestine becomes a state, if Israel withdraws from all of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, if the UN provides protection for and access to the religious sites, and if the issue of the right to return for refugees is addressed, then the Palestinian community seems likely to accept the loss of pre-1967 Israel and a permanent peace has a chance. </p> <p>Next week, if the Bethlehem schools are still open, Raeda Ghazaleh's theatre company will be performing another play; about a boy's search for his grandfather, and how this helps him understand himself. Like him, we must understand the history of the Palestinian people and the reality of their conflict with Israel if we are to understand their situation now, and if we have any hope of finding a solution. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:katharine.viner@theguardian.com\">katharine.viner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The greatest tragedy underlying the bloodshed of the past fortnight is that it appeared avoidable. Negotiators in all camps, Israeli, Palestinian and US, agree that an agreement had seemed possible. <p>At the Camp David peace talks in July, agreements in principle had been reached on some of the fundamental issues. A Palestinian state would come into being, comprising more than 90% of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Jewish settlers would be consolidated and concentrated in the remaining fortified enclaves. The new Palestine would gradually take over its borders with the outside world. </p> <p>In return, the vast Palestinian diaspora, representing a quarter of the world's refugees, would give up their dreams of going home, and would be paid off with money contributed by the international community. A token few could go back to be reunited with their families in Israel. </p> <p>But then there was Jerusalem. It was never going to be easy to find a solution in a fortnight at a country retreat in Maryland. Yet the negotiators seem to have come surprisingly close. </p> <p>The Palestinians wanted to establish the capital of their new state there, a matter of supreme importance to the entire Muslim world, which was urging Yasser Arafat to remain steadfast. Yet some of the proposals floated in the last desperate hours of the talks on July 25 came surprisingly close to the Palestinian position. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's apparent failure to respond with any enthusiasm baffled and enraged the Israelis and the US. </p> <p>Why did the Palestinian leader refuse to compromise? He is an inscrutable figure, but those who claim insight into his thinking say he is obsessed with how he will be remembered in history. He is terrified of going down in the annals as a traitor to the Arab cause like Anwar Sadat, who signed the last Camp David treaty, between Israel and Egypt in 1978. </p> <p>Others say he was held back by other Arab leaders, in Cairo and Riyadh particularly, who had not been briefed on the talks and who held absolutist positions on Jerusalem, Islam's third most sacred site. </p> <p>However, Palestinian negotiators and strategists like Hussein Agha say Mr Arafat's apparent intransigence had more to do with the way the Camp David talks were conducted, coupled with a distrust rooted in a history of constantly renegotiated and unimplemented accords. </p> <p>\"The methodology of Camp David was complicated and unhelpful,\" Mr Agha said. \"It was a big mess. Lots of ideas were being raised, but it was never clear whose ideas they were.\" </p> <p>He said the Palestinian delegation was reluctant to agree to loosely worded proposals when it was not clear whether they were US or Israeli positions, final drafts or starting points for discussions. Mr Arafat, in short, was afraid of committing himself to a compromise, only to find that it had never really been on the table. </p> <p>The format of the Camp David talks meant that as long as Jerusalem remained unsolved, nothing was solved. Nothing had been put down on paper, and so as the peace process went up in flames. All the key issues driving the conflict are as raw and bitter as ever. </p> <p><b> Jerusalem</b><br> </p> <p> Since the 1967 war, Israel has had control over the entire city, including the Arab districts of East Jerusalem and the holy sites of three religions, Judaism, Islam and Christianity. </p> <p>However, the day-to-day running of the Haram al-Sharif - sacred to the Jews as the Temple Mount - was handed back to the Muslim religious authorities, the Waqf. </p> <p>The Palestinians want full sovereignty over all the Arab-inhabited districts of East Jerusalem, including the Islamic, Christian and Armenian quarters of the Old City, and full control, religious and temporal, over the Haram al-Sharif. </p> <p>The most the Israelis were prepared to put on the table in public was Palestinian sovereignty over some of East Jerusalem's outer suburbs, local autonomy in a few inner suburbs, and religious autonomy possibly combined with flag-flying rights at Haram al-Sharif. </p> <p>Ehud Barak's proposals fell short of Palestinian demands, but they marked a breakthrough. Since 1967. sovereignty over Jerusalem had always been treated as non-negotiable by Israeli leaders. </p> <p>Other proposals were floated by the US at Camp David and afterwards. One involved a sort of split-level sovereignty, giving Palestinians control of the stone surface of the Haram al-Sharif, and the Israelis control of the archaeologically rich Temple Mount below. Another put the city's holy sites under some form of international, possibly UN, control. Yet another, gave the Palestinians more or less what they wanted - control over most Arab-inhabited districts of the Old City and East Jerusalem. </p> <p>However, Mr Arafat did not respond to these floated ideas, possibly because he feared they would be withdrawn after he had made concessions on other issues. </p> <p>His hesitation offered a window of opportunity to Ariel Sharon, to provoke a direct confrontation over sovereignty in Jerusalem, before talks could be restarted. </p> <p><b> Refugees</b><br> </p> <p> More than 3.6m Palestinian refugees living in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria have clung to the hope that UN resolutions would be fulfilled, promising them a right of return to the homes they abandoned in 1948 and 1967. </p> <p>However, this was never going to be acceptable to Israel. Most of the refugees' property had been taken over, and a return of the Palestinian diaspora would create an Arab majority in Israel. Israel also refused to take any financial responsibility for compensation. </p> <p>The compromise solution was for an internationally-financed fund to compensate the refugees and their host nations, paving the way for their ultimate absorption in the Arab states. </p> <p>Israel would allow some refugees to return for \"humanitarian\" reasons. The numbers quoted under this scheme varied from a few hundred to 100,000, but the conditions and timescale of this token return were never made clear. </p> <p>It was also far from clear how the refugees themselves, for whom a return to Palestine is an item of faith, would react to such a compromise. The deal could easily have triggered a political crisis in Jordan, Lebanon and other host nations. </p> <p><b> Settlers</b><br> </p> <p> The greatest barrier to the transfer of the West Bank to Palestinian control was the presence of 200,000 Jewish settlers who had established communities there, ranging from tiny hilltop outposts to huge concrete citadels around Jerusalem. </p> <p>The settlers included some of the most radical nationalist Jewish groups, many whom came from the US with a mission to repopulate Biblical lands. Any attempt to remove them would inevitably lead to violence, and would extract a huge political price for any Israeli government attempting to implement a peace deal. </p> <p>The solution seemed to lie in the distribution of the settlers. More than 80% of them lived in less than 8% of the West Bank, in the high-density suburbs ringing Jerusalem. According to the deal discussed at Camp David, the settlers would gradually be concentrated in this 8%, and the resulting 92% of the West Bank, together with the Gaza Strip, would become the new state of Palestine. The two territories would be linked by a system of flyovers, while the Jewish settlements around Jerusalem would have access to the city itself through tunnels and more raised highways. </p> <p>Only such complicated feats of civil engineering, it was argued, could resolve the conflicts inherent in the patchwork map of settlements and Palestinian villages around Jerusalem.</p>",
  "Five synagogues were set ablaze in France yesterday as rage ignited by the latest killings in the Middle East flashed around the globe. A Jewish school in the Paris suburb of Saint-Ouen also came under attack from petrol bombers. <p>In Britain the Jewish community said it had been put on high alert for fear of reprisals. </p> <p>In New York mosques were closed - a rare event for the day of prayer - as a mark of respect for the Palestinian dead. A prayer rally outside the UN was planned as community leaders warned that relations between Jews and Muslims in the US would be soured by Washington's \"blind support\" for Israel. </p> <p>In Chicago a rabbi narrowly escaped injury when his car was sprayed by bullets in a drive-by shooting, and three Palestinian youths were being questioned by police for allegedly slinging marbles at Jewish passersby from a van. </p> <p>\"When things flare up there [in the Middle East], Arabs and Muslims act in solidarity with their brethren there with illegal acts here,\" said Jay Tcath, the director of the Jewish community relations council in the city. </p> <p>Two South African police officers were stabbed when a protest degenerated into running battles outside the US embassy in Pretoria. Demonstrators were eventually dispersed by water canon. </p> <p>The worst violence was in France where unidentified arsonists set fire to five synagogues overnight. More than 70 anti-semitic incidents - ranging from arson to shouted insults - have been recorded by the police during the latest crisis. </p> <p>The synagogue attacks were in Bondy and Garges-les-Gonesses in the Seine-Saint-Denis area north of Paris, in the Belleville quarter of the capital, at Longjumeau south of the city and in the southwest city of Toulouse. There were no casualties and damage was slight. </p> <p>The front doors of two Jewish families in Orly, south of Paris, were also set alight. </p> <p>Anti-semitic graffiti was found on walls in another northern Paris suburb, Le Blanc Mesnil, which has a large immigrant population from north Africa. Jewish community leaders claim the attacks are predominantly the work of disaffected Arab youths. There are some 5m Muslims in France; some of their leaders, notably the Paris imam, Dalil Boubakeur, have called for calm and dialogue with Jewish groups. There are around 750,000 Jews in France, mostly around Paris. </p> <p>In London, Jewish groups warned that militant Muslim groups had distributed leaflets calling for the death of Jews. </p> <p>\"There have been fundamentalist organisations not calling for the killing of Israelis, but of Jews. It is very inciteful material,\" said Mike Whine, a spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews. \"Volunteers have been placed in and around synagogues and police are proactively patrolling Jewish areas\". </p> <p>Mr Whine said recent attacks on Britain's estimated 280,000-strong Jewish community had been largely confined to synagogue vandalism. \"We have advised the high level of alert will continue for the foreseeable future. But we've had nothing like the problems other countries are experiencing.\" </p> <p>About 300 people gathered for a peaceful protest outside Central London Mosque in Regent's Park, northwest London, after Friday afternoon prayers.</p>",
  "The widows of two Israeli soldiers made desperate attempts to reach their husbands on their mobile telephones when they discovered they had fallen into the hands of Palestinians in Ramallah. <p>Hani Avrahami rushed to call her husband Yossi, aged 38, when she found out what was happening by logging on to an internet site. His mobile continued to ring until an unfamiliar voice answered: \"I have just killed your husband.\" </p> <p>The words of his presumed killer froze Israel in horror yesterday. It was still reeling from the memory of television footage of one of the bodies being thrown head first from the second storey window of the police station in Ramallah, before being set upon by men wielding window panes torn from the building. </p> <p>Shortly after the mob set on the police station, chanting \"God is great\" and \"We want to break their legs, we want to gouge their eyes\", Irina Norjitz tried to call her husband Vadim, a Russian immigrant from Or Akiva, north of Tel Aviv. </p> <p>\"Vadim?\" she said when someone answered. But the answer came in a language she did not understand and then the telephone disconnected. </p> <p>Anna Norjitz, Irina's sister-in-law, said: \"Then they [the military] called to say he hadn't reached the point [the military base where he was due to report]. And then the police came and she understood Vadim was dead.\" </p> <p>The Norjitzs married last week and Irina was three months' pregnant. </p> <p>There was an information ban about the condition of the bodies. According to one report, one of the victims was still alive when the Palestinian Authority handed them over to the Israeli district co-ordination office outside Ramallah. </p> <p>Israeli newspapers reported that defence ministry doctors who examined the bodies burst into tears. A spokesman for the Israel army said the two were identified by their fingerprints and dental records. </p> <p>There was confusion about how many soldiers were captured, the role of the soldiers and how they arrived in Ramallah in a civilian car with yellow Israeli number plates. </p> <p>The Israeli military claimed the occupants became confused near an army base at Ofer, because there were cement blocks blocking the road. They then turned left, and took a long, bumpy road into town </p> <p>But Palestinians claim it was improbable that the soldiers did not know they were on an Arab road. Arab roads are unpaved, while roads built for Israeli settlers are new. </p> <p>The Palestinians continued to claim that the soldiers were working undercover in civilian clothing. The Israelis countered that the men were reservists, members of a transportation unit. \"You know the kind of guys, noncombatant reservists with potbellies,\" Ranaan Gissin, a spokesman for the Israeli army, said. </p> <p>An Israeli army major, Yarden Vatikay, said: \"There are some reports that there was an additional man, maybe not even a military man. We are still checking it but personally I don't think we will find anything. </p> <p>Yitzhak Ohayon, the mayor of Petah Tikva, where Avrahami lived with his wife Hani, a schoolteacher, their twin sons aged five, and a girl aged seven, said Avrahami was \"just an ordinary citizen, no interest in politics\". </p> <p>Norjitz was buried yesterday and Avrahami was to be buried on Sunday, the army said.</p>",
  "A Bosnian Serb accused of raping and torturing Muslim women nearly a decade ago killed himself as four German peacekeepers tried to arrest him on behalf of the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, Nato said yesterday. <p>Janko Janjic, 43, detonated a hand grenade which killed him and injured the soldiers. The German defence ministry said they were not in a critical condition. </p> <p>The incident took place late on Thursday night in Foca, a Serb-held town southeast of Sarajevo suspected of harbouring a number of indicted war criminals. Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary general, said the peacekeepers did not fire their weapons. </p> <p>In a separate development, it was disclosed that, over the past three days, Bosnian experts have exhumed the bodies of 118 Muslims murdered in 1992 and buried in mass graves. </p> <p>The Muslim commission for missing persons said the team has so far found 83 bodies in a grave near the eastern Bosnian town of Zepa. The victims are believed to be Muslims from the town of Visegrad, on the border with Serbia. </p> <p>They are believed to have been killed in their home town and thrown into the Drina river. The bodies floated down the river for some 15 miles to the Muslim town of Zepa, where they were recovered by residents and buried. </p> <p>Large nails were found in the bodies during the ex humation, appearing to support the claims of witnesses who said people were crucified on the doors of their homes or on their fences. </p> <p>At a second location, near Prijedor in northwestern Bosnia, the team exhumed 35 bodies. \"All of them were killed in 1992. Among the bodies was the oldest victim found so far, 102-year old Hanka Alic from neighbouring Kozarac,\" the deputy head of the commission, Jasmin Odobasic, said. </p> <p>The commission expects to find up to 100 more bodies in the two graves. During the civil war in Bosnia from 1992-95, some 200,000 people died and another 20,000 are missing, presumed dead. Almost 90% were Bosnian Muslims. </p> <p>Janjic, known as Tuta, was deputy commander of military police and paramilitary in the Foca area from 1992-93. </p> <p>Foca's police chief, Zoran Mandic, said the soldiers used explosives to blast open the apartment door of Janjic's brother Oliver, who was home with his wife and daughters. </p> <p>The office of Carla del Ponte, chief prosecutor at the Hague war crimes tribunal, said it regretted that Janjic, \"who had previously threatened to kill himself and others should an arrest attempt be made, chose to exercise this option\". </p> <p>In 1997, Janjic offered to reveal his alleged crimes to an American camera crew. In the CBS programme Public Eye he told a hidden camera: \"Yes, for DM5,000 I will tell everything. How I slit throats, killed them and dug their eyes out ... you can tape me.\" </p> <p>Serb paramilitaries overran Foca in April 1992 and, although there was no warfare in this region, killed or expelled virtually every Muslim in the town. </p> <p>Three Bosnian Serbs went on trial in the Hague in March over the Foca atrocities, in the first attempt by an international tribunal to prosecute for wartime sexual enslavement. Three others indicted are still at large. </p> <p>Janjic is the third indicted person to die resisting arrest in Bosnia. </p> <p>In 1997, the Bosnian Serb police chief, Simo Drljaca, was killed by SAS troops in Prijedor as he reached for his gun. Last year French troops shot dead a Bosnian Serb, Dragan Gagovic, after he tried to run them down in his car. </p> <p>EU leaders, who are to have talks today with the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, at their summit in Biarritz, are making it clear that they will not press him yet to hand over his predecessor, Slobodan Milosevic, and four of his close associates to the Hague tribunal. But he will come under pressure when his position is deemed to be more secure. </p> <p>The west's softly-softly approach has irritated public opinion across Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, where most of the war crimes were committed. </p> <p>\u0095 Alija Izetbegovic, leader of the Bosnian Muslims since 1990, will retire from the country's presidency today as a result of poor health and worsening relations with the international community.</p>",
  "Two dozen workers were sitting at a long table in their factory's conference room, discussing their strike demands. Tension hung in the air as pervasively as the smoke of hundreds of cigarettes. <p>A senior official had drawn a gun on a group of workers elsewhere in the administration building a few hours earlier. Upstairs the workers had posted their own guards in the accountant's office. \"We need to prevent documents being removed,\" explained Predrag Jelic, a member of the hastily formed crisis committee. </p> <p>With a staff of around 3,000, Trudbenik is one of Serbia's biggest construction companies. It has put up hotels in Belgrade, Baghdad and Beijing. When scores of other firms across Serbia went on strike last week to demand an end to Mr Milosevic's election fraud, Trudbenik carried on working. Now it is in uproar. </p> <p>\"We have used this moment to gather our strength and raise our voice. This is a political moment but our demands are not political,\" said Mr Jelic, a man with long years of service in the company. </p> <p>Yugoslavia's new president, Vojislav Kostunica, used the wave of strikes and street blockades to help to topple Slobodan Milosevic last week. But now that he has been sworn in as president, he has condemned the factory occupations as vigorously as has Mr Milosevic's Socialist party. </p> <p>Nebojsa Covic, who leads one of the parties in Mr Kostunica's coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (Dos), has been visiting factories, urging workers to get back to work and trust Dos to bring change. </p> <p>The strike committee at Trudbenik is having none of it. \"We don't need political sup port, and we won't accept any demands for restraint from Covic or anyone else from Dos,\" Mr Jelic stressed. </p> <p>Their suspicions are the legacy of the hybrid system of communism and unregulated capitalism that Mr Milosevic fostered. Everyone joined the ruling party, whether they were managers or trade union leaders. </p> <p>Political connections were vital not only for the company to get privileged access to capital, licences and subsidies but also for every factory's aspiring elite. Promotion was rare if you were not in the ruling party. </p> <p>In the early 1990s, as a crude market economy and phoney privatisation spread through eastern Europe, Mr Milosevic joined the bandwagon. He allowed large companies to break into smaller units and fix their own commercial contracts. Union leaders were as eager as managers to exploit the new chance of riches. </p> <p>\"The trade union secretary practically ran this company,\" said Mr Jelic. \"He got rid of the last managing director in 1995 and chose the new one. Under privatisation the trade union secretary formed a company called Sind which built upper-income flats in Belgrade. </p> <p>\"They won their workers' loyalty by paying them DM5 (\u00a31.50) an hour, while other workers here get DM100 (\u00a330) for a whole month,\" he added. </p> <p>The trade union leader also decided who was laid off with so-called holiday pay in the long periods when there were not enough orders. Instead of rotating the layoffs, he used the system to punish workers he did not like. The union also kept control of the flats given by the state solidarity board and intended for needy families. It sold some and kept others for its favourites. </p> <p>It was not cronyism by a handful of people at the top but a system of fear and favours which benefited hundreds of factory and party officials. No wonder the crisis committee's demands include the sacking of the managing director, the entire board of directors and the trade union leadership. </p> <p>Now that Yugoslavia is about to reopen to foreign trade with the lifting of sanctions, the country's economy should start to grow. </p> <p>A lot of money will be made, and the strike committee wants to be sure that the new rulers from Dos do not just reproduce the old system by imposing so-called democrats on factories. </p> <p>They have suffered too much from opportunism in the past. The same Mr Covic, who has become Dos's troubleshooter in urging workers to end the factory seizures, was the Socialist mayor of Belgrade and the third most senior man in Mr Milosevic's party until he switched sides in 1996. Yet during these past four years of \"opposition\" he has been able to remain managing director of a profitable company making tin cans. </p> <p>To prevent another round of musical chairs, the strike committee at Trudbenik wants a proper system of accountability in the company, credible financial public accounts and no further role for party politics in factory appointments. It will not just blindly put its faith in Dos. </p> <p>Mr Jelic was finishing his explanation when the door burst open and a red-faced man stormed in. </p> <p>\"It's Dusan Djuraskovic, the managing director. He told us yesterday he would be on a business trip today,\" Mr Jelic explained while we watched in astonishment as he made his way to the head of the table, shouting all the way. He was too worked up to notice or mind the presence of foreign reporters. </p> <p>\"No provocations, please. I'm here and I want peace and dignity,\" he bellowed, his anger undermining his presumably prepared opening words of conciliation. </p> <p>Then he launched a tirade of promises and threats, constantly pounding the table. </p> <p>\"I don't recognise your crisis committee. But I'll sign your request for my resignation. Call the police. Call whomever you like. I'm ready to go because I want peace and quiet, and for the sake of my family. </p> <p>\"We're so close to killing each other here. It needs just a little thing to set if off. You can see all the company's papers. There's nothing to hide. Sue me if you want to. But if I leave here, the company will lose. I'm running it well.\" </p> <p>He took a blank piece of paper, and signed it. \"Fill in whatever you like,\" he shouted. As the tirade went on, workers started to whisper. \"He must be drunk. He had to work up his courage somehow,\" one surmised. </p> <p>\"Excuse me, who invited you here?\" a worker shouted. That piece of lip set off a new torrent of words ending with the managing director's final threat: \"I'll go off and see Covic tomorrow, and the other Dos leaders.\" </p> <p>\"All right,\" someone shouted. \"We'll be here in the building all night and we'll have reinforcements tomorrow from all the rest of the company's sections.\" </p> <p>\"And don't use your company car any more,\" another voice chipped in as Mr Djuraskovic stormed out of the room as furiously as he had come in.</p>",
  "Last Friday, the law firm Bhatt Murphy was rung by the Mail on Sunday, who said they were writing a piece about detention of refugees and were interested in featuring one of their clients. This is like being rung by the British National party and asked to give your address so they can send you their autumn catalogue. If the Mail were ever to question the justice of jailing refugees, it would be to promote sterilisation as the alternative. <p>The reason for the sudden interest in the client, whose asylum claim was upheld by the appeals tribunal and who is therefore legally resident, was that he is suing the Home Office. He claims that the last three months of his detention were unlawful because the Home Office was in possession of all the information that led to his asylum claim being upheld. Part of his complaint is that, after complaining about conditions in the notorious Campsfield House, he was handcuffed and moved to prison. </p> <p>Bhatt Murphy asked the Mail to guarantee their client's anonymity, for his safety and that of his family still in Algeria. The Mail's position is that, given that he is bringing a civil action, his identity is public. This raises the question that if the whole world is talking about it already, why does the Mail think it's such a scoop? If the British public and the Algerian government spend their days at the Royal Courts of Justice, scouring the daily listings and sitting in on civil suits, the story is redundant. Actually, there are people who do that, but most are homeless, few look Algerian and I doubt whether any are Mail readers. Mail readers haven't sat in on trials since the death penalty was abolished. </p> <p> Nevertheless, the newspaper refused to accept that the man or his family might suffer as a result of the story. Bhatt Murphy found themselves explaining that fear of persecution is what being a refugee is all about. It's not a legal status the Home Office confers with gladness of heart. Moreover, not all regimes are above taking out their frustration with exiles on friends and family. </p> <p>To spell it out for the Mail, the solicitors referred the paper to guidelines from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. But the paper was determined, feeling best placed to make judgments about the safety of political dissidents abroad. Perhaps the Mail should start an advice page in its international edition with hints on evading arrest and torture. But I suppose the suggestion \"Stay calm and don't move, especially here\" would become repetitive. </p> <p>On Saturday Bhatt Murphy won a court ruling against the Mail, and on Sunday the paper grumpily informed readers that it wasn't allowed to put the man's family at risk. However the paper was able to give us illuminating quotes from Ann Widdecombe and Robin Corbett, who is a Labour MP and chair of the home affairs committee. </p> <p>Widdecombe told us, \"It is perfectly proper for asylum seekers to be detained, particularly where there is good reason to fear they may disappear before their case is decided.\" Well, under her proposals, there would be no \"particularly\"; she wants to put them all in camps, which she calls \"reception centres\". I have spoken to many a receptionist; they are usually charming and none has ever held me in a headlock, smashed my belongings or said, \"Go home if you don't like it.\" </p> <p>But Labour's reign has scarcely been more humane than Widdecombe's notion of what it is to meet and greet. Despite the perpetual blather about the fear of refugees absconding, most of those in detention are awaiting decisions, cannot be deported and have no reason to go on the run. About one in seven refugees are detained the second they arrive, and one in 10 are still in jail three months later. The man in the Mail story endured 19 months of detention. The fact that he is suing over only three months of it shows considerable forbearance in my view. </p> <p>At present more than 1,000 refugees are in camps and prisons, with Jack Straw hoping to build on that success by jailing another 1,700. So it is not surprising that the loyal minion Robin Corbett gave the Mail this piece of wisdom: \"It seems a very churlish way to show gratitude to a country which has given him sanctuary.\" </p> <p>In the first place, the man is not suing the country; he is suing the Home Office. In the second place, just how long is a refugee supposed to bow and scrape? Must his children also feel grateful that the government conceded something to their father that was his by right? Can the government do what it likes to people if they weren't born here, and should they be jolly thankful if they're not tortured? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "It was nearly noon and the young men were engaged in a shoving match with the cordon of Israeli riot police blocking the gates of the mosque. <p>Yesterday, on the third Friday since two peoples began their descent into an unholy war, it all came home to the heart of the matter: the sacred ground of the Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem. </p> <p>In the tangle of lanes around the mosque, thousands of Israeli riot police were deployed in the greatest show of force since the onset of violence. Only middle-aged men, and women, were allowed inside for afternoon prayers, and the crowds were seething with frustration. </p> <p>On the other side of Jerusalem's old walled city, meanwhile, the most sacred shrine of the Jews was almost deserted. Despite the approach of the Sukkot festival, few worshippers dared visit the Wailing Wall. </p> <p>As the hearts of two peoples returned to their faith, there could hardly have been a greater divide. One nation was angry and defiant. The other, Israel, was bracing for more horrors to come. </p> <p>In scuffles on al-Mojahedin Street, named for holy warriors, Israeli riot police used canes and forcefully applied fists to chests to turn back young men from the mosque. </p> <p>\"This is the ultimate humiliation, preventing me from going to pray,\" said Mazen Sublaba, aged 25. </p> <p>Mercifully, there was no real violence, and the massive police deployment broke the pattern of earlier Fridays when youths have stormed out of mosques throwing stones and petrol bombs. </p> <p>At Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances to the walled city, mounted policemen loomed over the crowds before driving them back with tear gas. Some men rolled out their prayer mats and knelt where they were. Others stood their ground. </p> <p>\"Saddam, Saddam, the conqueror. Go back to bombing Tel Aviv. If you want us to wear a commando uniform, we are ready,\" they screamed. </p> <p>After Yasser Arafat freed 350 militants from Palestinian jails, including the top bomber of the Hamas movement, that is precisely Israel's fear. Yesterday there was intense security around shopping malls and other public places, and the army issued warnings of a renewal of terror. </p> <p>\"We understand that they understand that they have a green light for terrorist attacks,\" said Major Yarden Vatikay, an Israeli army spokesman. \"These are people who do not plan sporadic fire. These are people who plan to demolish buildings, hit buses and kill women and children.\" </p> <p>In the afternoon a few dozen Israeli activists stood outside a square in west Jerusalem with placards pleading: \"Don't kill the peace\". But the streets were unusually quiet, even for the eve of the Jewish sabbath. </p> <p>Twenty four hours after all of Israel seems to have watched and recoiled in horror from the uncut television footage of the killing of their soldiers, a consensus seemed to be forming that peace was dead, and that the Israeli left had been fools to even think of negotiating with the Palestinians. </p> <p>\"The psychological and cultural split yawned open yesterday into a deep and perhaps total rift. The Palestinian people are mobilising for a war of independence, the Israeli public is united, at least at the moment, in a battle of survival,\" Ma'ariv newspaper said. </p> <p>In Petah Tikva, the hometown of one of the dead soldiers, they were even more unforgiving. \"It is not just this murder, but the behaviour of the Arabs inside and outside the country,\" said Dr Yehuda Finkelstein. </p> <p>\"This is not a peace process. this is part of a Palestinian project on how to destroy us and to throw us away from the Mediterranean area.\" </p> <p>In Ramallah, where worshippers went straight from afternoon prayers to throw stones at an army checkpoint on the edge of town, they agreed with the Israelis on one point, at least. Peace was dead. However, they said it had never amounted to much anyway. \"What is peace?\" said one teenager with a Tommy Hilfiger t-shirt wrapped around his head. \"I can't even get out of this shithole unless the Israelis say so.\" </p> <p>On the roads leading out of town, which Israel has blocked with concrete barricades, a handful of children were snapping at their catapults, testing them for future confrontations. </p> <p>Outside the police station where the Israeli soldiers met their deaths on Thursday, a few policemen in black uniforms struggled to maintain their dignity, standing guard over what was reduced to a heap of rubble by Israel's rocket attack. </p> <p>Otherwise, the streets were eerily quiet. </p> <p>Nobody here is expressing contrition at the deaths of the soldiers. Instead their outrage is focused at Israel's deployment of its war machinery to avenge those deaths. \"This is not an intifada any more. This is war,\" said Yusuf Ali, who runs a cafe that is the fuelling point for young Palestinians in between bouts of stone-throwing. </p> <p>In the distance a machine-gun mounted on an Israeli tank was aiming its fire on a small hut where a Palestinian sniper had been hiding. Down the road the barricade was burning as usual. </p> <p>\"No matter what happens, sooner or later, even if it takes 100 years, Jerusalem is going to be back with all the Muslim people, not just the Palestinians. And this is only the beginning,\" said Mr Ali.</p>",
  "The west seems incapable of thinking of more than one Balkan thing at a time. But in the Balkans, it is the interconnection of things which matters. By thinking only of Croatia in 1992, we blew up Bosnia. When we ended the Bosnia war at Dayton, we forgot about Kosovo. And now there is a real danger that in the rush of relief and euphoria to welcome President Vojislav Kostunica in Serbia, we will destabilise the peace we have created in Bosnia and Kosovo and undermine the fragile government in Croatia. <p>This is not to underestimate the remarkable transformation taking place in Belgrade; or the potential of the moment. It is merely to caution that there are now many ways to waste the opportunity that Mr Kostunica and the forces of democracy in Serbia have presented to us. One is for the west to judge Mr Kostunica by what he has said and done in the past. Mr Kostunica says he is a nationalist (I think he means a patriot, but there is no such distinction in Serbo-Croat). His past statements, and even some of his actions, do give cause for concern. But if it had not been so, I doubt that he would have rid us of Milosevic. So the right policy is to judge him, not by the past, but by what he does in the weeks and months ahead. And so far the things he has done have been good, even brave. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica is a legalist and has, to some, acted too slowly to rid Serbia of the malevolent forces of Milosevic. But it is a good thing to have, as president of ex-Yugoslavia, a man who is scrupulous about the law. No one should under- estimate the poison which Milosevic can infiltrate into the Serb body politic as long as he is around. But I think that the revolution that unseated him is now irreversible. If Mr Kostunica has achieved this without the lawlessness which would have resulted from more extensive use of popular force on the streets, and so strengthened the legal foundations of his government for the future, then that should be a matter for welcome, not regret. </p> <p>But if a too sceptical approach is one danger which the west should avoid, a too euphoric one is another. My hunch is that Mr Kostunica's instincts are those of cooperation and good relations with neighbours. But there is a long way to go before he establishes a stable and effective government which can put these qualities into action. Too early a western commitment of full support, before the transformation has been completed, could be dangerous. We must not relax for Serbia the standards of internal democracy and the acceptance of the rule of international law which we have demanded of other Balkan nations. The first priority should be for President Kostunica to stabilise his government. But in the end, there can be no compromise on the necessity to bring to justice in the Hague those indicted for war crimes in ex-Yugoslavia. Anything less would risk destabilising the fragile government of President Stipe Mesic in Croatia, who has taken great risks to send the Tudjman-era war criminals to the Hague. </p> <p>So the west's policy should be to offer goodwill and help for Mr Kostunica at the start, to judge him by what he now does and to be patient about progress, but firm about the conditions which must, ultimately, be fulfilled. </p> <p>What then can Mr Kostunica do to capitalise on the wider opportunities in the Balkans which his velvet revolution has created? Here the picture is mixed. There is now a real opportunity to resolve the Montenegro question which has held the Balkans on a hair-trigger for war in recent months. There seems a willingness in Belgrade to renegotiate the constitutional relationship with Montenegro, within a confederal \"commonwealth\" based on the principle of equality. This would leave all powers with the two constituent nations, except for those relating to foreign affairs, the army and the management of a single convertible currency which they hope will lead to the euro. There even seems to be agreement between the two countries to abandon the old name of Yugoslavia in favour of a new name, \"Serbia-Montenegro\" - a name whose undoubted inelegance seems a small price to pay for the removal of one of the Balkans' most explosive flash points. </p> <p>For Bosnia, too, the change in Belgrade is good news. Mr Kostunica has said (and made me promise to repeat) that he accepts the Dayton borders and wishes to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. This should increase the votes of the moderates, at the expense of the pro-Milosevic Serbs, in the forthcoming Bosnia-wide election early next month. Freed from threats to its existence from both Croatia to its west and now Serbia to its east, Bosnia should be able to get down to the business of building itself as a state and making the changes necessary to become a candidate for Europe. </p> <p> In Kosovo the picture is more mixed. Though they will not admit it publicly, the presence of Milosevic gave legitimacy and strength to the Kosovan Albanian claim for independence. These are neuralgic times for Kosovan Albanians. They know that the removal of the dictator who so violated and brutalised their community has weakened their claim for total independence. And they fear that, just as the west's caravan moved on from Bosnia to Kosovo, now all the political will, influence and aid is about to move north to Belgrade. </p> <p>Some say that we will see played out in Kosovo the same phenomenon that I witnessed as a soldier in Belfast in 1970. The troops arrive as heroes to the oppressed, but soon become the enemy who keeps them from their political ambitions. I don't think this is likely in Kosovo. But it will need a great deal of political maturity and wisdom from Kosovo's inexperienced politicians to understand that the right response to Kostunica is not to retreat into suspicious gloominess and introspection, but to accept that Kosovo is now in an economic and democratic race with Belgrade, which they intend to win. The west will not abandon Kosovo. But we are now playing a larger game of regional reconstruction, and Kosovo will better serve itself by being part of this than by retreating into a small island of Balkan refuseniks. </p> <p>Kostunica, if he is wise, should help this process. He needs to understand that security for his fellow Serbs in Kosovo does not come out of the barrel of a K-For gun, but out of a new political relationship between the two communities, which, on the Serb side, he can help lead from Belgrade. No doubt his own nationalist elements will want him to strike muscular positions on Kosovo. That would set the province alight, cause even more suffering to the Serbs, increase the votes of the Albanian extremists in next week's Kosovo elections and make sure that K-For troops have to stay longer. His best course of action is to say he wants to work constructively with the UN in Kosovo, advise Kosovan Serbs to do the same and leave the status of Kosovo to later when things have quietened down. </p> <p>One final step we should now consider. The end of Milosevic has left a number of interconnected southern Balkan issues still to be resolved: the status of Kosovo, the relationship between Montenegro and Serbia, the stability of Macedonia and, now that we have removed the danger of a greater Serbia, the question of a greater Albania. There is now a case for looking at these regionally - for a kind of \"southern Balkans Dayton\". As I said, in the Balkans it is the interconnection of things which matters. </p> <p> Paddy Ashdown's diaries, which include previous trips to the Balkans, will be published on November 1 </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Is there now a threat to the regional order in the Middle East? It is a question that has naturally been raised as the violence in Israel and the territories continues, especially since it has been accompanied not only by demonstrations across the Arab world but by the attack on the USS Cole and the bombing of the British embassy in Yemen. Nervous markets, as is their way, have already decided to act as if there were such a danger. It would be foolish to be too sanguine, particularly about the possibility of terrorist action. But it is plainly not true that the region is trembling on the brink of the kind of revolutionary change that would bring down existing governments and install radicals and fundamentalists in their place. There is no outside power, as there was in the past in the shape of the Soviet Union, to sponsor such changes. <p>As for the prospect of wider war, neither Syria nor Israel would gain anything by it. Nor does it seem likely that the one other state that could cause military trouble, Iraq, will do so at a moment when it has been successfully working its way back into international life in spite of United Nations resolutions and American and British hostility. Middle Eastern governments are certainly frightened and perplexed. Critical though some were of the peace process and of Israel, the slow working out of a settlement between Israelis and Palestinians formed a core activity to which everybody related, as they did to the larger American management of the region. That management was there to be used when necessary, to be resisted on occasion, to be influenced when possible. But it provided a map on which leaders, governments and political movements could orientate themselves. Now the map is suddenly indecipherable and all are having to cope with the resulting uncertainty. There is also the problem undemocratic or quasi-democratic regimes face when their peoples take to the streets in the knowledge that the legitimacy of their protests cannot be questioned. When real politics is so constrained, popular anger that may have many causes other than the one proclaimed jets through the few allowed channels with greater force. Probably all Middle Eastern governments want the situation, as the phrase goes, brought under control. But none wants to be associated with a failed effort to do so, hence the caution with which Egypt, for instance, is treating the idea of a summit- meeting on its soil. </p> <p>In the place of functional activity, Arab diplomats are rushing about in the search for instant condemnation. They are, for example, pursuing a resolution accusing Israel of genocide, at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva - a course of action as unfair as it is useless. A hundred dead is a terrible thing, but it is not genocide. The United States, meanwhile, is \"working the phones\" and President Clinton is available for a summit. There will be one, it may be hazarded, as long as there is not another Ramallah. </p> <p>The Middle East is a region that resists change, and when change comes it never comes in a uniform way to all its countries. There is no part of the world over which western governments are more prone to sudden panic. But, while it is true that events in Israel and the territories do not augur some immediate upheaval across the region, it would be a different matter if Israelis and Palestinians go into permanent political regression. That is why all must hope that \"working the phones\" will lead at least to a halt to that process.</p>",

  "George W Bush has recovered his lead in the American presidential election opinion polls in part because more voters have come to see Al Gore as a traditional liberal advocate of big government, advisers to both White House candidates believe. <p>Republican strategists urged Mr Bush to put the \"big government\" issue at the centre of his case against Mr Gore during the second presidential debate earlier this week in North Carolina. </p> <p>Mr Bush, as usual, carried out his advisers' wishes to the full. </p> <p>President Clinton is believed to be among the Democratic moderates who counselled Mr Gore to place more emphasis on the government's role as a promoter of opportunity rather than as a provider of solutions, an approach that Mr Gore tried to follow with limited success in the debate. </p> <p>While recent US campaign headlines have focused on aspects of the candidates' characters, Mr Bush's current surge has been accompanied by the emergence of strong public support for a smaller and less activist government than Mr Gore proposes. </p> <p>Results of a Washington Post survey of public opinion this week showed that Americans prefer a less interventionist government by a margin of nearly two to one, a finding which could make it very hard for Mr Gore to capture centre-ground voters, who are particularly sceptical about government activism. </p> <p>According to the Post poll, 58% of voters say that they would favour \"smaller government with fewer services\", as against 32% of Americans who prefer \"larger government with many services\". When asked which of the two candidates would do a better job \"holding down the size of government\", 54% chose Mr Bush, while only 33% chose Mr Gore. </p> <p>Mr Gore's dilemma is that almost all of the individual programmes he supports are very popular; he revived his flagging candidacy this summer by pledging to use government spending to help \"working families\" and the poor. </p> <p>Yet, as the election nears, those promises seem not to hold such attraction for the affluent minority of Americans who are expected to vote on November 7. </p> <p>\"Gore's reliance on government solutions has been very successful in rallying the Democratic base, but it does not play well with the independent voters whose support he also now needs,\" a leading Democratic moderate said this week. </p> <p>Mr Bush, who has placed a $1,300bn (\u00a3885bn) tax cut over 10 years at the centre of his programme, relentlessly painted Mr Gore as a supporter of big government during their debate. </p> <p>\"I don't believe, like the vice-president does, in huge government,\" Mr Bush said Wednesday during his closing remarks.\"I believe in limited government. And by having a limited government and a focused government we can send some of the money back to the people that pay the bills.\" </p> <p>On several occasions during the debate, Mr Gore tried to stress his credentials as a limited-government man. \"I'm for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm not for command and control techniques,\" he said later in the debate. </p> <p>At times, however, Mr Gore also seemed an enthusiast for government intervention at home and abroad; responding to Mr Bush's calls for limited US foreign engagement, Mr Gore said that the US should \"provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction\". </p> <p>And when he talked about subjects such as healthcare, hate crimes and education, Mr Gore seemed to embrace government activism very willingly. </p> <p>In 1992 and 1996, Mr Clinton successfully finessed the issue with his \"third way\" strategy, in which he reinvented the Democrats as the party of more limited government activism. </p> <p>Mr Gore has not been able to follow through on that approach in the way that hardcore moderates - such as his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, and President Clinton - would normally favour. </p> <p>As he saw his support languishing throughout the first half of this year, Mr Gore was compelled to move to the left, trying to inspire traditional Democratic voters with promises of big spending programmes - especially on pensions and prescription drug benefits for the elderly - made possible by the surplus in the federal budget. </p> <p>That strategy restored Mr Gore's candidacy to health in August and for much of September. But in the past three weeks the vice-president has lost ground as Mr Bush regained it with promises of tax cuts. </p> <p>Win or lose, the issue is certain to be at the heart of the election post-mortems after November 7.</p>",
  "Amos Oz (Why Arafat must take the blame, October 13) attacks Arafat and pleads for a Palestinian right to nationhood and sovereignty. Mr Oz's tone is temperate and rational. This contrasts with Edward Said's article (Double standards, October 12), which makes a similar demand for Palestinian rights, but uses the language of anger and hate. <p>Mr Said calls Ariel Sharon a \"paunchy old war criminal\", Yasser Arafat \"an ageing and discredited leader\" of a \"corrupt and stupidly oppressive regime\", and Hosni Mubarak an \"isolated and unpopular Arab chief... compelled humiliatingly to toe the American line\". When a respected academic such as Mr Said resorts to inflammatory vilification, attacking people because they are overweight and old, he discredits his own argument, and lets down the Palestinians, for whom he has acted as a spokesperson. He certainly would not make it easy for Mr Oz to persuade his fellow Israelis to put away their guns and begin delicate negotiations. <br> <b>Fred Lowe</b><br> Dublin </p> <p>\u0095 Do I detect double standards in the media's reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

  "Given what we now know about J Edgar Hoover's private life and proclivities, to turn up in FBI files might be a testimony to moral fitness rather than the opposite. Pandering to the boss's prurience, agents detailed to keep an eye on the bouncing Czech wondered why Robert Maxwell was keeping his (female) staff up late. Evidently disappointed, they concluded it was only to get more work out of them. <p>So Maxwell was no threat to the American way of life. Minor self-reinvention (claiming to come from Scotland rather than central Europe) was and remains the American way. What these releases from Washington show, in spite of their deadpan style, is how much larger than life Maxwell was, how energetic - he did not just aspire to be prime minister but to write the antidote to Das Kapital. That \"pathological ambition\" recorded by an FBI informant makes it easier to explain how he managed to steamroller his way through so many industries and reputations, let alone pension funds. </p> <p>The bureau disclosed reports on Maxwell to third parties, which was probably illegal. Unscrupulous he was (at that stage in his career - worse followed) but he doubtless shared an interest in making a fast buck with many members of the American College of Physicians which was being warned against him. </p> <p>The files, in other words, say as much about Hoover's FBI as about the would-be political and intellectual hero it was investigating. But does the release of the files impede the bureau's present-day law enforcement activities? Of course not. We know Maxwell had extensive dealings with the Secret Intelligence Service, MI6; it may even have \"invented\" him. His Security Service file must be pretty thick too. When the Americans can be as free with information as they are, there can be no UK national interest in retaining files here. The Blair government's constipated passage of freedom of information legislation will do little to help.</p>",
  "Why is Myra Hindley still in prison? For one simple reason: because politicians have been left in charge of her release. Successive home secretaries have refused to take on the tabloids, who have turned her into a focal point of evil. She also provides a useful foil. The last three home secretaries - Straw, Howard and Waddington - have sought to bolster their \"tough\" images with declarations that Hindley would spend the rest of her life behind bars. Mr Straw leaked his reaffirmation of this decision in 1997, as a cover for a liberal move under which several thousand short-term prisoners were offered early release through electronic tags. Now the lord chief justice, in an interview in this week's New Statesman, has reaffirmed his view that under the new Human Rights Act, home secretaries are likely to lose their power to decide how long murderers serve in prison. Good for him. <p>There is a proper role for politicians in sentencing, which includes establishing a proper legal framework and broad policy. But in a democracy, they should play no part in determining sentence lengths of individuals. Mature democracies are supposed to have risen above such tinpot dictatorial procedures. Slowly, but inex orably, the home secretary's powers over the release of convicted killers has been cut back. The European Court of Human Rights has already ruled that once the two boys who killed James Bulger have served their \"tariff\" (the fixed term for retribution and deterrence), the final indeterminate period which depends on risks posed by the offenders can no longer be set by home secretaries. Earlier, home secretaries lost the power of release over discretionary lifers. But they still, for the moment, hold on to their power after a mandatory life sentence. Hindley's case is likely to be one of the first under the new Human Rights Act. </p> <p>No one would want to deny the gravity of Hindley's crimes, nor ignore her refusal over 20 years to accept culpability for all five children murdered. But all this is a long time ago. She has now served 35 years, more than twice the average life sentence. The lord chief justice at the time of her trial, no softie, only recommended 25 years. The parole board, which scrutinised her case minutely, has already recommended an open prison - a pre-step to release. All that is keeping her inside is public opinion. But justice systems, set up to be above lynch law, are expected to rise above public opinion.</p>",
  "A devastating, blow by blow account that leaves few people connected with the \u00a31bn Millennium Dome fiasco unscathed will be revealed by parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, next month. <p>The report describes how the misconceived project - already over budget before it opened - applied for four separate tranches of cash this year, totalling \u00a3179m, to avoid bankruptcy. </p> <p>The report records a story of how directors and senior staff of the New Millennium Experience Company lost control of the dome's finances, accepted without question over optimistic visitor projections, and had no clue of who owned what and how many contracts they had let. </p> <p>The only way disaster could have been avoided was if the dome had never been opened in the first place. </p> <p>The one year contracts signed before the end of last year were based on 12m visitors including 1m guests coming to the dome. </p> <p>The dramatic failure to predict accurately the correct number of visitors is the main reason the auditors give for the financial catastrophe that followed. </p> <p>The national audit office predicts that the final figure for visitors will be 4.5m, including cut price tickets and 1m guests. </p> <p>As a result of the shortfall in visitors, money was haemorrhaging from the dome each month, the report points out. </p> <p>The auditors blame the original directors of the company, who include Michael Grade, Channel 4's former chief executive, Sir Brian Jenkins, chairman of the Woolwich Bank, and Bob Ayling, former chief executive of British Airways, for not taking a grip on the project. </p> <p>They also reveal that the nine millennium commissioners initially failed to question the visitor projections until things started going wrong. </p> <p>The first alarm bell rang when the dome company took up a \u00a350m tranche held in reserve. </p> <p>The second came in February - only two months after the dome had opened - when the company won a \"final\" \u00a360m to tide it over. </p> <p>The money was handed over only after the millennium commission sent its own finance officers into the com pany to check the facts. They came back saying the cash was essential. The dome immediately gobbled up \u00a330m to stave off debts - and then drew on the remaining \u00a330m over the next two months. </p> <p>By May there was a demand for another \u00a338.4m. This time the commission's director, Mike O' Connor, refused to sign the cheque. </p> <p>Accountants Deloitte and Touche had already been sent in to the dome, and uncovered more financial disasters. </p> <p>But Chris Smith, the culture secretary, and the nine commissioners agreed to give the dome another \u00a329m. </p> <p>Then in August the dome company demanded another \u00a343m as part of the deal to sell it as an going concern to the Japanese company, Nomura, at the end of the year. The money was granted on the grounds it would be returned after Nomura paid \u00a3105m to take over the dome. Then came the devastating report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountantcy firm, revealing the dome was technically insolvent and could not meet its bills. </p> <p>Nomura pulled out and the company's letter -put in the House of Lords library by the government - lists a catalogue of failings, all covered in the auditors' report. </p> <p>The final blow came last month when the commissioners had to overrule its own director for the second time in four months, after he refused to pay out another \u00a347m to keep the dome afloat and provide for the \"winding up\" process. Once again the money had to be paid by diktat.</p>",

  "Two hundred years ago, white hunters and traders in the United States believed that the best way to cheat native Americans was to get them drunk. <p>To this day, alcoholism is one of the main problems on the reservations. Now a fight is brewing over a historic decision by one tribe to ban alcohol sales on its reservation, a decision being challenged in the courts by the state's attorney general. </p> <p>The Yakama tribe in Toppenish, Washington state, has been deeply affected like almost every other tribe by alcoholism among its members. Three weeks ago, it decided to ban the sale of alcohol at the stores and taverns on its 2,000 sq mile ( 5,000 sq km) reservation: possibly the first time a \"wet\" reserve has voted to go dry. </p> <p>But the ban has prompted protests from some among the 20,000 non-Indians living in the three small towns on the reservation; they want to continue buying alcohol there. </p> <p>The dispute highlights the Indians' struggle to deal with the debilitating effects of alcohol - and the issue of just how much power they can wield inside what are supposedly autonomous areas. </p> <p>The attorney general of Washington state, Christine Gregoire, plans to sue the Yakama for trying to impose a local law that they have no authority to enforce. The Yakama claim that under the federal laws of the 1830s, intoxicants should not be sold on Indian land. </p> <p>Jack Fiander, a lawyer and tribal council member leading what he believes is the first attempt by a US tribe to ban liquor sales, said: \"It's symbolic when you enact something that excludes alcohol from the reservation. It's like you're casting it out.\" </p> <p>Mr Fiander cites statistics showing how much alcohol has damaged the tribe. Alcohol figures in twice the number of traffic accidents involving native Americans on the reservation as against the rest of the state. Mr Fiander has complained that many of the grocery stores are effectively liquor stores, taking around 80% of their profits from liquor. </p> <p>Ms Gregoire's office stresses that the state appreciates the Yakama's desire to deal with a serious problem, and is challenging only the tribe's methods. \"We're very understanding about the desire of the tribe to address the serious problems of alcohol,\" said a spokesman, adding that the action was being brought to find out if the Yakama had the right to impose the rules on non-Yakama. </p> <p>Indian Health Service data show that native Americans are three times more likely than other Americans to die of cirrhosis of the liver. Between 5% and 25% of their babies are likely to be born with mental or physical damage because the mothers are alcoholic. The average national rate is 0.2%. </p> <p>Michael Dorris, in his study of foetal alcohol syndrome entitled The Broken Cord, wrote: \"Tribe after tribe learned... how to drink from Europeans whose bad manners, determination to get drunk and lack of restraint were notorious.\" </p> <p>Mr Dorris argued that, over time, Indian communities incorporated this \"trapper style\". </p> <p>In Killing the White Man's Indian, Fergus Bordewich wrote: \"White traders well knew that a drunk Indian was easier to exploit than a sober one, and many an Indian was tricked out of the fruits of his hunt when he was offered a 'free dram'. \" </p> <p>Now the courts will have to decide if there was ever really such a thing as a free dram.</p>",
  "Ten years' longing for a plot in which to realise my wildest gardening dreams finally came to an end late last summer when, spurred on by impending parenthood, my girlfriend Kirsten and I put an end to procrastination and moved from south London to a country cottage in East Sussex. <p>Along with the house-swap came the chance to relinquish my urban \"estate\" of two tatty window boxes and to embrace the challenge of a partially overgrown, empty and unkempt 15m x 45m rural plot. Our virgin ground, which runs alongside a lane, comprised a large, spring-fed pond at its far end, the ruins of an outbuilding and the cottage itself. A decent size, but without being too big. I was excited as to what wonders we might perform here. </p> <p>However, on my first midwinter stroll outdoors to contemplate creative wizardry and put my name in the gardening halls of fame, I became rapidly confused - the possibilities seemed so endless. All manner of ideas flared up - terraces with romantic topiary, ornamental parterres, surreal sculptures made from recycled objects - and all of them well beyond both budget and feasibility. </p> <p>With a mind full of mirages, I was getting nowhere fast and frustration was mounting, so I retreated indoors for a week or so and glared at the garden - while it glared back at me. When this standoff began to ease, I tried again, but this time with a more measured approach. With our lofty ambitions of aesthetic conquest now laid aside, we surveyed the garden afresh and began making decisions based on common sense and practicality.</p> <p> We looked at each individual area, and started to devise down-to-earth solutions that were led by the garden, rather than imposed on it. Behind the picket fence between the house and the lane, you would expect to find a typical cottage garden - all show for passers-by. Going with this theme, we decided to distil its essence into a random collection of tall herbaceous perennials: a phallic flowering frenzy. </p> <p>Over a period of a month or so, we hoarded pink and purple foxgloves, blue and yellow lupins, electric blue delphiniums, apricot foxtail lilies, red-hot pokers, burgundy pentstemons and yellow asphodelines. When we had amassed enough to pack the bed - about six plants per square metre - we laid them out and moved them around until the right combination of colourful chaos seemed most likely. And into the warming, rich, moist soil they went, hidden like dormant secrets that the coming seasons would reveal to us. </p> <p>The large pond, meanwhile, was suffering from severe clogging by a rampant South American aquatic plant, Myriophyllum aquaticum, or 'Parrot's Feather'. This is one of many risky alien species that, if left unchecked, will rapidly outgrow all native aquatic plants and fill a pond with a massed tangle of growth - overpowering not only other plants but any fish and amphibians as well. </p> <p>The only remedy in such a situation is to don waders and get physical - in my case to the tune of several hundredweight of stinking stems that I dredged from dark waters. We brought with us one item of furniture - a huge seat, nicknamed The Giant's Rest - built out of recycled timbers and rope to outsized proportions: 10ft long, with a seat high enough from the ground for even the tallest adult's feet to dangle. But where to put it in this plot with barely any open spaces? The garden itself presented us with a perfect site, backing on to a hedge between a large maple tree and a small flowering cherry - the seat nestled between the two trunks almost made to measure with inches to spare. To help integrate such a large structure with the rest of the garden, I enclosed the seat between two curving beds and planted ferns, hellebores, epimediums and Liriope muscari in its shady protection. </p> <p>We flanked it with pots of large-leaved hostas and zantedeschias to further enhance its surreal sense of scale. A rayed semicircle of slate slabs inter-planted with aromatic Corsican mint that I laid at its feet as a take-off and landing point made a decorative link with the seat's westward-facing, sunset orientation. We decided to leave a large grassy bank, bristling with nettles, between the pond and the outbuilding as a reminder of the garden's former wildness, as well as to provide a source of nettles for tea and soup, and, not least, a habitat for wildlife and insects, particularly butterflies. </p> <p>However, on the other side of this ruin, behind the house, was a spot that begged to be cultivated. Here, a 12m x 9m raised section of grass took advantage of most of the day's sun, as well as benefiting from the south-facing wall of the ruin - a perfect enclosure for an ornamental vegetable garden. </p> <p>To make up for poor, rubble-filled soil we created a patterned layout of raised beds from 15cm-wide tanalised boards with curves around a central circle formed from upended and buried bottles. We back-filled the beds with rotted manure, spent mushroom compost and topsoil to provide an instant fertile medium in which our seeds, tubers and plantlets (all ordered from the Organic Gardening Catalogue) could thrive. </p> <p>As spring progressed and all areas started to fill with foliage, our appetite for new plants continued and overflowed into 50 or so terracotta and black plastic pots - terracotta for herbs, dahlias etc; plastic tree and shrub containers for potatoes, courgettes and sunflowers. We bartered sturdy plastic fish-boxes from a fisherman and planted them with tomatoes and runner beans that soon clothed the walls in foliage. We watched as first flowers and then fruits started to appear. </p> <p>With the onset of such delights came a run-in with the local slugs that saw me become a ruthless executioner of these slimy devourers - dashing them against the paths for the birds. Luckily, I got at the aphids, too, and took perverse pleasure in rubbing them into a green mash between my fingers. </p> <p>As our first summer in the garden fades into the distance, the early days of wrangling with lofty and unsuitable ideas seem a long way away. Having arrived with a desire to conquer and impose - to show this garden a thing or two - I have learned the value of accepting the will of a raggedy plot that really only needs its surface scratched to perform wonders. </p> <p>The front garden has dazzled since spring, and is still standing firm with Verbena bonariensis (to the delight of a hummingbird hawkmoth), heleniums, asphodelines and cosmos. Our vegetable garden has yielded enough turnips, onions, garlic, chard, lettuce, carrots, etc, for us to cancel our weekly delivery of organic veg, and we are contemplating making chutneys and pickles to deal with our surplus of tomatoes and beetroot. </p> <p>The pond has space enough for the lily pads to spread, concealing a nest of moorhens, while 40-plus fish can now breathe and feed again - with just enough Parrot's Feather left (and kept in check) to help out. And the Giant's Rest is regularly crowded with the family (plus dogs) at sunset, where we plan additions and alterations for next year - with the garden's permission, of course</p> <p>\u0095 For a copy of the Organic Gardening Catalogue, call Chase Organics on 01932 253666.</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday night, Johnny's Recovery Room, a down-at-heel bar on Harlem's main drag, had been marinating in Motown and malt whisky. A woman who had been staring into space for at least half an hour had fallen off her perch on a bar stool only minutes after Gloria Gaynor had finished I Will Survive. She landed with a thud, remained there for a short while before being picked up and offered another drink. Minutes later an equally drunk man had danced out to Midnight Train To Georgia and cheers from the bar. </p> <p>But now, on 125th Street in the cold light of Sunday morning, the last partygoers are outnumbered by churchgoers. Saints and sinners pass each other as though in different worlds. The faithful, suited, booted and ready to pray, walk purposefully clutching Bibles in small suitcases, while the feckless, in last night's gladrags, sit on stoops holding cans of beer and bottles of whiskey in brown paper bags, watching the coaches go by. </p> <p>Large, plush, air conditioned vehicles are cruising Upper Manhattan with eager cargoes of tourists. Japanese, Germans, Koreans, British and even some Americans are now regular features in Harlem's Sunday landscape and cast a curious, slightly nervous, eye over the drunks who cast an ambivalent, slightly mocking, eye back. Later the tourists head for one of a select group of churches - to watch rather than worship - and then on to Sylvia's for soul food and a story to tell the folks back home. </p> <p>\"Harlem wears to the casual observer a casual face,\" wrote James Baldwin, who was born there. \"No one remarks that - considering the history of black men and women and the legends that have sprung up about them, to say nothing of the ever-present policemen, wary on the street corners - the face is, indeed, somewhat excessively casual and may not be as open or as careless as it seems.\" </p> <p>His essay, Harlem Ghetto, was written in 1948 but is as pertinent now as it has ever been. For surrounding the church-day nonchalance are signs of fundamental change. Some, like the Gap billboard, the Starbucks coffee shop and the scaffolding around the Abyssinian Baptist church are comparatively subtle. Others, like the Harlem USA shopping mall, the new buildings and the huge HMV store, are not. All are indications of the economic development pouring into the area over the past five years, a combination of government money and corporate investment that is changing the texture of life here not just commercially but culturally. </p> <p>To some this marks the second Harlem renaissance, mirroring the area's heyday early in the last century, when it was home to a new wave of African-American literature, art and music that exuded confidence and originality. It presents another opportunity to emerge from a public perception of urban decay and deprivation. \"We are only minutes away from some of the most expensive real estate in the world, yet there are still buildings in Harlem that remain vacant,\" says Darren Walker, chief operating officer of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, a non-profit organisation, affiliated to Harlem's biggest church. \"Rebuilding and filling them makes us a more attractive neighbourhood.\" To others the change represents a threat to spiritual integrity - gentrification that will drive out the poor and destroy all that has made Harlem aesthetically distinctive. \"It's a corporate takeover,\" says Leon Griffith, who works in Record Shack, a music shop. \"It's all about money. It has always been a place of hustle and now they just want us to look like downtown Manhattan.\" </p> <p>What is at stake is far more than the fate of a small patch of real estate: it is the historical legacy that earned Harlem the title of the \"Negro capital of the world\", the urban backdrop for great dramas of the American 20th century; where Malcolm X was assassinated, Marcus Garvey marched, reds and blacks rioted, and everyone from Cab Calloway to James Brown performed. This is the place that inspired some of America's finest cultural moments, driving Langston Hughes to poetry, Zora Neale Hurston to prose, and Sarah Vaughan to song. </p> <p>Harlem is no stranger to change. It was settled by Dutch immigrants in 1658, and by the 19th century had become a wealthy suburb for European immigrants, particularly the Irish, Italians and Jews. But as African-Americans left the rural poverty and racial oppression of the South and headed north in search of opportunity, a few mostly Jewish and black estate agents with empty buildings and an eye for a profit awaited them. Ralph Ellison's protagonist took that journey in his landmark novel, Invisible Man. In a few years just before the first world war, the racial complexion of Harlem was transformed. </p> <p>The impact on Harlem was huge, and the influence of black politics no less so. The move from country to city and field to factory, at a time of great social turmoil around the globe, inspired both activism and ideology. Revolutions in Ireland, Russia and Germany, and the radicalising effect of the war, forged a new consciousness whose often contradictory strands - internationalism, communism, anti-racism, pan-Africanism - were woven together. </p> <p>\"Hitherto it must be admitted that American Negroes have been a race more in name than in fact, or to be exact, more in sentiment than experience,\" wrote Alain Locke, a professor of philosophy at the historically black university of Howard in Washington DC. \"The chief bond ... has been that of a condition in common rather than a life in common. In Harlem, Negro life is seizing upon its first chances for group expression and self determination.\" </p> <p>This change in ideas and the activism it engendered gave rise to the \"New Negro\" - by self-definition an urban, more radical northern relative of a down-trodden southern cousin. Poverty and discrimination may still have been widespread, but now America's black urban population felt politically and culturally equipped to deal with it differently. </p> <p>The mood was articulated by poet Langston Hughes in 1926: \"We younger Negro artists ... intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too ... If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain, free within ourselves.\" The birthplace of this political and temporal construct, said Locke in 1925, was Harlem, which \"had the same role to play for the New Negro as Dublin has had for the New Ireland or Prague for the New Czechoslovakia.\" </p> <p>This burgeoning spirit of self-assurance and defiance found its expression in the Harlem Renaissance. Although the term is often used, and universally recognised, its definition has always been elusive. Its period roughly spans from the end of the first world war to the beginning of the depression. This was the era that saw the emergence of some of the greatest names in black American letters. </p> <p>Jean Toomer's Cane, a volume of poems and novella, marked the beginning of the literary renaissance. He had been raised in Louisiana and later abandoned writing for mysticism. Zora Neale Hurston, a flamboyant, spirited young woman from Florida, challenged the sexism and class-snobbery of the renaissance, who did not publish her most famous work, Their Eyes Were Watching God. until the late 1930s. She ended her life in poverty, dying in a Floridan welfare home, and was buried in an unmarked grave. </p> <p>Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, has since called her \"one of the greatest writers of our age\". Langston Hughes, \"poet laureate of the renaissance\", also wrote short stories and novels but made his greatest impact with a book of verse, The Weary Blues. Claude McKay, Jamaican-born, racially-militant, politically radical wrote Home To Harlem, the first black novel on the bestseller lists. He was the enfant terrible of the renaissance: he converted to Catholicism late in life and moved to Chicago to work in a school. </p> <p>There were renaissance artworks, too: the sculpture of Meta Warwick Fuller, the paintings of Aaron Douglas, Palmer Hayden and William Johnson; the documentary photography of James Van Der Zee and the photographic portraits of Carl van Vechten. </p> <p>The renaissance was literary and artistic, but it was backed by the impressive soundtrack of the golden age of jazz. Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton and James P Johnson were in their prime, Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson were innovating, applying orchestral discipline to their creativity. The jazz age coincided with the renaissance, but it was not part of it. Artists rarely passed up a chance to play in Harlem, but their geographical axis was further south and west, their following more working class. </p> <p>Even though the \"New Negros\" of the renaissance, led by writers and artists, proudly asserted their intellectual independence, they were mostly financially reliant on white patrons. Their talents had to catch the attention of white editors and publishers who introduced the work to the mainstream in books or literary magazines. Beyond that, Harlem was in vogue. Black people lived there, but fashionable white people longed to be seen there, enjoying the success vicariously. </p> <p>The geographical proximity of all these black stars gave social and artistic momentum to their work. \"In those days there were a great many parties in Harlem to which various members of the New Negro group were invited,\" wrote Hughes in his autobiography, The Big Sea. \"These parties, when given by important Harlemites were reported in full in the society pages of the Harlem press.\" </p> <p>It was a movement and a moment; a literary, artistic and musical expression rooted in a time and place which, because of the nature of that time and that place, flitted between the political and the cultural, the interests of the elite and the needs of the many. \"Nothing will do more to change the mental attitude and raise [the Negro's] status,\" claimed essayist James Weldon Johnson, \"than a demonstration of intellectual parity by the Negro through his production of literature and art.\" </p> <p>The renaissance ended when Wall Street crashed, and its many white patrons withdrew. \"That was really the end of the gay times of the New Negro era in Harlem,\" wrote Hughes. \"The white people had much less money to spend on themselves, and practically none to spend on Negroes, for the depression brought everybody down a peg or two. And the Negroes had but few pegs to fall.\" </p> <p>The renaissance stalled, and left behind the human, geographical and economic space that had given the renaissance its name. In the dire days of the 1930s, Harlem descended into urban decay and cultural desolation. As early as 1930, in a prophetical essay, Black Manhattan, James Weldon Johnson foresaw inevitable change of a nature that still resonates today. \"Will the Negroes of Harlem be able to hold it? Residents of Manhattan, regardless of race, have been driven out when they lay in the path of business and greatly increased land values. Harlem lies in the direction that path must take; so there is little probability that Negroes will always hold it as a residential section.\" </p> <p>At the corner of Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Boulevards there is a huge Disney store on one side and a Kentucky Fried Chicken on the other. The Audubon Ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated, the Cotton Club, where jazz heroes made their name, and the Harlem Opera House, have all been knocked down. A few blocks up you can see the brick imprint of what was the Teresa hotel, to which Fidel Castro famously decamped during a UN general assembly in 1960, claiming that he was being mistreated in Manhattan, and had more solidarity with the people of Harlem. </p> <p>The Apollo theatre, which once hosted Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith and Aretha Franklin, still stands, although control of it has now been turned over to Time Warner. James Brown made his name on amateur night there, and that night's blend of ruthlessness and playfulness - booing unpopular acts off stage to the accompaniment of a clown-like executioner - continues. So do the step shows and religiously-inspired soul performances. But most of those in the expensive seats are Japanese, Korean and German tourists, not local African-Americans. </p> <p>\"It's like we don't exist any more and those of us who do exist are constantly looking for money to survive,\" says Dr Barbara Ann Teer, founder of the National Black Theatre. \"We need to develop an understanding of what we have begun to call culturenomics. We need to create the kind of cultural expressions that we can sustain here economically. We have to develop a support system of our own.\" </p> <p>Harlem is still poor. It maintained a rich cultural life and varied economic existence through the 1950s and early 1960s, though the emergence of a monied black middle class meant that resources and talent left the area, which then become a byword for urban decay and crime. Tours have become popular, but tourism has yet to take off. Since the Teresa shut it no longer has a hotel, although there are plans to build one. The crime rate has plummeted, but unemployment remains high at 18%, four times the national average. </p> <p>Harlem will receive almost a billion dollars in public and private funds over the next four years. But Leon Griffith says the money that is coming in goes out again just as fast. Record Shack, which has become a local institution since it started in the 1960s, has been struggling after an HMV opened around the corner. \"They may bring jobs to the area, but at the same time they are destroying our businesses,\" he says. \"We can't compete with HMV. I live in Harlem. So the money that used to stay in the community is now leaving it and we are losing control.\" </p> <p>According to the president of the 125th Street business improvement district, Barbara Askins, only 35 to 40% of retail businesses on the main drag are minority-owned. As more corporate fast-food outlets open, small joints whose names are a taste of Harlem life - \"No Pork on my fork\" and \"Nuff Niceness\" - will be threatened. Rents are rising; many are moving to the Bronx and Queens. Barbara Ann Teer says: \"They are bringing in the corporations and they are employing the workers. But they are not paying the workers enough to live in Harlem.\" </p> <p>The coach tourists are received by some - but not all - with mixed bewilderment and contempt. \"Sometimes tourism here is handled like it's a jungle safari,\" says Lloyd Williams, president and CEO of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce: \"Like they're in the wild kingdom, looking at the animals running around.\" </p> <p>In this atmosphere only the very strong, very big, or very canny survive. Sylvia's soul food cafe has opened Also Sylvia's next door, to cater for the tourist trade. Its 38th anniversary was sponsored by Rupert Murdoch's local television franchise, Fox Five. ADC, the non-profit wing of the Abyssinian Baptist church, employs a small army of estate agents, financiers, developers and lawyers. They have helped build a supermarket, day care centre and two schools, but are currently working on a deal with Gap and a chain-restaurant, the International House of Pancakes. </p> <p>\"One of our goals is to ensure longterm sustainability and for this we need to have a balance,\" says Walker, of the ADC, who interrupts our conversation for an urgent call with his broker. \"There is enough opportunity to protect the interests of poor people and the rights of the indigenous community to remain here while allowing for some people to move in. There were lawyers, maids, doctors, bus drivers in the past, and we are striving to make it socio-economically diverse.\" </p> <p>True, much of Harlem's past has been mythologised. The first renaissance may have been culturally black-led, but it was \"white-owned\" economically, which caused tension, particularly between Hurston and her patron, who wanted her to concentrate on the exotic rather than the anthropological. There was always a significant white presence in the renaissance period, and it was always greeted with a degree of ambivalence. In 1927, author Rudolph Fisher wrote in an essay, The Caucasian Storms Harlem: \"It may be a season's whim, then, this sudden contagious interest in everything Negro. If so, when I go into a familiar cabaret, or the place where a familiar cabaret used to be, and find it transformed and relatively colorless, I may be observing just one form that season's whim has taken.\" </p> <p>The issue now is neither should Harlem be economically developed - it already is - nor whether such development would change the character of the area - it has already done so. The issue is more on what terms will change take place and who will benefit as a result? Weldon Johnson said in 1930: \"The next move ... will be unlike the others. It will not be a move made solely at the behest of someone else; it will be more in the nature of a bargain.\" Many in Harlem wonder now whether they are selling themselves short, or whether the price is too high.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to make any sort of progress in today's world, you have to know how to handle two things: a golf mallet and a fish knife. This is because the only time people talk to each other is when they're eating or playing golf. With golf, you can get away with continual swearing, but table manners are a sterner test. First, you should never start eating before anyone else, although it's worth making a quiet check on whether they actually ordered a starter. Once you get started, you will often have more cutlery in front of you than you have in your drawer at home. The polite thing to do is make sure you use every single implement on every course, even if it's soup. After you've used an implement, store it in the little jug marked with the flower. </p> <p>At some stage, the waiter may bring a bottle of wine for your approval. The correct thing to do is to check the alcohol content - if it's lower than 15%, send it straight back. Once you've checked the alcohol content, they will pour a tiny amount into your glass. This is sheer meanness on their part. You've paid for it, so insist on a full glass. You can then go ahead and taste the wine. Just remember that spitting it out is the right thing to do and the correct receptacle for this is the ice bucket by the table of the romantic couple sitting next to you. </p> <p>Napkin-folding is one of the cornerstones of western civilisation, and staff in a good restaurant should be able to transform a damask napkin into a fully functioning stegosaurus in less time than it takes you to find the right end of an asparagus spear. Waiting staff are always happy to demonstrate this skill, so wait until they've spread it across your lap and then say you preferred it in its mating-duck form. There is often some confusion between a napkin and a serviette, and getting it wrong is a clear signal that you are as common as dirt. The golden rule is that where there is an even number dining, napkins are serviettes, and vice versa. </p> <p>Certain foods have for years provided a litmus test for social skills. For example, asking for two fishfingers is tantamount to slapping your host in the face. Similarly, taking a mouthful of alphabet soup without a vowel is wretchedly common. The ultimate challenge, of course, is lobster, when you're given a bowl and a pair of nutcrackers. It takes years of practice to find the lobster's nuts and then get them into the bowl, but socially it pays huge dividends.</p>",
  "<p>I have always had a low opinion of my critics, but last weekend's shower, who decided that I was \"jealous\" of poor Paula Yates, left me cackling with glee. God, yes, how could I not have seen it all these years - forget Dorothy Parker in her prime or Ava Gardner at her peak: what I really, REALLY wanted all along was to be a suicidal, silicone-breasted, bleached-blonde, 40-year-old mother of four, adulterous spawn of Hughie Green and a Bluebell Girl, with a dead boyfriend, an even deader career and a habit of being sick into her handbag at public parties. What a deluded fool I've been. I'll try to rectify matters now that you've drawn it to my attention. Shall I start by cultivating a heroin habit, or by making myself unemployable? I'll reach that state of grace that is Pauladom by any means possible.</p> <p>A few days before, in this same newspaper, Charlotte Raven was accused of being \"jealous\" of Nigella Lawson simply for stating the obvious: that someone who spends so much time creating such an ostentatiously \"perfect\" life is obviously dealing with a good many demons. If anything, it was a new way of understanding and empathising with the Nigella Phenomenon, rather than writing her off as some sort of souped-up Proust'n'pashmina Stepford Wife. Apart from anything else, our combined critics are using the wrong word - they mean \"envious\". If we were \"jealous\" of Paula and Nigella, it would mean we coveted them sexually. And who'd dare say such a thing of such flagrantly heterosexual gals as Miss Raven and myself?</p> <p>I've noticed for a while now that when men criticise other men, not even the most immature observer will turn round and lisp, \"Oooh, you're jealous, Tom Bower - you're jealous of Richard Branson cos he's such a dish! And as for you, Michael Crick, stop being jealous of Jeffrey Archer, because he's such a better writer than you!\" When a woman criticises another, however, the geek chorus is always on hand to prolong the myth that the only reason one woman could find another not to her taste would be because she envied her. It's a pathetic point of view, and one more suitable for readers of the Daily Star, frankly.</p> <p>I don't think women are generally envious of other women. If they were, Jennifer Lopez wouldn't invariably be voted most beautiful woman in the world by other women. If we were uniformly green-eyed bitches, wouldn't we choose someone a bit more mundane, such as Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock? The antipathy to Big Brother's Melanie was read by some social critics as female antipathy to attractive women, but women despised Mel for one reason and one reason only - she was, personality-wise, a truly amazing combination of man-pleaser and control-freak, a hard double-punch to pull off, but one of spectacular awfulness when achieved. What sort of woman goes around letting men snog her, and then saying, \"You really shouldn't have done that\", as though she was somewhere else at the time? Surely this is no way for a grown-up female to conduct herself - but then, Mel was rather odd, in that she was a 28-year-old woman who dressed like a teenager and lived with her mother.</p> <p>Besides, Mel was never beautiful - she was \"attractive\", a thin gruel when placed beside actual beauty, Claire the Florist. And didn't Mel herself realise this, to judge by her hostile body language when the luscious giggler first bounced through the door of the Big Brother house! In my experience, it's your \"attractive\" women who can be most obsessed with the pecking order, as Mel proved. Beautiful girls and plain girls have pretty much sorted where they stand by the time they're 18, and cut their cloth accordingly, but the merely attractive girl spends her life feeling superior to the plain ones and inferior to the beautiful ones, and it can make her a bit of a bitch. Mind you, I don't say that disapprovingly - a touch of bitchiness can be the finishing touch in a woman, rendering pleasingly tart what might otherwise be wishy-washily bland.</p> <p>Reading Patrick Jephson's \"expos*\" of Diana, I could not believe the way some of the broadsheet harpies picked up on her tendency to swear, have affairs and laugh at dirty jokes as proof of her basic worthlessness. If we applied this strict no-sex-we're-saints criteria to men, everyone from Gandhi to Geldof would be out of the running as any sort of of hero. My favourite Diana moment has to be that much tutted-over time when she crept up behind the Legge-Bourke woman and whispered silkily, \"So sorry about the baby!\" Frankly, if someone has a double-barrelled name and thinks that being accused of having an abortion is anything to get upset about, they deserve what they get.</p> <p>Here, unusually, I think we did see in Diana's critics a touch of genuine girl-on-girl envy, albeit by a bunch of women who are motivated by a bourgeois form of class envy - \"If Charles had chosen me, little Lesley from Cheam, I'd have been a much better princess than that stuck-up bitch!\" - as much as anything. So, generally, women are not jealous of each other: how could the fashion rags sell as well if they were? Women don't buy them to look at the dreadful clothes, but rather to look at the beautiful models. Men are more envious of beautiful women than women are - envious generally, as well as jealous specifically, of any they may personally be in love with. This one's thick, that one's a gold-digger, the other one's a 'ho. When Eminem disses Christina Aguilera in that lisping little voice, say, I can't help but think of a drag queen made bitter by a real woman's breasts. And how do you explain the far greater ratio of male-to-female sex changes than female-to-male ones? Venus envy.</p> <p>You can't blame men for envying women; I just wish they'd be more honest about it, instead of covering it up with macho and strut. It's only natural to like us more. For instance, off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen women who are so pretty that they make me want to stand up and cheer whenever I see a photo of them - Mariella Frostrup, Tamzin Outhwaite, Martine McCutcheon, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Natalie (though not Nicole) Appleton, Tyra Banks, Kylie (still), Kate Moss, Frankie Rayder, Amanda Burton and Emmanuelle B*art - but I'd have to think long and hard before I could compile a list of men who make me feel the same way. Yet I think I know enough about myself by now to know that I am at least 95% heterosexual. This is why lesbianism makes so much more sense than male homosexuality. I find it far easier to appreciate the way that the loathsome Peter Stringfellow feels about women than I can understand the way the glorious George Michael feels about men. To be crude about it, you could call it the Scrotum Factor. I mean, who the hell can look at a scrotum and think, \"Wow!\"?</p>",
  "Two million Brits aged 10 to 16 work part-time - two out of five children aged 10 or over and two out of three over-15s hold part-time jobs. Yet an estimated two-thirds of children who work are doing so illegally and many others are ripped off by miserly employers who give less than the average rates of pay for jobs typically done by youngsters, according to new research from Abbey National. <p>The average weekly pay for 10 to 16-year-olds is \u00a314.03. Girls earn an average \u00a32.75 per hour and boys \u00a31.93, largely because girls are more likely to do shop work which tends to be more highly paid, though in general girls are less likely to work than boys. </p> <p>One in three schoolchildren who work have more than one job. Half of all children who work have delivery jobs while almost one in five works in a shop. Part-time jobs as cinema ushers, paying an average \u00a35 per hour, and as supermarket checkout operators at \u00a34.50 an hour, tend to be the best-paid positions to go for. Among the worst-paid are paperboys or girls, who earn \u00a37 a week, and chip shop assistants, who make just \u00a31.20 an hour, according to Abbey National. </p> <p>The national minimum wage does not apply to people under 18 and so pay tends to depend on local rates for the type of work, or on what can be negotiated with the employer. Some of the larger national companies make no distinction between under-18s and other part-time workers, nor do they differentiate between areas, although many pay extra if the job is in London. </p> <p>Most young people don't have to pay income tax on their wages because their total annual income does not exceed the personal tax allowance - \u00a34,385 for the tax year 2000-2001. And they will not be liable to pay National Insurance until they are 16; even then they must earn more than \u00a376 a week before they will have to pay. </p> <p>Many perks such as paid holiday and sick pay are not available to young people. Someone under school-leaving age (by law, a child ceases to be of compulsory school age on the last Friday in June in the school year in which they reach the age of 16) doesn't have a right to paid holidays, but are expected to take two weeks' break a year during a school holiday. </p> <p>Those aged 16 to 18 are slightly better off in being entitled to paid holiday pro rata, according to how often they work. So, for example, if ordinary workers get four weeks paid holiday, a Saturday worker should get four days paid holiday per year. </p> <p>Some types of job can bring extra perks which, if they are not offered, are always worth requesting. Someone working in a shop might ask for a discount on the products, for example, while people working in catering might ask for a share of tips and free meals. </p> <p>Of the high proportion of children working illegally, a quarter are under the minimum age, almost one in five starts work before 7am on a weekday and one in five works after 7pm in the evening, says Abbey National, which has published a free guide to make parents aware of their children's rights at work and how to protect them. </p> <p>Though children are obviously being exploited in such situations, parents can at least rest assured that it is the employer, not the child, who is breaking the law. </p> <p>The minimum age to start paid work is 14, though in some areas local authority by-laws allow 13-year-olds to do certain jobs such as delivering newspapers, serving in shops, working in hairdressing salons, offices, cafes and riding stables. Parents of 13-year-olds should check with their local council about what type of work is permitted. </p> <p>Once a young person reaches school-leaving age, there are very few restrictions on what they can do, although generally speaking, they must be over 18 to work in a bar. </p> <p>The law says that people of school age should only do \"light work\" and local authority by-laws may list certain jobs considered unsuitable for young people, such as working in commercial kitchens, nightclubs, betting shops and in businesses involved in selling door-to-door. </p> <p>Other jobs outlawed for under-16s include working in dangerous industries such as demolition, building, transport or manufacturing. </p> <p>\u0095 For a free copy of Abbey National's The Easy Guide to Your Kids' Rights at Work call 0800-917-6759.</p>",
  "<p>The conductor Bernard Haitink is praised for many things, but his ability as an orator is not high on the list. While his reputation as a taciturn and somewhat introvert figure is slightly overplayed, it is nevertheless true that he has never been given to the grand dramatic gestures often favoured by other leaders of his profession. But despite this reticence, perhaps the few words he said two years ago to a packed Royal Albert Hall following a performance of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, the final part of Wagner's Ring cycle, might be his longest lasting legacy to musical life in this country. </p> <p>The opera house at Covent Garden was closed for redevelopment and the company was homeless. The financial and political chaos had progressed from tragedy to farce and back again and it was seriously being suggested that the orchestra and chorus should be disbanded. Haitink offered his resignation on the reasonable grounds that there was little point in being music director if there was no music. </p> <p>\"The orchestra were extremely frightened and they asked John Tomlinson, who was singing Wotan, to say a few words,\" Haitink recalls. \"John thought about it and said no. He said let the music speak and I agreed with him.\" The phrase could have been made for Haitink but five and a half hours later, as much to his surprise as to everyone else's, he found himself walking towards the front of the stage. \"We are always accused of being elitist but there were 6,000 people there and it was quite an event. It felt the right moment so I said a few words. It was totally improvised and I can't even remember what they were now, but it seemed to help.\" </p> <p>Haitink urged the crowd to write to the department of culture in support of the orchestra and, as is sometimes the quirky way with British democracy, the next day the department was on the phone to him seeking a meeting. Assurances were made, his resignation was withdrawn and when the new Covent Garden chief executive, Michael Kaiser, joined a month later Haitink's position was confirmed. </p> <p>\"I knew it was crucial for Bernard to be here,\" says Kaiser. \"He is an important leader both artistically and spiritually. He is the conscience of the house and it would be no way to start by letting your conscience leave in the first week.\" Kaiser ensured the orchestra's future was made secure and Haitink committed himself to the house until 2002. </p> <p>It was a huge achievement and a graphic illustration of Haitink's commitment to music-making in Britain. He began in his native Holland, but since the mid-60s, first with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and now at the Royal Opera, he has been a linchpin of musical life in this country, and was awarded the KBE for services to music as far back as 1977. </p> <p>This evening Haitink conducts his first Tristan und Isolde at Covent Garden. The opera is a key challenge for any great conductor and it is something his admirers have long wanted him to do. Over the past 15 years there have been several false starts, but this production will mark the beginning of a long goodbye from Covent Garden. When it is revived in 2002 it will be the last thing he conducts there as music director. As such, the piece neatly frames his career. The first operatic work he conducted in Holland in 1957 was its Prelude and Liebestod. </p> <p>In that time, Haitink's reputation as a supreme exponent of Wagner has soared. Following Lohengrin and Parsifal, an initial stab at the four-opera Ring cycle was aborted in 1988. He eventually completed it in 1991, albeit in a production he was obviously not happy with. Jeremy Isaacs was general director of Covent Garden when it was staged. \"Bernard is a very honest man and therefore couldn't conceal what he felt about aspects of the production,\" says Isaacs. \"But he is also very loyal. And while he made his points about aircraft and battered saloon cars on stage, the music-making was wonderful. That said, I'm sure he enjoyed it more at the Albert Hall without any staging.\" </p> <p>Haitink had no such reservations about his Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg, first produced in 1993 and regularly revived ever since. It has been acclaimed as one the best Covent Garden productions since the war. Thomas Allen sang Beckmesser. \"It is head and shoulders the most exciting thing I've done in my career,\" he says. \"And so much of that is down to Bernard. It is not just Everest in front of you but the whole of the Himalayas. That Bernard exercises such control is just extraordinary.\" </p> <p>Haitink says he takes the Birgit Nilsson line on what is needed to take on Wagner - \"comfortable shoes\" - but more seriously he expresses some disquiet about performing the work. \"I am not a Wagner fanatic,\" he explains. \"He was an incredible man of the theatre but he will always be controversial. His work has great appeal to audiences, especially in German-speaking countries. He is regarded as their composer, which can be frightening.\" </p> <p>That Haitink should be so aware of these issues is unsurprising. He was born in Amsterdam in 1929 and his formative years were lived under the Nazi occupation. \"Of course it has marked my life. Strangely, in the second half of my life I have been more aware of what went on than I was even at the time. I was very young and many things passed me by. My family didn't suffer too much, but I had many friends who disappeared.\" </p> <p>In fact he, his parents and his elder brother and sister were extremely fortunate to have survived the war, considering that his mother, Anna, was half Jewish. She worked for the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise - the international French cultural institution - while his father, Willem, was a civil servant who eventually became a director of the Dutch electricity board. Willem Haitink was for a time held in a concentration camp in reprisal for the bombing of a National Socialist bookshop. </p> <p>\"They took 100 hostages and my father was one of them,\" Bernard recalls. \"He just disappeared and we didn't know what had happened to him for four weeks. Then we got a letter saying he was in a concentration camp.\" Haitink remembers the letter asking if young Bernard had received a score of Beethoven's Fidelio. \"We had never discussed any score but it was his code for saying that he was in the same situation as the prisoners in Fidelio.\" When he was released after three and a half months - \"on the mercy of the F\u00fchrer\" - he was so thin his son didn't recognise him. </p> <p>\"But for me the really worst memories were the days of the liberation,\" he continues. \"The confusion of hate and joy in the population made it like the Wild West. People did what they wanted and there was a great deal of revenge. All that sticks in the memory. Today, sitting comfortably in my chair drinking a glass of wine, I refuse to look at films or pictures of the Holocaust on television. I think that is awful and wrong. But while we must never forget these things, maybe we should now look forward. We can never experience what these people experienced, but perhaps there is also a danger that one wallows in the past.\" </p> <p>While he says all this made his approach to Wagner both late and problematic, from the outset he had a \"huge thirst\" for music, despite a \"very primitive\" music education. He took up the violin and virtually lived at the concert hall where he saw great conductors like Bruno Walter, Erich Kleiber and Otto Klemperer conduct. After leaving school he won a place at the Amsterdam conservatoire - despite misgivings, because his Jewish friends were excluded - but describes wanting to be a conductor as a \"very strange urge, as I didn't have the tools for it\". He ruefully adds that he eventually achieved his goal through a matter of luck and opportunity. </p> <p>\"I have a strange theory. If I had not lived through those awful times when so many talents were murdered - I'm not only thinking of the Jewish community but people killed at the front as well - there would have been many more available talents and I would not have become a conductor. When you start to think about it, it becomes a bit frightening. Why me? Why not they who were murdered?\" </p> <p>So is his current huge workload an attempt to ensure that he does not waste the opportunity he has been given? \"It is because I was a lazy pig then. When I think of my school years I am ashamed. I wasn't stupid but I just wasn't there. Half the time we were taught under our desks because of air raids. But even when things became normal I wasn't interested. Maybe this is why now, when I am over 70, that people always ask me why I work so hard. I have to make up for my lazy days.\" He says it is ironic that he read a lot of German literature during this period because he had a good German teacher. \"I also had a wonderful French teacher but after a year she was removed because she was Jewish.\" </p> <p>When he was 25 he won a place on the Netherlands radio station conductors' course, but it was deferred for a year and he was instructed to play violin with a radio orchestra. He is dismissive of his talents as a violinist and has said that if he hadn't become a conductor he would have ended up on the back desk of second violins in a small provincial orchestra. \"But I am very grateful for that year. It is important for a conductor to be within an orchestra and it helped me a lot.\" </p> <p>Bob St John Wright is chairman of the London Philharmonic Orchestra and played under Haitink when he was music director there in the 70s. He says, \"He is the ideal orchestral player's conductor. He understands the mentality of an orchestra and the potential tediousness of it. He understands because someone has done it to him and he is tuned in psychologically and emotionally into how a player thinks.\" </p> <p>Haitink was initially awarded a contract to conduct four radio concerts in Holland. His big break came in 1956 when Carlo Maria Giulini cancelled an appearance with the Concertgebouw orchestra in Amsterdam and Haitink replaced him for Cherubini's requiem. \"Once people think you are a talent then you are in their hands. But at that time I was a sleepwalker. I was told to do things and I did them. While I'm not a sleepwalker any more, I never was a chess player in respect of planning my career.\" </p> <p>The next elevation came in 1961 when the respected principal conductor of the Concertgebouw, Eduard van Beinum, died and Haitink was asked to take over, first jointly with another conductor and three years later on his own. He held the post until 1988. \"I was far too young,\" he says. \"It was terrible for myself and must have been bad for the orchestra because I really wasn't that great. But I had been noted down as a talent and at that time there were very few young conductors in Holland so I had to become that talent. It took a long time and I struggled, but I did survive.\" </p> <p>Haitink developed the orchestra's traditional expertise in Bruckner, Beethoven and Mahler, and extended the repertoire with much contemporary music, including a great deal of work by 20th-century Dutch composers. He describes himself as a strange combination of extreme insecurity and inner toughness. He says if a rehearsal ever goes badly, for whatever reason, he has a dogged stubbornness to correct it. \"I think that stub bornness saved the day for me. There are some things I would do differently in my career, but I would never become a dictator.\" </p> <p>Watching him conduct a rehearsal of Tristan at Covent Garden illustrates his collaborative approach. As the overwhelmingly luscious opening chords of the opera emerge - heard only by the mid-morning cleaning shift - so a black polo-shirted Haitink begins to work with his orchestra. He follows up many of his notes to the players with conciliatory asides - \"I hope you agree\", \"not much different I know\". He is also gently humorous. \"Come on, come on,\" he smilingly urges a violinist. \"You have a crescendo there, don't be shy.\" Another violinist is asked for a note to be \"more velvety. Like you are stroking a cat - unless you are allergic to cats\". </p> <p>Rien de Reede has been principal flute at the Concertgebouw since 1972. He says Haitink was never obsessed by absolute instrumental perfection, but more concerned with, \"the value behind the notes and the essence of the composition\". It has been said that while someone like, say, Herbert von Karajan would give you Karajan's Beethoven, Haitink would always strive to give you Beethoven's Beethoven. </p> <p>Haitink says that words are mostly peripheral to rehearsals. \"You can say all sorts of stupid things, but it is the music-making with your hands, with your face, with your musical personality, that is the important part. I always say to a young conductor that when you are at a performance you can't talk any more to the orchestra, you have to show them what you mean.\" </p> <p>Despite success in Amsterdam, for many years Haitink had a difficult relationship with sections of the musical establishment and the press in Holland. \"I was far too young when I took over and it took a long time to really take shape. I was always that young conductor who had so much luck, but now I am a bit above the fray.\" </p> <p>When he finally left the Concertgebouw in 1988 it was an acrimonious parting. His long-term ally, the highly respected artistic director Marius Flothius, had left in 1974. He was replaced by a former finance director of the orchestra, Hein van Royen, who reorganised sections against Haitink's wishes and made new recording arrangements. By the time Haitink resigned, just before the Concertgebouw's centenary season, their relationship had completely broken down. Only recently has the relationship been Haitink and the orchestra been re-established and he is now its honorary conductor. \"When he left, it was like when a marriage breaks up,\" says Rien de Reede. \"But now he is St Bernard in Holland. His 70th birthday was a big thing and when he comes back it is like when the Dutch swimmers at the Olympics come back with their gold medals.\" </p> <p>Haitink now says that his relationship with Holland is \"OK, although I don't live there any more. As long as I work in London I will live in London, but even if I wasn't working here I don't think I would go back to live in Holland.\" He still owns a family house by the sea there, but says it is exclusively occupied by his children. Haitink has five children from his first marriage to Marjolein Snijder and is now a grandfather. They first met at music school and married in 1956. She stayed in music as an accompanist to young singers. Haitink is fiercely protective of his families' privacy and has promised that he would never speak about any of them in either promotional material or in interviews. </p> <p>The marriage to Marjolein broke up in the late 70s. Haitink had two further comparatively short-lived marriages in the 80s and 90s, first to a cellist and then to a violinist from the Concertgebouw. He is now married to Patricia Bloomfield, who was a viola player at the Royal Opera before leaving to become a barrister. Thomas Allen is one observer who says Haitink has changed in recent years. \"It's as if he has come home within himself. He was actually always quite approachable professionally, but he doesn't let too many people close to him. Now he appears easier in his own skin and more relaxed. Pat has been very good for him.\" </p> <p>Patricia herself says that Haitink \"still has a tendency to worry about everything. That's the way he is.\" Together they are working on reducing his schedule to spend more time relaxing. He had emergency heart surgery in 1998 and, after a period of intense concern, found himself with an unexpected period freed from pressures: \"After the operation was something of a golden time.\" Haitink says he was nervous returning to work after three months. \"I was partly thinking that I should finish because I had been given a warning: I should have a simpler life. After the first rehearsal I called Patricia to pick me up and I told her I was very worried because I had started to like it again.\" </p> <p>They have a house in south-west France and another home in Switzerland where he enjoys walking and cycling. \"He loves to be on his bike, which he can't do much in London,\" Patricia explains. \"He says it is the only Dutch thing about him, but I'm not too sure.\" </p> <p>While Haitink was with the Concertgebouw he also became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra - \"to some people's annoyance in Holland\" - a post he held until 1979. He is also a guest conductor with the Vienna and Berlin philharmonic orchestras, principal guest conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and music director of the European Union Youth Orchestra. </p> <p>As his reputation grew in the 70s he was invited, somewhat unexpectedly, to Glyndebourne where the LPO was the resident orchestra. \"Even though he was comparatively inexperienced in opera, it was a great coup to get him,\" says Glyndebourne's George Christie. Haitink says he \"really had no idea what opera entailed. But I was asked back, despite some near disasters.\" He was made director of the festival in 1978. Thomas Allen sang in Haitink's first production there and remembers him as being \"jittery. He tends to be a worrier and if anything goes wrong he could sink into a dark Dutch mood. But the musical structure of the pieces was wonderful and he has since become much more of a theatre man.\" </p> <p>Haitink says Glyndebourne was \"very endearing, especially with the old house, although no-one misses it now. One of the main qualities was that you had time to rehearse. But you were more or less imprisoned in Sussex, which sometimes was nice and sometimes horrible.\" </p> <p>After his initial apprehensions about opera it was the 1976 production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress that convinced Haitink of the possibilities of the form. It was directed by John Cox and designed by David Hockney. \"It was a real breakthrough. For the first time I saw you could make real music in the pit in collaboration with the stage.\" It was Hockney's first opera. \"I felt my duty was to the music and I think Bernard sensed that,\" he says. \"Now I know that not all designers and directors are like that, but my number-one rule was 'don't fuck up the music'. It's not the job of a set designer to make an opera come alive. That's the job of the music.\" </p> <p>It seems slightly odd for Haitink, who appears to be instinctively democratic, to have worked for so long at institutions like Glyndebourne and Covent Garden, with their largely elite audiences. \"We always said that the best time at Glyndebourne was the preparation time before the first night and the arrival of the audience. But there was always a very knowledgeable core audience. They did appreciate the quality.\" He says that opera attracts all sorts, \"and not only the best sort. Especially nowadays with the whole corporate thing. Sometimes you wonder why they come\" </p> <p>He claims now to be a bit tired of the elitist tag at Covent Garden. \"Yes there are very expensive seats and that doesn't necessarily attract the right people, but there are also less expensive seats. But it is not all about seat prices: Covent Garden does extensive education work. I do wonder when I have finished how I will see the place.\" </p> <p>He was asked twice before he agreed to become music director, and will have stayed six years longer than he expected when he leaves in 2002. John Tooley was the general director who appointed him in 1988. \"He was not the obvious choice because he had limited operatic experience, but what we needed was a first-rate musician and a first-rate orchestra trainer. The orchestra was beginning to need the discipline that Bernard could bring and he has produced astonishing musical results.\" </p> <p>Jeremy Isaacs, with whom Haitink was said to have a cool relationship, also praises his generosity: \"He had the most benevolent attitude to other conductors and absolutely no selfishness. He even came and watched other leading conductors to see how they handled the orchestra. This is highly unusual and has been hugely beneficial to the house as a whole.\" </p> <p>In recent years it has seemed as if he could do no wrong, but earlier in his time at Covent Garden there was criticism, particularly of his handling of the Italian repertoire. George Christie at Glyndebourne says that he was never completely at home with Verdi. \"It is the best kind of roast beef; it is good and red and strong while at the same time it is tender. Bernard didn't seem to quite get it and it could all be a bit symphonic.\" After an ill-conceived production of Il Trovatore at Covent Garden he was actually booed - albeit by a tiny minority - when he came on stage at the end. </p> <p>Any doubts as to his theatrical abilities were killed off by the triumph of Meistersinger, and as the company slipped into its seemingly endless turmoil in the late 90s so Haitink's moral authority became an increasingly important beacon of hope. \"I always wanted to bring the company through these awful times as alive as possible.\" </p> <p>He says that during the closure mistakes were made as people started to panic. \"They were like rabbits i n front of a headlight. Someone then suggested blowing the whole thing up and starting from scratch. On paper that is a sensible idea if you are in industry, but music doesn't work that way.\" He says only experience enabled them to get through a chaotic opening night and initial season in the refurbished building. </p> <p>Haitink praises what Michael Kaiser has done at the house as \"a miracle. He has put the company on a healthy footing again\", and welcomes changes, such as the introduction of surtitles. \"When we were trying them out I could tell within minutes whether they were on or not. If no surtitles then death behind my back. Nothing. With surtitles people would react and that persuaded me. And let's face it, sometimes opera librettos are so idiotic people need a bit of help.\" </p> <p>When he finishes at Covent Garden it will by no means be the end of his career. He has contractual links with orchestras in Boston and Berlin. But first is Tristan. \"He is equipped to give the performance of his life,\" says Jeremy Isaacs. The bass Gwynne Howell, who has sung at Covent Garden for more than 25 years, agrees that Haitink has the scope to encompass this huge work. \"If you run a marathon before you're ready it is a nightmare,\" he says. \"But running it when you're prepared means you can relax a bit, accelerate when needed, be in control. It is still a huge challenge, but it is one he can meet.\" </p> <p>Patricia Haitink acknowledges the scale of the piece. \"He is frightened of it physically as well as artistically. Two conductors died doing it in the early days.\" It is an enormously demanding task to conduct an 80-strong orchestra for four and half hours - Haitink's score is the size of a breeze block. \"Bernard recently did the Prelude and Liebestod in a concert,\" continues Patricia. \"That's about 20 minutes of music, and at the end he said he was exhausted. One of his strong points is that he knows how to pace a performance. He knows where the top of the arc comes and that will help him physically.\" </p> <p>The two conductors Patricia referred to were Felix Mottl, one of Wagner's pupils and a great Wagner and Bruckner conductor, who died in Munich in 1911; and the great Joseph Keilberth, who also died in mid-performance in Munich in 1968. According to von Karajan, they both died in Act 3 - the act in which Tristan himself dies - and at approximately the same point in the score. </p> <p>Haitink hasn't yet decided whether to continue with opera after he leaves Covent Garden, despite his successor, Antonio Pappano, extending an invitation to return. \"There's no reason not to come back, but I don't know what my life will be like then. When you are in your 70s you start to think how long can you do it.\" </p> <p>He concedes that he is trying to get a little more philosophical - to accept that in life \"things come to an end. The most difficult things in my life are planning-meetings. I get glazed eyes when they give me a date in 2004. It is an awful thing in this profession that you have to plan so far ahead. At my age it is a bit cruel. But as long as I am mentally and physically able to conduct, I think I will want to do it.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Tristan und Isolde is at the Royal Opera from tonight, and on Radio 3 on November 9.</p> <p><strong> Life at a glance </strong></p> <p><strong>Bernard Johann Herman Haitink</strong> </p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> March 4 1929. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Amsterdam Conservatory; Netherlands Radio Union conductors' course. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1956 Marjolein Snijder, (three daughters, two sons);1994 Patricia Bloomfield. </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> violinist Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra 1954; conducto NRP and other orchestras in Holland 1955-61; joint conductor Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam 1961-64, principal conductor Concertgebouw 1964-88; principal conductor London Philharmonic Orchestra 1967-79; musical director Glyndebourne Opera 1978-88; music director Royal Opera House 1987-; director European Union Youth Orchestra 1994 - present; principal guest conductor Boston Symphony Orchestra 1995 - . </p> <p><strong> Honours:</strong> Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres 1972; Honorary KBE 1977.</p>",
  "<p>What are we to make of The Turn of the Screw nowadays? In an age when paedophiles are named and shamed, and vigilante action is both understandable and out of control, what do we do with a tale and an opera that take as their subject the remorseless staining of childhood innocence and the resultant destruction of life? Both book and opera depend to a certain extent on our not being told either what has gone on in the past or what is really happening in the present. </p> <p>In Henry James's novel, the ghostly figures whose sexual histories have possibly involved the children may be a projection of the governess's own disturbed erotic fantasies. Have Miles and Flora really been abused - or is the governess herself imputing to them inappropriate adult knowledge? James doesn't say. Benjamin Britten brings the ghosts on stage and thereby makes them real, but he draws a veil over past events, which remain both unspeakable and unspoken. </p> <p>Both works involve us in a conspiracy of silence. The genius of Elijah Moshinsky's shattering staging for Broomhill Opera is that he takes that very silence as his starting point, presenting us with a series of images at once blatant and horrific, and embroiling the adults in tacit complicity throughout. Its power derives from the shocking double-take Moshinsky forces on us - namely that the ghosts of Quint and Miss Jessel are very much molesters, while the governess is so trapped in her private world of Jamesian sexual horror that she in turn becomes an instrument of destruction. </p> <p>We first meet Alison Rae-Jones's astonishing incarnation of the main protagonist as she sweeps on stage to collide with the hunky academic type who has just sung the prologue. She fixes him with a stare at once sexual and terrified. En route to Bly, she crumples hysterically, wringing her hands and clutching her body as she recalls her frustrated fascination with her employer. On arrival, Miles greets her with un-childlike gallantry, bending over her hand to kiss it lingeringly. She recoils from him as from an unwanted lover, catastrophically oblivious to the fact that adulthood has been prematurely foisted on him. </p> <p>Bly itself is the beautiful, decrepit interior of Wilton's Music Hall, reflected in a massive revolving mirror. All here is not what it seems. In a brilliant stroke of casting, Moshinsky uses Carol Rowlands as Mrs Grose - a younger singer than usual. As she narrates her version of events at Bly, a shadow crosses her face, and we realise that she, like Miss Jessel, has also been sexually involved with Quint and that her own morality is tainted with lies. </p> <p>The ghosts, meanwhile, are terrifying phantasms. Quint - the tremendous American tenor Shawn Bartles - is stripped to the waist, his body monstrously tattooed. Miss Jessel is a slut in d\u00e9collet\u00e9 silk. With the children briefly out of the way, the couple copulate savagely on Miles's bed. Miles is later discovered by the governess pinning Flora to a wall in what might be imitation.</p> <p>The whole is a uniquely disturbing piece of music theatre - Rowlands is strident at times while Tara Harrison's Miss Jessel is unsteady. The children - Jonathan Darbourne as Miles and Nazan Fikret as Flora - are both outstanding. You need to see it if your nerves can take it, for this is, without question, the definitive Turn of the Screw for our times. </p> <p>Until October 28. Box office: 020-7702 9555.</p>",
  "<p>His paintings show a serene world peopled by obese - yet elegant - figures in dreamlike scenes far removed from the drug-fuelled violence that wracks his homeland. </p> <p>Now artist Fernando Botero is sending a huge collection of artworks back to his native Colombia, even though he feels it is too unsafe to live there full-time himself. </p> <p>The donation, said to be valued at more than $100m (\u00a368m), includes some 200 works by Botero, and nearly 100 pieces by others from his own collection, which includes Monet, Picasso, Dali and Bacon. </p> <p>They are to be shown at museums in Bogota and a purpose-built gallery in Medellin, city of his birth. \"It was a way to help Colombia and a way to change the face of Medellin,\" said Botero. \"We wanted to show that it's not just the city of the cartels, assassins, death and crime..\" </p> <p>Until recently, Botero's art ignored Colombia's endemic violence, but earlier this year, the painter sparked controversy when he unveiled a new collection portraying the turmoil of crime and war. </p> <p>One picture shows drug baron Pablo Escobar dying in a hail of police bullets. In another, Manuel \"Sureshot\" Marulanda, legendary leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), stands calmly in a jungle clearing, carrying a strangely harmless-looking machine gun. </p> <p>Other paintings in the series include the aftermath of a car-bomb attack, a group of guerrillas resting in a forest and a massacre in a bar. </p> <p>Why did he break his own rules? \"Art should be an oasis, a place or refuge from the hardness of life,\" he explained. \"But the Colombian drama is so out of proportion that today you cannot ignore the violence, the thousands of displaced and dead, the processions of coffins. Against all my principles I had to paint [the violence].\" </p> <p>The paintings are oddly peaceful. In the Escobar portrait, the bullets seem frozen in mid-air. The drug baron's only wound is a tiny spot of blood, when in reality, he was practically torn apart by gunfire. </p> <p>When the paintings were released in July, some Colombians said the works glorified notorious outlaws. \"He has the complete right to immortalise whomever he wants,\" said an editorial in the Cali newspaper, El Pais. \"However, one is left with a certain unease.\" </p> <p>Botero insists that no moral judgment was intended. \"It wasn't a homage, I was giving testimony on people who are central to Colombian life ... In the US, there are films and books about Al Capone, but that doesn't mean anyone admires Capone - he's just part of American reality.\" </p> <p>Pilar Velillo, director of the new museum in Medellin, said: \"It's impossible for a Colombian, and especially an artist to be on the sidelines of what is happening to us. Just as Picasso painted Guernica, Botero had to paint 'Sureshot'.\" </p> <p>The collection is to be housed in two restored colonial buildings which form the centrepiece of an ambitious plan to revitalise the centre of Colombia's third-largest city. He is formally opening the exhibition today and a rundown neighbour has been renamed \"Botero City\" where the artist's corpulent statues will be on permanent display in a new park. </p> <p>\"This isn't just about showing pictures - it's about awakening pride and a sense of belonging. We aren't just making a museum, we're proposing a change of attitude. Our city has been really beaten up by violence, but we're not all bad here,\" said Ms Velilla. </p> <p>Like the novels of Colombia's other artistic giant, Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Botero's art is steeped in his native culture with references to the landmarks and customs of Medellin, despite having lived abroad for 48 years. </p> <p><strong> Failed kidnapping</strong><br> </p> <p> \"In a way, Botero has never left,\" said Ms Velilla, but after a failed kidnapping attempt in 1994, the painter was forced to restrict his visits to Medellin. </p> <p>\"After that I couldn't come to Colombia so often, because I was a real danger, but it makes me very sad. It's very hard when you can't visit your own land,\" Botero said. In 10 years, the civil war has forced more than a million Colombians from their homes, while tens of thousands have fled abroad. </p> <p>Botero's work itself became the focus of the violence in June 1995, when a bomb in Medellin tore apart his statue of a dove, killing 25 people. He insisted the statue stay put as a \"monument to stupidity\". </p> <p>In 1998, President Andres Pastrana launched talks with Farc, but progress has been very slow. </p> <p>Said Botero: \"The situation in Colombia couldn't be worse. We have to have faith, because it's the only option we have. But it's hard to stay optimistic when there's no sign of change.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Ubiquity</strong> <br>Mark Buchanan <br>230pp, Weidenfeld, \u00a320</p> <p> Why are physics textbooks full of mathematics and biology books full of words? Because, as the great Richard Feynman once pointed out, physics is simple. Classical physics deals with inanimate objects performing relatively simple behaviours that can be described adequately using straightforward equations. The motion of heavenly bodies, the jiggling of atoms within molecules, even relativistic behaviours and the strange shenanigans of the quantum world - they can all be described using the general sort of equations with which most of us struggled at school. </p> <p>Raise the level of complexity, however, and mathematicians begin to struggle. Notice, for example, how often the weather forecast is wrong. The atmosphere is complicated, and its description requires equations that are exquisitely sensitive to input errors. By the time we reach the irredeemably complex world of living things, traditional maths is virtually useless. Master all the mathematics in all the textbooks of classical physics in the world, and you would not be in a position even to begin to describe the internal workings of an ant. </p> <p>At least, this was the situation until recently. In the last few decades, mathematicians have started grappling with more complex areas of science. First came the analysis of non-linear systems, beautifully explained by James Gleick in his 1988 bestseller Chaos . Then came complexity theory, outlined in Roger Lewin's Complexity . Now we have Mark Buchanan's Ubiquity , a book explaining the behaviour of systems in the \"critical state\", a concept described by the author as \"the first really solid discovery of complexity theory\" (to give a flavour of the intellectual lineage). </p> <p>The basic principle is that certain systems, under certain circumstances, behave in rather curious yet mathematically similar ways. For a practical illustration of the idea, take a handful of rice and drop the grains one by one on to a table top. Soon you will have a pile of rice. But the pile will not grow taller for ever: eventually the addition of one more grain will cause an avalanche. Keep a tally of the magnitudes of these avalanches and a characteristic pattern emerges, one that can be described mathematically using a power function. The important point about this in the present context is that the power-function description implies something profound about our ability to predict the behaviour of the rice pile. The addition of a single grain may have no discernible effect, or it may precipitate a small avalanche, or a big one, or a series of avalanches resulting in a catastrophic collapse of the whole structure. Because of the particular mathematical distribution of avalanche magnitudes, predicting which of these consequences will ensue is, for all practical purposes, impossible. </p> <p>Having established this underlying principle, Buchanan goes on to explain how it might be extended to shed light on the behaviour of more complex systems. Perhaps the most interesting concerns earthquake prediction. If fault systems in the earth's crust are in a critical state, and if the magnitude and timing of slippages along the faults follow a power law, then predicting when earthquakes will strike, and how destructive they will be, should prove virtually impossible. Historical records of the timing and magnitudes of earthquakes do seem to follow a power law, which suggests, among other things, that seismologists around the world may be wasting their own time and large amounts of our money banging their heads against an insoluble problem. To be fair to the profession, many seismologists had already come to this conclusion without the aid of rice. </p> <p>Moreover, many earth scientists believe that critical-state theorists are overreaching somewhat when they try to liken the behaviour of something as complicated as the earth's crust to a pile of grain. And when essentially the same technique is employed to explain everything (note the book's title) from forest fires to stock market fluctuations, from extinctions in the fossil record to upheavals in human history, many feel that they are not so much overreaching as hurling themselves into the wide blue yonder. Perhaps because of this attitude of intellectual derring-do, most historians, economists and historical scientists at the present time seem willing to do little more than look on, often in bewilderment, as the mathematicians fly past. This is a shame because the whole project is refreshingly courageous and potentially very important. However, the theorists' cause is not helped by the extreme simplification of reality inevitably required by their analyses, nor by their sometimes shocking ignorance of the problems under investigation. The best that can be said about Buchanan's treatment of extinctions, for example, in particular the Permian mass extinction, is that the many factual errors do not greatly affect the conclusion. </p> <p> Ubiquity represents an audacious attempt to explain an equally audacious ongoing programme of research, and herein lies its great strength and weakness. Any author who risks stretching ideas across numerous academic disciplines and well beyond the boundaries of knowledge is sure to receive both admiration and criticism; only time will tell which forms the greater part of the response in this case. For my part, I wish there were more juicy, thought-provoking books like Buchanan's on the now-groaning popular-science shelves of the nation's bookstores.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Tank</strong><br>Patrick Wright <br>256pp, Faber, \u00a325 </p> <p> For over 80 years, the tank has been the mobile master of the battlefield. From its beginnings on the soggy, cratered ground of the Western Front, it has been engineered for supremacy. A protected mobile space carrying only the crew necessary to transport and serve a direct-fire weapon, its ultimate object has always been the breakthrough - achieved by killing its (ideally outclassed) opponents and then wreaking invulnerable havoc among the unprotected. The Germans ground into their Flanders trenches, the Allied tankers who faced Tigers and Panthers in the undergunned Sherman (the \"tommy-cooker\"), the Gulf War Iraqis immolated before they could fire a round - all were minnows before the sharks of the battlefield. </p> <p>Yet Patrick Wright is interested not only in the tank as instrument of warfare but also in its \"miasmic afterlife, which has lifted it from its customary motor pools and battlefields and relaunched it as a phantom of the modern imagination\". This takes him from Tiananmen protestor to agitprop art, from first-world-war propaganda to whether digitisation means a \"revolution in military affairs\". So the tank's successes at Cambrai in 1917 are followed by its use as a patriotic fund-raiser around Britain (the \"tank bank\"); the first Blitzkrieg is coupled with the unravelling of the myth of the Polish lancer versus the German panzer; Amos Oz follows swiftly on the heels of the Six Day War. Wright's style throughout is discursive, even languid, and his breadth of reference exciting. </p> <p>This approach throws up frequent gems. War Office refusals to provide a single man for initial tank trials in 1915-16 led to a tentative approach to Mrs Pankhurst to find crews of suffragettes instead (60 volunteered). And Wright's search for the truth of whether the Turkish army punishes inanimate objects conjures up a splendidly bizarre image: a tank on a hillside, surrounded by a picket fence, guarded by a sentry, parked in mechanical Coventry for the sins set out on a nearby sign. </p> <p>But more often it serves to annoy. Wright is too self-indulgent an author to know when to stop, and none of his extensive reading must go to waste. Armour prophet JFC Fuller was an early acolyte of satanist Aleister Crowley, so the pre-tank ramblings of the Great Beast get 20 pages. An eccentric artist's mobile apartment for the homeless - which even Wright admits looks more like an armoured personnel carrier than a tank - claims 10 more. As minor writer and fascist Curzio Malaparte followed tanks about the Eastern Front, we have to hear about him and his un-tanklike house on Capri. Time and again, material that merits a paragraph and a footnote gets five or 10 pages. The overall effect is of nothing so much as the lyrical transcription of material thrown up by typing \"tank\" into a shoddy net search engine. </p> <p>The space wasted on the irrelevant might have been better allocated to filling holes. An examination of the inter-war revolution in armour should focus on Nomonhan (where Zhukov practised Tukhachevsky's preachings on lightly armed Japanese), rather than Spain, as the harbinger of the operational future. And straitened interwar military establishments didn't just oppose mechanisation because (pace British Field Marshal Montgomery-Massingberd) tanks dirtied their jodhpurs. They noticed that machines were expensive, unreliable, logistically demanding and not that mobile - all of which undermined the apparently overwhelming logic for pensioning off the horse. </p> <p>These apart, Wright is better on the military aspects than many so-called military historians, in part because he writes so well. Instead, most of the holes are in his thesis on tank as \"cultural phantom\". Where is the tank and the coup, the tank and popular literature, the tank and the war film, the psychology and technology of tank-killing? Where is the tank as privatised toy, hired out by the hour on ranges around the world? Some of these get mentioned in passing, some ignored altogether; yet all have defined the cultural spectre of the tank far more than the satanic ramblings of Aleister Crowley. Most of all, where is the peace tank? The political shifts of the 1990s have produced the bizarre image of tanks denying their \"tankness\" - parked in the open, painted white, reassuring some and bluffing others, all on behalf of that miasmic entity, the international community. Nothing represents the shift in the moral environment of armour better than UNPROFOR's Danish Leopard and its female gunner, emptying every round of main gun ammunition into Serb positions to teach their recalcitrant garrison a lesson. It's the acronymic armour of peace support rather than the digital ramblings of the US Armor Center that will define the cultural phantom for the post-Desert Storm generation. </p> <p>Wright's search for the allegorical also undermines his exposition of the real. He claims that the tank was engineered out of the cultural imagination of the second decade of the 20th century. But it wasn't: it was a pragmatic product of the first-ever coincidence of shell-torn trench lines with the means (the caterpillar track) to cross them. It may have begun \"in a cloud of frantic period fantasy\", as soldiers and propagandists peddled absurd notions of the landship's power. But the fantasy has never detracted from the essence of the tank, both in function and experience: it is a weapon of war, crewed by and aimed at man. </p> <p>This is the idea that is struggling to emerge from the frantic fantasy of Wright's prose. Popular perceptions of the weapon are defined as much by representations of the people in it and facing it as by the image of the weapon itself. The key to the cultural phantom is the tank's combination of power and vulnerability. It is the power that breaks battalions; it is the vulnerability that makes them stay put, waiting for a Ganju Lama VC to destroy a tank and turn the tide. For every tank crewman knows that his comparatively comfort able ride into battle has its downside. Once the armoured shell is penetrated, the whole crew may share the same fate: minced by a HESH round, torched by white phosphorus. The better protected the tank, the less it can see; and when its vision devices are smashed, it is a cripple waiting for the coup de grace. The power of the image of the tank defied may derive from the sense of its omnipotence, but the image is so widespread because the tank is so weak. </p> <p>At the same time, the inanimate is perhaps ultra-human. Tank crews (and those of other armoured vehicles) live more closely than any servicemen save submariners. Three to five men may spend 20 hours a day boxed up in a small compartment, relying entirely on each other's skills for survival. This proximity builds bonds strong even by the standards of a close-knit profession. The power of the tank also rests on human shoulders. As Wright himself points out, the Tiananmen protestor only stopped a column of PLA armour because the driver of the lead tank chose not to roll over him. The size and vulnerability of the weapon may simply serve to magnify the humanity of those who wield it. </p> <p>This is a message that will not go away. The tank is as vulnerable, and as human, as ever. Grozny, New Year 1994-5: lost, unsupported Russian tanks are hunted down by packs of Chechens with rocket-propelled grenades and turf knowledge. Southern Lebanon, 2000: the safest tank in the world, the Israeli Merkava, falls to Hizbollah's TOW missiles. Both were images that shaped policy. The tank's symbolic resonance is a function of the humanity of those who create, serve and are killed by it. Perhaps if Wright had ignored the whimsical siren of second-rate artists and stuck with the squeal of sprockets, Tank wouldn't have read like a missed opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>Turn on your television at peak viewing times and you may well see an Alan Whicker lookalike playing with plastic cups and a red ball. The advert is for Charcolonline, the web offering of Charcol, mortgage broker and independent financial adviser, and is a bid to persuade us that buying our mortgage over the internet will make our lives easier. </p> <p>Purchasing a house, as banks and building societies are so fond of telling us, is the biggest transaction most of us will undertake in our lives. But having drummed this mantra into our financially obtuse heads for years, they are now telling us that we can get a mortgage in 15 minutes without the need for paperwork or any face-to-face contact. </p> <p>So how easy is it? And what are the advantages of buying a home loan online? Siobhan Hotten, marketing manager at Charcol, which launched Charcolonline last November, says it now channels 25% of all its business via the net and once clients enter their personal details, they will instantly see a selection of the best mortgages on the market. The group sifts all mortgage products on a daily basis to ensure that the site carries only the best buys of the 4,000 loans in the market place. </p> <p>Then the clients are asked more questions on their employment status and income and the type of mortgage they want (fixed-rate, discount, etc) to ensure they are eligible for the products. </p> <p>The third stage involves completing the online application form. Charcolonline will download it, check references, instruct a credit search, commission a valuation and present the lender with a final proposition. \"We understand the lenders' criteria, so the only way an application is going to be turned down is if the person has a poor credit history which they have not disclosed,\" says Ms Hotten. </p> <p>Charcolonline also offers some unique products and has advisers who, if you email them, will call you to answer any questions, although they will not give advice on which product you should accept. </p> <p>Moneysupermarket.com has a similar process, except it also offers what it calls a residential reverse auction. Applicants submit their mortgage requirements online to a panel of 14 lenders who then bid for the business. The client is emailed within 48 hours with the best rates bid, and can choose. Since launch two months ago, it has received \u00a3300m in mortgage applications and more than 80% of all bids beat the best rates available on the open market. </p> <p>A net-based conveyancing service is also on offer to take the deal through to completion. The charge is \u00a3249 plus disbursements for first-time buyers and \u00a3150 for remortgages, compared with around \u00a3600 plus disbursements for a standard London-based solicitor. Online lenders and brokers are subject to the same regulations as their off-line versions. </p> <p>So why aren't we all buying online? Just 3% of all mortgages are bought online, according to Simon Nixon, chief executive officer of Moneysupermarket, although 30% of buyers use the net to research the deal. Charcol adds that 15% of those starting the application process online elect to complete it using the standard adviser service. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Yorkshire Building Society, which plans to sell its products online next year says: \"While we are obviously not against online mortgages, for some people there is the issue of security. They may not be happy submitting all their financial details over the net, especially after all the publicity surrounding bank security breaches.\" </p> <p>While the number of net buyers is growing quickly, it is still only remortgagors or second- or third-time buyers who are happy to buy a mortgage in this impersonal way. The Moneysupermarket auction is only available for people borrowing \u00a3150,000 or more, so low-income individuals are excluded. </p> <p>And not all the market is growing in the quite the same exponential way as these two companies. This week the chief executive of E-Loan, the online mortgage introducer launched in a fanfare of publicity in January, left the company, unhappy that the business is to be sold because of the pressures of rival brokers on the web. </p>",
  "<p>Banks are failing to support deprived areas despite booming profits that would allow them to keep local branches open, according to a report out this week.</p> <p>The New Economic Foundation says banks would only need to spend 0.2% of their profits - \u00a340m - on a network of 1,500 community banks. It could encourage large numbers of people without bank accounts to benefit from services like direct debits that can save them money. Most utilities offer discounts to customers who pay via direct debit. </p> <p>The Case for Community Banking, by Derek French, argues that community banks in pubs, churches, schools and village halls, could regenerate areas. \"Siting banks in such places could prove an effective solution to community decline by underpinning other vulnerable areas of community life,\" he says. </p> <p>He says the banks, run locally but acting as a shared agency through which all clearing banks could offer services, could be \"a powerful aid to to local economic and social regeneration\". In the US banks are required by law to operate in poor neighbourhoods. More than $1trillion has been committed by US banks to deprived areas, and \"such lending can be profitable\". </p> <p>The major high street banks have resisted the idea of clubbing together to help deprived areas. Concerns about the loss of brand identity and who would pay for the the scheme have been raised with ministers. </p> <p>Mr French says he recognises that bank directors are trapped between \"conflicting economic and social imperatives\". But he says some comunities have been devastated by the loss of their last remaining bank. </p> <p>\u0095 Contact <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org\">www.neweconomics.org</a> or tel: 020-7407-7447.</p>",

  "<p>The former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns was yesterday named chairman of the national lottery commission, an appointment the government hopes will quell growing controversy surrounding the award of the next licence to run the game. </p> <p>Choosing Lord Burns, one of Whitehall's most experienced figures, sends a signal that the culture secretary, Chris Smith, wants to restore some credibility to the commission, which has seen its name ravaged in recent weeks. </p> <p>Lord Burns, 56, comes with a down to earth reputation and was thought adept enough at handling emotive issues to chair the government's hunting inquiry. </p> <p>Mr Smith will now want the two rival bidders, Sir Richard Branson's People's Lottery and Camelot, to end their verbal warfare and resume negotiations with the commission. </p> <p>The Conservatives immediately dubbed the appointment Tony Blair's \"revenge\" on Gordon Brown because of the history of ill will between the chancellor and his then-permanent secretary, which resulted in Lord Burns' enforced \"retirement\" from the Treasury in 1998 - clutching a peerage. </p> <p>The shadow culture secretary, Peter Ainsworth, also renewed his calls for the remaining four lottery commissioners to step down. \"We welcome the appointment of Lord Burns, who is clearly a very able man,\" he said. \"But question marks still hang over other members.\" </p> <p>Lord Burns is stepping into a job many would regard as a poisoned chalice. He replaces Dame Helena Shovelton, who quit last week amid claims she mishandled the process for picking a group to run the lottery from next October. Lord Burns said he appreciated how difficult the task was. \"It is clearly not an easy job but I believe it can be done otherwise I wouldn't have taken it on. The important thing is to look forward.\" </p> <p>A decision to pursue exclusive negotiations with the People's Lottery was overturned in the high court in a judgment which suggested the commission had abused its power. In a letter to Lord Burns confirming his appointment Mr Smith acknowledged he was taking over at a \"challenging time\". </p> <p>Mr Smith said: \"He is someone of unimpeachable integrity and very high public stature.\" </p> <p>Both Camelot and the People's Lottery were happy with the appointment. \"We welcome a fresh pair of eyes and hope he can allay our concerns,\" said a Camelot spokeswoman. The People's Lottery said it hoped the process could move to a swift conclusion. </p> <p>Lord Burns will receive an annual salary of \u00a348,000 during his three-year tenure. A respected figure, his offences in the Treasury included his monetarist past as a Thatcher appointee and the suspicion that he was Downing Street's \"fifth column\" as Mr Brown and his inner entourage - Ed Balls, Geoffrey Robinson and Charlie Whelan - took control in 1997. </p> <p>What clinched the exclusion, according to Andrew Rawnsley's book, Servants of the People, was that Lord Burns refused to help Mr Robinson out of political difficulty by saying he had been told about the then paymaster general's Channel Islands trust. Lord Burns believed he had only been told it was a \"family trust\" - with no tax implications. </p> <p>That should reassure MPs and voters that Lord Burns is a genuinely independent figure, not a \"crony\".</p>",
  "Nearly 5,000 members of the public have expressed interest in becoming people's peers, according to Lady Jay, leader of the House of Lords. <p>She said yesterday that 191 people have already been formally nominated or completed application forms since adverts for people's peers were placed in mid-September. The deadline for applications is November 17. </p> <p>An appointments commission is touring cities trying to drum up applications from voluntary groups, businessmen and public sector employees.

  "<p><strong>ARSENE'S IN CHARGE</strong></p> <p>Arsene Wenger certainly knows how to deal with the FA. Scarcely minutes after ruling himself out of the running for the vacant England job - \"the England job is an attractive one, but someone else will be taking it, not me\" - the no-nonsense Arsenal manager announced his intention to take the hapless footballing body through the courts. </p> <p>A serene Wenger explained today that he is not best pleased with his recent 12-match ban for physically threatening behaviour. \"Maybe I went to the meeting expecting some kind of small punishment, perhaps a fine,\" he mused, \"but this is far, far too much, and I will certainly consult a lawyer. It is not only harsh, it is an injustice. I feel like I have killed somebody.\"</p> <p>But just for the record, Arsene doesn't hate David Davies's very guts. That's because, although Arsene is hard (and he is), he's also fair. Showing a willingness to forgive and forget, Wenger today conceded that he may be prepared to coach England. When he is good and ready. \"I wouldn't say no to the manager's job if I was completely free,\" he said, \"but at the moment I give my all to Arsenal. Maybe in two or three years I will change my mind.\" This sounds fine to the Fiver - any major lawsuits should have been dealt with by then.</p> <p><strong>A LOVELY TALE</strong></p> <p>The Fiver spent most of Wednesday evening hurling a thesaurus's worth of profanities at u&gt;direct's u&gt;seless coverage. And when the TV wasn't incurring our wrath, French referee Alain Sars took up the slack. \"Off, off, off!\" we cried when Teddy Sheringham was tripped - only to see Monsieur Sars furiously shake his Gallic head. \"Go-aaalllllllllll!\" we cheered, as Romford Ray's rocket crashed off the bar and in - only for Sars to deny us again. Never mind, we thought - when Sars talks to the press, he wouldn't deny us our justice for a third time, would he?</p> <p>\"I don't feel responsible for England's defeat at all and anyway they had only one real opportunity to score,\" Mr Sars said today, knocking the Fiver's socks off. What about the sending off? \"In such a case a referee wonders if that player really had a chance to score,\" Sars pondered. \"I saw two Finnish defenders who could have intercepted the ball if Sheringham had shot. I assessed the striker had been tripped and that the keeper deserved a yellow card.\"</p> <p>\"Alright then, what about Romford Ray's wonder-goal?\" we seethed - but even that was not Sar's fault. \"How do you think an assistant can see where the ball bounced,\" he said, \"when it's just hit the crossbar at 150 kilometres-per-hour and comes out straight away?\" By using his eyes perhaps?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It looks like a classic case of a bandwagon effect snowballing out of control\" - A classic case of mixed metaphors as William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe explains why odds on Lazio's Sven Goran Eriksson for next England manager tumbled from 33/1 to 3/1.</p> <p><strong>SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO BACKWARDS TO MOVE FORWARDS</strong></p> <p>Gerard Houllier today took a step closer to realising his dream. By agreeing a \u00a37m deal with Dynamo Zagreb for Croatian international Igor Biscan, the Liverpool boss will soon be able to field a team consisting solely of defensive midfielders, thus unleashing his epochal 0-10-0 formation on a stunned footballing world. Biscan won't arrive until the mid-winter break in the Croatian season, mind you, so we'll have to put up with the tired old goal-seeking formation for a while yet.</p> <p>\"We will be delighted to have him, especially as so many other top European clubs were interested,\" babbled an over-excited Houllier as he imagined Biscan trapping a searching three-yard sideways pass from Jamie Carragher. \"He is an international player and a class player. We've been watching him for a long time,\" he chattered, picturing his new charge racing down the wing to stop a Dietmar Hamann back-pass going out for a corner.</p> <p>Of course, Biscan is a talented man - you don't get in the Croatian side at 22 years of age if you're no good. \"He is a versatile footballer as he showed against Scotland when he played on the right of midfield,\" explained his new boss, showing worrying cavalier tendencies. Luckily for Liverpool fans however, Houllier was quick to clear up any confusion: \"I see him as a defensive midfielder.\" So good luck with the new plan, Gerard, and remember: sideways pass and move, it's the Liverpool groove!</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Both Newcastle and Celtic are lining up a bid for \u00a33m-rated Everton defender Richard Dunne, according to reports.</p> <p>West Ham have enquired about taking Torino defender Fabio Galante and midfielder Djibril Diawara on loan.</p> <p>Sunderland are interested in taking Sporting Lisbon striker Kwame Ayew on trial, reports Planet Football.

  "Israel and the Palestinians were today close to arranging a weekend summit that would include the US, Egypt, Jordan and the United Nations in a high-level attempt to end more than two weeks of violence, Palestinian officials said. <p>Israeli officials confirmed that the terms of a summit were being negotiated, but said no agreement had been reached yet.</p> <p>But as diplomatic moves gathered pace, a gun battle erupted between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in the volatile West Bank town of Ramallah, the scene of a mob killing yesterday of two Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>In Jerusalem, Israeli police beat back young Palestinians outside a revered mosque. </p> <p>However, Israel and the Palestinians appeared to be moving toward a summit that would be held tomorrow or Sunday in Egypt, according to senior Palestinian officials. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak are both expected to attend the talks, the officials said. </p> <p>The final details had not been worked out, and the Israelis and Palestinians were not dealing directly with each other, the officials added. </p> <p>As a condition for attending the summit, the Palestinians are demanding that Israel withdraw its troops from the outskirts of Palestinian cities and lift its siege of their communities in the West Bank.</p> <p>Mr Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, confirmed that negotiations on a summit were under way, but nothing had been decided. </p> <p>World leaders have sought to calm two weeks of fighting that escalated yesterday when the two Israeli soldiers were mutilated by a mob of enraged Palestinians. Israel responded with combat helicopters that fired rockets at key Palestinian targets, including Arafat's residential compound in the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has been leading a group of diplomats trying to broker a truce to the Israeli-Palestinian bloodletting that has left at least 94 dead, the vast majority Palestinian.

Initial reports said Palestinians opened fire on Israeli troops with rifles and the Israeli's responded with \"virtually everything they had\" including automatic weapons firing live rounds. Up to 2,000 people were said to be involved, but there are no immediate details of casualties</p> <p>In Jerusalem's Old City, clashes broke out between police and young Palestinian men as Muslims arrived for midday prayers at the Noble Sanctuary compound, the third holiest site in Islam. </p> <p>Muslim men under 45 were turned back on the reasoning that they would be most likely to participate in rioting. Police with clubs hit young Palestinian men attempting to enter the compound, and Palestinians heaved stones and bottles.

  "<p> Ahhh, romantic Paris at night. It was raining. Not the kind of grey drizzle you expect in London. This was real rain - fat ploppy drops that send your hair into ringlets and your mascara into dark, intriguing smudges. No cabs, no parapluie. I stood under a doorway watching embracing couples dashing from awning to awning. Occasionally they stopped and kissed. The man sheltering next to me smiled and nodded at the sky. \"You need taxi?\" I nodded. That was how I found myself skimming across Paris in the back of a cab with a (very) handsome Frenchman. Only turns out he was an Italian living in France. Signor Cornetto with a side dish of Gaul. The Paris fashion week after-show party season was under way. If London is pointless (any excuse for a bash) and Milan relies on a point (any excuse to earn a million or so), the Paris after-show party is pointedly sexual - any chance of a quickie? \"I lurrrve you young fashion girrrls who are independent and trrravel all overrr the worrrld.\" </p> <p>\"Actually, I'm married.\" </p> <p>\"I lurrrve you marrrried fashion women who are dependent and trrravel only occasionally.\" Yawn. </p> <p> First stop, some Brits abroad - four young designers had taken it upon themselves to hire a studio space and exhibit their wares in the heart of Europe's fashland. Eley Kishimoto (print-meisters - love the tights), Jessica Ogden (has a way with embroidery threads and print effects), Mulligan (top collection of asymmetric cuts and corsage details) and J Maskray (queen of stick-on sequins) had all been around at London but felt that exposure in Paris may bring extra international business. The party was low-key, conveniently so considering my dramatic trip at the entrance. Sliding around the exhibits, I found a video screening at the back and settled down to watch J Maskray's London presentation. Now, some people would flinch at an array of skin jewellery displayed on lap dancers. I, on the other hand, joined a group of French buyers who were clearly weaned off breast milk with soft porn. The glittering dragons' heads adhering to the writhing naked bodies were stunning. My pen flew across my notepad. Only after 10 minutes did I realise that, apart from the leech, I was alone in my viewing and the newly assembled crowd were watching me watching the show. Had anyone told them this was an alternative fashion show? I think not. \"Oh look, there's an old pervert in the corner with a leery Italian watching a porn vid.\" Blushed? </p> <p> Quick exit to wittily named Fur-midable - a cocktail party coutesy of Saga furs. Now, before you start, I don't approve of the use of fur in fashion either - but that shouldn't stop you attending. \"Kate Adie doesn't approve of war,\" I told myself, \"but that doesn't stop her going.\" Opinions suspended, I relinquished my handbag for an offensive weapons check and entered the fur-torn world of Saga. Champagne and hors d'oeuvres jostled for attention with electric blue mink-covered washbasin units and a bathroom mirror trimmed in bleached fox tails. Languorous models pawed at each other with all the \"luxury-prop\" realism of a Wallpaper magazine interiors shoot. Bad enough that those dear wee minkies have been turned into cuffs, muffs and collars. More terrible still, though, is the fact that their lives had been cut short to become... a tissue box cover or a classic novel binding. Need I say more? The only good thing: the assembled throng took not a blind bit of notice but remained adhered to the buffet table until the nibbles and champagne ran dry. </p> <p> On to a photography exhibition (of which there are many this week) by... well, d'ya know, I don't remember, since my invite got washed clean by the rain and there wasn't a biog to hand (agent, take note). But it turned out to be yet another excuse to knock back champagne. There were lots of fashion celebs there, though, looking at photos of lots of fashion celebs. For them, in fact, it became a Question of Sport-style game, where you see a bit of someone and you have to guess who it is. \"Look, there's me\"; \"Look, that's my leg next to Juergen Teller.\" This pastime, I assure you, may well be fun if it might be your leg.

  "For Jewish and Palestinian people settled in Britain, the recent eruptions in the peace process makes for painful armchair viewing. The Jewish community in the UK has decided to tighten security amid fears the Middle East conflict could spread over here. But are their fears well founded? <p>\"By and large, there has not been much feeling against Jews as Jews,\" says Ghada Kermi, chairman of the Palestinian Community Association of Britain. \"The problem is with Israel.\"</p> <p>But Simon Plosker, a spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews, says: \"Israel is extremely important to the British Jewish community,\" he says. \"At the same time, it does not necessarily mean we have a problem with Palestinians or Arabs, in London or elsewhere.\"</p> <p>There are an estimated 10,000 and 20,000 Palestinians living in Britain. Some came in the early 90s, after the Gulf war. Many others have been here since 1948.</p> <p>Mejad Alzeer, the director of the Palestinian Return Centre in north-west London, which campaigns for the rights of Palestinians to return to their homeland, says that most Palestinians look forward to that day. \"To the best of my knowledge, most of them want to go back and want somebody to recognise their right to do so,\" he said.</p> <p>At least half of the Palestinian community lives in or around London. The rest are scattered around the country, working in a wide range of professions. \"The culture is the same as Arab culture,\" Kermi explains. \"There is nothing specific about it, though it is very informed by the Israeli background, and has much more of a political edge because of it.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Plosker claims that the situation in the Middle East does not necessarily have a direct bearing on Jewish culture in Britain. \"It is an entirely separate deal,\" he says. But he warns of fundamentalist and extremist groups actively trying to create tension in Britain between the Jewish and Arab communities. </p> <p>Fewer than 300,000 Jewish people live in Britain, with numbers currently in decline. About 70% of the population of UK Jews are formally linked to a synagogue, but almost one third of that number is religiously unaffiliated. Like Palestinian Britons, they work in a wide range of occupations and can be found in all corners of the country.</p> <p>One organisation trying to bridge the gap of extremism and hostility on both sides is the Maimonides Foundation, whose objective is to promote understanding, peaceful relations and cultural exchange between Jewish and Muslim groups, including Jews and Palestinians. </p> <p>Its activities include the Daughters of Abraham forum, where women from both cultures meet to develop understanding, focussing on similarities and shared experience. An inter-faith football club for young people from both sides, assisted by Arsenal FC, is another example. Fun and collaboration to replace tensions and isolation.</p> <p>Foundation spokesman David Krikler said: \"We do make efforts to improve relations between Jews and Palestinians, and we try our best to ensure that the continuing improvements in relations in our community is not held hostage to the peace process. It is something achieved with great difficulty.\"</p>",

  "<p>Matthew Bannister's move to become BBC director of marketing was always viewed by insiders as a slightly odd, but at the same time a very BBC kind of appointment, and his sudden departure will come as no surprise to many. </p> <p>Odd because Mr Bannister's background was in broadcasting, not marketing. Yet also very BBC because the corporation has a long history of putting people regarded as good managers and loyal servants into positions for which they have apparently little relevant experience.</p> <p>There have certainly been mutterings from within the ranks of the BBC's marketers about this BBC suit being parachuted in over their heads, to run the newly formed marketing and communications \"petal\" in the corporate structure announced by Greg Dyke in April. </p> <p>The BBC's marketing operation was swelled considerably during the later years of Sir John Birt's reign as the corporation went out into the commercial world and hired some of the brightest and best around.</p> <p>Former BBC Broadcast marketing head Sue Farr left shortly afterwards. Maureen Duffy, brought in from the commercial sector to raise BBC1's marketing game, went to run ITV daytime. Meanwhile, Jane Frost, who was Birt's corporate marketing chief and regarded as the architect of the BBC's award-winning Perfect Day promo, was believed to be less than impressed with Mr Bannister's appointment but decided to stick it out.</p> <p>Mr Bannister himself is said to have been reluctant to take the job, but was persuaded to do it by Greg Dyke, with whom he reportedly got on very well. He is understood to have been considering leaving the BBC altogether, after failing to get the director general's job himself last summer, and move into talent management. It is thought that after having a complete break, he may still go in this direction.</p> <p>He was regarded as one of the Birtists - the group of BBC execs who helped implement the former director general's management consultancy-inspired cost-cutting regime in the 1990s. He first made his name by relaunching Radio London as the hip and trendy GLR, before moving on to oversee the creation of the crucial Birtist tract, Extending Choice, in the early 1990s. </p> <p>In 1993 Bannister was rewarded for his efforts with the controllership of Radio 1. He famously threw out the station's Smashy and Nicey image, bidding farewell to the likes of Simon Bates, Dave Lee Travis and several million listeners in the process, and introduced a more cutting edge indie/dance playlist just as the mid-1990s Britpop scene took off.</p> <p>But perhaps his most famous Radio 1 coup was signing Chris Evans to present the breakfast show - a moment caught for posterity courtesy of a supposedly clandestine \"secret meeting\" between the two, an event actually staged for the benefit of a News of the World cameraman.</p> <p>In 1996 Mr Bannister moved further up the BBC corporate ladder, taking over as director of radio in the Birt restructuring that split broadcasting and production. At the beginning of last year he was promoted again, to chief executive of BBC Production. Six months later he made the shortlist to replace Birt as director general, but lost out to Dyke.</p>",
  "An explosion that devastated one of the US navy's most sophisticated destroyers in Aden yesterday was caused by an elaborately planned terrorist suicide mission, Pentagon officials alleged last night. <p>Officials said two men were seen standing to attention in military style on the deck of a small boat that came alongside the USS Cole moments before a massive explosion which tore a 600sq ft hole in the destroyer, killing four US sailors and injuring more than 36. Another 12 US sailors were missing, feared dead. </p> <p>The Cole, a Burke class destroyer which is part of the US Fifth Fleet, was paying an unannounced visit to Aden for a refuelling stop scheduled to last between four and six hours. The fact that the Cole's arrival was not widely known points equally to a high level of security intelligence and terrorist preparedness. </p> <p>The Cole was travelling from the Suez canal to the Persian Gulf to take part in the US oil blockade against Iraq. That fact immediately raised suspicions of Iraqi involvement in the incident, though with anti-American tensions so high across the Arab world at present, no one in Washington was ruling out any possibility. </p> <p>The Pentagon ordered all US ships docked in the region to put to sea last night as a precaution against any further attacks. </p> <p>Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh denied terrorists were behind the explosion. \"I don't think it's a terrorist attack,\" he told CNN, insisting his country harboured no \"terrorist elements.\" </p> <p>But Yemen has been plagued by generally low-level terrorism for many years. Following the Afghan war, many Muslim fighters took refuge there, taking advantage of lax security, the ready availability of weapons and the rugged terrain to use it as a base for training and activities in other countries. </p> <p>The vessel which caused the explosion was described as a small, rubber boat which was assisting the Cole with its mooring lines as it docked. Some early reports suggested that the vessel rammed the Cole. </p> <p>The Cole was said to be under control and to have the use of its own engines on reduced power last night. The ship remained listing to its port side in Aden harbour. </p> <p>Yemeni television showed pictures of some of the wounded sailors in hospital in Aden. President Saleh visited the wounded. </p> <p>President Clinton was notified of the incident at his home in New York state yesterday morning. He later called it \"a despicable and cowardly act\".</p>",
  "Palestinian news outlets in English, which are sketchy at the best of times, now seem paralysed by the general fear gripping the region. <p>Even the Palestinian National Authority website has collapsed, and the <a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo\" target=\"_new\">ministry of information</a> pages are unavailable for the second successive day. </p> <p>The mood of Arab anger against Israel is, however, well captured by the <a href=\"http://www.arabia.com/\" target=\"_new\">Arabia.com site</a>, which features comprehensive coverage of ongoing events. It carries a chilling <a href=\"http://www.arabia.com/pollSaveChoices/1,4928,764|M|0|result,00.html\" target=\"_new\">opinion poll</a> in which 53% of respondents, asked how Yasser Arafat should respond, opt for a declaration of war. </p> <p>Belligerence is also the prevailing tone in the Israeli papers, which shrug off any suggestion that Israel itself may bear some responsibility for the crisis. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a> is adamant: \"Arafat cannot escape responsibility for the unspeakably brutal lynching of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah, even if, as Palestinians claim, his police tried to prevent the mob from removing them from police custody. No known steps have been taken to arrest the perpetrators. </p> <p>\"Most importantly, the lynching was the product of relentless PA (Palestinian Authority) incitement to violence. It was this incitement that produced the violence of the last two weeks, and has only accelerated with every Palestinian casualty. Israel's measured military response was, if anything, mild or, in the IDF's (Israeli Defence Forces) own description, 'symbolic.' The frenzied cries of Palestinian spokesmen that Israel has 'escalated' and is perpetrating 'massacres' of Palestinians are absurd.\" </p> <p>The more liberal daily <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a> also clearly believes that Israel has behaved reasonably, in the face of great provocation. It devotes its editorial not to the escalating conflict with the Palestinians, but to the ugly outbreak of violence between Jews and Arabs within Israel. It notes with approval that the disturbances have died down, and that there are signs of reconciliation. </p> <p>\"Apparently, both sides were horrified by the violent events and realised that for the sake of normal life together and for the sake of preserving the rule of law, an effort must be made to restrain emotions and impulses and to find a common denominator for coexistence.\"</p>",
  "<p>Champions of the world's largest film format, Imax, are confident that next week's UK release of CyberWorld, a 3D animation extravaganza with stars from Antz and The Simpsons, will further place the medium on a viable commercial footing. Despite this and the opening of three new British Imax cinemas in coming months, the acceptance of Imax into the movie mainstream still has some way to go. </p> <p>Imax has been around since 1970, when the company behind it, Imax Corporation, developed a new, giant-screen feature film format. It uses film 10 times larger than a conventional 35mm frame and three times bigger than standard 70mm. This, combined with unique Imax projection technology, delivers images of unsurpassed size, clarity and, aficionados insist, impact. </p> <p>Accompanied by state-of-the-art multi-speaker sound systems, Imax films are projected onto screens 20 metres high by 26 metres across - the size of five double-decker buses. Due to its particular specifications, however, Imax requires films to be shot and produced in a particular way. </p> <p>You can't just shoot footage on any old format and transfer it into large format - although this might be possible in the future. For now, large-format films must be shot using large-format equipment and with specially designed giant film stock. </p> <p>Resembling a fridge on a tripod and as noisy as a vacuum cleaner, an Imax camera needs re-loading after just a few minutes. Yet despite this, hundreds of films have been shot in Imax since the format's launch. And last year more than 75 million people visited an Imax theatre worldwide. </p> <p>Since the mid-90s, Imax Corporation has invested heavily in international expansion. It's opened hundreds of Imax theatres around the world. And it's developed further innovations with Imax technology such as Imax 3D, and \"stereo animation\" which allows animators to draw and animate freehand in 3D space. </p> <p>Without doubt the main appeal of Imax is, quite literally, the spectacle. An Imax film is larger than life - a true movie-going \"experience\". Which explains the fact that, for many years, the majority of Imax films were factual, made for a specific venue, such as a museum or visitor centre, or for theme park rides. </p> <p>This has changed, however, with growth in the number of commercial Imax cinemas, says Dennis Laws, technical manager at the BFI London Imax cinema. \"Established producers and studios have woken up to the potential of shooting in Imax,\" he says. \"With 280 Imax cinemas now worldwide, it's more appealing - and commercially viable - to make Imax films.\" </p> <p>So, Disney produced Fantasia 2000 for Imax. CyberWorld, a potpourri of computer-animated short films, is backed by DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures Imageworks. DreamWorks, meanwhile, recently confirmed plans to release an Imax 3D version of its next animated feature, Shrek, in December 2001. Even the BBC is getting in on the act, currently making an Imax film about the human body. </p> <p>\"As a film-maker, Imax is the pinnacle - it's filming the best you can ever get it, on a 90-foot screen, at 70mm resolution and in stereo,\" says Ian Bird, creative director of London-based Eye Animation Studios which produced the Liberation sequence in CyberWorld. </p> <p>\"Even though it's been around a while, I believe Imax will become the main theatrical experience for film in the future,\" he adds. \"It's more intimate and personal, for some reason. And its potential for stirring narrative is starting to be realised.\" A case in point is recent Imax production Loch Lomond: Legend of the Loch, made by British company Principal Large Format, which was acclaimed at last month's Giant Screen Theatre Association convention in Frankfurt for demonstrating the true narrative potential of Imax. </p> <p>A key issue, however, will be at what point Imax films graduate from their standard 45-minute duration to 90 minutes-plus. A key reason for their shorter length is the format's documentary heritage, Laws says. Another is caution over production costs. The economics of making an Imax movie are very different to conventional film-making. They have a far longer shelf life, for a start - which is just as well given that it can take years for investors to see a return. </p> <p>\"Traditionally, the box office split is less favourable to the film-maker than in conventional film-making,\" explains Lock London producer Phil Streather, director of Principal Large Format. \"For Imax, the box office pays for prints and advertising so the return to the distributor/film-maker is far less - perhaps $15m on $100m gross.\" Typically, just one third of an Imax film's production budget comes from equity funding, with the balance usually comprising scientific grants and sponsorship - AOL, Saab and Yahoo are among companies which have backed the format. </p> <p>The extent to which the growing interest of big studios will affect what remains, in effect, a cottage industry remains to be seen. As does how far commercial interests push Imax into narrative storytelling. Until both issues are resolved, however, it will be difficult, irrespective of hype, to justify claims that Imax has finally gone mainstream. </p> <p>\u0095 CyberWorld is released on Friday October 20</p>",
  "<p>Great directors don't always have great careers. The British film-maker Michael Reeves made only three films, between 1966 and 1968: The She-Beast, The Sorcerers, and Witchfinder General, his masterpiece. A year after making Witch-finder General, he died aged just 24, but left the world with three imaginative, low-budget movies, which - in their own modestly ambitious way - are superb examples of a very British type of cinema. </p> <p>Reeves's love of film started young. At the age of eight, he announced to his mother that he wanted to be a film director; three years later, he made his first film, Carrion, which starred his friend Ian Ogilvy as a psychotic who attacks a girl in a wheelchair. Another regular Reeves collaborator, the writer Tom Baker, worked on the film, too. \"He didn't just want to make films, he wanted to make Hollywood movies,\" Baker recalls now. \"So we had to learn how to track. For this we used his mother's tea trolley with an 8mm Bolex on top.\" </p> <p>Reeves and his mother were the poor relations of a rich family, and inherited money when Reeves was 15. He used the opportunity to take himself off to Hollywood at 17, and meet his hero, the action director Don Siegel. Somehow Reeves discovered where Siegel lived, and turned up on his doorstep, where the bewildered director appeared in a string vest and underpants. \"I've come all the way from England to meet you because you are the greatest director that ever lived,\" Reeves told him, and promptly found work in town. </p> <p>A year later he had convinced the producer Paul Maslansky to work with him on his own film, The She-Beast, to be shot in Rome and starring Ogilvy in his first major role. Reeves's goal was to make a scary movie, but cheap sets and corny lines made it obvious that nobody was going to be too scared by this tale of young holidaymakers terrorised by a monstrously deformed witch who comes back from the dead. So they camped it up instead. Made for \u00a315,000, The She-Beast remains notable for making a leading lady of the already legendary horror film icon Barbara Steele, although she was booked for only a single day. \"I managed to get her for $1,000 for one day's work,\" Maslansky recalls, \"but I didn't say how long that day was. I made her work for 18 hours. She didn't speak to me for 20 years.\" </p> <p>Having cut his horror teeth on The She-Beast, Reeves returned to England to make The Sorcerers, a brilliant forerunner of Being John Malkovich in which an old couple, Boris Karloff and Catherine Lacey, invent a machine that allows them to live vicariously through a dissolute young man (Ian Ogilvy, naturally). In an allegory for the vicarious thrills of cinema itself, the old couple's fun starts off innocently enough, with Ogilvy hanging out with groovy chicks and imbibing soft drinks at various swinging nightclubs, but slowly the old woman gets carried away and makes the young hipster carry out a series of increasingly gruesome acts. </p> <p>A moral forewarning of the dangers of a thrill-seeking lifestyle, The Sorcerers depicts an innocent time and makes it seem very sinister indeed, with nightclub scenes inevitably ending in bloodshed and various dolly birds - Susan George among them - coming to a grisly end. </p> <p>The Sorcerers was made quickly, efficiently, and on next to nothing. \"We blew up a Jaguar in Notting Hill without permission,\" Ian Ogilvy remembers. \"The blast shattered windows for blocks around, then we ran like hell. We knew that if we didn't get the right shot within minutes, we'd be in jail for sure.\" Reeves had no problem with endangering the lives of his cast, either. He and Ogilvy filmed a motorbike scene on the M4 at 100mph. Ogilvy wore no helmet, Reeves was in the boot of a car with his camera, and he demanded that his leading man come closer and closer until he was within a metre of him. </p> <p>Then came Witchfinder General. In essence an English western, it is a tale of violent revenge based on the life of Matthew Hopkins, one of Oliver Cromwell's witch-hunters, who is alleged to have ordered the death of 200 people between 1645 and 1646. Hopkins, played with great relish and twisted moral arrogance by Vincent Price, travels through the Suffolk countryside with his thuggish henchman John Stearne and murders the innocent, ostensibly to cleanse the land of evil - but in reality for profit, sexual favours, and the sheer hell of it. When he turns his wicked attentions on an old priest and his daughter, he incurs the wrath of the daughter's husband, a Cromwellian soldier played (naturally) by Ian Ogilvy, who rises up against the witchfinder's dark power. It is a brutal, shockingly violent film, yet beautifully shot, capturing - with panoramic tracking shots - the rolling English landscape under a Turneresque sky. It is an example of something hardly seen today: a uniquely British film that portrays the country's elegance as well as its oppressiveness. </p> <p>As usual, it had limited financial resources. Extra funding came from American International Pictures, and with that came Vincent Price. Used to the comfort of Hollywood, this revered, veteran actor was sent by his studio to the wilds of cold, damp and misty Suffolk, and into the hands of an extremely wilful and very resourceful 23-year-old director. The story goes that a short-tempered Reeves told Price to \"stop over-acting, please, please, please, stop rolling your eyes, and try and look natural for once.\" An offended Price replied: \"Young man, I've been in 84 films. How many have you made?\" \"Two good ones.\" At which Price burst into laughter and did exactly what the young man told him from then on. Price didn't even complain about the uncomfortable job of acting the final sequence, in which Ogilvy beats Hopkins to death with a hammer - rubber, but still rather painful for the ageing actor. </p> <p>The film was shot over five weeks in Suffolk, using a single Arriflex camera, by cinematographer John Coquillon. The few sets used were built locally, and a disused second world war aircraft hangar (rented for \u00a350 a week) was the production base. </p> <p>Lighting came courtesy of Lee Electric, who provided a noisy generator free of charge. According to Coquillon: \"Michael was 25 years ahead of his time, with the eye and the imagination of a veteran. I still wonder whether we ever worried our producers about our way of shooting Witchfinder. We were determined to make it our way and not in the conventional, accepted, boring (to us) ways of those times.\" According to Ogilvy, such conditions helped create great cinema: \"[Reeves's] ability to make do is what makes his films so interesting. How to get over a bad situation.\" </p> <p>Upon release, Witchfinder General was a critical and commercial success, despite cuts by censors concerned by its violence. Reeves was quickly swamped with scripts, but rejected most of them outright, and fell into depression. Always secretly prone to the condition, he began drinking heavily and taking anti-depressants. \"He would shut right down, maybe three to four months before he died,\" Witchfinder's writer, Tom Baker, remembers. After a couple of abandoned projects, Reeves came home one night after a skinful and had insomnia. The coroner's report states that he took a handful of anti-depressants and was found dead in the morning. </p> <p>What Reeves might have gone on to achieve is hinted at by a letter from his old cinematographer Coquillon to the American director Jeff Burr, written in 1983. Coquillon recalls a telephone conversation with Reeves when he was in Los Angeles, shortly before he died. \"One day he called me full of excitement. He'd found the story. We were going to ride around the US, shoot in 16mm and shoot every which way, into the sun and out of the sun - on motorcycles. The actor was to be a long-time LA buddy - a completely unknown son of an actor - name of Peter Fonda. The film was to be called Easy Rider. It was while planning this movie that Michael Reeves died. I still mourn the man and miss him. Always will. One doesn't get to meet many people like him.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Witchfinder General and Blood Beast: The Films of Michael Reeves will be screened at the Cornerhouse, Manchester on October 21 as part of the Britain in Darkness season.

  "<p>What is it about the famously meek and mild Hubert Selby Jr that turns civic bluenoses green at the gills? In the mid-60s his first novel, Last Exit to Brooklyn, was the subject of a famous British obscenity trial that fell midway between Lady Chatterley and the Oz \"Schoolkids issue\". Despite the fact that the cream of the British literary aristocracy trooped through the courtroom to defend Selby's merits, the book was first banned, then unbanned on appeal a year later - all this notoriety guaranteeing its publishers a runaway bestseller. </p> <p>There was no such equivalent palaver when Last Exit was filmed in the late 80s - with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the, um, \"difficult\" role of Tralala, a hooker who is multiply, horribly raped outside a bar - and was released without incident. But 35 years later, we seem to have moved no further into the future. The US ratings system seems as ossified as the 60s obscenity laws. Requiem for a Dream, Selby's 1978 junkie novel, has been filmed by Darren Aronofsky, who debuted with Pi a couple of years ago. </p> <p>Requiem has intentionally been released without a ratings certificate in the US, a strategy aimed at avoiding the Motion Picture Association of America's NC-17 rating. The NC-17 appellation was developed as an alternative to the old X rating - which was indelibly associated with hardcore porn - to distinguish non-pornographic adult movies from mere masturbation fodder. Most non-metropolitan American newspapers refused to carry advertising for X ratings and, far from drawing distinctions between X and NC-17, they have merely assumed that one means exactly the same as the other. In short, the NC-17 rating is now rightly seen as a stigma that kills movies at the box office. </p> <p>The distributors, Artisan Entertainment, claim they've been the victim of the recent clashes between Washington politicians and Hollywood studio heads over sex and violence in movies. Exhibitors at two cinema chains in New York have demanded that Artisan's ads and posters specify that no one under the age of 17 will be admitted - even though underage moviegoers aren't usually barred from unrated films. \"We agree with the request being made of us,\" says Artisan chief Amir Malin, \"but we are very concerned about the precedent this sets.\" </p> <p>\"I think this decision by our exhibitors is a dark harbinger of a cold climate of censorship that's blanketing this nation,\" added Requiem's producer Eric Watt this week. \"The really disturbing aspect of this decision is that morally bankrupt studio films will continue to be released unscathed due to their financial and political muscle, while independent films dealing with powerful themes are going to be scapegoated.\" </p> <p>The MPAA has officially rated Requiem as NC-17 - but Artisan in effect repudiated the verdict by risking an unrated release, partly because the rating was based not on any violent content, but on \"explicit sexual content\", in particular a scene in which a pimp forces a woman to have sex with a hooker before a roomful of men. At a time when even hidebound British movie censors have declared that sex on screen - even hardcore sex - is no great threat to public morals, their American equivalents are still obsessed with drawing metaphorical figleaves over the naughty bits, even as they pass violent studio movies uncut. MPAA head Jack Valenti - who used to defend the Vietnam war as LBJ's press spokesman - is equally anxious to defend the now thoroughly discredited NC-17 rating despite, or perhaps even directly because of, debacles like last year's battle over South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Directors Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the ratings process and the resulting movie as a stick with which to beat Valenti's organisation. \"Every time they asked us to cut something,\" said Stone, \"we'd take it out and put in 10 things that were much worse - and they'd pass them without blinking.\" </p> <p>Until the wildly unfair inconsistencies of the MPAA system are ironed out, we will continue to live in an upside-down moral universe in which nipples and pubic hair are deemed more threatening to the public good than machine-gun massacres and skipfuls of severed heads. \"Mommy! That lady's pointing her fully loaded boobs at me! Wah!\" </p> <p> <strong>Pin-up Paula</strong><br></p> <p> You can understand why Pamela Anderson and Dr Laura Schlessinger might object when nudie pictures of themselves turn up on the internet for the titillation of one and all, but one really has to wonder at the willingness of many women stars and celebrities to disrobe for money in the pages of America's skin mags. The parade of stars who seek empowerment by taking control of their own bimbo-isation has been endless and now presidential accuser Paula Corbin Jones plans to appear nude in Penthouse. </p> <p>You have to ask yourself if Jones - whose rhinoplasty operation will soon celebrate its second birthday - has even seen a copy of Penthouse recently. Chances are she thinks it's still a couple of degrees naughtier than Playboy's chaste and airbrushed sexual romper-room aesthetic. Wrong. Penthouse's Bob Guccione has - since the bitter \"Pubic Wars\" of the early 70s - always positioned himself beyond the Playboy pale. Opening a copy of US Penthouse today is like opening a hardcore magazine in 1975: photo layouts feature oral sex, penetration and ejaculations. This is all part of a little-remarked change in the men's sophisticate magazine market spearheaded by Larry Flynt in the early 90s, when he told his employees he wanted \"more penetration!\" (I used to toil for Flynt and this was one of many company meetings I attended with eyes popping, my chin on my chest). Now everyone's doing it - except Playboy. </p> <p>So if Paula is expecting the hazy dreamworld that enfolded Gennifer Flowers when she stripped for Hef, she needs to think again, given the relentlessly gynaecological focus of the Penthouse lens. No doubt we can also expect a retelling of her tawdry dealings with Bubba Clinton (if indeed there were any), and further discussion of the presidential member. The dividing line between \"empowerment\" and voluntary degradation seems to have disappeared completely. </p> <p>Is it only a matter of time before Hillary gets 'em off?</p>",
  "The artesian well of hatred spouting in the Holy Land is a terrible reminder that deep national grievances never drain away but instead seep underground to await their moment. The scenes in Israel and the territories are reminiscent not just of the very worst days of the occupation but of the violence that was endemic before the Israeli state was founded, when burned buses littered the roads and Jewish and Arab throats were slit every day. <p>It may well be that the two populations have indeed psychologically regressed half a century or more. Israelis have understood that they are still hated, a fact which many of them had put out of their minds in their obsession with how much they were ready to give for peace and how much gratitude and obedience they deserved in return. Some Palestinians, at least, have gone back to a time when no compromise at all could be contemplated with the enemy. </p> <p>Was all the time and effort devoted to making peace a fraud, a process of self-deception for Israelis and Palestinians, and for the US and other countries which tried to sustain it? Those, like Edward Said, who opposed Oslo root and branch, now feel justified. Yet it is arguable that it was not the Oslo process itself that led to this disaster but Israeli insistence on trying to so completely dominate and control the Palestinian future. Everything had to be arranged so that a Palestinian state could offer no threat, so that the settlements could be maintained and the lion's share of Jerusalem could be retained. In trying to prevent a future threat, the Israelis created a present danger. </p> <p>In all this, the achilles heel of Israel has been its strength. It was so strong militarily, economically and diplomatically that it did not have to bargain with the Palestinians: it could give what it wished and it could keep what it wished. It gave too little, too late: the result is evident. That is not a view which many Israelis hold. Instead, in the frightening discovery that \"You see? They want to kill us\", most may believe that the Palestinians have viciously rejected a generous offer, one that Israel should never again repeat, in favour of war. They are perplexed at Palestinian anger, see it as without cause, cannot grasp that Israeli actions and decisions are foremost among the reasons for it. </p> <p>It is true that Ehud Barak was ready to make unprecedented \"concessions\". But these, while they were genuinely politically risky for him, were only concessions if you began with the assumption that Israel's physical possession of territory was the same as legal ownership and that anything it was ready to hand over was therefore being \"given\" to the Palestinians. If you began instead with the idea that, at the very least, ownership was disputed, then the fact, for example, that Yasser Arafat never questioned Israeli control of West Jerusalem was a far bigger concession than any made by Barak. Palestinians naturally took the second view. The status of the sacred sites was a sticking point for people who believed that they had already given up too much, and Arafat knew it had to be a sticking point for him. </p> <p>There is a time for peace and a time for war, the Bible says, but in the Holy Land today the problem is that neither side wants either. The swift settlement that seemed possible only a few weeks ago is lost. Yet war is not a choice which either side can take in the long run. If anyone doubted that the military advantage lies overwhelmingly with the Israelis, in spite of Arafat now posessing large and relatively well armed security forces, the casualty figures show otherwise. Yesterday's helicopter strikes underline the disparity. This is not a struggle which the Palestinians can continue for very long, for the costs would be truly terrible, and there is a limit to the political gains, in terms of international sympathy, which the confrontation can bring. Indeed that sympathy will once again be forfeit, almost certainly, if the fighting continues much longer. </p> <p>Equally, though, as Shimon Peres pointed out on these pages, there can be no return by the Israelis to occupation, with the new war it would inevitably entail. Protecting the settlements without occupation, however, as the last two weeks have shown, probably cannot be done. War would poison the relationship between Israeli Jews and the one million Palestinian citizens of that state. Israel is neither as tough nor as ruthless a society as it used to be, nor can it afford a fundamental clash with the US, which has to balance its leaning toward Israel with its important relationships with Arab states. Since war is not possible, therefore, the Israelis and the Palestinians are condemned to some sort of agreement. </p> <p>As soon as it decided it would have to accept a Palestinian state, Israel also moved to ensure that this state would be militarily, economically and politically weak or, to be more precise, weak enough to present no threat to Israel in itself but strong enough to deter those who might present such a threat in the future. As the Palestinians grasped that this was the only state they were likely to get, they began to ponder how they might subvert such an Israeli strategy. Arafat and the Fatah leaders concentrated most on how they could deal with Israel on these terms and yet retain enough political credibility to rule. </p> <p>A movement like Hamas distanced itself from Fatah's compromises, yet did not wholly repudiate a state which it might aspire at some stage to inherit. Radicals of various kinds saw ahead a long linked struggle to strengthen the Palestinian state on the one hand and expand the rights of a growing Palestinian minority within Israel on the other, a struggle in which, thanks to the Palestinian birth rate in both places, the balance would in time shift more in their favour. In spite of the legalities of two states, Israel and Palestine would remain in some ways a single political space, and Israelis and Palestinians would continue to contend within it, even if they did not often, or ever, resort to physical violence. This, rather than \"peace\" in the romantic sense of a total reconciliation, was what seemed to lie ahead a few weeks ago. </p> <p>This was not, however, the popular understanding of what was going on. On the Israeli side, there was an unrealistic expectation that the pay-off for allowing a weak Palestinian mini-state to come into existence would be the end of all conflict and of any future claims on Israel. On the Palestinian side, people had little patience with or understanding of the idea of a long-term effort to remove the constraints Israel was building into any settlement. </p> <p>Now, the most that can be hoped for in the immediate future is a truce, followed by the restoration of some minimal cooperation. If there is then to be a new effort at creating a framework for co-existence, it will be demanding of both sides but will depend especially and crucially on a recognition by Israel that peace is undermined if you try too hard to rig history in your favour. </p> <p>\u0095 martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</p>",
  "Sixteen months after being spirited out of Kosovo, Serbia's forgotten prisoners are counting on revolution to end their daily round of torture and corruption. <p>Jails are softening their regimes as pressure piles on the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, to release the hundreds of jailed ethnic Albanians. </p> <p>However, Mr Kostunica wants to link their fate to the question of missing Serbs. He has indicated a pardon would be possible only after more than 1,000 Serbs who disappeared in Kosovo are accounted for. </p> <p>About 2,000 ethnic Albanians, arrested in Kosovo in the runup to last year's war, were transferred to jails in Serbia as the Nato bombing began. Lists are incomplete but the estimates of those still being held range from 600 to 900. </p> <p>Little has been heard of the prisoners since they vanished into jails in the cities of Nis, Sremska Mitrovice and Pozarevac. </p> <p>In Pozarevac, the Milosevic family's home town, claims of beatings and killings have been made. </p> <p>Guards allegedly formed two lines to greet the arrivals with a game of \"hot rabbit\". One by one the Albanians were ordered to run through the lines while fists, boots and sticks rained down. </p> <p>Some of the prisoners, aged 14 to over 70, were wounded during their journey from Kosovo. \"And do you know what?\" said one prison source. \"Not one of them made a sound. They didn't scream or beg for mercy. </p> <p>\"The beatings were savage but the longer it went on, the more the guards came to respect them. They had dignity and were tougher than Serb prisoners,\" the source said. </p> <p>A former prisoner told the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Centre that between seven and nine inmates were bludgeoned to death with chains. There has been no independent confirmation. </p> <p>\"Serbian prison guards tend to be badly educated and don't know much about human rights,\" said Gradimir Nalic, a lawyer who has defended some of the ethnic Albanians. </p> <p>Mr Nalic said a mafia-type extortion racket offered freedom to those who could afford to bribe judges, prosecutors and guards. \"Those left behind were the poorest.\" </p> <p>Another lawyer, Husnija Bitic, a Kosovo Albanian who has represented many of those in prison, cuts an incongruous figure. For the most part, he looks like any other lawyer, dressed in a grey pinstripe suit. The oddity is his baseball cap. </p> <p>He has good reason to wear the cap: a 7cm hole in his skull, the result of a beating by masked men who burst into his home in Belgrade on March 16. He had faced a series of death threats for working with the prisoners. </p> <p>Mr Bitic listed lots of cases of people being held without any evidence and of people being sentenced without the prosecution even putting up cases. He has not worked since the beating. </p> <p>At one stage he represented Flora Brovina, one of the best-known Kosovan prisoners whose retrial was postponed yesterday until November 16. She is accused of assisting the Kosovo Liberation Army by supplying medicine, treating wounded fighters and helping to supply them with uniforms. Although her 12-year sentence was quashed on appeal, a retrial was then ordered. There is increasing speculation that she may be released. </p> <p>Mr Bitic was particularly upset about the fate of another client, Ukshin Hoti, the leader of one of the Kosovan parties. He was allegedly released in May last year without Mr Bitic's knowledge and has not been seen since. </p> <p>Paul Miller, based in Skopje as a field researcher for the human rights group Amnesty International, said: \"Our first challenge to Kostunica to prove his commitment to the rule of law is to release prisoners of conscience such as Flora Brovina.\" </p> <p>Apart from a group of 144 mostly students and middle- class professionals from the Kosovo town of Djakovica, the prisoners tend to be farmers or labourers.</p>",
  "He held up his palms to the crowd. They were red with blood. As the mob bayed, a body clad only in grey underpants shot through the corner window of the Ramallah police station. It left a smear of blood on its descent. <p>With that, Israel and the Palestinians were effectively at war. In the tense moments before Israel exacted its retribution, witnesses described the scenes of horror in which it is thought three Israeli soldiers died at the hands of a Palestinian lynch mob. </p> <p>It was unclear exactly how many men there were, who they were or how their car had arrived in such a dangerous location at such a sensitive time. </p> <p>As the Israelis arrived at the police station yesterday morning, a crowd of more than 1,000 people was collecting around the corner at Ramallah's grand mosque for the double funeral of two men killed by Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>This was a crowd on the edge of reason, fired up by the bloody images on official television, by the martial music pounding out of radio stations and by the posters of dead Palestinians - some in school and scout uniforms - staring out from posters plastered all over town. </p> <p>In one fortnight the Palestinians have lost nearly 100 of their own. And almost every funeral, where gunmen firing in the air escort a corpse draped in the Palestinian colours to a martyr's grave, has ended with more violence. </p> <p>Yesterday's was a mob hungry for bloody revenge. </p> <p><b>'Contempt for life'</b><br> </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, called the killings \"a cold-blooded lynching\". The foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, said: \"It betrayed total contempt for the sanctity of human lives\". </p> <p>An Israeli military spokesman said the dead men were army reservists in plain clothes who were sent to reinforce the defences of Beit El, a Jewish settlement north of Ramallah. They were administrative officers reporting for duty straight from their homes, he said. </p> <p>\"On the way to the base, they literally got lost,\" said Captain Natan Gold. They were apprehended by Palestinian police at one of the checkpoints they control near the centre of town. \"Instead of being turned back at the Palestinian check point, they were forced to go to the station.\" </p> <p>Nachman Shai, an Israeli government spokesman, held the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, directly responsible for their fate. \"There is no doubt that the Palestinian Authority was involved and there is no doubt that the Palestinian mob was given a free hand to do whatever it wanted,\" he said. </p> <p>\"That shows by itself the character of people that we deal with and ... it shows that Yasser Arafat is doing everything he can in order to put the entire Middle East on fire,\" he said. </p> <p>But outside the police station in Ramallah people were convinced that the men had been members of an elite Israeli army undercover unit, feared for its night raids on local villages. They said their car had pulled up outside a local Quaker school and that the men sat for a few minutes fiddling with electronic equipment. </p> <p><b>Tribal hatreds</b><br> </p> <p>But no matter who the Israeli men were, and how they got to the police station on Nablus street, they were doomed. </p> <p>After the carnage of the last fortnight, tribal hatreds now rule the hearts of Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p>Even long-term residents of Ramallah are fearful. \"I have lived here 31 years, but I cannot walk in Ramallah alone anymore because people think I am Jewish,\" said Elizabeth Khayyo, a local Armenian woman. \"Peace, peace, peace, that is all we have heard for more than five years. Where is peace? It is in a sack.\" </p> <p>In more peaceful times Israeli troops apprehended inside Palestinian-ruled areas would have been handed over without incident. But this time the Israelis did not have a chance. Within moments of their capture word spread throughout Ramallah that four Israeli soldiers were inside the police station. Perhaps 2,000 men, some firing in the air, began swarming around the station. They came from the funeral, and from the heart of Ramallah, Manara square. </p> <p>Inside the blue gates the Palestinian police mounted the wall, automatic weapons at the ready. But they were no contest for the mob. Screaming \"Death to the Jews,\" and \"Don't betray us, hand them over,\" they surged in waves towards the station, brandishing guns, knives and iron bars. </p> <p>\"You could not count the people. They were just pushing, pushing forward towards the station,\" said one witness. \"By this point, the rabble was controlling everything.\" </p> <p>A local restaurant owner said she tried to intervene. \"I told the police to take the Jews to the district co-ordination office [the liaison for Israeli forces in the West Bank]. I told them, 'We don't want to kill them. There will be big trouble'.\" </p> <p>It was already too late. </p> <p>Fuelled by hate the mob stampeded through the gates and young men began scaling the walls of the station and overhanging trees. The police did not even fire in the air. Moments later a man appeared at the corner window, raising his blood-stained hands in triumph. </p> <p>One man was dumped out of the window. Then, witnesses said, two others were dragged out by the mob, leaving dark streaks of blood on the pavement. </p> <p>With their t-shirts pulled over their heads, they were frogmarched towards the main square. Some witnesses said the men were passed from hand to hand over the heads of their captors as the mob made a victory procession around the stone lions of Manara square. Others said the men were stabbed and their bodies burnt. </p> <p>Eventually two bodies were handed over to Israeli forces. They were burnt and severely mutilated, an army spokesman said. \"Use your apocalyptic imagination to figure out what they looked like,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>In Ramallah, meanwhile, a deep sense of dread descended as the Palestinians awaited Israel's inevitable retribution. </p> <p>Plain-clothed gunmen began to hunt down and beat reporters and television cameramen, and police appeared with loudspeakers, ordering people to return to their homes. </p> <p>As the streets emptied gunmen with Kalashnikovs took up position at five-metre intervals around the police station. Several surrounded foreign reporters and demanded to see their passports and proof that they were not Israeli citizens. In the police station an armed man in police uniform stood at the smashed window watching the scene. </p> <p>Shop shutters rolled down, and residents of blocks of flats overlooking the station barricaded themselves in their homes or joined a long stream of cars heading out of town. Those who had witnessed, or perhaps participated in, the murders refused to speak. </p> <p>\"This is the silence before the storm,\" said one policeman, who refused to give his name. </p> <p>\"I hope that Kofi Annan can do something, and that Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak can do something before there is more killing. Jews and Arabs, we are all human beings, but that does not seem to matter any more. I think that we have become like Lebanon now. I don't like blood, but this is our life.\"</p>",
  "Ex-President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist party announced leadership changes yesterday in an effort to stop the exodus of senior members as more and more factory directors switched loyalties under pressure from workers. <p>But there were signs too that the 18-member coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (Dos), which brought Vojislav Kostunica his election victory, was also nervous about the wave of strikes and factory occupations. </p> <p>\"Some of this is spontaneous, some of it is not,\" Mr Kostunica was quoted as telling the New York Times. \"It is something that worries me.\" </p> <p>The new government is preparing to open Yugoslavia's economy to foreign investors now that sanctions are being lifted and does not want industrial anarchy to develop. \"I'm having almost as much trouble from friends as from my enemies,\" Mr Kostunica added. </p> <p>Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian president, was named a vice-president of the Socialist party in an apparent attempt to stop him defecting. A longtime Milosevic loyalist, Mr Milutinovic has made ambiguous remarks about his future and earlier this week suggested he might resign as president. </p> <p>Since then, Mr Milosevic has succeeded in persuading the Serbian parliament - still controlled by the Socialists and their allies - to delay moves to dissolve itself and hold early elections. </p> <p>Mr Milutinovic had no party job and his nomination to become a Socialist vice-president was seen as a way of buying his allegiance. </p> <p>The party's secretary-general, Gorica Gajevic, resigned after taking the blame for the catastrophic performance in the Yugoslav elections. She was succeeded by Zoran Andjelkovic, an ultra-hardliner who was the last Serb governor of Kosovo before Serb forces withdrew last summer when Nato-led peacekeepers arrived. </p> <p>Serbia's deputy prime minister and Radical party leader, Vojislav Seselj, threw another spanner into the tense negotiations over forming a new Serbian government yesterday when he made his party's agreement conditional on an end to the takeovers of facto ries and companies which had Socialist party cronies as directors. He described the wave of purges and occupations as part of a \"coup\". </p> <p>\"The coup leaders are taking control of one institution after another. That's a criminal act,\" Mr Seselj declared. \"They will have to execute us or lynch us if agreement is not reached.\" He also urged Mr Kostunica to name a federal Yugoslav prime minister as soon as possible, and \"bring things back into the institutions\". </p> <p>Mr Kostunica is also causing some worry among his supporters by failing to announce any changes in the army high command. Although General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the chief of staff, expressed his loyalty to the new government, he was a longtime Milosevic supporter. General Momcilo Perisic, who leads a small party in the Dos coalition, said last weekend that sacking General Pavkovic would be one of the new president's first acts. </p> <p>The forced resignations continued yesterday, with two bosses quitting Beopetrol, a big fuel importer with links to the Socialists and the neo- communist Yugoslav Left (JUL) party of Mr Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. </p> <p>At the Lola Corporation, a large engineering plant a few miles from Belgrade, the general manager, Branko Vlahovic, told the Guardian: \"I don't know what the Socialist party's future can be.\" </p> <p>A party member himself, he saw the writing on the wall a few days before last week's uprising in Belgrade which toppled the Milosevic regime. Three days earlier, he agreed with the company's two trade unions on a general strike \"for truth\". This was the diplomatic wording for an end to the election fraud and for Mr Milosevic to admit defeat in the polling on September 24. </p> <p>Mr Vlahovic put no obstacle in the way of scores of workers who went to Belgrade for the mass protests. They were promised full pay for the day. </p> <p>\"We cooperate with many other big state companies so we cannot work without connections,\" he said in explanation of his Socialist party membership. \"That's why the general manager has to be close to government.\"</p>",
  "It is not for nothing that Yasser Arafat is known as Mr Palestine. For more than 30 years he has dominated the Palestinian national struggle. <p>First, he was the leader of the armed resistance he helped to found; then, ever more controversially, he became the champion of a what he called his \"peace of the brave\"; and now, he is the would-be president of his Palestinian state-in-the-making. His dominance has grown absolute with time. </p> <p>He occupies no fewer than 30 official posts. He occupies himself with the minutest details of control and management in Palestine proper and the diaspora. He may be exco riated for cronyism, corruption, the brutalities of his police and his disdain for what he used to call his \"Palestinian democracy\", but his people still look to him as their only possible chief. </p> <p>All potential rivals have been killed. He has appointed no successor. And there simply is no obvious one. He is an egoist; he tends to assume he is immortal. </p> <p>Yet who, or rather what, comes after him has suddenly become a very pertinent question. Two weeks ago one could, at a pinch, have prophesied that he was close to his promised land, his Palestine state within grasp. </p> <p>But, with Israeli helicopters yesterday in action against the very institutions of his Palestine Authority, Mr Palestine faces a supreme personal test, which is at the same time the supreme crisis of the whole generation of struggle which he embodied. His political, and very possibly his physical, survival, are on the line. </p> <p>Mr Arafat will not go easily. Insofar as the continued survival of this arch-survivor is the fruit of his own decisions - which of course it may no longer be - he probably faces a basic choice. </p> <p>It has been long foreshadowed by all that he has done in recent years, as he has moved further and further away from his original role as freedom fighter towards his \"partnership for peace\" - a partnership which, if it was to continue at all, was leading him into compromise after ever more discreditable compromise. </p> <p>It is a choice, which, at its most dramatic, could mean his dying, all his original revolutionary credentials restored, as the true hero of his people and martyr to the cause - or as a traitor to his people, and agent of Israel and the Americans. Less dramatically, it could mean his capture and expulsion by the Israelis, or his repudiation by his own people when the intifada that first erupted against the enemy turns against him. </p> <p>Ever since Ariel Sharon walked on to the esplanade of the al-Aqsa Mosque, the inevitability of that choice has been growing more and more acute. </p> <p>The only way Mr Arafat can preserve himself is for the former guerrilla leader to assume the mantle of the leader of a nation at war, in the hope that, with the stature thus acquired, he can eventually end the war, and achieve a peace with honour. At the moment the other course - to bow to Israel and America and end the violence - hardly seems possible. </p> <p>But what will be the price of the first course? Re-conquest of all the occupied territories? Huge civilian casualties? A full-scale war between the Israeli army and the Palestinian police? The storming of Mr Arafat's headquarters? The very worst seems possible. </p> <p>If Mr Arafat does go, one way or another, there will be no successor to lead the Palestinian people out of the catastrophe that accompanies his departure. In destroying Mr Palestine, the Israelis will have destroyed the very instrument of all their expectations. And there will only be chaos, burning hatred - and a conviction, whose portents are already clear, that there can be no peace, ever, with enemies such as them. </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",
  "Israelis who know anything of their country's turbulent history - and most know a lot - will have no trouble in recognising what the Palestinians are doing as the region sinks into mayhem, bloodshed and perhaps a wider war. <p>Like the Jews in 1948, preparing for battle as the British mandatory government packed up, Palestinians seem to be launching their bid for statehood. </p> <p>Zionists once sang: \"In blood and fire Judea will arise.\" The violence unleashed two weeks ago is seen by Arabs as the means to finally win their freedom. But it may not work out that way. Or if it does, the cost may be unbearably high. </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest tragedy of what is happening is that it seems to end the prospect of the peaceful coexistence that was the great hope of Oslo, when Yitzhak Rabin, then prime minister, grasped the hand of Yasser Arafat in 1993. </p> <p>But it is a double tragedy because, in reality, solving the problem of Israel-Palestine is not very complicated. In 1937, when the British ruled, Lord Peel's royal commission report concluded that with two competing nationalisms, the only solution was to divide this one small country between the two peoples who claimed it. </p> <p>It has taken a very long time for that simple truth to sink in. In Israel it was a view that only became respectable after the 1982 Lebanon war or, some would argue, after the intifada (uprising) which the Palestinians launched in 1987. </p> <p>But even as the idea was taking root, on the left and eventually in the centre of Israeli politics, the fatal dragon's teeth continued to be sown. </p> <p>The same settlements - some in reality fully-fledged cities - that now dot the bare hills around Jerusalem and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are in the very centre of the vortex of violence. </p> <p>The deadly Netzarim junction, scene of bloody clashes for a fortnight, guards a Jewish settlement inhabited by people who probably do not enjoy majority support in their own country. </p> <p>But Ehud Barak's version of peace, like Rabin's before him, was flawed by the assumption that the majority of these outposts would stay put, even after a final settlement. </p> <p>Yet Mr Barak acknowledged for the first time that Jerusalem could be the capital of an independent Palestine as well as Israel - exactly what prompted the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to the Temple Mount. </p> <p>Hopes for a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians have suffered terrible blows before: Rabin's assassination by an Israeli extremist; the Hamas suicide bombings on buses, the grim interlude of Binyamin Netanyahu's rule. </p> <p>Israelis' great decisions about war, peace and territory have always been agonising, divisive. Now they confront a society stunned by the fury of the Palestinians - and likely to close ranks in the face of the savagery of a lynch mob in Ramallah. </p> <p>Neither side has a monopoly of wisdom as this terrible violence spirals. Liberal Israelis were shocked by the televised death of 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah in Gaza. Yet they despair too at Mr Arafat's inability or unwillingness to control his people. </p> <p>Israelis have seen Palestinians for too long through the sights of their guns. But the destruction of Joseph's Tomb in Nablus - a Jewish religious site, just like the Muslim holy places of east Jerusalem - does not augur well for mutual tolerance. </p> <p>Israelis were staring into an abyss of uncertainty last night. But one thing is clear: whatever happens next, it will be harder than ever to come to terms with the neighbours they are doomed to live with. </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",

  "Israel unleashed its mighty arsenal of war on the Palestinians yesterday, bombing Yasser Arafat's Gaza headquarters in revenge for the brutal killing of up to three of its soldiers. <p>After a day of mob and military violence all hope of peace in the Middle East seemed extinguished. Palestinian officials said they considered the attacks by helicopter gunships on installations in the West Bank and Gaza a blatant act of aggression. \"This is a declaration of war - a crazy war,\" said Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator. </p> <p>The attacks marked the first Israeli offensive against Palestinian targets since 1994. </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, last night declared he would form an government of national unity within three days which would include the broadest possible coalition. The statement implied the inclusion of Ariel Sharon, the rightwing Likud leader whose visit to the Temple Mount two weeks ago sparked the Palestinian revolt. </p> <p>Mr Barak suggested that the peace process was over, at least for now. He said Mr Arafat \"does not appear to be a partner for peace at this time,\" and added that responsibility for yesterday's grave events lay with the mob and the Palestinian Authority which could not control it. </p> <p>Israel's deputy prime minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, accused Mr Arafat of choosing the path of confrontation. \"We are on a collision course. This is war, the diplomatic process is dead.\" </p> <p>In Gaza Mr Arafat was cheered by hundreds of Palestinians as he toured the areas hit by rockets, including a power station, a government building and a police station. In a militant response to the bombing, he said: \"Our people don't care, and don't hesitate to continue their march to Jerusalem, their capital of the independent Palestinian state,\" he said. </p> <p>The day's events began soon after 9am (BST) when a Palestinian lynch mob hacked, beat and burnt to death at least two, and possibly three, plainclothed Israeli reservists at a police station in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Israeli military officials said the men had been reporting for duty at a nearby settlement but had strayed into a Palestinian checkpoint where they were taken prisoner. </p> <p>Five hours later Israel retaliated by attacking targets in the West Bank and Gaza. Anti-tank missiles landed only yards from Mr Arafat's headquarters where just a few hours before he had been discussing the options for peace with the director of the CIA, George Tenet. </p> <p>In Ramallah helicopters took the roof off the building where the Israeli soldiers had been held. They also hit other police installations, and the Voice of Palestine radio station. </p> <p>Palestinian officials denounced the strikes as crimi nal aggression. \"It is walking on the path of madness,\" said Yasser Abd Rabbo, the Palestinian information minister. </p> <p>Tension rose further in the region when an apparent terrorist bomb ripped a hole in a US navy destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden, killing at least five sailors. Twelve sailors from USS Cole were still miss ing last night. It was not clear whether the attack was connected to events in Israel. </p> <p>Bill Clinton admitted that the peace process was in serious peril. \"The alternative to the peace process is now no longer merely hypothetical. It is unfolding today before our very eyes.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's turn of events seemed inevitable after Israeli television repeatedly broadcast horrifying footage of the Palestinian mob killing the captured soldiers. After a fortnight of clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Ehud Barak was under tremendous pressure to hit back hard. </p> <p>\"We did not declare any war, and of course we do not want to,\" the Israeli army chief of operations, General Giora Eiland, said. \"The restraint demonstrated by the Israel defence forces during this recent time was responsible policy and was aimed at reducing the level of hostility and violence. Today we had no choice but to do something more significant.\" </p> <p>Although tanks rolled into position across the West Bank, Gen Eiland said the army had restricted its attacks to helicopter gunships. He said the military had made every effort to avoid casualties, warning the Palestinian police to evacuate their posts three hours ahead of the strike. </p> <p>But Palestinian officials said the attacks amounted to an unacceptable use of firepower against a people with no airforce or armour and only a fraction of Israel's firepower. At least 27 people were reported injured in the attacks. </p> <p>By early evening the army announced an end to the attacks. But with passions inflamed to a new level it was clear that a fresh chapter had been opened in the Middle East crisis. </p> <p>The first helicopters struck at 3pm, taking out the top floor of the central Ramallah police station where the Israeli soldiers had been held, shattering windows and destroying cars parked nearby. About half an hour later they struck another police station, setting off a fire whose smoke was visible for miles. </p> <p>\"They could have killed many people,\" said a blood-spattered Palestinian doctor, who was surrounded by crowds of flag-waving youths. \"This is just the organised killing of the Palestinian people.\" </p> <p>Israel hoped its helicopters would send the Palestinians a strong signal. It appears the message has gone unheeded. </p> <p>\"We will continue fighting,\" said Marwan Barghouti, a leader of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction.\"This will never stop us.\" </p> <p>Within minutes of the Israeli attack that sentiment had percolated down to the streets of Ramallah.\"I am not afraid,\" said Nabil Khatib, standing near the flames from one police station. \"But as Palestinians now our aim is absolutely clear: a Palestinian state with a capital in Jerusalem. Until that happens, there is no peace.\" </p>",
  "There was a sense of stunned disbelief in Washington yesterday as American diplomats watched violence in the Middle East sink to its worst levels for nearly a decade. Only a few weeks ago they believed a lasting settlement to be only a few diplomatic tweaks and compromises away. <p>But the region's sorry history was always against them. If there is such a thing as a rule of thumb in the Middle East, it is that whenever peace appears close, the danger of violence is at its highest, as the stakes rise and the enemies of compromise become desperate. </p> <p>So it was in November 1995, when the soldier-turned-peacemaker, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by an Israeli extremist. A virtuous circle turned to a vicious circle. In the months that followed the election chances of his successor Shimon Peres were sunk by a string of bombings by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, ushering in the hard-line Likud leadership of Binyamin Netanyahu. </p> <p>And so it was on September 28 this year, when Ariel Sharon, accompanied by hundreds of Israeli police, lumbered across the Haram al-Sharif, known to the Jews as the Temple Mount, enclosing the Dome of the Rock, the al-Aqsa mosque and the most delicate few square yards of real estate in the region. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's intentions were clear enough. Days before his visit he had told the fiercely pro-Israeli New York Times columnist William Safire that Jerusalem \"belongs to the world's Jews, and we in Israel are its custodians. Now, for the first time in thousands of years, a leader of Israel is willing to give up sovereignty in Jerusalem.\" </p> <p>At that time, there was speculation about possible US bridging proposals aimed at closing the gap between the two sides over the fate of Jerusalem and the Haram al- Sharif in particular. One proposal envisaged Jerusalem's holy sites under UN control - a formerly unthinkable idea for Israelis and US diplomats alike. </p> <p>Negotiations were flowing in favour of the Palestinians and their leader, Yasser Arafat, so Mr Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif was not a surprise. But officials at the White House and the state department have been stunned by the Palestinian reaction, which appeared to play into Mr Sharon's hands. </p> <p>In one off-the-record briefing after the other, US spokesmen have emphasised the sense of betrayal felt by President Clinton and the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, by what they see as Mr Arafat's failure to rein in the riots. </p> <p>The Clinton administration argues it was responsible for transforming the Palestinian leader from a pariah to a major international player. Since the famous handshake with Mr Rabin on the White House lawn in 1993, Mr Arafat had been invited to the Oval Office a dozen times, more than any other foreign leader. He was sitting, bewildered, next to Mr Clinton when the Monica Lewinsky story broke in 1998. </p> <p>The White House also thought that it had achieved a breakthrough in trust with the Palestinian leader when Mr Clinton stood up for Mr Arafat in the face of Mr Netanyahu's hectoring at the Wye Plantation talks in 1998. The Ameri cans believed they had made an investment in Mr Arafat that would pay off at high-pressure all-or-nothing negotiations at Camp David in July. </p> <p>Yet when he was finally cajoled into turning up, White House officials described Mr Arafat as aloof and uncommitted, seemingly unwilling to negotiate creatively about the key sticking point, Jerusalem. </p> <p>This was to have been the jewel in the Clinton-Albright diplomatic crown after eight years of negotiation, and Mr Arafat's apparent unwillingness to cooperate explains much of the bitterness direct towards him from Washington, as the US threatens to retreat from its peacebroker role and join Israel in its bunker. </p> <p>Mrs Albright acknowledged that Mr Arafat had lost control of the Palestinian rioters, but ordered him to \"regain\" it without explaining how. US officials admit they are unsure what influence Mr Arafat has in the streets. He has locked up most of the Fatah activists, but he still has uneasy relationship with the Fatah \"Youth\" leaders, who were at the front line in the five-year intifada uprising. They see him as selling out, and they appear to be playing a prominent role in the riots. </p> <p>It has also turned out that the broader Arab world was not ready to accept the carve-up of east Jerusalem and the holy sites. Diplomatic observers say the US failed to can vas Arab capitals before the Camp David talks, and when Mr Arafat called from the negotiations to ask for guidance, they urged him not to compromise further on Jerusalem. </p> <p>Washington has attempted to make up for that mistake, and in late September officials were optimistic that something could be pulled out of the bag to salvage something before Mr Clinton left office. But yesterday, no one had any hopeful words to offer.</p>",
  "<p>When he started putting his latest novel about, Brian O'Doherty had reason to believe that there might be some interest: he had published several books already, was well-connected and had a distinguished track record stretching back 40 years across the arts. </p> <p>He was a professor of fine arts whose work is in the collections of the Met and the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and the Pompidou Centre in Paris; he had made an award-winning film about his friend, the painter Edward Hopper; written and presented television series; and held a senior position for nearly 20 years on the US equivalent of the Arts Council. </p> <p>In short, 72-year-old O'Doherty had done rather a lot for a writer described as an unknown when he was shortlisted for the Booker prize. \"It was a despised book that I had put all my heart and soul into,\" he says, sitting by the swimming pool of his weathered-wood home in the Hamptons, at the far end of Long Island. \"It went round and round the publishers. They said: 'Well, I suppose it is well written, but who needs another dark Irish novel?' They turned it down, sometimes contemptuously. I don't mind being turned down in this life, but don't do that.\" </p> <p>Even now that The Deposition of Father McGreevy has earned a measure of recognition for its literary merit, the indignities have not receded entirely. The amazon.com listing for O'Doherty's book suggests that if you have enjoyed it you might like to try, among others, Knick Knack Paddy Whack, by the comedian Ardal O'Hanlon. </p> <p>O'Doherty laughs this off, as he does many things, the irreverent Irishman at the heart of American high culture. During a break in a lunch of turkey and caesar salad he leans across and creases his lean face, under a flop of silver hair, into a rude story \"while the ladies are away\". This involves a misunderstanding of the term \"a U-turn\" by a gentleman who \"can bring tears to a ewe's eyes\" and is not entirely gratuitous, given an episode in his novel. </p> <p>But if the big publishers had had their way we would never have got this far, to the bright, open-plan house surrounded by trees and lifted by art that he shares with his wife of 40 years, the painter and art historian Barbara Novak. The Deposition of Father McGreevy was taken up and championed by some of his influential friends in Manhattan and elsewhere, but it made no difference. He received a letter from Seamus Deane, who won the Guardian fiction prize and was himself shortlisted for the Booker, for Reading in the Dark. That was reassuring, but it still did not get O'Doherty's book into print. \"It's good to have a friend in court, but the court wasn't there,\" he says. </p> <p>Finally, the manuscript fell into the hands of a man who was a rare part of the writer's forgotten past. Jonathan Rabinowitz was a small publisher who, 25 years previously, had taken a class in art writing at Columbia University. \"Slowly, a very remote penny dropped,\" says O'Doherty. \"I remembered a very dark, insecure man who had done the best work in many years. At the end, he disappeared before I ever spoke to him. A great writer was lost and instead went into the great industry of publishing.\" </p> <p>Rabinowitz's Turtle Point Press published the book, the reviews were good and O'Doherty was entitled to feel rather pleased with himself, especially when the Booker judges paid attention. \"The Booker is validation for toil, sweat and the joy of writing,\" he says. </p> <p>Father McGreevy is an allegory about a village on the west coast of Ireland, destroyed by illness, gossip and rumour at the end of the 1930s. The events, recorded in a deposition by the local priest, are picked up decades later by a journalist in a pub in London. The author is proud that he has given the Irish language a starring role. </p> <p>Rabinowitz, understandably, is also delighted. \"The Booker means a great deal in the US. The phone's been ringing off the hook.\" In fact, the Booker shortlist receives scant mention in the mainstream US press, and is nothing compared with the internecine literary dogfights in the British isles. </p> <p>It is perhaps a testament to the broad outlook of the new Ireland that this was represented as well in Dublin as in mainland Britain. \"The panel should hang its head in shame,\" said the Irish Times, despite the fact that the list includes two Irish writers (though both, admittedly, live abroad). </p> <p>When the nominees are announced for the National Book Award, the Booker's nearest equivalent in the US, it appears in the press without any great fanfare and a month later the prize is awarded. Yesterday's New York Times welcomed this year's selection with the sanguine headline: \"National Book Award Finalists Announced\". The piece below it proceeds from start to finish without anyone having a cultural seizure or denouncing the judges as \"wankers\", as one British publisher did when Vikram Seth was excluded from the Booker list seven years ago. </p> <p>O'Doherty prefers to draw encouragement from the disputatious approach, and nothing would keep him away from the Booker prize dinner at the Guildhall in London on November 7. \"I'm glad someone's worked up about literature,\" he says. \"I'm going there with bells on. I know I'm an outsider, but what is greater than the unexpected?\" </p> <p>Indeed, much about O'Doherty is unexpected. For one thing, he is also Patrick Ireland. This was the name he adopted, and under which he has shown all his art, since Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. \"That was very upsetting and there was nothing I could do about it,\" he says. His conceptual art, paintings and sculptures will continue to appear under that name until the British military presence has been removed from Northern Ireland. </p> <p>But O'Doherty/Ireland goes out of his way to say: \"Patrick Ireland is not a terrorist. I've been accused of that. I don't hate the British or the Irish or the church.\" He makes a point also of mentioning the five presidents of the US with a Protestant Irish background, and makes light of his adoption of dual US/Irish citizenship. He did it, he says, only because his wife got fed up waiting for him at the non-US citizens queue at Kennedy airport. </p> <p>\"I said, 'Now I'll have to take responsibility for Vietnam and the repression of minorities.' I've had people come up to me and say, 'You're the spit of Brian O'Doherty, but he's much nicer.' \" </p> <p>Patrick Ireland is only one of his alternative identities. O'Doherty, who was born in Ballaghaderrin, county Roscommon, trained for what he calls the family business and practised as a doctor when he was a young man. He continued to paint all the while and a year working in a cancer hospital was enough to convince him that it was time for a change. \"After that, nothing matters that much.\" </p> <p>New York had always been his goal and he moved to the US in 1957. \"What I am, I am because of America. It's the American dream, in a way.\" His dream took him into a world peopled by painters such as Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock's widow Lee Krasner (Pollock had died the year before). </p> <p>A retrospective of Krasner's work has opened recently at Brooklyn Museum of Art, but his wife is hesitant about going. The couple are confirmed Manhattanites, and Brooklyn does not figure much on their schedule, even if it is much closer to their apartment on the Upper West Side than is their home in the Hamptons where, they make plain, they are not part of the social set. </p> <p>He took a job working as an art critic on the New York Times. He was a naughty boy in those days, he says - he is sorry to see that journalists affect a preference for mineral water with lunch these days - but this did not exactly hold him back. Later he was an arts reporter on network television, won a prize for writing and directing a documentary, published several books about art and spent 19 years as director of film, radio and television programmes at the National Endowment for the Arts. He also found time for more than 40 one-man shows devoted to his work, and is still professor of fine arts and media at the Southampton College campus of Long Island University. </p> <p>All this, and yet he describes seeing Stanley Matthews play football as one of the transcendent moments of his life. He has time, too, for the former German international sweeper Franz Beckenbauer, and will be spending this evening watching the New York Mets - dismissed by Yankees fans as New York's \"other baseball club\" - attempt to win a place in the World Series. He supports the Mets because of their blue-collar, underdog status. </p> <p>O'Doherty and Novak never had children and, while there were small regrets at one time, they are satisfied that they have led full lives. Or, at least, she is. He wishes he had become a full-time film director. That, he says, would have been the field in which he could have made best use of all his talents. Now there is not enough time left. \"I was not going to let other people determine the limits of my life. I believe deeply that our social pressures and lives limit people enormously and nullify their potential for development. People have more in them than they allow.\"</p>",
  "<p>The pupils of Uckfield community college were enjoying the applause for their performance of the musical Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo - which features the song \"Let it rain, let it rain\" - when the heavens opened. </p> <p>By yesterday morning five inches of rain had fallen in 12 hours and their picturesque town in East Sussex was waist deep in muddy floodwater and sewage. </p> <p>All day long emergency workers rescued men, women and children from the torrent. The people of Uckfield had been awoken by the frightening sounds of breaking glass and rushing water as the River Uck burst its banks and flooded the town. </p> <p>Residents were plucked from the first floors of their houses by lifeboatmen working in unfamiliar territory, 15 miles inland. A supermarket's windows were burst open by the force of millions gallons of water, and soggy produce floated away. </p> <p>Yet people still tried to get into work. A local jeweller was swept off his feet by the current as he tried to open his shop on the high street at 7.20am. Vernon Jay was winched out of the water half a mile away by a helicopter. </p> <p>A neighbour, Darren Marshall-Dean, said: \"I looked out of my window and could see Vernon being sucked down the high street in the torrent. He didn't even have a chance to scream, the water was so fierce.\" He was found clinging to a shop front half a mile away and was eventually pulled from the water. </p> <p>As the worst floods locals could remember rose across tranches of southern England, many areas were cut off. Car and lorry drivers had to abandon their cars, or sit on their roofs and await rescue. In the car park of Etchingham railway station, near Hastings, vehicles began to float and crunch into one another. Roads were blocked and railway lines impassable. </p> <p>In Lewes, continuing torrential rain combined with high tides meant that many homes had to be evacuated. Emergency services were stretched to breaking point as staff fled fire and ambulance control rooms as the water flooded in. </p> <p>Council staff drove around with a loud-hailer to warn residents in low-lying areas to leave their homes and meet at the town hall or at a leisure centre on higher ground. By yesterday afternoon hundreds of homes were underwater. </p> <p>Those who had gathered in safety watched as beer barrels floated outside Harvey's brewery, which was under more than 20ft of water. Nineteen workers were plucked from the brewery roof. </p> <p>The cost of the damage will run into the millions, prompting many to ask why more is not being done to protect their homes from the floodwaters. The Environment Agency and weather forecasters repeated their warning that global warming is likely to make serious floods more common in the coming years. </p> <p>The Environment Agency launched a new flood warning system only a few weeks ago. It has done away with the old system of classifying floods as yellow, amber or red. Now it has introduced what it believes is a clearer system and is spending \u00a32m on a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of flooding. </p> <p>By 3pm yesterday it had issued \"severe flood warnings\", indicating that there was imminent danger to life and property on 10 rivers in East Sussex and Kent. There were also 47 \"flood warnings\" and \"flood watches\" on 92 rivers across England and Wales from the Isle of Wight to Yorkshire. </p> <p>Archie Robertson, director of operations of the Environment Agency, said the amount of rain which had fallen in some places was \"unheard of\". </p> <p>But, of course, there was nothing they could do to stop the rain. The government agency said that in the past 72 hours northwest Kent and East Sussex had seen 180mm (7ins) of rain. Some 130mm (5ins) had fallen in just 12 hours. </p> <p>Five lifeboat crews were escorted into the area by police. One crew rescued six children who were swept away while playing near the railway line. Others rescued a group of 20 men, women and children from the Somerfield supermarket in Uckfield, and from flats above the high street. The supermarket's windows caved in under the pressure of the water and stock floated off down the street. Children grabbed footballs, dolls and boxes of chocolates. Some adults could not resist either. One young man wading through the water with a trolley of goods was stopped by a policeman who used a JCB to reach him. </p> <p>The town's mayor, Mike Skinner, said: \"Our entire industrial estate of about 400 businesses has been flooded out, as well as around 30 shops in the town centre. There is flotsam and jetsam everywhere.\" </p> <p>Six members of a lifeboat crew had a narrow escape when their boat was dragged underneath a bridge in Lewes which had been almost submerged by water. The men leapt on to the walkway over the River Ouse seconds before their dinghy, battered by strong currents, vanished. One toppled into the water and had to be plucked to safety by his colleagues. </p> <p>East Sussex Fire Brigade control room was evacuated after a newly built retaining wall alongside River Ouse collapsed. The ambulance service had to send emergency mobile control vehicles to high ground to operate an emergency satellite radio and 999 control. </p> <p>The emergency services were stretched to breaking point. Every available fire crew in East Sussex was this morning pumping flood water from properties while Environment Agency workers tried to keep swollen rivers flowing. </p> <p>The AA was dealing with 500 calls an hour in the region, with some drivers saying they could not find their cars in the floods. </p> <p>The M20 and M2 in Kent were badly hit. Many smaller roads were impassable. The water turned part of the M25 into a skidpan and there was a string of minor accidents. </p> <p>Thousands of commuters could not get into work. Rail services into London were affected and the Balcombe rail tunnel in Sussex was flooded, preventing any electric trains from passing. </p> <p>Met Office forecasters warned there was more rain to come in southeast England but with easing on Friday. </p> <p>However, the relief is likely to be short-lived. </p> <p>The director of the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Research, Alan Thorpe, said current research showed Britain will have wetter winters and, in northern areas, slightly wetter summers. \"The number of days of very heavy rain could increase substantially, so the risk of flooding is likely to increase,\" he said. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Past deluges</strong></p> <p><strong>1953</strong> Storm and high seas combined with heavy rain saturated the east coast of England, and 307 people died. Over \u00a330m damage was caused after severe flooding swamped roads, and the pier at Skegness was destroyed. </p> <p><strong>1960</strong> Floods in the south west, south Wales and south west midlands blocked many main roads. Two people drowned and hundreds of houses were flooded. The rivers Taw, Avon and Wye reached six metres above normal level. </p> <p><strong>1968</strong> Eighteen people died and 3,000 houses, shops and other properties were flooded and damaged across the country. Worst affected areas were in Bristol, Somerset and Devon. Bridges collapsed and roads were destroyed. </p> <p><strong>1978</strong> East Anglia and the east coast were lashed by gales and flood tides. The rivers Ouse and Nene flooded over 1,000 houses. In Wisbech a woman drowned in her own home. </p> <p><strong>1990</strong> Sea defences were breached by storms and high tides. More than 1,000 people were evacutated from Towyn in north Wales and parts of the south west.

  "<p>Why can't this family just get along?\" </p> <p>- Meadow Soprano. </p> <p> There was a floral tribute at the Kray funeral from The Boys In New York. Uh-huh. None was recorded from The Boys In New Jersey, who were unavoidably engaged at the time, bleeding over the scenery. </p> <p>At the end of the first series, all the senior Sopranos had tried and failed to kill each other. You could not fault their energy or ingenuity. It was sheer bad luck. Livia (\"Mommy Dearest\") Soprano was in intensive care with a stroke brought on by pure rage at the failure of her labyrinthine plot to kill her son. Junior (\"Mr Magoo\") Soprano, the older-than-god godfather, was in jail. Only Tony (\"I'm not fucking insane\") Soprano was left standing. </p> <p>I may have misheard a word or two. Listening to The Sopranos is like your first encounter with Rab C Nesbitt. You think you've gone deaf. After a while you can pick up the tune of it, even if you still miss some of the lyrics. </p> <p>Uncles can come out of jail and mothers can come out punching. Which brings us, via the most spine-tingling opening titles on TV, to the second series of <strong> The Sopranos</strong> (C4). James Gandolfini got a well deserved, if overdue, Emmy for playing Tony Soprano in this series, and deserved a suitcase of used notes. It is an object lesson in acting to watch his eyes suddenly start to slide. </p> <p>Tony's saving grace is his humour, or what \"Big Pussy\" Bompensiero calls his jokey shit. Pussy, whom we all feared was down a well, wisely went to Puerto Rico for his health and has returned looking, said Tony, like a tanned ghost. The Sopranos is ferociously funny and, of course, vice versa. Excessive ferocity is itself funny. </p> <p>I have sometimes wondered what happened to the Romans. One day there they were, running the world, and the next they were making tutti frutti. So where did the Romans go? On this showing, New Jersey. </p> <p>Livia, played by the irreplaceable Nancy Marchand who died in June, has the same name as the Empress Livia, matriarch of the more obviously insane Caesars. It is a name derived from the Latin word for malignity. Livia is probably the world's most trying mother-in-law. Tony's wife says, tolerantly, that she is a peculiar duck and the reason Tony needs extensive therapy. Unfortunately shrinks take to the hills when approached for a consultation, and even the deliciously cool Dr Jennifer Melfi is downright icy. Sometimes Tony's world seems to slow down like an old gramophone and close friends look treacherous... </p> <p>\"Cunnilingus and psychiatry brought us to this!\" says Tony memorably. I would really like to explain this but I don't think I will. </p> <p>With Livia defanged or deranged (\"Let me die! I saw a light! Voices calling out to me!\"), a new Soprano has joined the snake pit. Tony's sister, Janice, is a hippy who prefers to be known as Parvarti, a Hindu goddess. \"Hey Parvarti, take it easy,\" says Tony as she smacks a passing fly. \"According to you, that could have been Robert Mitchum.\" As goddesses go, Parvarti is not someone you would care to share a table with in an all-night cafe. She is associated with ferocity, destruction and strings of skulls. And don't act like you are amazed. You know you are not. </p> <p>WARNING: Do not accept any social invitation immediately after watching an episode of The Sopranos. It is best to allow a full eight hours for the effects to disperse. Otherwise you will find yourself greeting quite old and valued friends with a fond \"Come here you fat fuck!\" </p> <p>Which brings me smoothly to <strong> Fat Friends</strong> (ITV) by Kay Mellor - a short series about people in a slimming club. There is a quite distinctive feel about it. It is cosy, domestic, acutely observed, touching and looks dead easy. In the first episode (and the powerful company of Alison Steadman and Barrie Rutter), Ruth Jones was strikingly delightful as the overflowingly fat and sassy Kelly. We meet her failing to force herself into a flouncy wedding dress. It is, you feel, entirely the fault of the wedding dress for failing to get into the fun of things. Kelly's ebullience recalls Two Ton Tessie O'Shea, who used to sing bouncily to a disconcertingly small banjo: \"There a little bit here and a little bit there and it all belongs to me.\" </p> <p>There is a series of celebrity cameos during the series. One is Judy Finnigan.</p>",
  "<p>British insurance companies have for several years been demanding that applicants for life insurance reveal the results of a number of genetic tests. </p> <p>They do not compel applicants to take the tests - simply to say what the results were if they have taken them. </p> <p>Tests are only likely to be taken by people who believe they are at risk of contracting the disease concerned, usually because of family history. </p> <p>In each case, certain patterns of mutations in single genes, or pairs of identical genes, are known to give an extremely high risk of the patient getting the disease. </p> <p>Genetic tests of this kind are still relatively rare. Most common diseases, such as cancer, are thought to be the result of a combination of environmental and genetic factors. In a genetic test, a sample of DNA - the chemical in which genes are encoded - is extracted from a patient's body, often from blood cells. This is then analysed to check for mutations in the suspect gene. </p> <p>Equipment to carry out these tests is becoming faster, making it likely that genetic testing will become more common for diagnosis in future. </p> <p>The seven genetic tests where the Association of British Insurers demands disclosure are for: </p> <p>\u0095 Huntington's disease </p> <p>\u0095 Familial Adenomatous Polyposis </p> <p>\u0095 Myotonic dystrophy </p> <p>\u0095 A form of Alzheimer's </p> <p>\u0095 Multiple endocrine neoplasia </p> <p>\u0095 Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I </p> <p>\u0095 Hereditary breast cancer, where a single gene is involved.</p>",
  "<p>Insurance companies will continue to demand information about seven genetic tests from potential customers, even if the government, as expected, only approves one of them, the industry's lobby group has said. </p> <p>A government watchdog body is set to give insurers the nod today to use the results of a single genetic test, for Huntington's disease, when it considers applications for life insurance. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said yesterday that they saw no reason to wait for the government to approve use of the other six tests, and would carry on using them unless they were told to stop. \"There is no agreement or legislation to say we can't use these test results,\" she said. \"In our discussions with the government, that wasn't on the agenda.\" </p> <p>The ABI says that if the watchdog, the genetics and insurance committee, does eventually give any of the tests the thumbs down, it will compensate customers who have been made to pay higher premiums. </p> <p>People with a family history of Huntington's disease can choose to have their DNA analysed for mutations in a particular gene which, if present, mean they are certain to contract the fatal brain condition, even if they appear to be perfectly well. </p> <p>Insurance companies say they will not try to force anyone to take the test. But if a potential customer has been tested, they insist on knowing. A positive test for the Huntington's gene would result in increased premiums. </p> <p>Reaction to the committee's likely endorsement of the test has been muted, partly because Huntington affected families have long faced genetic discrimination. Even without a genetic test, insurers require applicants to report any history of Huntington's in the family. </p> <p>\"The people likely to be affected by these proposals are the people who already know they have a family history, and if they try to get insurance they will already have come up against a family history clause in life insurance applications,\" said John Gillott of the Genetic Interest Group, which lobbies on behalf of charities for sufferers of genetic diseases. </p> <p>Another of the illnesses where insurers already use genetic information is a rare form of Alzheimer's disease, affecting several hundred people in Britain. Like Huntington's, there appears to be a genetic test capable of predicting accurately whether someone is likely to get the disease or not. </p> <p>More controversial is the test for an inherited form of breast cancer. Here, the presence of mutations only gives a healthy person an increased chance of getting the disease, not a certainty. This genetic test is not endorsed by the genetics and insurance committee but factored in by insurance companies. </p> <p>The National Consumer Council criticised the insurance companies yesterday, saying people would choose not to have medically important genetic tests for fear of it being used against them.</p>",
  "The home secretary, Jack Straw, may be forced to release Myra Hindley and other murderers against his will under the new Human Rights Act, the lord chief justice said yesterday. <p>Judges may well remove the home secretary's power to decide the \"tariff\" or earliest date of release for murderers, Lord Woolf predicted in an interview in the New Statesman. </p> <p>Asked if Mr Straw was legally right to insist on keeping the power to decide when murderers are set free, he replied: \"I would be very surprised if he proves to be correct.\" </p> <p>Hindley's case could be one of the first challenging the home secretary's role to come before the judges under the new act, which came into force in October. Her lawyers have already filed a claim on her behalf at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. </p> <p>They argue that allowing the home secretary to set the \"tariff\" breaches the right to a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 of the European convention on human rights, because in effect a politician rather than a judge fixes the sentence. </p> <p>Last December in a case brought by the murderers of two-year-old James Bulger, the Strasbourg court removed the home secretary's right to set a tariff for underage killers sentenced to detention at her majesty's pleasure - the juvenile equivalent of a life sentence for murder. </p> <p>Hindley's lawyers also plan to bring her case back before the English courts now that the Human Rights Act has come into force. She lost her challenge to her \"whole life\" tariff in the House of Lords last year, but the court could not rule on whether the home secretary's role in setting the tariff breached her right to a fair trial because the European convention on human rights was not yet part of English law. </p> <p>Hindley is among 23 prisoners serving life for brutal murders - who also include her accomplice Ian Brady - for whom the home secretary has set a whole life tariff, insisting \"life should mean life.\" For murders with no aggravating or mitigating features the standard tariff is 14 years. For Hindley's part in the sadistic murders of four children, the then lord chief justice, Lord Lane, recommended a tariff of 25 years in 1988, but she has now served 34. </p> <p>Lord Woolf, who sat in the court of appeal on Hindley's previous case, said Mr Straw had been wrong to take the view that life should mean life and had not dealt with the matter correctly. </p> <p>However, \"one has to accept the constraints of the law as it is,\" he said and told Hindley that Mr Straw was entitled to say at that stage that he would not release her, as long as he kept the case under review. </p> <p>\"I see no possible objection to sentencing someone to life as long as there is in place a proper, objective machinery for review. We do not have that at present in cases like Myra Hindley's.\" </p> <p>The lord chancellor said last month that the government might in rare cases refuse to comply with judges' human rights rulings, in what was taken as a reference to cases like Hindley's. </p> <p>But Lord Woolf said he expected Mr Straw to give way to the judiciary, whether he liked it or not. \"I do not see any home secretary, except in the most exceptional circumstances, being prepared to go to parliament and say: 'We want to pass legislation that is inconsistent with the Human Rights Act'.\" </p> <p>\"Jack Straw says that the ruling [of the Strasbourg court on James Bulger's killers] does not apply to adults. If he's wrong about that, I would expect him to do what he did in regard to juveniles. He may not like it, but that is what he would do.\" </p> <p>He signalled that government proposals to lock up dangerous people with severe personality disorders who had committed no crime were likely to be shot down by the judges if they went ahead. He would be \"very unhappy if the courts were drawn in to compulsorily sentence someone who has not committed an offence.\"</p>",
  "The world's largest tobacco company, Philip Morris, admitted for the first time yesterday that cigarettes are addictive and harmful, during public hearings in Geneva in the run-up to a global treaty on tobacco control. <p>Until yesterday, despite scientific evidence and internal industry documents that have been revealed in litigation in the United States, tobacco companies have refused to acknowledge that vast numbers of people are hooked on nicotine. The companies always claimed that people smoke out of choice. </p> <p>\"We agree that smoking is addictive and causes disease in smokers,\" announced David Davies, Philip Morris Europe's vice president for corporate affairs, at a news conference. \"Today I affirm we are in step with public health authorities.\" </p> <p>His historic admission was dismissed by anti-tobacco compaigners as a clever piece of footwork by the industry, which is trying to win inclusion in the World Health Organisation's negotiations on a global tobacco treaty which begin on Monday. Campaigners believe the tobacco industry would attempt to water down the treaty and would drag out negotiations if its representatives are included in the discussions. </p> <p>Mr Davies' position yesterday was that, however addictive and damaging cigarettes are, the public have a right to smoke if they want to. Public health campaigners will argue that this stance is illogical and that someone who is addicted is stripped of choice in the matter. </p> <p>Philip Morris supported \"sensible\" regulation of tobacco products and their sales, marketing and advertising, said Mr Davies, but opposed \"any proposal which would constitute a prohibition on the ability of companies like ours to make cigarettes and the ability of informed adults to choose to use cigarettes\". </p> <p>It opposed uniform global tax rates and called for countries to outlaw the sales and marketing of cigarettes to under 18s - a measure which health campaigners say is totally ineffective in preventing children from starting to smoke. </p> <p>Mr Davies promised the company would share its own research with WHO scientists and take steps to combat smuggling. There was laughter from the audience when Mr Davies said Philip Morris regretted a decision last week by the European court to throw out legislation that would have banned almost all tobacco advertising and sponsorship in the EU by 2006. </p> <p>Matthew Myers, president of the US-based non-governmental organisation Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, dismissed the remarks as \"an insidious effort by Philip Morris to prevent strong government regulation\". </p> <p>Tobacco companies and public health groups have come face to face for two days of public hearings on tobacco control, which was the WHO's answer to the demands of the industry to be included in negotiations on the framework convention on tobacco control. Over 500 submissions came in from all over the world and have been posted on a dedicated website. </p> <p>In spite of enthusiasm for the treaty from the public health community, it will not be easy to get agreement on specifics. Tobacco growing employs many people in the developing world and cigarettes are a big source of tax revenue for governments. The WHO wants its 191 member states to agree on international duties on cigarettes, a clampdown on smuggling, a total ban on advertising, the outlawing of public smoking worldwide and support for farmers who stop tobacco farming. </p> <p>British American Tobacco, the other tobacco giant, backed national action to stop minors from smoking. But it did not support the proposed international convention and asked the health agency to concentrate on policy advice and research.</p>",
  "The Israeli army said they were unarmed reservists who had taken a wrong turning near Ramallah. The Palestinians said they were undercover members of Israeli death squads. The Palestinian police claimed they had tried to protect the two men when a mob attacked the police station where they were being held. Israelis believe the two were sacrificed by Palestinian security forces already deeply complicit in the violence of the past two weeks. The young men who beat and stabbed the Israelis' mutilated bodies in the street seemed to think they had struck a blow for freedom. But many Israelis will find in this horrific act a confirmation of their belief that there can be no peace with such an enemy. <p>The retaliatory Israeli helicopter and naval attacks that ensued were, in the defence force's menacing view, a \"token signal\" of their country's wrath. But Palestinians, and the Arab world, saw the assault on Yasser Arafat's Gaza compound as a declaration of war. Thus in the space of a few, terrible hours, the enormous gulf of misunderstanding, distrust, and violence that has in recent weeks rapidly opened up between these erstwhile \"partners for peace\" is shockingly dramatised. \"There is no peace process today. The peace process is dead,\" said Israeli minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer. Perhaps he is wrong. Perhaps dialogue can eventually be revived with less ambitious, incremental goals. But perhaps he (and many leading Palestinians) are right. Perhaps October 12 will indeed come to be remembered as the moment when the hopes raised after Mr Arafat shook hands with Yitzhak Rabin at the White House in 1993 finally died in a maelstrom of missiles, knives and bullets. </p> <p>If so, the Middle East may yet reap an awful harvest. For, in the absence of peace, what does war mean? For the Israelis, it will undoubtedly mean a closing of ranks, the return of a siege mentality, and in all probability, an even greater military ruthlessness in the unquestioned, unquestionable cause of national self-defence. For hapless prime minister Ehud Barak, it means the utter failure of the peace platform upon which he was elected last year. It means, in all likelihood, the formation of a national unity government with Ariel Sharon, the rightwing leader of Likud, and the withdrawal of all previous Israeli offers and suggested compromises on the return of occupied territory, recognition of a Palestinian state, and the shared administration of Jerusalem. It brings the prospect of renewed terror, settlement killings, suicide bombs and daily, paralysing fear. </p> <p>For the Palestinians, the triumph of violence, an end to dialogue, would be equally horrendous. For all the Arab world's bombast and threats, the Palestinians are always left to fight their battles alone. Yet they have no army to send against Israel; in military terms, it is a war they cannot win. It means, prospectively, the ascendancy of the extremists as, perhaps, the discredited Mr Arafat and his corrupt Palestinian Authority are pushed aside. It may bring an end to much western aid and support contingent on the peace process. It may even mean the loss of that land which has, through negotiation, been wrested from Israeli control. Without a shadow of a doubt, it means that Palestine's people will continue to die, but in ever greater numbers; and that tears and blood, and yet more tears and blood, will ultimately be all they share with the state of Israel. </p> <p>This is a disaster that can still be avoided. But who can bridge this divide, this calamitous, widening gulf of hate and fear? Who can work the miracle? For it is a miracle the Middle East needs now.</p>",
  "\u0095 Certain South African institutions, and the SABC in particular, are legitimate targets for liberal protest, but Christopher Hope (Just like old times, G2, October 11) is unfair. <p>White racism is not a bogeyman; South Africa is saturated and dripping with it.

  "\u0095 As an Israeli who campaigns for human rights together with Palestinians, I disagree with Jonathan Freedland's description of the crisis as \"a religious war\" (Doves must be hawks, October 11). This week in Nazareth, armed Israeli civilians and police carried out what can only be described as a pogrom, indiscriminately clubbing and shooting both Christian and Muslim Palestinians. Three Palestinians were shot dead and dozens were injured. <p>A close friend from Galilee is devastated after losing her 17-year-old son, Asil Asleh. Armed Israeli police beat him and then shot him through the neck at close range. He was a well-known peace activist and at the time of his execution, as reported by you, he was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with \"Seeds of Peace\" (Israeli Arabs enraged by underclass life, October 6).

They then all voted against resolution 194 about refugees \"willing to live in peace with their neighbours\". This reduces the present riot to a dust-in-the-eyes exercise. The proof is that Arafat refused this summer's offers on Jerusalem because the price was the indifferently reported requirement to end the conflict and its claims altogether. The Palestinian Authority will have to accept that while Israel can be pushed about small items of territory, it can no more be pushed off self-determination than the Arabs. </p> <p>Meanwhile if Belfast erupted in a shower of bricks, would it be a \"peaceful\" demonstration?

The truth is that it is Israel that faces its moment of truth. Israel's strategy has for many years been based on the idea that it can take by force what it wants and compel the Palestinians and the Arabs to accept it; the idea that Palestinians and Arabs can be forced to \"lower their expectations\". But with the conflict becoming much more political and popular, rather than elite and military, Israel's options have become much more restricted. </p> <p>Is Israel seriously going to reoccupy the towns and villages of the West Bank? Even if Israel does not itself care about the massive losses of Palestinian life that will be involved, its reputation will take a further nosedive. Is Israel really going to re- occupy the south of Lebanon and build another security zone, at a time when Hizbullah is much better organised and equipped than it was in the early 1980s and when Israel no longer has any \"local\" agents willing to do its bidding?

  "It was as the artist for the Eagle comic's Adventures Of PC 49 in the 1950s that John Worsley, who has died aged 81, really reached an audience. From his first episode, published in August 1951, he drew the tales of 49 - Archibald Berkeley-Willoughby - until March 1957. Some 290 episodes, involving more than 3,000 drawings, appeared in Eagle comic alone, with further tales in the Eagle Annual and various spin-off books. Three-quarters of a million schoolboys relished every brushstroke each week. <p>Worsley also worked for the Eagle's companion paper, Girl, drawing Belle Of The Ballet, and, beyond that, turned his talent to an extraordinary range of work. </p> <p>This included Albert RN, the dummy sailor at the centre of a daring wartime escape plan from Marlag O prisoner-of-war camp, near Bremen. Worsley, himself a sailor PoW at the camp, created the life-sized figure out of wire and papier-mache, after which it was held between two soldiers during roll call, fooling the camp guards into thinking they had a full complement of prisoners while a British escaper made his getaway. </p> <p>For four days, Albert, with his ping-pong ball eyes and no hands (his sleeves were stuffed into his jacket pockets), stayed on parade; unfortunately, the escaper was recaptured on the northern coast of Germany. Two months later, Albert was finally rumbled when a second escape attempt was foiled, and the camp guards realised they had one too many prisoners. </p> <p>Back in England, Guy Morgan, a former fellow PoW, immortalised Albert RN in a play, which, in 1953, became a film starring Anthony Steel as a fictionalised version of Worsley. The artist himself recreated Albert for the movie, and the dummy is now kept at the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth. </p> <p>Born in Liverpool, Worsley was the son of a naval officer who settled on the family coffee farm at Kabuka, north of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. It was here, amid spectacular scenery and at an altitude of 6000ft, that Worsley grew up, shooting and messing around in the family model-T Ford when not attending school. </p> <p>This idyllic life ended in 1928, as coffee prices collapsed. John was sent to St Winifred's boarding school, his fees subsidised by the Royal Navy Trust. He won a scholarship to Brighton College, and spent three years at Goldsmiths College school of art. In his final year, he purchased a second-hand Fiat for \u00a34, and, after leaving college, travelled the south coast, making sketches to sell to magazines. </p> <p>Worsley's naval experiences began in 1939, with a three-week crash course in seamanship. His ability to accurately report through his work helped him to become the youngest official war artist in the Mediterranean. He had already survived the sinking of HMS Laurentic, by a German U-boat in 1940, and now found himself taking part in the landings at Sicily, Reggio and Salermo. </p> <p>In 1943, he was among the rescue party sent to establish a base on Lussin Piccola, in the north Adriatic, only to find it overrun by Germans. Worsley was taken to Germany for interrogation, and spent almost two months in solitary confinement before being sent to Marlag O. It was there that he met the journalist Guy Morgan, who was about to be repatriated with serious war wounds, and who smuggled out a number of Worsley's drawings in the plaster cast on his arm. Then came the Albert RN escapade. </p> <p>As allied troops advanced in early 1945, Worsley and other PoWs were forced to march the 80 miles to L\u00fcbeck, arriving a few days before the war ended. Returning to Britain, he settled in a small studio in Barons Court, west London. He was asked by the Admiralty to paint portraits of high ranking officers, and found illustration work on the Eagle soon after its launch, painting a full-page advertising/ adventure strip for Walls ice cream, starring Tommy Walls, a lad whose heroics were always accomplished by the Lucky Walls Sign, and whose reward was, inevitably, lashings of ice cream. PC49 followed. </p> <p>In later years, Worsley produced for Esso a series of paintings showing life on oilfields in Iraq and America. He made hundreds of colour illustrations for television readings of children's stories; many of them later found their way into books. Even in his late 70s, he could still be found busy, always working on a marine painting, sculpture or glass engraving. </p> <p> H e was a gracious guest of honour at dinners organised by PC49 fans, and impressed a new generation with his collection of wartime sketches, John Worsley's War. Many of his paintings and portraits - including those of Montgomery and Admiral Sir John Cunningham - can be seen at the Imperial War Museum and the National Maritime Museum. He also worked as a police sketch artist, his facility for capturing a likeness being responsible for many arrests. </p> <p>A recent article about his work by one of his enthusiasts was entitled The Complete Artist; nobody earned that title more than John Worsley. </p> <p> John Godfrey Bernard Worsley, artist, born February 16 1919; died October 3 2000</p>",
  "Japanese detectives investigating the disappearance of the Tokyo nightclub hostess Lucie Blackman arrested an Osaka estate agent yesterday and searched his properties. <p>Joji Ohara, 48, who reportedly has a penchant for expensive cars and foreign women, was apprehended at a flat in Akasaka, central Tokyo.</p> <p>He is believed to have been a customer at the Casablanca hostess bar, where Ms Blackman, a former British Airways stewardess, was working until she went missing on July 1.</p> <p>Detectives have yet to make a statement, but Japanese media reports said a call made by Ms Blackman on the day she disappeared had been traced to Mr Ohara's mobile phone. The 22-year-old from Sevenoaks, Kent, had called a friend to say a customer was taking her to the seaside.</p> <p>Mr Ohara has been detained on suspicion of indecently assaulting a Canadian hostess between three and four years ago. He allegedly took the woman to a property in Zushi, in Kanagawa Prefecture, and then molested her after getting her drunk.</p> <p>Police believe there may be similarities between the two cases. By investigating the earlier alleged assault, they can hold Mr Ohara for four weeks, while they try to gather evidence on his suspected links with Ms Blackman.</p> <p>Detectives raided about 20 locations nationwide linked to Mr Ohara, who has denied the charges against him. At Mr Ohara's home in an upmarket residential area of Denenchofu, south-western Tokyo, police combed the building and began digging up the garden, which is surrounded by high walls and guarded with security cameras.</p> <p>\"I can't believe he would be involved in something like this,\" said a neighbour, who has known Mr Ohara for 30 years. \"He was always very polite - a regular Japanese businessman.\" Other neighbours, however, said the suspect was a mysterious figure who had not been seen at the property for several months.</p> <p>Mr Ohara is the son of a wealthy Osaka family. He is a law graduate of the elite Keio University and spent three years studying in the United States. His business and private lives, however, are a con fusion of false names and dummy addresses.</p> <p>According to Japanese media reports, Mr Ohara was a regular visitor to foreign hostess bars in Roppongi - which include the Casablanca - where he would run up large tabs under false names.</p> <p>The owner of one bar, interviewed by TV Asahi, said: \"He was a quiet type who never joined in with karaoke or dancing. He was a bit odd.\"</p> <p>At the Casablanca, which has changed its name to the Green Grass, an employee denied that anyone called Ohara had ever been a customer.</p> <p>Mr Ohara is registered as the president of Plant, an estate agency in Akasaka, Tokyo, but he is also the company's sole employee and his \"office\" is a flat in a housing complex.</p> <p>His businesses appear to have been running into problems. Property records show that Fuji Bank was in the process of repossessing part of Mr Ohara's property in Denenchofu in June.</p> <p>His arrest is the clearest sign of a breakthrough in the three-month investigation, which has until now been focused on the possibility that Ms Blackman may have been abducted by sado-masochists. One suspect interviewed by police later hanged himself in a room full of fetish videos.</p> <p>Ms Blackman's mother Jane said she was relieved that police appear to be making progress. \"I feel a mixture of cautious optimism and terrible fear,\" she said yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>The relaunch of the Burberry label is fast becoming a textbook lesson in how to ramp a brand. </p> <p>Three years ago, Burberry meant just one thing: outdated raincoats with dull plaid linings that were a firm favourite with middle class Home Counties ladies and middle-aged City gents.</p> <p>Now that plaid is the hottest of high fashion, adorning everything from spike-heeled boots to bandanas, and a must-have in the wardrobes of rock stars and royalty. Kate Moss, Meg Matthews, Nicole Appleton and even Prince William are all big fans of the Burberry beige.</p> <p>The label is part of the Great Universal Stores catalogue empire and the jewel in its crown. In a trading update yesterday, GUS reported Burberry sales up 38%.</p> <p>A large store has just opened in New Bond Street, London, another will open in Tokyo's Ginza in December and the label's New York store is doubling its floorspace.</p> <p>\"It is absolutely storming\", said GUS finance director David Tyler. The Burberry brand was always big in Japan, but now, he said, that success is being repeated in other Asian markets, the US and Europe.</p> <p>When former GUS chief Lord Wolfson hired Saks Fifth Avenue president Rose-Marie Bravo to revive Burberry in 1997, he suggested the business had no long-term future inside GUS but it needed fattening up before it could be sold. Now it would be attractive to luxury brand groups such as LVMH and Gucci. Mr Tyler said: \"I can't deny people ring us up\". But he insisted there were no plans to cash in on its success.</p> <p>In the rest of the GUS business - which is focused firmly on the opposite end of the social scale to Burberry - the Argos catalogue shops posted an 11% like-for-like sales increase. The best performers were furniture and mobile phones, and GUS said the new Additions clothing catalogue was also performing well.</p> <p>But the traditional home shopping catalogues are still having a tough time. Sales dipped 5% in the first half after a 7% slide last year. Mr Tyler said GUS recognised it was in long term decline -\"you can't push water uphill\" - and that the Argos Additions catalogue, which uses the same stock as the home shopping catalogues, was \"an important part of the way forward\".</p> <p>When GUS bought Argos after a bitter takeover battle, many analysts criticised the group for overpaying, but Mr Tyler said the Argos sales figures now proved his firm had been right: \"Where would GUS be today without Argos?\"</p> <p>The group's Experian credit information business reported sales up 4%.</p> <p>The shares, which fell from 850p to 330p last year, closed down 1.5p at 454.5p. Analysts are split on the outlook, with ABN Amro and Williams de Broe rating the shares a buy while SG Warburg repeated its \"underperform\" view.</p> <p>\u0095LVMH yesterday said sales of its portfolio of top labels, which range from TAG Heuer to Dom Perignon and Hard Candy, climbed 35% to \u20ac2.9bn (\u00a31.7bn) in the third quarter of this year. September sales hit an all-time record.</p> <p>Fashion and leather goods sales increased 46% to \u20ac812m, with the highlight being Louis Vuitton. LVMH said Celine, Loewe, Kenzo and Givenchy also performed well and Fendi had been \"excellent\".</p> <p>But champagne was still hung over from the pre-millennium buying spree.</p>",
  "A parliamentary inquiry in France has criticised Britain's role in a US-run global electronic surveillance system it calls \"a real threat to public and individual liberties\". <p>America and Britain set up Echelon in the cold war to intercept military communications in the eastern bloc. But Arthur Paecht, the inquiry's chairman, said the system was now routinely used to intercept economic and industrial information, including messages between firms in EU member states, and between private individuals that are supposedly protected in law. </p> <p>\"Echelon's mission is to monitor every message in the world,\" Mr Paecht said. \"It is not improbable that the information collected is used for political and economic ends, even against certain Nato members.\"</p>"
